like they'll have like a few planners

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.189 
like they'll have like a few planners
every<00:00:16.379> once<00:00:16.529> awhile<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:16.949> nothing<00:00:17.460> big<00:00:21.199> yeah

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
whatever you get the drift they are

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
high-quality trucks base plate is gray

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.620 
high-quality trucks base plate is gray
and<00:00:34.100> then<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> hangers<00:00:35.550> are<00:00:35.790> bright<00:00:36.090> silver

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and then the hangers are bright silver

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.430 
and then the hangers are bright silver
and<00:00:37.309> then<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:40.140> where<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and then right here right where the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.920 
and then right here right where the
backs<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> bearing<00:00:41.820> wheels<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.270> g6<00:00:42.510> flat

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
backs of the bearing wheels like g6 flat

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.310 
backs of the bearing wheels like g6 flat
face<00:00:43.140> wheels<00:00:43.500> hit<00:00:44.180> its<00:00:45.180> rounded<00:00:45.690> really

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
face wheels hit its rounded really

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
face wheels hit its rounded really
really<00:00:46.649> small<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.280> touching<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
really small like that's touching the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.750 
really small like that's touching the
lens<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.480> bearing<00:00:51.480> wheels<00:00:52.760> could

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
lens so that bearing wheels could

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.389 
lens so that bearing wheels could
probably<00:00:54.300> last<00:00:55.020> forever<00:00:55.320> no<00:00:55.770> guarantees<00:00:56.250> but

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
probably last forever no guarantees but

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:11.790 
probably last forever no guarantees but
probably<00:01:00.260> liked<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.620> look

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.590 

all<00:01:12.800> right<00:01:13.040> look<00:01:13.400> like<00:01:13.880> these<00:01:14.300> are<00:01:14.450> no

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
all right look like these are no

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.850 
all right look like these are no
complies<00:01:15.280> on<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.729> backs<00:01:16.940> are<00:01:17.150> really<00:01:17.450> skinny

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
complies on the backs are really skinny

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.460 
complies on the backs are really skinny
compared<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:18.920> flat<00:01:19.070> plate<00:01:19.250> hose<00:01:19.520> but<00:01:19.729> whatever

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
compared to flat plate hose but whatever

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.270 
compared to flat plate hose but whatever
they<00:01:21.470> have<00:01:21.590> still<00:01:21.860> work<00:01:22.040> see<00:01:23.320> they<00:01:24.320> are<00:01:24.350> sanded

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
they have still work see they are sanded

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.570 
they have still work see they are sanded
really<00:01:26.150> good<00:01:26.530> see<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:27.710> black<00:01:28.100> that's<00:01:28.400> from

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
really good see that black that's from

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.359 
really good see that black that's from
washers<00:01:29.380> don't<00:01:30.380> mind<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.860> could<00:01:31.040> like<00:01:31.190> rub

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
washers don't mind that I could like rub

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.890 
washers don't mind that I could like rub
that<00:01:31.520> off<00:01:31.670> right<00:01:31.790> now<00:01:32.030> nothing<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.750> could

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
that off right now nothing that could

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.740 
that off right now nothing that could
happen<00:01:36.670> yeah<00:01:38.080> guess<00:01:39.080> I<00:01:39.200> got<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:40.539> just<00:01:41.539> place

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
happen yeah guess I got it just place

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.100 
happen yeah guess I got it just place
that<00:01:41.780> there<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.759> if<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.970> can<00:01:44.119> tell<00:01:46.990> it's<00:01:47.990> not

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
that there and if you can tell it's not

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.270 
that there and if you can tell it's not
touching<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.830> it's<00:01:49.820> touching<00:01:50.210> metal<00:01:50.539> on<00:01:50.750> metal

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
touching it it's touching metal on metal

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.830 
touching it it's touching metal on metal
so<00:01:52.280> they<00:01:52.970> would<00:01:53.119> probably<00:01:53.330> last<00:01:53.600> forever

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
so they would probably last forever

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.950 
so they would probably last forever
without<00:01:54.110> washers<00:01:58.270> really<00:01:59.270> nice<00:01:59.420> quality

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
without washers really nice quality

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.859 
without washers really nice quality
trucks<00:02:00.259> all<00:02:01.179> right<00:02:02.179> there's<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.479> little<00:02:02.630> bit

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
trucks all right there's a little bit

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.359 
trucks all right there's a little bit
sanded<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.560> little<00:02:03.770> bit<00:02:03.860> skinnier

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
sanded so that a little bit skinnier

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.699 
sanded so that a little bit skinnier
lighter<00:02:05.140> um<00:02:06.140> yeah<00:02:06.910> all<00:02:07.910> right<00:02:08.060> let<00:02:09.050> me<00:02:09.080> put

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
lighter um yeah all right let me put

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.890 
lighter um yeah all right let me put
this<00:02:09.800> back<00:02:09.920> on<00:02:10.220> real<00:02:10.429> fast<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.970> don't<00:02:11.630> talk<00:02:11.870> a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
this back on real fast I don't talk a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.819 
this back on real fast I don't talk a
little<00:02:12.080> bit<00:02:12.260> about<00:02:14.829> all<00:02:15.829> right<00:02:16.070> they<00:02:16.370> are

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
little bit about all right they are

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:24.729 
little bit about all right they are
going<00:02:18.829> to<00:02:18.980> come<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:21.220> what's<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.340> called<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:23.739> bag

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
going to come in what's it called a bag

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.590 
going to come in what's it called a bag
like<00:02:26.380> wut<00:02:27.380> rip<00:02:27.560> would<00:02:27.799> come<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.130> maybe

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
like wut rip would come in maybe

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.819 
like wut rip would come in maybe
probably<00:02:29.600> smaller<00:02:29.989> like<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:33.769> will

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
probably smaller like this and it will

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:40.720 
probably smaller like this and it will
he'll<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.370> legit<00:02:35.950> seal<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.730> soon

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
he'll like a legit seal on it and soon

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.650 
he'll like a legit seal on it and soon
we'll<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:41.180> stickers<00:02:42.670> but<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:44.000> currently<00:02:44.510> we

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
we'll have stickers but not currently we

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.569 
we'll have stickers but not currently we
do<00:02:44.780> because<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.620> really<00:02:46.549> can<00:02:47.030> make<00:02:47.060> them<00:02:47.329> yet

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
do because I really can make them yet

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.630 
do because I really can make them yet
all<00:02:49.579> right<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.090> you'll<00:02:50.780> also<00:02:50.989> get<00:02:51.459> you'll<00:02:52.459> get

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
all right and you'll also get you'll get

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.600 
all right and you'll also get you'll get
nuts<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.630> they<00:02:53.810> get<00:02:56.170> bushings<00:02:57.170> just<00:02:57.709> tech

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
nuts and they get bushings just tech

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.460 
nuts and they get bushings just tech
bushings<00:02:59.150> cuz<00:02:59.980> yeah<00:03:00.980> all<00:03:01.820> right<00:03:02.000> um

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.360 

will<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.580> regular<00:03:07.330> trucks<00:03:07.630> which<00:03:07.990> are

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
will you have regular trucks which are

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.120 
will you have regular trucks which are
cheaper<00:03:09.450> there<00:03:10.450> for<00:03:10.750> 50<00:03:11.230> because<00:03:11.710> they<00:03:11.890> take

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
cheaper there for 50 because they take

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.270 
cheaper there for 50 because they take
maybe<00:03:12.760> four<00:03:13.090> hours<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.510> make<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.660> pair<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.280> it

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
maybe four hours to make a pair and it

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.400 
maybe four hours to make a pair and it
hurts<00:03:15.490> so<00:03:16.590> four<00:03:17.590> hours<00:03:18.040> probably<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:19.410> you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
hurts so four hours probably and you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.910 
hurts so four hours probably and you
don't<00:03:20.500> while<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.980> like<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:21.310> 554<00:03:22.300> wide<00:03:22.920> they're

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
don't while it like in 554 wide they're
