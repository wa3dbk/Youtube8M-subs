it work I think the whole idea of having

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.020 
it work I think the whole idea of having
a<00:03:12.630> shop<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.260> any<00:03:13.590> kind<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.520> could<00:03:14.820> be

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
a shop of any kind that that could be

a shop of any kind that that could be
online<00:03:15.240> is<00:03:15.840> becoming<00:03:16.680> clearly<00:03:17.130> not<00:03:17.520> viable<00:03:17.790> I

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
online is becoming clearly not viable I

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.580 
online is becoming clearly not viable I
mean<00:03:18.210> it's<00:03:18.300> it's<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.110> matter<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.350> time

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
mean it's it's just a matter of time

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.900 
mean it's it's just a matter of time
really<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:19.950> mean<00:03:20.070> if<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.220> could<00:03:20.430> buy<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.700> online

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910
