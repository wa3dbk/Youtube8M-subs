00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.590
 hello today we are going to make a little bone or a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.540
 wallet I do not know how to call it exactly 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.250
 diaper holder so you do not have to be 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.769
 putting the o in any way the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.480
 handbag 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.940
 with plastic bags 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.890
 and I will accompany it with size 5 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.440
 because if you do it with a handkerchief 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.400
 tiny of the newborn or about 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.960
 fast little mesecitos then good 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.579
 I tell you more or less is to cut the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.909
 eva rubber 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.610
 the size is 37 and a half more or less by 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:44.930
 the 23 38 centimeters 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.800
 for 36 that you want and for 36 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 28 by 36 let's put tomorrow here in 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.620
 medium 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.680
 and let's say the little bag is going to be something like that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.809
 for closures you can put velcro 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.170
 botoncitos texts feet or to 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.110
 each one what you like 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.320
 well let's go until it goes well 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.979
 and one with hot glue 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.549
 heat sealer 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.549
 let's point out 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.220
 from where will the flap be 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.410
 to throw the hot glue 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.410
 the rest 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.880
 and s 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.560
 we have a little tension is 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.540
 warm the other two 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.540
 to make it right 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 gratuitous 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.690
 and not 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.890
 if you want to ensure a little more 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.130
 you can give some stitches quietly 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 so with a fine wool of colors 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.790
 decorate 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.450
 good I'm going to close the bag exports 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.050

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.590
 with little buttons of these is what 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.590
 they are called 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.359
 we are learning here 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.230
 from down here 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.640
 whoever does not have it does not pass anything 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.810
 you can put velcro 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.690
 adhesive or something similar 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.599
 the gangs the meals little money the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.890
 true many until the Chinese is that the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.110
 they have 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.110
 so 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.680
 and if you cheer for ebay mine mine the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.680

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.670
 Thank you 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.860
 so that they remain marked us 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.500
 we tighten so they stay on the side of the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.880
 shape remain marked 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.880

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.530
