00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.849
 and if you do not even make the flowers in the video 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.039
 previous 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.529
 click here to see how they 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.529
 the stars were ready 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 now I'll put the path of the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.630
 leaves the leaves were made with the cdu 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 in almada with gelatin 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:36.210
 I used the wire wrapped in a wire 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:43.550
 thin jacketed cheat sheet and in caring for 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.550
 we put the silicone glue 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 have liquid cold silicone 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.580
 I invite bigger that I put in this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.510
 design it always be new but if the 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.470
 starting to thicken is difficult to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.019
 leave 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.339
 just put a penguin of something that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.339
 she gives under easy 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.049
 provider does ensure that you do not have 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.290
 to stay just waiting to be on hand 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.040
 then I work the arrangement I go 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.670
 do 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.690
 has two opaque fabric flowers two 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.280
 buttons sheets of opaque fabric and sheets 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.280
 fabric that gives lightness 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.979
 so I made a button here that will stay 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 together 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.450
 and I'll do the other to make this stone 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.300
 great so brand 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.240
 I cut it made a 9 by 9 comic 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.409
 I separated the petals and I counted it here 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:59.720
 I went on fire nor furlan he said now 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:02.659
 I'll change the second button 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 leg volume not much because I 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.850
 I want a more open button like this 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.440
 here so only the first stone turned 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.100
 inside the others today I go 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.100
 put on 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.370
 three centuries jaffÃ© 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.790
 4 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.629
 This one already has six pieces, that's okay. 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.060
 now I'm going to do some leaves with this 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.629
 same fabric that is organized and 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.629
 curtain 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.510
 Claudia does not have anything 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.970
 make four cones 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.970
 I'll spend a little bit because I do not 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.180
 I want her to stay all all marked 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.580
 of fire is just to announce to the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.580
 finish is a little bit 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.530
 the transparent fabric is good to pass the 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:33.889
 finger to glue do not go the other way 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:36.080
 can not have too much lap time worth it 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.900
 I lay down for myself how this law 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.750
 in a class that has a logical hundred 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.560
 to facilitate if you want to change places 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.289
 if you want to make a move there nothing 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.300
 then it gets easier if I do not 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:55.539
 put this here the penalty does not have this 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:05:00.020
 mobility and this one is just simple 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:03.129
 passing glue and put here and is a 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:07.280
 Sewing collection now I'm going to fulfill 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:11.710
 I used the waxed wire that one praying 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:18.879
 We snake in a food store. 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.879
 jacob so from crucible school 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.729
 the silk line silk mood line 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.580
 frayed 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.270
 I'm going to use only two mirrors. 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.190
 she has three children I will only use two 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.190
 to be fine, fine 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.870
 zk which way the fields I'll put 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.240
 three threads because here a new extension 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.270
 aroma is thicker 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:43.680
 I can already have three children who do not 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:46.560
 will stay some flowers are legs but 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.790
 I'm putting the white line 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.790
 This is not going to be a problem. 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:06.340
 I was not all because I cut it will be 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.340
 I will not need it all. 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.630
 now I'll start showing the arrangement 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.110
 the arrangement will look like this after 

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.780
 Ready, I'll show you how. 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.770
