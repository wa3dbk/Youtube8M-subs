00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Let's start with good hair sitting too 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.799
 So we can start in a new one 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
 episode of bramberg tv and the launches 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.150
 very nice with the celebrity big brother 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.870
 chaos in the celebrity big brother house namely 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.640
 on the one hand with Paul and elan at the is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.859
 quite nice there is a cuddly one there 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 smooch photos and the candidates ask 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.529
 she too, what's up there? 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.180
 they would fit together the one 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.320
 was a bachelor the other was a bachelor 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.810
 no data 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.669
 but he himself says he has none 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 Ambitions as far as this thing is concerned 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 believe it a general and silent 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.480
 about it if the couple already yes 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.800
 but somehow already 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.539
 not good but we will see what 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.129
 after that happens in any case like 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.840
 it could be good for someone else 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.210
 Candidate of this house is now 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.579
 unfortunately mega congestion namely for the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 mario-max of schaumburg-lip had the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.579
 a girlfriend when he moved into the house 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.320
 is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.760
 now he will be back soon and has 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.739
 no more than your friend circuit 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.810
 and just not 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.150
 Said I do not know yes can says so 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 embarrassing and the mother in law is 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.820
 shit and yes the new freedom like whole 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.409
 great but not if we do not 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 can say personally and that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.369
 it's unfair me it's unfair 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 faith work is said in the house if 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 then five cameras on him as well 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 be directed 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.240
 which is even nastier and flies 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.900
 somehow the predicate please 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:36.420
 Action we come to stars the bad 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.630
 They smell exactly whether they are personal 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.549
 legal I do not know but the fans 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 are no longer so on their smell 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.740
 on her perfumes namely Justin Bieber 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.040
 and Taylor swift her perfumes gm go 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.070
 go to their features go sales figures 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.110
 Down 30 percent in the last quarter 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.920
 less sold 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.750
 supposedly has on the one hand 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.969
 economic reasons have it said 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.090
 yes always to another but can also 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.119
 the escapades and the behavior of the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.479
 Both stars are the reason for his yes that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.369
 definitely say insider 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.989
 but in the end, of course, it can not 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.840
 say exactly what the reason is 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.220
 Nevertheless, I think they can 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.239
 cope with 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.530
 The reason is the 50 I know I have 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.060
 they both did not break i have that 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.470
 yes by justin bieber at home 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.480
 somehow you my time 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.489
 presented as a present for the birthday as 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.489
 nice detail flows for free 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.310
 but I could not go on a gala 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.629
 Go next, then I'll jump that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.310
 We can try money or yes 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.959
 Notice how it smelled and on 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.629
 all ran away from me or if 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.590
 all have come to you 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.359
 Now we have a really cool action 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.250
 for you that rewe like ip 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.349
 internship there you can on the one hand 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.629
 win placebo for the internship and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.120
 on the other a meet greet with daniele 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.650
 or malcolm and an ipad mini and you 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.970
 can even use your bff or your 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.680
 join in the best buddy 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.799
 together then could behind the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.019
 backdrops of the rewe to go in cologne or the 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.359
 Green buildings in Berlin look what 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.950
 is very exciting in any case 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.400
 There is a lot to experience on this day 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.720
 and how you can participate you will find out 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.840
 right here under this link if you are 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.440
 now that it's just a shot 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.440
 the 29th 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.790
 and yes, I pressed my thumb firmly 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.730
 maybe that will be with me and that 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.810
 Audience was a cool thing 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.040
 cool experience can be said in the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.810
 Last year it was already pretty mega 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.880
 success and will it be determined this year 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.310
 again, right now we are coming to 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.099
 the top djs of the whole world the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.950
 highest paid djs in the world became now 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.709
 cooled and place one takes over kevin 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.970
 bright is with 60 million dollars in the 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.769
 he has been washing for the last year 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.269
 indians before the best merits so 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.350
 I think that's right now 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.360
 a lot of coal 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.010
 century he is really good too 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.910
 So it's not just blatant 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.250
 really good chance 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.440
 I understand that with a person 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.480
 if I'm a bit dubious 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.480
 why they are so successful now 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.570
 So nothing against the now 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.940
 maybe very nice and so for 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.300
 I'm not that over dj right now 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.410
 she got on it estimated 290,000 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.720
 per hour 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.430
 you have to imagine that and you 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.290
 is really in the box clubs in Ibiza 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.530
 In Amnesia it is one of the most prestigious 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.150
 clubs probably last beaver celebrated and 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.300
 all sorts and then he puts the 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.950
 But he leads now to say parasites 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.110
 people who are familiar with it 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.840
 she does not do that herself and that is 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.240
 is that there while doing so but it will 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.070
 everything mixed up for her but me 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.260
 yes, even if you're on a poster 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.610
 Do you see Carsten today ? 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.070
 Everybody wants to line me, I want to 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.560
 just to look like you do 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.240
 Similar looks like that is actually 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.970
 no matter what the men also equal to the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.180
 even if you so the smurfs cd 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.700
 Of course that's a different one 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.120
 Free what a cool wash is 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.910
 our German boy zdf also among the 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.350
 top ten is meanwhile also with many 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.630
 songs in the charts for example too 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:22.450
 break free also mega especially in 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.450
 America I think I have many too 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.880
 extras has it actually large 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.310
 made but it is your last 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.560
 time so a little under the radar 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.390
 like certain dubstep stops 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.930
 not so hot it was new 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.100
 but I was still going so now 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.130
 Finally, have a cool one 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.500
 remix for you namely the obama that 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.880
 problem is more or less it is 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.190
 but a little bit together 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.200
 funny and with that we say goodbye 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.000
 we still look at something and then 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.360
 I'm sure we'll meet again soon 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.360
 exactly 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.050
 what was high
