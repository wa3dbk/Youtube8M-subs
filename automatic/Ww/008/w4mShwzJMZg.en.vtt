00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:01.399> hmm<00:00:03.560> please<00:00:04.560> don't<00:00:04.859> poke<00:00:05.040> me<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.190> the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
I think hmm please don't poke me in the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.830 
I think hmm please don't poke me in the
eye<00:00:06.950> that's<00:00:07.950> probably<00:00:08.700> pretty<00:00:09.030> good<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.719> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
eye that's probably pretty good it's a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.749 
eye that's probably pretty good it's a
little<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.860> was<00:00:10.980> pretty<00:00:11.219> quick<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.519> little

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
little that was pretty quick a little

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.669 
little that was pretty quick a little
goofy<00:00:12.269> but<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.809> was<00:00:12.990> maybe<00:00:13.170> two<00:00:13.530> minutes

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
goofy but so that was maybe two minutes

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.099 
goofy but so that was maybe two minutes
to<00:00:14.130> three<00:00:14.549> but<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.210> when<00:00:15.509> you're<00:00:15.630> sitting

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
to three but it's when you're sitting

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.620 
to three but it's when you're sitting
here<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:17.279> low<00:00:17.580> low<00:00:17.820> low<00:00:17.850> along

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
here going low low low along

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.590 
here going low low low along
it<00:00:18.750> feels<00:00:19.260> longer<00:00:19.880> now<00:00:20.880> if<00:00:21.119> you're<00:00:21.270> doing<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
it feels longer now if you're doing a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900 
it feels longer now if you're doing a
bigger<00:00:21.840> area<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.710> probably<00:00:23.130> takes<00:00:23.369> longer<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
bigger area it probably takes longer to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.390 
bigger area it probably takes longer to
dry<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:25.019> depends<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.529> how<00:00:25.590> goopy<00:00:26.250> you've

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
dry and it depends on how goopy you've

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.710 
dry and it depends on how goopy you've
put<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.510> heavy

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
put it on like if it's a heavy

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.990 
put it on like if it's a heavy
prosthetic<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.039> might<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.340> tempted<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.760> put

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
prosthetic you might be tempted to put

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.720 
prosthetic you might be tempted to put
it<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.269> thicker<00:00:30.840> don't<00:00:31.740> keep<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> pretty

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it on thicker don't keep it a pretty

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.660 
it on thicker don't keep it a pretty
thin<00:00:33.120> coat<00:00:33.450> um<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:34.860> you'll<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.489> more

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
thin coat um but you'll have to do more

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.950 
thin coat um but you'll have to do more
places<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:36.480> you've<00:00:36.600> got<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.840> wait<00:00:36.930> for

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
places and then you've got to wait for

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.430 
places and then you've got to wait for
all<00:00:37.200> those<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.829> dry<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.460> now<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.960> put<00:00:40.200> can

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
all those to dry so now can you put can

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.990 
all those to dry so now can you put can
you<00:00:40.530> apply<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.160> layers<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you apply this in layers like if you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.610 
you apply this in layers like if you
don't<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:42.930> quite<00:00:43.290> thick

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
don't think that that's quite thick

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
don't think that that's quite thick
enough<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.160> add<00:00:44.309> another<00:00:44.579> layer<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.390> can

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
enough can you add another layer you can

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
enough can you add another layer you can
okay<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> suppose<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> layer<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.059> there

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
okay well I suppose the layer on there

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.299 
okay well I suppose the layer on there
bonds<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> layer<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.260> anyway<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.070> okay

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
bonds to layer on here anyway so okay

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.410 
bonds to layer on here anyway so okay
are<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.210> putting<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.629> yeah<00:00:51.870> oh<00:00:52.050> okay<00:00:53.420> I'm
