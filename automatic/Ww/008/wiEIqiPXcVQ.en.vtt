00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.899 

so<00:00:01.469> welcome<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.829> part<00:00:01.979> three<00:00:02.490> of<00:00:02.520> the

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
so welcome to part three of the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.970 
so welcome to part three of the
sculpting<00:00:03.330> series<00:00:03.689> in<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.560> first<00:00:04.799> two

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
sculpting series in the first two

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.920 
sculpting series in the first two
tutorials<00:00:05.310> we<00:00:05.790> basically<00:00:06.120> went<00:00:06.420> over<00:00:06.720> some

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
tutorials we basically went over some

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.530 
tutorials we basically went over some
sculpting<00:00:07.230> theory<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:09.000> created<00:00:09.300> this

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
sculpting theory and we created this

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.280 
sculpting theory and we created this
base<00:00:09.780> mesh<00:00:10.639> so<00:00:11.639> in<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:11.880> tutorial<00:00:12.080> I'm<00:00:13.080> gonna

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
base mesh so in this tutorial I'm gonna

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.240 
base mesh so in this tutorial I'm gonna
start<00:00:13.559> sculpting<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.190> these<00:00:14.340> brushes<00:00:16.250> so

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
start sculpting with these brushes so

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.320 
start sculpting with these brushes so
what<00:00:17.400> I'm<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.940> I'm<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.090> gonna

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.769 
what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna
go<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> sculpt<00:00:19.350> subdivide<00:00:19.800> my<00:00:19.980> mesh<00:00:20.189> again

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
go to sculpt subdivide my mesh again

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.099 
go to sculpt subdivide my mesh again
creates<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> sculpting<00:00:22.289> tag<00:00:23.810> you<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:24.840> add<00:00:25.080> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
creates the sculpting tag you can add a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.529 
creates the sculpting tag you can add a
few<00:00:25.380> more<00:00:25.439> levels<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> subdivision<00:00:26.939> like<00:00:27.330> this

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
few more levels of subdivision like this

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:37.280 
few more levels of subdivision like this
I<00:00:28.939> think<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.029> five<00:00:30.240> should<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.099> right<00:00:36.290> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I think of five should do it right so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.959 
I think of five should do it right so
the<00:00:37.380> most<00:00:37.530> commonly<00:00:37.980> used<00:00:38.100> brush<00:00:38.670> in

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the most commonly used brush in

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.000 
the most commonly used brush in
sculpting<00:00:39.390> will<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.170> brush<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.770> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
sculpting will be this brush here is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
sculpting will be this brush here is
called<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.399> pool<00:00:41.610> brush<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.390> I'm<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:42.989> going

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
called a pool brush and I'm just going

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.510 
called a pool brush and I'm just going
to<00:00:43.260> run<00:00:43.379> through<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.980> settings<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to run through some of the settings in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.150 
to run through some of the settings in
this<00:00:44.640> brush<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> firstly<00:00:46.469> we've<00:00:46.860> got<00:00:47.039> these

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this brush so firstly we've got these

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400 
this brush so firstly we've got these
three<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:47.910> important<00:00:48.420> settings<00:00:48.780> link<00:00:49.140> size

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
three very important settings link size

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.220 
three very important settings link size
pressure<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.250> symmetry<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:52.050> these

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
pressure and symmetry up here now these

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.889 
pressure and symmetry up here now these
are<00:00:52.379> important<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.000> check<00:00:54.270> link

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
are important because if you check link

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.709 
are important because if you check link
size<00:00:55.160> basically<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.789> brushes<00:00:57.090> are

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
size basically all these brushes are

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.510 
size basically all these brushes are
gonna<00:00:58.140> take<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> settings<00:00:58.920> from<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.280> brush

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
gonna take the settings from this brush

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
gonna take the settings from this brush
this<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.329> very<00:01:00.510> useful<00:01:00.930> especially<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.680> you're

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this is very useful especially if you're

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
this is very useful especially if you're
dealing<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.190> symmetry<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.969> don't<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.600> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
dealing with symmetry you don't want to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420 
dealing with symmetry you don't want to
keep<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.080> into<00:01:04.229> every<00:01:04.470> single<00:01:04.799> brush<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
keep going into every single brush and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
keep going into every single brush and
turning<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.820> symmetry<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.630> want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> do

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
turning on symmetry you just want to do

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.090 
turning on symmetry you just want to do
it<00:01:07.350> once<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.890> just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it once and then that's it so I'm just

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.210 
it once and then that's it so I'm just
gonna<00:01:11.189> link<00:01:11.549> symmetry<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:13.040> even<00:01:14.040> link

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
gonna link symmetry and even link

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.240 
gonna link symmetry and even link
pressure<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:14.850> fine<00:01:15.740> now<00:01:16.740> when<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> come

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
pressure that's fine now when I come

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
pressure that's fine now when I come
over<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.729> object<00:01:18.210> you'll<00:01:18.390> notice<00:01:18.810> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
over to this object you'll notice this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.910 
over to this object you'll notice this
orange<00:01:19.979> circle<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.409> basically<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
orange circle and this is basically the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.749 
orange circle and this is basically the
brush<00:01:23.220> size<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.890> if<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.130> look<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> middle

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
brush size and if you look in the middle

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.730 
brush size and if you look in the middle
you'll<00:01:27.119> see<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.420> curve<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> actually

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you'll see a curve and that is actually

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.429 
you'll see a curve and that is actually
the<00:01:28.920> fall-off<00:01:29.400> curve<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.229> basically

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the fall-off curve so that is basically

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.640 
the fall-off curve so that is basically
this<00:01:31.890> curve<00:01:32.280> continued<00:01:33.290> inside<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
this curve continued inside of the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.609 
this curve continued inside of the
orange<00:01:35.130> icon<00:01:35.310> which<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> pretty<00:01:36.119> clever<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.409> if

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
orange icon which is pretty clever so if

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.600 
orange icon which is pretty clever so if
I<00:01:37.770> adjust<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.189> fall-off<00:01:40.009> that<00:01:41.009> you'll

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I adjust this fall-off that you'll

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.139 
I adjust this fall-off that you'll
notice<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.090> orange<00:01:42.420> curve<00:01:42.689> changes<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.530> well

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
notice that orange curve changes as well

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.149 
notice that orange curve changes as well
I'm<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.450> reset<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.979> back<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I'm just gonna reset that go back to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.530 
I'm just gonna reset that go back to
settings<00:01:48.649> now<00:01:49.820> making<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.970> brush<00:01:51.180> stroke<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
settings now making a brush stroke is

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
settings now making a brush stroke is
very<00:01:51.899> simple<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.710> simply<00:01:52.979> click<00:01:53.220> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
very simple you just simply click and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.469 
very simple you just simply click and
drag<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:55.530> basically<00:01:55.920> pulls<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
drag and that basically pulls out the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.060 
drag and that basically pulls out the
geometry<00:02:00.049> if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> push<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
geometry if you want to push the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.719 
geometry if you want to push the
geometry<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.509> hold<00:02:03.750> down<00:02:03.810> control<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.729> now

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
geometry just hold down control and now

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.540 
geometry just hold down control and now
we're<00:02:05.880> basically<00:02:06.710> indenting<00:02:07.710> or<00:02:07.860> pushing

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
we're basically indenting or pushing

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.050 
we're basically indenting or pushing
and<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.530> middle<00:02:11.800> mouse<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.370> very<00:02:12.670> useful

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and the the middle mouse is very useful

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.820 
and the the middle mouse is very useful
as<00:02:13.180> well<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.110> click<00:02:14.290> middle<00:02:14.620> mouse

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
as well so if I just click middle mouse

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.420 
as well so if I just click middle mouse
and<00:02:15.220> drag<00:02:15.670> sideways<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.770> does<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.190> brush

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
and drag sideways that does the brush

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.900 
and drag sideways that does the brush
size<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.020> if<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.070> move<00:02:21.310> up<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.730> down

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
size like this and if I move up and down

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.990 
size like this and if I move up and down
while<00:02:22.450> holding<00:02:22.870> down<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> middle<00:02:23.500> Mouse<00:02:24.000> that

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
while holding down the middle Mouse that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.420 
while holding down the middle Mouse that
will<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.240> pressure<00:02:25.570> which<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.530> line

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
will do pressure which is that a line

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.740 
will do pressure which is that a line
with<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> circle<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.410> pressure<00:02:30.750> you

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
with the circle so that is pressure you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.240 
with the circle so that is pressure you
can<00:02:31.900> see<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.170> moving<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> right<00:02:32.800> hand<00:02:33.040> side

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
can see it moving on the right hand side

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.090 
can see it moving on the right hand side
there<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.090> hold<00:02:37.240> down<00:02:37.420> shift<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:39.070> can

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
there and if you hold down shift you can

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.630 
there and if you hold down shift you can
actually<00:02:39.400> smooth<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.780> brushstroke<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.520> that

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
actually smooth the brushstroke so that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.670 
actually smooth the brushstroke so that
is<00:02:42.730> quite<00:02:42.940> handy<00:02:43.330> because<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.750> kind<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.020> stops

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
is quite handy because it kind of stops

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.410 
is quite handy because it kind of stops
us<00:02:44.860> from<00:02:45.100> having<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.400> go<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.270> actual

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
us from having to go to the actual

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.120 
us from having to go to the actual
smooth<00:02:46.930> brush<00:02:47.520> which<00:02:48.520> is<00:02:48.550> located<00:02:49.240> here<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
smooth brush which is located here the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.450 
smooth brush which is located here the
iron<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:53.740> just<00:02:53.860> going<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.070> increase<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
iron so I'm just going to increase the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.950 
iron so I'm just going to increase the
pressure

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
pressure

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.070 
pressure
oops<00:02:55.960> that<00:02:56.310> then<00:02:57.310> hold<00:02:57.670> down<00:02:57.730> shift<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.450> smooth

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
oops that then hold down shift to smooth

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.890 
oops that then hold down shift to smooth
these<00:03:00.270> bumps<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.630> see<00:03:01.780> it's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
these bumps and you can see it's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.440 
these bumps and you can see it's
smoothing<00:03:02.320> increase<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.190> pressure<00:03:03.400> here

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.580 

so<00:03:09.050> no<00:03:09.319> need<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> really<00:03:09.950> go<00:03:10.099> over<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.459> smooth

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
so no need to really go over to smooth

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.320 
so no need to really go over to smooth
now<00:03:12.590> as<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.010> mentioned<00:03:13.520> there's<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.849> symmetry

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
now as I mentioned there's a symmetry

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.300 
now as I mentioned there's a symmetry
option<00:03:14.720> which<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:14.930> something<00:03:15.920> you'll<00:03:16.040> want<00:03:16.250> to

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
option which is something you'll want to

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.070 
option which is something you'll want to
set<00:03:16.550> at<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> beginning<00:03:17.270> so<00:03:17.510> you'll<00:03:17.810> want<00:03:18.020> to

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
set at the beginning so you'll want to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.960 
set at the beginning so you'll want to
check<00:03:18.290> link<00:03:18.770> symmetry<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.370> then<00:03:19.520> come<00:03:19.790> here

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
check link symmetry and then come here

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.120 
check link symmetry and then come here
to<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.209> symmetry<00:03:20.599> tab<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.470> you'll<00:03:21.890> want<00:03:22.040> to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
to the symmetry tab and you'll want to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.550 
to the symmetry tab and you'll want to
choose<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.400> symmetry<00:03:22.880> plane<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.540> I'm<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
choose a symmetry plane so I'm just

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
choose a symmetry plane so I'm just
gonna<00:03:24.680> try<00:03:24.980> Y<00:03:25.430> Zed<00:03:25.760> X<00:03:26.060> Y<00:03:26.300> Zed<00:03:26.360> here<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:28.430> is

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
gonna try Y Zed X Y Zed here and that is

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.510 
gonna try Y Zed X Y Zed here and that is
not<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:29.030> symmetry<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.569> need<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:31.340> I'm<00:03:31.430> just

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
not the symmetry I need so I'm just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.660 
not the symmetry I need so I'm just
gonna<00:03:31.610> uncheck<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:34.160> not<00:03:34.340> this<00:03:34.459> one

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
gonna uncheck that it's not this one

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.050 
gonna uncheck that it's not this one
either<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:36.580> this<00:03:37.580> is<00:03:37.760> it

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
either and this is it

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.990 
either and this is it
basically<00:03:38.420> any<00:03:39.220> change<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.430> apply<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> this

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
basically any change I apply to this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.610 
basically any change I apply to this
side<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.420> want<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.780> map<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.140> over<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
side I want it to map it over to the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.960 
side I want it to map it over to the
other<00:03:42.709> side<00:03:43.069> so<00:03:43.850> if<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:45.370> kind<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.459> draw<00:03:46.940> a

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
other side so if I just kind of draw a

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.000 
other side so if I just kind of draw a
brushstroke<00:03:47.510> here<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:50.680> automatically<00:03:51.680> maps

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
brushstroke here it automatically maps

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.100 
brushstroke here it automatically maps
to<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.220> other<00:03:52.340> side<00:03:52.640> and<00:03:52.910> now<00:03:53.060> because<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.450> set

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
to the other side and now because I set

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.170 
to the other side and now because I set
linked<00:03:54.350> symmetry<00:03:54.799> if<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.640> come<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.910> another

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
linked symmetry if I come to another

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.570 
linked symmetry if I come to another
brush<00:03:56.600> say<00:03:56.930> knife<00:03:57.910> that's<00:03:58.910> automatically

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
brush say knife that's automatically

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.009 
brush say knife that's automatically
picking<00:04:01.580> up<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.819> same<00:04:02.030> symmetry<00:04:02.540> options<00:04:02.870> as

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
picking up the same symmetry options as

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.610 
picking up the same symmetry options as
well<00:04:03.170> which<00:04:04.010> is<00:04:04.040> very<00:04:04.160> handy<00:04:05.350> I'm<00:04:06.350> just<00:04:06.530> gonna

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
well which is very handy I'm just gonna

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.970 
well which is very handy I'm just gonna
undo<00:04:06.830> these<00:04:07.100> strokes<00:04:07.420> now<00:04:08.420> lastly<00:04:08.900> if<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.830> just

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
undo these strokes now lastly if I just

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.509 
undo these strokes now lastly if I just
go<00:04:10.100> back<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.489> pool<00:04:11.330> brush<00:04:11.600> in<00:04:12.519> settings

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
go back to the pool brush in settings

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.150 
go back to the pool brush in settings
we've<00:04:13.970> got<00:04:14.120> these<00:04:14.209> FX<00:04:14.660> options<00:04:15.109> and<00:04:15.890> these<00:04:16.039> are

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
we've got these FX options and these are

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.990 
we've got these FX options and these are
actually<00:04:16.459> very<00:04:16.609> cool<00:04:17.890> if<00:04:18.890> I<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.039> choose<00:04:19.430> FX

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
actually very cool if I just choose FX

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.159 
actually very cool if I just choose FX
for<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.269> size<00:04:20.479> brush<00:04:20.780> here<00:04:21.370> we've<00:04:22.370> got<00:04:22.550> this

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
for the size brush here we've got this

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.890 
for the size brush here we've got this
all<00:04:24.169> these<00:04:24.380> kind<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.650> different<00:04:25.010> options<00:04:25.220> and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
all these kind of different options and

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.040 
all these kind of different options and
I'm<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:27.080> gonna<00:04:27.200> choose<00:04:27.410> distance<00:04:27.919> and

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
I'm just gonna choose distance and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.300 
I'm just gonna choose distance and
choose<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.080> curve<00:04:30.380> like<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.800> just<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.190> linear

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
choose a curve like this just a linear

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.020 
choose a curve like this just a linear
curve<00:04:31.700> now<00:04:32.000> if<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.860> get<00:04:33.860> okay<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.580> then<00:04:34.820> draw<00:04:35.000> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
curve now if I get okay and then draw a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.760 
curve now if I get okay and then draw a
brushstroke

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
brushstroke

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.080 
brushstroke
you'll<00:04:36.770> notice<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.430> brushstroke<00:04:37.910> is

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
you'll notice that the brushstroke is

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.080 
you'll notice that the brushstroke is
now<00:04:38.240> tapering<00:04:39.039> it<00:04:40.039> gets<00:04:40.220> smaller<00:04:40.550> depending

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
now tapering it gets smaller depending

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.990 
now tapering it gets smaller depending
on<00:04:41.360> distance

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.730 

can<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:47.720> draw<00:04:47.960> Direction<00:04:48.680> some<00:04:49.430> randomness

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
can you draw Direction some randomness

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.730 
can you draw Direction some randomness
and<00:04:51.740> now<00:04:52.040> we've<00:04:52.220> got<00:04:52.400> these<00:04:53.320> kind<00:04:54.320> of<00:04:54.350> strange

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
and now we've got these kind of strange

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.120 
and now we've got these kind of strange
little<00:04:55.010> effects<00:04:56.290> so<00:04:57.290> I'm<00:04:57.650> not<00:04:57.800> going<00:04:57.920> to<00:04:58.010> go

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
little effects so I'm not going to go

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.190 
little effects so I'm not going to go
through<00:04:58.280> every<00:04:58.550> single<00:04:58.670> FX<00:04:59.120> option<00:04:59.510> but<00:04:59.810> just

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
through every single FX option but just

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.570 
through every single FX option but just
so<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:00.380> know<00:05:00.440> they<00:05:00.770> exist

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.710 

so<00:05:04.580> now<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:04.790> we<00:05:05.000> learnt<00:05:05.180> about<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.450> brush

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
so now that we learnt about the brush

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.300 
so now that we learnt about the brush
basics<00:05:06.170> in<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.410> next<00:05:06.650> lesson<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:07.010> can<00:05:07.040> actually

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
basics in the next lesson I can actually

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.860 
basics in the next lesson I can actually
start<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.420> begin<00:05:08.630> sculpting<00:05:09.290> my<00:05:09.440> 3d<00:05:10.220> object<00:05:10.870> so

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
start to begin sculpting my 3d object so

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.810 
start to begin sculpting my 3d object so
that's<00:05:12.140> the<00:05:12.320> end<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.560> part<00:05:12.830> 3<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.220> thanks<00:05:13.760> for

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
that's the end of part 3 and thanks for
