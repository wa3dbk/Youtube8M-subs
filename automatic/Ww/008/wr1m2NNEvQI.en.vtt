like maybe 25 30 degrees the rudder is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.370 
like maybe 25 30 degrees the rudder is
much<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.290> same<00:01:49.320> process<00:01:50.899> will<00:01:51.899> tape<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.320> in

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
much the same process will tape it in

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.850 
much the same process will tape it in
place<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.869> will<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.960> checking<00:01:54.990> our<00:01:55.470> range<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
place and will be checking our range of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
place and will be checking our range of
motion<00:01:56.219> here<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.540> bit<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
motion here we have a little bit of a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
motion here we have a little bit of a
problem<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.320> doesn't<00:01:58.350> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> move<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.189> there

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640

on<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.939> direction<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.229> looking<00:02:01.560> okay<00:02:01.890> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
on that direction it's looking okay so

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.539

knife<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:09.390> cutting<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> bevel<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
knife and just cutting a bevel down the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.100 
knife and just cutting a bevel down the
length<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.730> hint

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
length of the hint

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.620 
length of the hint
this<00:02:12.680> should<00:02:13.010> allow<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.550> good<00:02:13.820> range<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.480> motion

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
this should allow a good range of motion

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.250 
this should allow a good range of motion
good<00:02:15.560> deflection<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.430> both<00:02:16.910> directions<00:02:17.260> and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
good deflection in both directions and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.830 
good deflection in both directions and
that's<00:02:18.440> what<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.800> need
