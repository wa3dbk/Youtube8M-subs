the right way to travel probably

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.760 
the right way to travel probably
would<00:00:13.100> be<00:00:13.280> to<00:00:13.490> slow<00:00:13.730> down<00:00:13.940> and<00:00:14.590> talk<00:00:15.590> to<00:00:15.740> people

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
and ask questions I think anyone who's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.130 
and ask questions I think anyone who's
opened<00:00:22.910> their<00:00:23.000> minds<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:23.420> actually<00:00:23.750> just<00:00:23.930> sat

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
opened their minds and actually just sat

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.010 
opened their minds and actually just sat
down<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.590> looked<00:00:25.279> around<00:00:25.550> because<00:00:26.360> a<00:00:26.810> big

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
down and looked around because a big

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.140 
down and looked around because a big
part<00:00:27.050> of<00:00:27.320> what<00:00:27.470> I<00:00:27.529> do<00:00:27.619> is<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.970> way<00:00:29.000> I

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
part of what I do is and the way I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.630 
part of what I do is and the way I
should<00:00:29.270> especially<00:00:30.230> is<00:00:30.590> I<00:00:30.619> actually<00:00:31.039> don't<00:00:31.430> go

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
should especially is I actually don't go

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.420 
should especially is I actually don't go
in<00:00:31.820> with<00:00:32.029> my<00:00:32.150> camera<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.770> normally<00:00:33.770> go<00:00:34.100> into<00:00:34.400> a

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
in with my camera I normally go into a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.970 
in with my camera I normally go into a
location<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.360> just<00:00:35.750> look<00:00:36.080> first<00:00:36.470> I<00:00:36.650> put<00:00:36.860> the

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
camera down and I sit and I kind of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.510 
camera down and I sit and I kind of
absorb<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.590> environment<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.190> look<00:00:40.340> at<00:00:40.460> the

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
absorb the environment and look at the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.160 
absorb the environment and look at the
surrounding<00:00:41.059> I<00:00:41.150> look<00:00:41.300> at<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.540> expressions<00:00:42.050> of

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
surrounding I look at the expressions of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.990 
surrounding I look at the expressions of
people<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.590> look<00:00:42.800> at<00:00:42.920> how<00:00:43.040> people<00:00:43.340> interact<00:00:43.670> and

people I look at how people interact and
then<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.210> try<00:00:44.270> to<00:00:44.390> find<00:00:44.720> something<00:00:44.960> out<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.290> it

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
then I try to find something out of it

and I went on a backpacking trip to
Japan<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:24.860> strange<00:01:25.190> thing<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.550> was

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
Japan and the strange thing is that was

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.070 
Japan and the strange thing is that was
the<00:01:25.880> first<00:01:26.120> time<00:01:26.240> actually<00:01:26.480> use<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.870> camera

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
the first time actually use the camera

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.110 
the first time actually use the camera
and<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:27.890> focus<00:01:28.220> on<00:01:28.310> composition<00:01:28.730> because

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
and I just focus on composition because

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.530 
and I just focus on composition because
I<00:01:29.330> was<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.480> new<00:01:29.750> guy<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.250> until<00:01:31.250> today<00:01:31.540> somehow

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
I was a new guy and until today somehow

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.450 
I was a new guy and until today somehow
another<00:01:32.930> that's<00:01:33.290> still<00:01:33.650> my<00:01:33.800> favorite<00:01:34.160> set<00:01:34.340> of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
another that's still my favorite set of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.120 
another that's still my favorite set of
pictures<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:35.630> something<00:01:35.990> liberating<00:01:36.500> for

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
pictures it's something liberating for

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.130 
pictures it's something liberating for
people<00:01:37.490> when<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.820> don't<00:01:37.850> are<00:01:38.570> not<00:01:38.840> tied<00:01:39.110> down

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
people when you don't are not tied down

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.030 
people when you don't are not tied down
to<00:01:39.800> two<00:01:40.520> conventions<00:01:41.270> because<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.320> spend<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.010> lot

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
to two conventions because I spend a lot

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.670 
to two conventions because I spend a lot
of<00:01:43.190> time<00:01:44.020> feeling<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.050> picture's<00:01:45.260> rather

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
of time feeling the picture's rather

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.500 
of time feeling the picture's rather
than<00:01:45.860> thinking<00:01:46.190> about<00:01:46.460> them<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.030> that

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
than thinking about them so that that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.450 
than thinking about them so that that
that<00:01:47.780> was<00:01:48.020> where<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.290> started<00:01:48.740> LA<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.070> from

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
that was where it started LA and from

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.960 
that was where it started LA and from
there<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:50.090> travel<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.610> photography<00:01:52.610> for<00:01:52.820> me

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970
