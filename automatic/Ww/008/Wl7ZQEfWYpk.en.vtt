sniper rifle and once again i'm not a
sniper<00:00:26.859> but<00:00:27.249> i'm<00:00:27.400> doing<00:00:27.699> it<00:00:27.789> for<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:27.999> random

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
sniper but i'm doing it for the random

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.679 
sniper but i'm doing it for the random
weapons<00:00:28.749> and<00:00:29.140> going<00:00:30.130> for<00:00:30.369> it<00:00:30.460> so<00:00:30.789> there's<00:00:31.150> 50

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
it is actually it's really hard for me

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.700 
it is actually it's really hard for me
to<00:00:35.650> decide<00:00:35.950> about<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:37.000> sniper<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:38.350> one

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
to decide about this sniper because one

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.470 
to decide about this sniper because one
thing<00:00:38.740> i<00:00:39.010> absolutely<00:00:39.460> love<00:00:39.760> about<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.060> is<00:00:40.330> you

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
thing i absolutely love about it is you

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.810 
thing i absolutely love about it is you
get<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:41.140> lot<00:00:41.680> of<00:00:41.710> one-shot<00:00:42.250> kills<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.700> don't

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
get a lot of one-shot kills you don't

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.180 
get a lot of one-shot kills you don't
get<00:00:42.940> too<00:00:43.150> many<00:00:43.620> hit<00:00:44.620> markers<00:00:44.920> which<00:00:45.070> is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
get too many hit markers which is

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.120 
get too many hit markers which is
absolutely<00:00:45.850> great<00:00:46.060> i'd<00:00:46.420> say<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:47.380> hit<00:00:47.590> market

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
absolutely great i'd say you hit market

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.920 
absolutely great i'd say you hit market
ten<00:00:48.460> percent<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.030> shots<00:00:49.300> with<00:00:49.600> this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
ten percent of the shots with this

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.020 
ten percent of the shots with this
whereas<00:00:50.620> with<00:00:50.650> other<00:00:50.920> snipers<00:00:51.340> like<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.580> MSR

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
whereas with other snipers like the MSR

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.330 
whereas with other snipers like the MSR
you<00:00:52.390> might<00:00:52.540> be<00:00:52.720> hit<00:00:53.020> marking<00:00:53.380> about<00:00:53.560> 20<00:00:54.040> shots

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
you might be hit marking about 20 shots

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.100 
you might be hit marking about 20 shots
so<00:00:54.640> twenty<00:00:55.270> percent<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.630> time<00:00:55.780> left<00:00:55.990> to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
so twenty percent of the time left to

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.740 
so twenty percent of the time left to
shoot<00:00:56.530> them<00:00:56.650> twice<00:00:56.890> than<00:00:57.160> MSR<00:00:57.580> and<00:00:57.880> only<00:00:58.540> ten

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
shoot them twice than MSR and only ten

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.320 
shoot them twice than MSR and only ten
percent<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.440> as50<00:01:00.040> one<00:01:00.820> thing<00:01:01.060> I<00:01:01.180> find

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
percent with the as50 one thing I find

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.790 
percent with the as50 one thing I find
quite<00:01:01.510> weird<00:01:01.780> about<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.200> how<00:01:02.380> when<00:01:02.560> you<00:01:02.650> aim

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
quite weird about is how when you aim

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.940 
quite weird about is how when you aim
down<00:01:02.830> sight<00:01:03.659> it's<00:01:04.659> almost<00:01:04.930> as<00:01:05.350> if<00:01:05.379> you've<00:01:05.710> not

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
down sight it's almost as if you've not

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.050 
down sight it's almost as if you've not
at<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.490> doesn't<00:01:06.670> actually<00:01:06.759> give<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.030> a

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
at it doesn't actually give you a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.999 
at it doesn't actually give you a
magnification<00:01:07.930> well<00:01:08.439> actually<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:08.770> me<00:01:08.859> have<00:01:08.950> a

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
magnification well actually I me have a

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.889 
magnification well actually I me have a
look<00:01:09.219> that<00:01:09.759> I'm<00:01:09.909> just<00:01:10.119> looking<00:01:10.390> at<00:01:10.479> camera<00:01:10.780> in

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
look that I'm just looking at camera in

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.840 
look that I'm just looking at camera in
downside<00:01:11.289> it<00:01:11.829> gives<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:12.249> barely<00:01:12.520> any

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
downside it gives you barely any

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.999 
downside it gives you barely any
magnification<00:01:13.509> on<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.079> scope<00:01:14.289> so<00:01:14.530> really<00:01:14.920> it

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
magnification on the scope so really it

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.380 
magnification on the scope so really it
just<00:01:15.039> kind<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.340> restricts<00:01:15.789> your<00:01:15.999> view<00:01:16.210> when

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
just kind of restricts your view when

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.989 
just kind of restricts your view when
you<00:01:16.479> go<00:01:16.630> down<00:01:16.810> scope<00:01:17.109> and<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:18.460> much<00:01:18.579> else<00:01:18.640> I

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
you go down scope and not much else I

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.429 
you go down scope and not much else I
mean<00:01:19.090> obviously<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.600> makes<00:01:19.719> more<00:01:19.960> accurate

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
mean obviously it makes more accurate

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.109 
mean obviously it makes more accurate
because<00:01:20.560> you've<00:01:20.740> got<00:01:20.859> your<00:01:21.039> crosshair<00:01:21.579> which

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
because you've got your crosshair which

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.050 
because you've got your crosshair which
means<00:01:22.329> you<00:01:22.420> can<00:01:22.509> aim<00:01:22.719> for<00:01:22.749> people<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.549> I<00:01:24.789> just

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
means you can aim for people but I just

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.819 
means you can aim for people but I just
find<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.359> really<00:01:25.659> weird<00:01:26.020> on<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.289> sniper<00:01:26.649> rifle

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
find that really weird on a sniper rifle

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.630 
find that really weird on a sniper rifle
and<00:01:27.569> in<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:29.049> way<00:01:29.259> is<00:01:29.530> quite<00:01:29.770> useful<00:01:29.950> because<00:01:30.310> I'm

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
and in a way is quite useful because I'm

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.069 
and in a way is quite useful because I'm
not<00:01:30.789> sure<00:01:30.999> this<00:01:31.179> is<00:01:31.240> just<00:01:31.479> me<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:31.749> at<00:01:31.869> long

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
not sure this is just me but at long

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.660 
not sure this is just me but at long
range<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.560> don't<00:01:32.740> have<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.009> be<00:01:33.130> quite<00:01:33.429> so

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
range you don't have to be quite so

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.090 
range you don't have to be quite so
accurate<00:01:34.149> because<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:34.899> kind<00:01:35.139> of<00:01:35.170> snaps<00:01:35.530> on<00:01:35.859> I'm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
accurate because it kind of snaps on I'm

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.069 
accurate because it kind of snaps on I'm
not<00:01:36.520> sure<00:01:36.639> and<00:01:37.030> talk<00:01:37.630> about<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.899> gameplay

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
not sure and talk about the gameplay

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.289 
not sure and talk about the gameplay
quickly<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.590> have<00:01:38.889> a<00:01:39.039> quite<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.490> shocking<00:01:39.969> start

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
quickly I have a quite a shocking start

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.480 
quickly I have a quite a shocking start
okay<00:01:40.780> it's<00:01:40.929> really<00:01:41.049> good<00:01:41.319> towards<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.889> middle

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
okay it's really good towards the middle

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.639 
okay it's really good towards the middle
and<00:01:42.909> then<00:01:43.030> tails<00:01:43.810> off<00:01:43.990> towards<00:01:44.319> the<00:01:44.409> end

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
and then tails off towards the end

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.249 
and then tails off towards the end
that's<00:01:45.399> pretty<00:01:45.670> much<00:01:45.789> how<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.090> goes<00:01:46.479> got<00:01:47.229> a

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
that's pretty much how it goes got a

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.139 
that's pretty much how it goes got a
real<00:01:47.469> nice<00:01:47.679> killstreak<00:01:48.219> towards<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:48.969> middle

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
real nice killstreak towards the middle

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.800 
real nice killstreak towards the middle
like<00:01:49.389> I<00:01:49.539> say<00:01:50.219> so<00:01:51.219> one<00:01:52.030> thing<00:01:52.389> that<00:01:52.450> I've<00:01:52.780> heard

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
like I say so one thing that I've heard

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.959 
like I say so one thing that I've heard
that's<00:01:53.109> really<00:01:53.499> good<00:01:53.709> is<00:01:53.950> if<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.549> put

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
that's really good is if you put

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.359 
that's really good is if you put
variable<00:01:55.509> zoom<00:01:55.659> on<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.020> as50<00:01:56.439> then<00:01:56.889> you<00:01:57.100> can

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
variable zoom on the as50 then you can

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.149 
variable zoom on the as50 then you can
use<00:01:58.149> it<00:01:58.179> like<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.569> normal<00:01:58.780> sniper<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.499> do<00:01:59.679> quite

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
use it like a normal sniper and do quite

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.219 
use it like a normal sniper and do quite
a<00:02:00.189> lot<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.490> damage<00:02:00.670> because<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.179> does<00:02:01.420> actually

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
a lot of damage because it does actually

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.699 
a lot of damage because it does actually
speak<00:02:02.799> more<00:02:03.039> damage<00:02:03.340> have<00:02:03.579> a<00:02:03.819> high<00:02:04.509> damage<00:02:05.439> on

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
speak more damage have a high damage on

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.100 
speak more damage have a high damage on
I<00:02:05.740> think<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.329> even<00:02:07.329> more<00:02:07.509> damage<00:02:07.959> than

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
I think it's the even more damage than

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.460 
I think it's the even more damage than
the<00:02:08.170> bar<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> 50<00:02:08.860> Cal<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:10.630> semi-auto<00:02:11.350> is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
the bar a 50 Cal and it's a semi-auto is

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.559 
the bar a 50 Cal and it's a semi-auto is
not<00:02:11.709> bolt<00:02:11.980> action<00:02:12.490> which<00:02:12.730> again<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.090> really

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
not bolt action which again is really

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.000 
not bolt action which again is really
nice<00:02:13.689> enough<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.110> cock<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.439> up<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:14.830> every

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
nice enough to cock it up for every

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.729 
nice enough to cock it up for every
single<00:02:15.280> shot<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.540> yeah<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:17.080> far<00:02:17.260> as<00:02:17.439> sniper

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
single shot so yeah as far as sniper

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.510 
single shot so yeah as far as sniper
they<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.189> say

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
they can say

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.380 
they can say
