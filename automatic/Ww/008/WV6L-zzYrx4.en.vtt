now<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.229> while<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.799> deck<00:01:38.220> has<00:01:38.670> been

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
now all the while the deck has been

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.530 
now all the while the deck has been
thinking<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:41.430> knows<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.119> card<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

thinking and it knows what your card is
right<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:44.009> hoping<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> spread

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
right now I'm hoping so when I spread

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.470 
right now I'm hoping so when I spread
out<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.200> cards<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.880> so

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.000 

and<00:01:52.280> flip<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.400> over<00:01:54.110> watch<00:01:55.370> what<00:01:56.370> happens

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
and flip it over watch what happens

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.700 
and flip it over watch what happens
spread<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.130> cards<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.550> evenly<00:02:00.440> when<00:02:01.440> I<00:02:01.470> give

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
spread the cards out evenly when I give

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.580 
spread the cards out evenly when I give
the<00:02:01.770> cards<00:02:02.400> could<00:02:02.730> flourish<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.770> Oh
