something<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.959> think<00:02:17.170> makes<00:02:17.379> this<00:02:17.500> radar

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
something I think makes this radar

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.309 
something I think makes this radar
detector<00:02:18.250> very<00:02:18.489> unique<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.900> notice<00:02:20.200> I'm

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
detector very unique you notice I'm

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.570 
detector very unique you notice I'm
almost<00:02:20.560> looks<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.890> little<00:02:21.069> too<00:02:21.310> little

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
almost looks a little too little

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.699 
almost looks a little too little
periscopes<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.780> are<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:22.959> top<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.409> radar

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
periscopes that are on top of the radar

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.570 
periscopes that are on top of the radar
detector<00:02:24.099> right<00:02:24.220> here<00:02:25.739> first<00:02:26.739> glance<00:02:27.069> you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
detector right here first glance you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.470 
detector right here first glance you
might<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.000> these<00:02:28.390> are<00:02:28.569> laser<00:02:29.220> diodes<00:02:30.480> well

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
might think these are laser diodes well

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.000 
might think these are laser diodes well
this<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.049> case<00:02:32.200> these<00:02:32.470> are<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.950> to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
this is not the case these are going to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.850 
this is not the case these are going to
be<00:02:33.069> little<00:02:33.400> LEDs<00:02:34.329> that<00:02:34.690> when<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.530> radar

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
be little LEDs that when the radar

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.740 
be little LEDs that when the radar
detector<00:02:36.310> activates<00:02:36.819> will<00:02:37.000> light<00:02:37.239> up<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.659> I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
detector activates will light up and I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.240 
detector activates will light up and I
think<00:02:38.079> it's<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.769> neat<00:02:38.980> little<00:02:39.099> feature

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
think it's really a neat little feature

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.490 
think it's really a neat little feature
of<00:02:39.610> this<00:02:39.700> radar<00:02:39.970> detector<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.720> I'll<00:02:41.230> give<00:02:41.410> you

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
hand here is going to be a little device

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.839 
hand here is going to be a little device
that<00:02:49.239> we<00:02:49.510> use<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.900> test<00:02:50.140> radar<00:02:50.500> detectors<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
that we use to test radar detectors and

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.819 
that we use to test radar detectors and
what<00:02:52.060> I'll<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.299> is<00:02:52.390> I'll<00:02:52.510> shoot<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.959> radar<00:02:53.590> beam

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
what I'll do is I'll shoot a radar beam

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.509 
what I'll do is I'll shoot a radar beam
a<00:02:54.010> radar<00:02:54.519> alert<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:59.190> and<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.400> was<00:03:00.459> a

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
a radar alert to it and that was a

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.410 
a radar alert to it and that was a

of<00:03:07.120> cave<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.959> there<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> pulse<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.190> I

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
of cave in and there was a pulse that I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.619 
of cave in and there was a pulse that I
sense<00:03:09.549> what<00:03:09.700> he<00:03:09.819> noticed<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.120> those<00:03:10.329> little

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
sense what he noticed that those little

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.740 
sense what he noticed that those little
LEDs<00:03:11.049> don't<00:03:11.349> do<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.590> again<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:16.599> that

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
LEDs don't do that again and in that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.870 
LEDs don't do that again and in that
case<00:03:16.959> i<00:03:17.169> sent<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.440> little<00:03:17.680> salt<00:03:17.950> longer<00:03:18.489> signal

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
case i sent a little salt longer signal

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.150 
case i sent a little salt longer signal
to<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.120> radar<00:03:19.299> detector<00:03:19.870> were<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.769> able<00:03:20.980> to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
to the radar detector were you able to

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.490 
to the radar detector were you able to
see<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.760> Geiger<00:03:22.419> counter<00:03:22.450> effect<00:03:23.079> display

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
and I'll shoot a little ka at the radar

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.300 
and I'll shoot a little ka at the radar
detector<00:03:31.380> again<00:03:32.380> you'll<00:03:32.709> notice<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.130> little

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
detector again you'll notice the little

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.220 
detector again you'll notice the little

again we went out this past weekend and

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.650 
again we went out this past weekend and
we<00:04:02.430> ran<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.609> radar<00:04:04.060> detector<00:04:04.449> through<00:04:04.629> a

we ran the radar detector through a

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.530 
we ran the radar detector through a
series<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:05.019> tests<00:04:05.459> our<00:04:06.459> long-range<00:04:06.970> test<00:04:07.359> some

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
series of tests our long-range test some

filtering<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:10.540> I'm<00:04:11.169> very<00:04:12.129> happy<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.579> say<00:04:12.790> that

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
filtering and I'm very happy to say that

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.030 
filtering and I'm very happy to say that
again<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.930> think<00:04:14.139> this<00:04:14.230> radar<00:04:14.470> detector

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
again that I think this radar detector

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.520 
again that I think this radar detector
has<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:15.910> lot<00:04:16.329> better<00:04:16.539> performance

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
has a lot better performance

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.170 
has a lot better performance
had<00:04:18.040> anything<00:04:18.280> ever<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.730> come<00:04:18.850> out<00:04:19.030> with

had anything ever to come out with
before<00:04:20.730> this<00:04:21.730> is<00:04:21.940> probably<00:04:22.120> one<00:04:22.450> of<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> best

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
before this is probably one of the best

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.690 
before this is probably one of the best
products<00:04:23.290> that<00:04:23.680> whistlers<00:04:24.100> come<00:04:24.340> out<00:04:24.490> with

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
products that whistlers come out with

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.480
