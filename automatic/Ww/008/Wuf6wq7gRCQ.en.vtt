was<00:03:35.780> your<00:03:36.410> boss<00:03:36.530> coming<00:03:36.860> out<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.040> paradise<00:03:37.400> in

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
was your boss coming out of paradise in

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.259 
was your boss coming out of paradise in
good<00:03:37.730> shape<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.510> healthy<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:40.310> for<00:03:41.000> me<00:03:41.090> it's

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
good shape and healthy but for me it's

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.060 
good shape and healthy but for me it's
just<00:03:41.360> been<00:03:41.630> all<00:03:41.840> about<00:03:42.080> how<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.410> recover<00:03:42.709> from

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
just been all about how to recover from

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.680 
just been all about how to recover from
the<00:03:43.610> efforts<00:03:43.880> I've<00:03:44.000> made<00:03:44.180> last<00:03:44.390> week<00:03:44.570> to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
the efforts I've made last week to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.009 
the efforts I've made last week to
parties<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.340> try<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:46.790> regain<00:03:47.720> my<00:03:47.900> health

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
parties and to try and regain my health

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.190 
parties and to try and regain my health
100%<00:03:48.920> so<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:49.760> basically<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.540> easy<00:03:50.870> to

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
100% so it's basically really easy to

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.900 
100% so it's basically really easy to
some<00:03:51.350> train<00:03:51.560> be<00:03:51.739> sprayed<00:03:51.980> but<00:03:52.160> we<00:03:52.340> do<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.459> lot<00:03:52.550> a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
some train be sprayed but we do a lot a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.960 
some train be sprayed but we do a lot a
longer<00:03:53.269> ride<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.600> Wednesday<00:03:54.700> we're<00:03:55.700> coming

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
longer ride on Wednesday we're coming

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.400 
longer ride on Wednesday we're coming
from<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.269> there<00:03:56.510> would<00:03:56.660> be<00:03:56.690> an<00:03:56.900> intensity

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
from that there would be an intensity

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.070 
from that there would be an intensity
but<00:03:57.620> every<00:03:57.800> other<00:03:57.860> week<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.420> then<00:03:59.420> nearing

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
but every other week and then nearing

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
descenders going around fed to my

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.590

advantage<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:25.280> trying<00:04:25.729> so<00:04:25.970> many<00:04:26.030> times<00:04:26.360> over

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
advantage of trying so many times over

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.270 
advantage of trying so many times over
those<00:04:26.810> riders<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.380> knew<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.770> corners<00:04:28.130> so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
those riders so I knew the corners so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.880 
those riders so I knew the corners so
well<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:29.539> where<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.720> could<00:04:29.900> push<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:30.590> where

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
well and where I could push it and where

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.610 
well and where I could push it and where
I<00:04:30.919> need<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.400> back<00:04:32.030> off<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.240> little<00:04:32.330> bit<00:04:32.539> but<00:04:33.200> I

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
I need to back off a little bit but I

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.320 
I need to back off a little bit but I
can't<00:04:33.890> show<00:04:34.010> are<00:04:34.160> basically<00:04:34.640> attacked<00:04:35.030> me

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
can't show are basically attacked me

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.300 
can't show are basically attacked me
bleeding<00:04:35.600> are<00:04:35.720> on<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.289> exit<00:04:36.620> of<00:04:36.680> every<00:04:36.950> corner

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
bleeding are on the exit of every corner

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.820 
bleeding are on the exit of every corner
so<00:04:37.789> it<00:04:37.880> was<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.180> like<00:04:38.330> doing<00:04:38.510> a<00:04:38.720> pull<00:04:39.650> out<00:04:39.680> of

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
so it was just like doing a pull out of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.279 
so it was just like doing a pull out of
Sprint's<00:04:40.280> out<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.640> every<00:04:40.850> corner<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:42.110> was

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
Sprint's out of every corner so it was

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.050 
Sprint's out of every corner so it was
one<00:04:42.830> of<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.979> hard<00:04:43.100> parts<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.550> race<00:04:43.789> no<00:04:44.030> I

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
one of the hard parts of the race no I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.080 
one of the hard parts of the race no I
bet<00:04:44.300> okay<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.289> just<00:04:45.560> very<00:04:45.620> briefly<00:04:45.770> then<00:04:46.250> who

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
bet okay so just very briefly then who

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.490 
bet okay so just very briefly then who
who<00:04:47.539> do<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.720> think<00:04:47.900> you'll<00:04:48.020> be<00:04:48.080> looking<00:04:48.380> out

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
who do you think you'll be looking out

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.140 
who do you think you'll be looking out
for<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:50.060> weekend<00:04:50.450> who<00:04:50.840> your<00:04:50.960> rivals<00:04:51.350> I

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
for this this weekend who your rivals I

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.100 
for this this weekend who your rivals I
think<00:04:53.150> they<00:04:53.240> might<00:04:53.390> be<00:04:53.450> contended<00:04:54.020> as

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
think they might be contended as

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.900 
think they might be contended as
unfortunately<00:04:54.890> put<00:04:55.160> myself<00:04:55.340> up<00:04:55.700> we've<00:04:55.880> got

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
unfortunately put myself up we've got

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.060 
unfortunately put myself up we've got
Matt<00:04:56.240> Goss<00:04:56.419> you<00:04:57.080> having<00:04:57.320> a<00:04:57.410> second<00:04:57.710> be<00:04:57.830> shown

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
Matt Goss you having a second be shown

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.440 
Matt Goss you having a second be shown
using<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.520> good<00:04:58.700> form<00:04:58.940> when<00:04:59.030> he<00:04:59.120> gets<00:04:59.300> a

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
using that good form when he gets a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.200 
using that good form when he gets a
chance<00:04:59.660> arena<00:05:00.169> and<00:05:00.380> as<00:05:00.890> he's<00:05:01.100> obviously<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.580> my

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
chance arena and as he's obviously a my

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.990 
chance arena and as he's obviously a my
team<00:05:03.050> laid<00:05:03.260> out<00:05:03.410> but<00:05:03.710> for<00:05:04.010> San<00:05:04.220> Remo

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
team laid out but for San Remo

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.760 
team laid out but for San Remo
so<00:05:05.690> hopefully<00:05:06.080> he's<00:05:06.229> going<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.470> be<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.560> real

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
so hopefully he's going to be a real

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.980 
so hopefully he's going to be a real
contender

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
contender

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.650 
contender
