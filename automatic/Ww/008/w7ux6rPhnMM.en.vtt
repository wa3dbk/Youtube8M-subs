00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hello 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.940
 Welcome to my house, it's a pleasure. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.110
 receive them nothing more Brazilian than 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 I was having a barbecue at home, actually. 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.809
 so I chose two skewers as well 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.119
 simple for you to do is one 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.609
 rump skewer with vegetables and sauce 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.910
 yogurt special with sat 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.180
 the other is a salmon skewer with the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.180
 little brother and celery will start 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.090
 To start the sauce, we have something 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.070
 a paste of one knows or 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.570
 also known as strong root I will 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.130
 be well to leave this folder well 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.950
 homogeneous 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.560
 I'll use the thick sun itself and then 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.820
 people will add a little bit of acidity 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.820
 with vinegar finishing touch very important 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.820
 olive oil 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.040
 the lid and I'll take it to the refrigerator to 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.670
 rest while we go to 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.280
 barbecue grill 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.480
 I chose a cut either the rump then 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.970
 We 'll cut the meat into cubes. 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.850
 for our hair is our goal. 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.820
 make a longitudinal cut the queues are 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.869
 long you should cut 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.940
 perpendicular to these fibers 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.590
 You have a softer flesh both in the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.090
 barbecue as in other production of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.400
 stove that can make in your house 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.070
 the onion you will cut into petals 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.710
 this way the body in half and makes its 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.290
 very interesting petals zucchini 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.979
 Italian people are going to cut into half-moon 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.960
 cut in half and make slices of this band 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.520
 cut meat cut vegetables let's 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.770
 start putting the skewer going 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.500
 introduce the spit rotating which is more 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.280
 easy to penetrate onion after meat 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.770
 zucchini slices of meat to the onion 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.690
 zucchini meat and so on 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.000
 I'll put the skewers in this dish 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.060
 to season with salt make a fondness in the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.899
 meat here in the salted vegetables other 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.030
 side a good move of olive oil and we 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.399
 will pass the skewers of good sound to 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.440
 People are going to start cutting these steaks. 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.869
 salmon prices fit in our 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.610
 chopped salmon cut so all in 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.259
 same standard is important for you to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.340
 have the same cooking time there in 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.950
 barbecue grill 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.750
 Then you 'll cut the lemon like that. 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.240
 what we call the French lemon 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.819
 cleaning the white part and pulling 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.200
 the seeds the celery we will cut 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.900
 in small pieces will stay leaning 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.430
 on the piece of salmon and will perfum the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.430
 salmon when you have it on the grill 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.020
 record the skewers you will put the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.650
 first a little piece of celery he goes 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.230
 hold our fish then salmon and over there 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.240
 the lemon peel leaning against the floor 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.380
 because it is precisely what will give the 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.600
 Sicilian lemon and lemon juice before 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.320
 we will season with salt and 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.250
 olive oil 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.720
 the same way we did 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.090
 goldfish face and let's leave 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.130
 rest a little 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.140
 she was expecting at hand all ready 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.330
 go to barbecue 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.580
 It's important for us to have a 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.200
 barbecue without fire only ember 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.120
 if you can not stay five 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.690
 seconds with your hand still on the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.950
 embers 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.220
 This means that the temperature is 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.520
 correct first I'll put the skewer 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.200
 meat and once you are at the point of 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.970
 Turn over I'll put the hand expedition 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.300
 because the meat takes a longer time to 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.300
 to cook 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.780
 the barbecue spot a preference 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.580
 quite personal 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.910
 Since Carlos is very well past her 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.220
 stay dry and the salmon is hard 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.319
 fish that should get a little more bad 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.630
 passed inside means one more 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.250
 Interesting texture never tastier 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.569
 so you can identify the point that you 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.569
 like to serve 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.830

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.690
