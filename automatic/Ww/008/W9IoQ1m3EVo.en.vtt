00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello today we are going to make a video tutorial 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:13.070
 how to clean our shootings 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.070
 our bearings of our skate 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.900
 The first thing we need to know are the 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.789
 materials 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.789
 because they realized the tour 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.849
 my tires that what we're going to need 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.849
 the key to remove from the rim 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.150
 a bottle where the bearings fit 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.150
 I removed nail polish 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.640
 I do not accept 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 a hair dryer 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.500
 and napkins to dry it 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.540
 we go with the first step and it 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.540
 I forgot a needle 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.460
 with the key 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.460
 let's take out with the nuts 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.910
 we take it out 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.540
 we play alvaro good reading 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.540
 let's remove the nuts 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.680
 what is it that they live here 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.969
 we take out the other 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.820
 click 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.370
 from there 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.910
 with the same trick we will put nothing 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.500
 plus the tip and we're going to pull a pass 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.750
 click 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.750
 so that from here it comes out 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.729
 our two boleros are already here and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.740
 so let's see with all and now we 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.740
 we remove what the means takes 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.750
 legend 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.750
 yes 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.890
 very well 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.990
 now 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.140
 with 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.560
 and the needle 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.270
 let's take what 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.120
 and that 's the change of being very 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.520
 dirty we're going to take away the part of 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.550
 black green anything 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.870
 let's take out introduce fix 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.870
 resist to see if not 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.440
 our 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.170
 needle with 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.819
 point 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.349
 let's go now we vote we're just going 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.349
 to remove a face 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.570
 with the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.130
 let's always remove the face that is 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.130
 dirtiest 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.409
 yes 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.409
 Y 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.990
 with the next step we are going to put them 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.940
 faces in the jar 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.230
 and inside also the bearings 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.230
 and they will be able to see it 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.430
 let's make our base tone 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.890
 and that we have removed it 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.770
 let's see you 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.770
 for the area 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.730
 that covers a quarter of the pot 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.730
 and that's why we take our site 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:41.470
 like our jar well 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:41.470
 and come on we keep coming 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.420
 once done that 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.420
 let's remove the acetone 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.950
 and we are going to 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.480
 and put them 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.480
 in the napkins 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.340
 what if 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.090
 one and with the other we are not going to 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.090
 involve pressure 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.050
 for me 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.400
 here and now we are going to grab one 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.400
 get them clean 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.820
 and we put aside 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.240
 Likewise we 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.240
 this 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.000
 let's see 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.710
 we clean 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.880
 aside 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.080
 on the one hand and so all 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:30.530
 and finally with our gun 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.530
 let's start like this carlos with heat 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.919
 very well and lastly for the 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:07.880
 recommendation put some oil 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:07.880
 of cough for discrete sewing machine 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.380
 for reasoner if that is to put some 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.380
 droplets and respond to roll well 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.110
 with the coquitos 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.740
 yes 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:56.020
 we do this with everyone and we cover them 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.020
 we train 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.960
 we continued to skate it was all thanks
