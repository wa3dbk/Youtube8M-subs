00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello guys a Veronese 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.300
 look what freshly caught we report 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.300
 on man it is a very interesting thing 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 and here we are ready 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.070
 let's find this truck this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.890
 small truck 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 this is clearly not the highlight 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 there's traffic there's casino I'm signing the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.720
 people are watching me but let's go 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.899
 forward we have to document chart ago 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.840
 part of the mali scenario here in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.510
 to the people who document 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.060
 and let's see while you have seen 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.540
 this truck I messed up 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.610
 basically 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.010
 but he hears me looking at me while I'm at it 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.280
 stating hello everyone died remains 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.650
 here we go on so much and look 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.720
 what went to find I would say that 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.370
 this stop 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.880
 it is worth documenting watch 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.410
 wonderful 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.780
 the splendid abandonment 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.140
 look at the most abandonment let's say one 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.100
 parked car is left 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.930
 deteriorate rot over time but that 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.890
 however a wonderful machine who 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.780
 he was looking for upwind doors here they are 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.460
 the first series call them the ports 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.910
 against the wind I do not buy the dog I am 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.080
 at the door against the wind or the car 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.660
 look at this machine left a 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.430
 rot with your doors meeting 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:38.479
 wind watch now let's have a good time 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 I saw it in this car 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.130
 followed and stop to document 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.100
 once again he was a cubit who did not 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.680
 I would find anything today he came up on 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.060
 such as the Veronese to take a picture a 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 small gathering of historic cars about 10 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.250
 20 10 20 cars will do great but for 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.800
 luck that this one is worth on the radio 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.070
 look at this moment also passes 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.480
 the cable car is looking at me but so is he 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.000
 let's finish the story let's see if 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.620
 we can go behind the car 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.690
 given look at the interiors 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.690
 watch her close the door 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:36.400
 closed door and we go to see in 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.890
 complete March detail who wants 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.190
 restructuring it must spend quite a bit 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.190
 of money 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.780
 with once 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.780
 this is called bang 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.900
 and luckily I didn't go behind 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.750
 to the historical audio procession has 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.370
 continued on this road if not with the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.830
 Man I would have found this car 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.650
 look at goals seen even put itself 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.910
 the welder's mask by stitch 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.130
 prevent someone from seeing 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.660
 [Music] 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.530
 privacy as they say 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 but still a splendid abandonment 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.250
 it also seems to me a bodywork 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.120
 a workshop here with the doors open 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.690
 smashed glasses let go into 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.130
 degraded this machine which is a good one 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.140
 booty for matri 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.870
 and for you clearly that you enjoy 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.370
 always these movies understood me 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.110
 like them even if you find some 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.900
 crap 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.470
 but I like to hear what I say crap and 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.430
 then continue with these movies the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.430
 actually they are not like that 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.140
 imagine paul cousin that my son 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.300
 would be things aside 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.210
 oh well let's watch this dead movie 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:04.450
 here is rai 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:08.450
 we dedicate this video to the lady 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.900
 trozzi self- demolition that follows me from 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.900
 a lot of time 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.270
 too many car demolitions let's do a little 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.550
 of advertising large centers of 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.430
 self-demolition in Italy a 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.410
 European level 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.600
 a greeting to all and thanks for this 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.840
 movie you followed me one more 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.830
 time with patience and we carry it 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.360
 machine 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.930
 [Music] 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.850
 here it is 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.350

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.139
 truck on TV truck fragment 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.960
