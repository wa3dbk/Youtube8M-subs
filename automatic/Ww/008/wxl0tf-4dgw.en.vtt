00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
it so it's 21 to him and I thought I had

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.830 
it so it's 21 to him and I thought I had
some<00:03:42.310> sort<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.609> route<00:03:43.060> back<00:03:43.269> into<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.660> game

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
some sort of route back into the game

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.080 
some sort of route back into the game
but<00:03:43.900> look<00:03:44.349> at<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.680> from<00:03:44.919> poor<00:03:45.220> keeping<00:03:45.700> he

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
but look at that from poor keeping he

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.520 
but look at that from poor keeping he
comes<00:03:46.359> out<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.720> don't<00:03:46.930> even<00:03:47.019> know<00:03:47.319> why<00:03:47.500> I

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
comes out and I don't even know why I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.080 
comes out and I don't even know why I
didn't<00:03:47.829> even<00:03:47.919> press<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.310> white<00:03:48.519> button<00:03:48.549> and

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
and I just can't do anything about it so

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.689 
and I just can't do anything about it so
it<00:05:53.139> was<00:05:53.169> well-played<00:05:53.889> to<00:05:54.009> limb<00:05:54.159> to<00:05:54.310> be<00:05:54.400> fair<00:05:54.639> he

gets<00:05:54.909> another<00:05:55.150> chance<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.599> I<00:05:55.690> just<00:05:55.840> didn't

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
gets another chance and I just didn't

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.300 
gets another chance and I just didn't
want<00:05:56.139> to<00:05:56.199> make<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:56.349> too<00:05:56.650> embarrassing<00:05:57.190> for

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
want to make it too embarrassing for

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.370 
want to make it too embarrassing for
myself<00:05:57.699> and<00:05:57.940> I<00:05:58.449> won't<00:05:58.630> wouldn't<00:05:58.990> recommend

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
myself and I won't wouldn't recommend

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.320 
myself and I won't wouldn't recommend
using<00:05:59.650> this<00:05:59.860> team<00:06:00.039> at<00:06:00.159> all<00:06:00.340> costs<00:06:00.610> like<00:06:00.729> 5k<00:06:01.210> as

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
using this team at all costs like 5k as

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.269 
using this team at all costs like 5k as
well<00:06:01.479> so<00:06:01.810> I<00:06:02.020> probably<00:06:02.440> just<00:06:02.590> discarded<00:06:03.159> it

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:03.279 
well so I probably just discarded it

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.279 
well so I probably just discarded it
after<00:06:03.610> this<00:06:03.699> game<00:06:03.909> and<00:06:04.210> just<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:05.110> way<00:06:05.229> it

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
after this game and just the way it

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.839 
after this game and just the way it
played<00:06:05.500> it<00:06:05.590> was<00:06:05.680> really<00:06:05.919> slow<00:06:06.250> its<00:06:06.610> really

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
played it was really slow its really

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.269 
played it was really slow its really
sluggish<00:06:07.120> and<00:06:07.569> then<00:06:08.289> just<00:06:08.800> a<00:06:08.919> team<00:06:09.069> which<00:06:09.190> I

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
sluggish and then just a team which I

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.589 
sluggish and then just a team which I
don't<00:06:09.430> like<00:06:09.550> using<00:06:09.729> so<00:06:10.029> that<00:06:10.150> is<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.389> end<00:06:10.509> of

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
don't like using so that is the end of

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:11.760 
don't like using so that is the end of
this<00:06:10.659> game<00:06:10.810> so<00:06:11.139> that<00:06:11.259> is<00:06:11.409> the<00:06:11.529> end<00:06:11.650> of<00:06:11.710> this

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
this game so that is the end of this

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.649 
this game so that is the end of this
