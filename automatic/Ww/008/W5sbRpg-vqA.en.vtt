00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
we've got the air speed control as as

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.859 
we've got the air speed control as as
standard<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> traxxas<00:01:08.189> plug<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.520> me<00:01:08.869> yeah

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
standard got a traxxas plug on me yeah

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920 
standard got a traxxas plug on me yeah
past<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.880> well<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.390> basically<00:01:12.750> works

past this and as well so basically works
with<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.170> BAC<00:01:13.490> an<00:01:14.490> off<00:01:15.299> switch<00:01:16.250> mmm<00:01:17.250> yeah<00:01:19.909> it's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
with a BAC an off switch mmm yeah it's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
with a BAC an off switch mmm yeah it's
not<00:01:21.090> too<00:01:21.119> bad<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:22.040> don't<00:01:23.040> if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.340> see

not too bad really don't if you can see

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.149 
not too bad really don't if you can see
through<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:25.950> see

through that you can actually see

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
through that you can actually see
through<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.759> casing<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> as

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
through the casing there you go so as

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.969 
through the casing there you go so as
you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> motherboard<00:01:31.710> inside<00:01:32.960> CPUs

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
you can see the motherboard inside CPUs

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
you can see the motherboard inside CPUs
everything<00:01:34.979> resistors<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.479> cooling

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
everything resistors it's got cooling

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.649 
everything resistors it's got cooling
pump<00:01:37.250> I'll<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.490> place<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
pump I'll just place that here for a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.030 
pump I'll just place that here for a
second<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:42.840> we've<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> brushless

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
second then we've got the brushless

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.510 
second then we've got the brushless
motor<00:01:44.399> itself<00:01:44.759> very<00:01:45.570> tidy<00:01:45.869> very<00:01:46.560> nice<00:01:46.770> don't

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
motor itself very tidy very nice don't

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
motor itself very tidy very nice don't
really<00:01:47.729> nice<00:01:47.850> job<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.590> yellow

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
really nice job there as you see yellow

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.969 
really nice job there as you see yellow
were<00:01:50.310> RC<00:01:51.470> brush<00:01:52.470> 4000<00:01:53.450> 350c<00:01:54.770> basically<00:01:55.770> see

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
were RC brush 4000 350c basically see

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
were RC brush 4000 350c basically see
marks<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.719> didn't

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
marks on there because if they didn't

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.480 
marks on there because if they didn't
other<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.469> there<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.799> wouldn't<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.100> allowed<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
other on there it wouldn't be allowed to

control basically make sure it's safe
even<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> cables<00:02:06.060> are<00:02:06.149> covered<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.570> them<00:02:06.810> sort

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
even the cables are covered in them sort

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.120 
even the cables are covered in them sort
of<00:02:07.680> Teflon<00:02:08.899> material<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.649> cover

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
of Teflon material like just cover

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.960 
of Teflon material like just cover
and<00:02:12.320> he<00:02:13.320> shrinks<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> end<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.880> very

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and he shrinks to at the end that's very

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.090 
and he shrinks to at the end that's very
nicely<00:02:15.330> done<00:02:15.600> too<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.830> think<00:02:16.890> I'm

it around something you can read it
yourself<00:02:32.070> right<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> output<00:02:34.730> current<00:02:35.730> is
