00:00:00.883 --> 00:00:07.167
 Hi, my name is Jurek, I'm an A-cat instructor. 

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:14.888
 I would like to present a "motor" in today's classes, which is currently valid for the exam. 

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:22.249
 This is the Yamaha XJ6 with a capacity of 600 cm. 

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:28.088
 Power 80 HP, weight 205 kg. 

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:38.565
 I will discuss the activities that we must do, so to speak, on the maneuvering square before driving 

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:46.282
 it is typically strictly related to construction activities, i.e. lights, fluids and a drive system. 

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:52.041
 Before driving, we always have to check the drive system - it's about the chain. 

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:59.226
 It works so to say that this chain is deflected between one wheel and the other. 

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:09.237
 The chain must be clean, lubricated and deflection at this point should be between 4.5-5.5 cm. 

00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:11.555
 A minimum of 4.5 cm, a maximum of 5.5 cm. 

00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:19.405
 When these limits are exceeded, the chain will be too loose or too stretched. 

00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:25.435
 After checking the drive system, we draw one of the lights. 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.757
 The first light that we draw is the positional light. 

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:38.020
 The position light determines the position of the motorcycle on the road. 

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:48.860
 At the front it is a white light, at the back it is a red light. 

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:58.460
 And we have to mention that the position light is responsible for illuminating the license plate. 

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:06.910
 Another light that we must be able to present is the passing beam. 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:16.520
 We must know that the passing beam in this motorcycle is activated when the motorcycle is started. 

00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.870
 So the so-called machine. 

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:31.550
 For this purpose, we start the motorcycle, go to the front of the motorcycle and now we have a low beam light. 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.730
 Another light that we can draw is a traffic light, which we must know that also lights up with the passing beam 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.510
 that is, the motorcycle must be running and here the switch on the left side we run the front light 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.750
 DRO-GO-EC. 

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:57.800
 Another light that we can draw are headlamps. 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:06.560
 The first on the one hand is the left turn signal, in front we have to show. 

00:03:07.118 --> 00:03:19.760
 We have to show both the left turn signal, then the right turn signal, it can be at the beginning at the back. 

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:23.410
 Next right front indicator. 

00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:30.360
 We can draw and we must know that this motorcycle is equipped with emergency lights. 

00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:39.500
 So after switching on, we have two lights on the front and two lights on the back. 

00:03:40.483 --> 00:03:47.630
 Another light that we can present is stop brake light. 

00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:56.200
 We pass the other side of the motorcycle to show that the stop brake light is on the handbrake 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:04.290
 by pressing the handbrake lever, the brake stop light is automatically switched on at the rear. 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.720
 The stop brake light also applies to the foot brake and also when the brake is applied 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:18.240
 the brake stop light is visible. 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.160
 - Can we show you again? -Please take very light on the foot brake. 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.270
 Brake light on the handbrake. 

00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:35.800
 We can still draw a sound signal, we must know that it is located on the left side. 

00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:44.880
 And that is, so to speak all the elements when it comes to lights. 

00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:49.630
 We go to the next element, or operating fluids. 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.430
 We must be able to indicate where the brake fluid reservoir is. 

00:04:55.035 --> 00:05:00.650
 The front wheel brake fluid reservoir is located here. 

00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:03.390
 It must be at least half. 

00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:14.390
 That is, the lower is half, at the moment there is an indication to the top full, i.e. the level is the most appropriate. 

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:21.620
 As for the rear brake fluid reservoir, we must know that it is located 

00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:28.160
 under the motorcycle seat in this place. 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:37.140
 Another element that we must point out is the level of coolant. 

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:46.430
 Here is a coolant tank and here we check this liquid. 

00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:51.630
 The next element is the indication of the oil level. 

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:56.370
 You have to show that the oil level indicator is in this place. 

00:05:57.438 --> 00:06:03.230
 When presenting the oil level indication, the "motor" should be removed. 

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:06.590
 And it should be checked on a cold engine. 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:17.720
 After removing the indicator, the state should be between the minimum and the maximum. 

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:29.440
 Briefly, these are all the activities that we should check on the maneuvering square. 

00:06:30.036 --> 00:06:37.640
 In the next class we will discuss all the activities that we need to check before driving 

00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:44.320
 that is, putting on and protecting the safety helmet, checking the lights, checking the brakes, 

00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:51.110
 checking the suspension system and only after these activities we can, so to speak, start driving. 

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:56.110
 That's all I would like to give you in today's classes. 

00:06:57.474 --> 00:07:03.280
 - And the "motor" is from school? - "Motor" is from the Euforia Driver Training Center in Wroc≈Çaw.
