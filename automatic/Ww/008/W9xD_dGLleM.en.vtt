00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Servus was patrick here from the fitness 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.940
 factory and today I show you how to 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.700
 potato potatoes makes the whole thing 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.070
 totally easy it is really very easy it 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.540
 going fast takes about 10 15 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 minutes if you are as bad as 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 I then cut with knife then takes 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.930
 maybe 20 minutes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 on the whole can recommend 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 year old capture sdk cage or have you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.720
 really little sugar with trainer 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 or he is not like that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.420
 blatant like the other normal petschke 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.630
 Jobs writes my comments like it 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.190
 Ketchups is the name of the number of ketter 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.170
 years of running potatoes so I have 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 here a whole kilo which I always quite 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 practically when the thin ones are long so 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.719
 I have here a crowded place such 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.110
 thick ball yes that nice long and thin 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.570
 there were beautiful pieces 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.200
 I'm still going to live next 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 background is just a stop 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.190
 bit of protein and knives 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.199
 cutting board a bowl us around 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.610
 hear her needs this on 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.070
 she has the most important to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.879
 For example, once I take garlic 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:08.420
 I hope a little bit more 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.560
 little curry chips and sweet paprika 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 if you want you can also like it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 a little salt over it 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.210
 whole has really cool nutritionals so 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.070
 I'll show you a short time and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.119
 Although here you have to see if everything 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.299
 He sees everything but he does 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.509
 there you see 1090 in the end 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.030
 calories 50 grams protein 50 grams people 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.799
 yes vegan protein deficiency you see something 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.939
 going off with a lunch 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.770
 Did you die 50 grams and only 28 grams 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.540
 fat so it can not be better 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.479
 the cool thing is you can directly 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.229
 record that directly available because of it 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.810
 yes so if you are fat with a lot of that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.130
 Fat , so to speak, does the carbohydrates 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.899
 include in the blood and that can 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.020
 not immediately in the cell walls there must 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.880
 then only 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.670
 to come and resolve it that way 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.289
 yes and if you just without fat or with 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.000
 very little goes only have one her 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.670
 really the advantage that you immediately to 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.960
 disposal is yes I will now the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.239
 potatoes times I probably will 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.360
 I'll be back soon 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 we'll see each other after that 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.650
 important 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.140
 Do not worry so that's what's coming 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.349
 the hoppy baking tray does not work that way 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.970
 It's 150 bit over 150 degrees in the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.099
 background is when the potatoes 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.299
 So if starchy carbohydrates too 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.130
 be baked hot 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.569
 then we remembered her structure 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.120
 do not use it that much anymore 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.950
 that goes a bit to cultivate it yes 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.670
 then again it may also be what 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.160
 change 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.690
 So it is broken in it but that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.340
 can you prevent everything that is so 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.329
 In any case, then, one word is all right 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.920
 really up to one 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.160
 carcinogenic story 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.980
 that's why a bit over 150 degrees 55 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.450
 206 km to stick around a bit longer, the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.230
 also very juicy and then if we too 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.810
 really cool 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.420
 At 108 200 degrees you do not have many 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.110
 before that had already started and that 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.609
 we do not want 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.139
 As I said, I cut my colleagues 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.859
 partly it was the same as it goes on and 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.730
 See you soon so I'm two times whole 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.380
 In short I want to give you something 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.220
 Cutting technology small so better 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.799
 demonstrate 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.150
 the best is the middle by the 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.160
 you can see that here a bit 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.530
 over it and then you can in the end 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.489
 yes cut as diagonally as it would be 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 Now, for example, a star is like that 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.060
 hopes you can see it 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.010
 He lives in a beautiful horny writing 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.720
 So here you see that you see 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.389
 Of course not, yes I'll try it 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.480
 so you can see the cut a bit 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.560
 better yes so always nice says small 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.510
 cut and then you get by 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.099
 relatively even pieces out 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.530
 and that makes all of course there 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.239
 better so right up so that always 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.310
 again all things are middle 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.500
 all of them now so yes they have 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.880
 you wonderfully horny things you can 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.680
 also like to take sweet potato 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.020
 Now we come back to spice it up 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.980
 is quite simple is the cayenne pepper 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.980
 yes, just have a need now 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.390
 just wanted the stuff 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:12.510
 July can be too much then the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:22.919
 paprika curry also very hot spice 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:26.780
 chili curry at the start and another one 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.430
 little chili if it wants hot or 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.290
 if it's a bit sharper wolf 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.300
 yes, not necessarily die now 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.389
 is always good for the metabolism will 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.770
 Stimulated is always in motion helps 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.960
 again with the fat burning 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.940
 even if no things turmeric helps with 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.650
 the digestion sometimes again 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.310
 separate video is also a very 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.850
 Horny is what you always take to it 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.789
 that's what the whole thing looks like now yes 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.960
 Unfortunately, I have no keys to that 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.550
 to hurl properly 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.120
 it 's all a bit with me 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.919
 improvised 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.479
 Cuba just as well as cool now 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.250
 already look and they are not even 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.020
 finished yes I can warmly 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.440
 recommend 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.850
 try it out i put the colleague 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.210
 now here on the baking sheet 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.919
 I have two sheets I do not know that 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.270
 I wanted to see how I as drauflegt 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.940
 That's why I'm just taking a break 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.440
 and so on, guys 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.930
 lig on the carpet draws this time 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.940
 In short I hope you can see how 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.669
 cool the things look yes they see yes 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.840
 already perverse wedge taste of them 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:45.240
 also is good so I'll show you already 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:47.250
 other player it looks like that 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.490
 about 15 minutes I have now too 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.900

 I was also in the pot to the 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.030
 kidney beans if you so if you 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.470
 the whole thing is too monotonous for you 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.479
 Potato budget you are already cool 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.150
 Enough yes, but if you all the too 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.690
 Monotone is you a pan 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.000
 to take 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.289
 You can mushrooms with the sydney soil 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.520
 a bit passed tomatoes 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.289
 spices maybe together in the 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.300
 pan-fry then you have namely 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.580
 still has a hot side dishes 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.990
 I'll just say yes, we'll see 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.099
 again when the dinger finish 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.870
 and so on it goes on 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.139
 Comrades are done I want to go now 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.139

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.160
 there is already so cool you are still on 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.539
 steam 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.490
 yes so in the end it is indeed 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.490
 already finished it is no no big one 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.710
 action they therefore were the children 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:51.330
 Forget the first place 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:51.330
 Later that's the good things 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.319
 Take a look at this hot mountain 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:08.949
 Potatoes with potatoes or waging 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:16.270
 Whatever says yes then as I said 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:19.569
 as needed a little bit looks like that 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:26.639
