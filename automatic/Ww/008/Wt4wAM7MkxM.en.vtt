means that every three levels the user

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.310 
means that every three levels the user
will<00:01:03.359> receive<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.750> diamond<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.330> forty<00:01:06.330> cents

default one and this one of right on

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.860 
default one and this one of right on
give<00:04:09.620> up<00:04:09.800> on<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.700> basically<00:04:11.120> this<00:04:11.420> is<00:04:11.480> one<00:04:11.720> is

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
give up on so basically this is one is

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.740 
give up on so basically this is one is
the<00:04:11.990> most<00:04:12.170> important<00:04:12.830> then<00:04:13.550> comes<00:04:13.850> this<00:04:14.060> then

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
the most important then comes this then

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.650 
the most important then comes this then
comes<00:04:15.050> these<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.710> comes<00:04:15.890> default<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:18.019> um

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
comes these and it comes default so um

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.680 
comes these and it comes default so um
let's<00:04:20.660> see<00:04:21.019> I've<00:04:21.230> set<00:04:21.590> fixed<00:04:21.950> levels<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:23.150> level

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
let's see I've set fixed levels to level

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.550 
let's see I've set fixed levels to level
two<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:23.900> should<00:04:24.530> get<00:04:24.740> five<00:04:25.730> glow<00:04:26.120> soon<00:04:26.560> let's

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
two I should get five glow soon let's

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.500 
two I should get five glow soon let's
see<00:04:27.770> how<00:04:27.890> far<00:04:28.160> away<00:04:28.340> from<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.700> level<00:04:28.970> up<00:04:29.210> IM

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
see how far away from the level up IM

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.540 
see how far away from the level up IM
I'm<00:04:29.770> about<00:04:30.770> fifty<00:04:31.310> percent<00:04:31.340> now<00:04:33.460> what<00:04:34.460> about

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
I'm about fifty percent now what about

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.810 
I'm about fifty percent now what about
now<00:04:35.170> alright<00:04:36.170> so<00:04:36.500> my<00:04:36.620> bars<00:04:36.860> almost<00:04:37.340> fool<00:04:37.580> um

now alright so my bars almost fool um
yep<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.020> level<00:04:39.320> up<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.740> got<00:04:39.890> five

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
yep and I level up and I got five

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.780 
yep and I level up and I got five
glowstone<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:41.030> ten<00:04:41.930> monies<00:04:42.890> which<00:04:43.190> i<00:04:43.400> got

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
glowstone and ten monies which i got

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.830 
glowstone and ten monies which i got
from<00:04:43.820> here<00:04:45.730> let's<00:04:46.730> see<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.180> level<00:04:47.540> three<00:04:47.810> I

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
from here let's see a level three I

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.310 
from here let's see a level three I
should<00:04:48.200> get<00:04:48.380> one<00:04:48.410> diamond<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.250> forty<00:04:49.669> cents

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
should get one diamond a forty cents

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.690 
should get one diamond a forty cents
let's<00:04:51.320> just<00:04:51.410> quickly<00:04:51.680> break<00:04:52.280> some<00:04:52.460> blocks

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
let's just quickly break some blocks

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.890 
let's just quickly break some blocks
here<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:55.220> there<00:04:55.550> we<00:04:55.669> go<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:56.090> received<00:04:56.630> one

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
here and there we go I received one

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.250 
here and there we go I received one
diamonds<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.620> forty<00:04:58.160> cents<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:59.020> this<00:05:00.020> works

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
diamonds and forty cents and this works

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.990 
diamonds and forty cents and this works
the<00:05:00.440> same<00:05:00.470> for<00:05:00.710> level<00:05:01.070> four<00:05:01.280> wonderful<00:05:01.640> 5

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
the same for level four wonderful 5

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.510 
the same for level four wonderful 5
etcetera<00:05:02.360> cetera<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.530> level<00:05:03.919> six<00:05:04.160> you'll<00:05:04.340> get

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
etcetera cetera and level six you'll get

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.180 
etcetera cetera and level six you'll get
in<00:05:04.669> on<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.910> diamond<00:05:05.200> um<00:05:06.200> so<00:05:06.650> that's<00:05:06.860> what's

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
in on the diamond um so that's what's

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.480 
in on the diamond um so that's what's
new<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.610> this<00:05:07.700> update<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.419> can<00:05:08.630> add<00:05:08.870> these
