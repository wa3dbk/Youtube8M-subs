00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello people and easter so much 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.759
 by the way today a video in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.009
 I show you something and that 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 Games consultant may know of a 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 or other of you who gave earlier 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.240
 it's almost every nintendo at least 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.949
 play any player consultant yes in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.840
 the stop all things were in there nicely 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.199
 with temples and so on and so forth 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.769
 and here are three pieces of zelda the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.810
 forests row 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.309
 I 'll probably too 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.500
 others show me some more 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.500
 others have but now take the forests 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.050
 Things in front of her, you see, too 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 had to do a lot and me 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.800
 I loved those earlier, so my 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.390
 The parents brought them and I was 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.280
 no idea the old one was me 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.030
 came out was already there 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.010
 I think so 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.649
 You can visit the house from when then 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.539
 is the book because I mean somehow 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.600
 promptly because she does not have the game 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.859
 also come from 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.550
 I just do not think so 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.350
 you see it there in 1993 at nintendo of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 europe i did not birth so 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.580
 well as an infant I have there 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.409
 probably not looking in now 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
 but this player consultant gave it to me 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.439
 think it too bad that to the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 There are still games today 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 games consultants but much less often 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 I have the feeling than before 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.140
 and they have just been ethical 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.670
 you have this beautiful link here 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.159
 picture for example had at link to the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 but the content was not 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.729
 always everything in it and take a look 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.530
 that he also ethically or because of that 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.210
 just a book on the game 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.490
 to have again so extra 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.759
 Drawings are in here again 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
 The story somehow summarized 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.140
 I've always thought that was really good and good 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.700
 again these these little things that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.680
 I always signed off 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 or have this here in front of me 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.189
 and then tried that 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.799
 somehow not sign off 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.780
 Traced and here we have the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.350
 the two is too large for the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.079
 camera 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.610
 give the world and I found everything mega 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.899
 awesome at that time and in the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.579
 Of course, always the players 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.119
 Temple declared or 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.590
 here where the action is all the things all 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.780
 and that was actually it 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.270
 unprepossessing 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.040
 of course, but here was this this 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.380
 pages in which have been shown again 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.910
 is where everything is you could earlier 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.000
 always be nice to his hooks turn 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.490
 and all princess zelda at the end there 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.400
 I even have it 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.770
 after all, you can read that waiting school 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.480
 that's just hanging on the wall 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.810
 I have times sun time phase 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.330
 had and yes, I then 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.040
 is imitate eventually tried times 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.530
 Of course, not quite so great 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.019
 maybe but hey come out there too 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.370
 much worse just so good that 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.560
 So left to the past 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.230
 Of course he has one of them here 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.610
 best selders somehow ocarina of time 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.010
 zoom is one of the best for me 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.660
 selders also mega good games consultant 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.200
 and you have to say I need it 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.600
 early yes i needed the weiligmann 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.459
 came out because he has indeed 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.440
 somehow it's still funny here 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.140
 club nintendo austria stand here 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.930
 still all the data in it with 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.250
 competent online oh ya shit and 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.630
 you look a noncommittal 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.030
 price recommendation 24 d mark 80 pfennig 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.750
 think about the paid house euro 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.299
 for such a thing 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.190
 twelve times twelve euros that's the judge 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.380
 not for 12 euro so one 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.260
 player advisor good no idea but 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.810
 also of time was 96, I believe on 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.750
 in any case, the small detail could still 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.000
 do not read than that all the nonsense 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.980
 came out here also found times 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.299
 mega good the picture 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.970
 and here again the items I have 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.980
 also tried to trace it 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.220
 I could not read it as it 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.049
 All the games came she wanted 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.850
 but still play and just here 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.260
 with the self is even if you are reading 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.180
 Do not you know that sometimes? 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.829
 right where exactly you always have to stop 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.780
 You can discover a lot yourself 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.769
 and that's why I often needed 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.359
 as a little child somehow 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.880
 Player consultant at all to grab where 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.650
 I have to go to anything at all 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.160
 to create and achieve the game 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.110
 but I always thought it was very good 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.790
 Of course, I also explored a lot by myself 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.840
 but just the things I have mine 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.150
 also earlier here 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.100
 These temples are taken and the the card 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.230
 simply signed off and yourself 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.330
 somehow so temple also created around me 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.190
 invented world itself and found like 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.410
 always said the pictures totally cool 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.120
 I always used to do that totally 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.040
 fascinated simply to look at the pictures 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.040
 and it was the best because of me 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.110
 discovered the last play that was 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.490
 somehow very special for me because 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.350
 I used to think my god like that 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.570
 that would be cool if you do that 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.010
 could record it in the game and you 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.750
 can look back afterwards 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.710
 I thought that was so good, but it works 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.090
 Of course not and then I have 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.370
 Okuma found out at let's play 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.810
 mass danger scented and that was why 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.790
 that really full of the before the 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.860
 discovery for me then but also 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.740
 this games consultant had a lot 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.900
 have had the description 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.970
 village i found the construction company totally 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.100
 well as a fig somehow i have the as 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.320
 little child always loved always wanted 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.510
 after play and so and here the 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.540
 Of course, for which sculpture is doing well 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.890
 you get something and of course here too 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.930
 could check everything off 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.730
 Did you do all the things my parents did 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.480
 of course everything ticked off all heart 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.010
 parts in it 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.930
 Here, that was for me sometimes completely 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.930
 important though as a little child could 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.510
 you all by heart someday 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.160
 wonderful song board with all of you 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.050
 This is somehow so in the song 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.000
 game 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.280
 wonderful people just gorgeous so and 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.580
 then last but not least majora's 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.290
 mask the player consultant also has 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.450
 a bit suffered since missing the 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.890
 back wall wherever she goes, yes 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.570
 I really do not know it 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.570
 and I have that game too 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.040
 So yes, get the christmas 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.930
 player consultant has really suffered 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.030
 unfortunately there is not so much already 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.500
 left over is therefore I have to 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.390
 I also found Christmas with it 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.560
 totally horny majora's mask ata ii totally 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.400
 many many background stories and 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.870
 interpretations also to the 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.610
 different game and these cards 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.220
 I also think it's always epic here 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.540
 and here on the songs on the edge 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.490
 maybe you can see it there 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.960
 all songs yes and also the 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.120
 player consultant ultimately needs 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.000
 to find all masks 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.229
 in the end, though not all of them 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.050
 wanted to get and then I had 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:20.470
 but everybody wants to get it 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.820
 yes so also this games consultant with 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.150

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.010

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.300
 The bosnier had taken until found 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.290
 also one of my favorite bosses 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.270
 I do not know why either 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.370
 and always keep these horny pictures 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:43.000
 Simply by striking this is easy 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.050
 totally stylish and no idea that needs 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.900

 myself with, of course, a heart here too 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.030
 I have not checked all but share 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.199

 zelda I still fly around here 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.400
 We can write if he still has 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.470
 which broke at home by the player 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.270
 or if you generally like that at all 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.710
 player consultant people that is 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.910

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.500
 is use but I mean 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.360
