so<00:01:59.860> we're<00:02:00.220> backing<00:02:00.580> up<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.820> hard<00:02:01.030> drive<00:02:01.270> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
so we're backing up the hard drive and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.330 
so we're backing up the hard drive and
we're<00:02:01.600> saving<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.020> on<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.229> same<00:02:02.440> partition

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
we're saving it on the same partition

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.030 
we're saving it on the same partition
which<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.210> bad<00:02:04.780> because<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.470> main<00:02:05.800> hard

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
which is bad because it's the main hard

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.530 
which is bad because it's the main hard
drive<00:02:06.100> becomes<00:02:06.550> corrupt<00:02:06.940> then<00:02:07.150> you<00:02:07.270> need<00:02:07.360> your

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
drive becomes corrupt then you need your

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.510 
drive becomes corrupt then you need your
backup<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:08.020> be<00:02:08.140> somewhere<00:02:08.470> else<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:09.369> we're

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
backup to be somewhere else but we're

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.340 
backup to be somewhere else but we're
just<00:02:09.550> going<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.819> fit<00:02:09.970> here<00:02:10.179> in<00:02:10.270> just<00:02:10.450> temporary

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.020 

so<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.410> want<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.890> create<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.160> full<00:02:15.430> backup<00:02:15.819> of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
so you want to create a full backup of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.720 
so you want to create a full backup of
your<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:17.530> full<00:02:17.950> archive<00:02:18.430> back<00:02:18.670> up<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.770> we're

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
your your full archive back up and we're

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.120 
your your full archive back up and we're
going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.970> set<00:02:22.120> our<00:02:22.150> options<00:02:23.110> manual<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:27.070> you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
going to set our options manual so you

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.890 
going to set our options manual so you
have<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> list<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.940> options<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.600> can<00:02:28.630> set

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
have a list of options that you can set

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.420 
have a list of options that you can set
up<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.080> we're<00:02:29.290> going<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> deal<00:02:29.800> with<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.070> couple

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
up but we're going to deal with a couple

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.270 
up but we're going to deal with a couple
options<00:02:30.550> we're<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.239> person<00:02:31.930> level

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
options we're going to person level

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.490 
options we're going to person level
which<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.310> right<00:02:33.610> here<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:35.019> compression

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
which is right here and the compression

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.490 
which is right here and the compression
level<00:02:35.850> controls<00:02:36.850> how<00:02:37.060> much<00:02:37.450> compression<00:02:38.290> is

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
level controls how much compression is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.740 
level controls how much compression is
applied<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.130> backup<00:02:39.360> which<00:02:40.360> actually

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
applied to the backup which actually

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.720 
applied to the backup which actually
save<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.590> lot<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.769> space<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.100> allows<00:02:42.550> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
save you a lot of space and allows you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.660 
save you a lot of space and allows you
to<00:02:42.820> get<00:02:43.000> your<00:02:43.239> backup<00:02:43.630> home<00:02:43.840> for<00:02:44.019> one<00:02:44.200> bit<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
to get your backup home for one bit so

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.740 
to get your backup home for one bit so
what<00:02:45.820> we're<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.420> we're<00:02:46.570> going<00:02:46.690> to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
what we're going to do it we're going to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140 
what we're going to do it we're going to
use<00:02:46.930> maximum<00:02:47.610> compression<00:02:48.610> which<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.000> going

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
use maximum compression which is going

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.530 
use maximum compression which is going
to<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.390> four<00:02:50.319> point<00:02:50.560> six<00:02:50.739> gigabytes<00:02:51.540> that's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
to do a four point six gigabytes that's

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.030 
to do a four point six gigabytes that's
one<00:02:52.660> allows<00:02:52.930> us<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.140> get<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.380> onto<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.769> disk

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
one allows us to get it onto one disk

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.789 
one allows us to get it onto one disk
with<00:02:54.220> one<00:02:54.400> disk<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.790> 4.7<00:02:55.540> database<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.620> once

and<00:03:08.239> we're<00:03:08.569> also<00:03:08.750> going<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.170> look<00:03:09.319> at<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.829> back

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
and we're also going to look at the back

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.149 
and we're also going to look at the back
up<00:03:10.400> via<00:03:10.670> priority<00:03:11.349> but<00:03:12.349> when<00:03:12.500> we<00:03:12.590> set<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.920> part

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
up via priority but when we set the part

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.179 
up via priority but when we set the part
priority<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.269> high<00:03:14.480> this<00:03:15.409> allows<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:16.010> make<00:03:16.159> a

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
priority the high this allows to make a

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.780 
priority the high this allows to make a
backup<00:03:16.459> load<00:03:16.819> back<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:18.650> it'll<00:03:18.859> also<00:03:18.980> make<00:03:19.579> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
backup load back but it'll also make the

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
we're going to do clean install with

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.699 
we're going to do clean install with
program<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.060> that's<00:03:41.239> just<00:03:41.450> notes<00:03:41.840> let<00:03:42.590> you

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
program and that's just notes let you

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.670

know<00:03:42.859> which<00:03:43.099> which<00:03:43.549> back<00:03:43.790> up<00:03:43.970> this<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.329> and<00:03:44.680> so

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
know which which back up this is and so

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.530 
know which which back up this is and so
that<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:45.980> can<00:03:46.129> keep<00:03:46.879> a<00:03:47.030> track<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.269> all<00:03:47.510> your
