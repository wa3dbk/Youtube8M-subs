00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:40.300
 these are just some of the photos that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.520
 they go on and on and on and on 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.610
 different satellites some of the soho and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.070
 some other satellites that point 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.770
 directly to the sun and they are calling 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.100
 the care around the world 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.560
 officially they are errors officially 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 are errors of these satellites and what 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:07.260
 let all see happen for us I 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.260
 in particular I see very strange that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.060
 these errors are seen in such a way 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.600
 give with ways let's say to say what 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.580
 less with appearance of intelligence with 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.840
 appearance of technology that seems to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 something else is there near the sun but 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.750
 you also have to be cautious you have to see 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.100
 Why come these images are 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.260
 images that do speak to us about 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.470
 very large objects 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.930
 that if we let the imagination fly 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.050
 a little we could assure that there 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.850
 objects with intelligent life near the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.400
 sun that are doing something that are 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.240
 official images of the nasa that good 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.270
 have been repeatedly censored or 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.640
 shown as errors I think it is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.380
 intentional the fact that they spread 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.349
 publicly I think that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.550
 some means also spear and 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.430
 something is there 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.100
 I leave this to your discretion and we will be 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.860
 after commenting on different theories 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.530
 that there is about it but I already owed them 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.800
 these pictures and I should talk to them 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.170
 little of this subject that although it can be 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.320
 very vast you can talk many things 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.070
 of this topic for now that cautious and there 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.780
 what to expect to see what else arises or if it is 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.970
 its object repeatedly follow 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.070
 appearing in these photographs or not 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.910
 by now it is known that many of the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.380
 satellites let's say they came out quickly 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.480
 all these types of images are now 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.020
 being more cautious in the exit of 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.880
 information 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.550
 and I think we 'll know soon or 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.330
 we will have more information from astronomers 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.750
 that can tell us if it really is 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.069
 possible these marked errors in the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.989
 which we see what everyone sees 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.299
 for now I wait for you in the next 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.689
 hangout to address this topic and others 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.760
 more with let's say more time 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.219
 and good to also be able to talk with 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 you for now we will also be in 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:27.939
 twitter on the green route and goes the signs 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.939
 practicing until then
