damage<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.009> coming<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.430> should<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.759> how

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
damage is coming so you should be how

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
damage is coming so you should be how
have<00:01:39.240> cool<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.689> saved<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.200> coulombs<00:01:40.650> ready

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
have cool down saved up coulombs ready

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.090 
have cool down saved up coulombs ready
for<00:01:41.100> those<00:01:41.220> heavy<00:01:41.850> damage<00:01:42.920> portions<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
for those heavy damage portions of the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.090 
for those heavy damage portions of the
fight<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:46.110> tank<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:46.920> well

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
fight so I would get a tank on how well

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
fight so I would get a tank on how well
he<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.369> surviving<00:01:47.729> using<00:01:48.119> cooldowns<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
he was surviving using cooldowns and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
he was surviving using cooldowns and
also<00:01:49.560> his<00:01:49.740> threat<00:01:49.950> generation<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> could

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
also his threat generation if you could

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
also his threat generation if you could
hold<00:01:50.970> threat<00:01:51.299> while<00:01:51.600> he<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:51.930> doing<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.380> of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
hold threat while he was doing all of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
hold threat while he was doing all of
his<00:01:52.619> other<00:01:52.710> stuff<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.280> being<00:01:53.729> able<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
his other stuff you know being able to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.179 
his other stuff you know being able to
micromanage<00:01:54.390> cooldowns<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.920> proper

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
micromanage cooldowns and do a proper

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.539 
micromanage cooldowns and do a proper
threat<00:01:56.490> rotation<00:01:56.960> but<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.860> threat<00:01:59.399> is

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
threat rotation but now that threat is

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.130 
threat rotation but now that threat is
basically<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> equation<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.020> don't

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
basically out of the equation you don't

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.340 
basically out of the equation you don't
have<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> worry<00:02:01.619> about<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.399> nice<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.350> now

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
have to worry about it it's nice I now

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.350 
have to worry about it it's nice I now
that<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.790> actually<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that I see now that I actually see the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.760 
that I see now that I actually see the
goal<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:06.899> blizzards<00:02:07.229> doing<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.560> nice

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
goal of what blizzards doing it's nice

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.139 
goal of what blizzards doing it's nice
because<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.849> worry<00:02:09.060> about

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
because now we don't have to worry about

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.809 
because now we don't have to worry about
threat<00:02:09.539> stats<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.410> mean<00:02:10.890> take<00:02:11.640> any

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
threat stats at all I mean take any

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.230 
threat stats at all I mean take any
expertise<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.480> got

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
expertise you got

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.610 
expertise you got
have<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.020> know<00:02:14.050> if<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.290> haven't<00:02:14.500> done<00:02:14.560> it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
have and you know if you haven't done it

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.800 
have and you know if you haven't done it
already<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:15.190> ever<00:02:15.340> forgit<00:02:15.790> any<00:02:16.360> hit<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.720> you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
already you ever forgit any hit if you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.000 
already you ever forgit any hit if you
haven't<00:02:16.990> done<00:02:17.050> already<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.410> give<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.590> forge<00:02:17.830> it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
haven't done already you give a forge it

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.310 
haven't done already you give a forge it
to<00:02:18.160> better<00:02:18.490> survivability<00:02:19.120> stat<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.080> yeah

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
to better survivability stat so yeah

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.930 
to better survivability stat so yeah
survivability<00:02:20.830> stats<00:02:21.250> really<00:02:21.460> took<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.760> dive

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
survivability stats really took a dive

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.230 
survivability stats really took a dive
they<00:02:22.210> really<00:02:22.390> don't<00:02:22.540> mean<00:02:22.630> anything<00:02:22.990> now<00:02:24.240> but

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
they really don't mean anything now but

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.570 
they really don't mean anything now but
it's<00:02:25.390> good<00:02:25.570> because<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.920> ISIS<00:02:27.190> floor<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
it's good because now the ISIS floor I

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.920 
it's good because now the ISIS floor I
meant<00:02:27.820> threat<00:02:28.060> stats<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.510> think<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.750> said

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
meant threat stats I think I said

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.630 
meant threat stats I think I said
survivability<00:02:29.380> sets<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:30.130> stats<00:02:30.430> mean

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
survivability sets that stats mean

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.370 
survivability sets that stats mean
nothing<00:02:30.970> now<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:31.690> good<00:02:31.900> because<00:02:32.050> now<00:02:32.200> we

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
nothing now but it's good because now we

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.970 
nothing now but it's good because now we
get<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> focus<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:34.330> sole<00:02:34.660> purpose<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.410> which

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
get a focus on the sole purpose of which

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.290 
get a focus on the sole purpose of which
we<00:02:36.220> all<00:02:36.460> should<00:02:36.730> have<00:02:36.850> been<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.090> first

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
we all should have been in the first

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.880 
we all should have been in the first
place<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.200> more<00:02:38.440> apparent

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
place but now it's just more apparent

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.440 
place but now it's just more apparent
that<00:02:39.340> we<00:02:39.460> get<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.610> focus<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.000> staying<00:02:40.210> alive

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
that we get to focus on staying alive

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.210 
that we get to focus on staying alive
survivability<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.890> should<00:02:42.100> be<00:02:42.190> a

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
survivability and that should be a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.270 
survivability and that should be a
tank's<00:02:42.550> number<00:02:43.300> one<00:02:43.480> goal<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.930> that's<00:02:44.830> going

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
tank's number one goal and that's going

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.190 
tank's number one goal and that's going
to<00:02:45.370> be<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.670> big<00:02:45.850> factor<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.480> distinguish<00:02:46.990> good

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
to be the big factor to distinguish good

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.110 
to be the big factor to distinguish good
tanks<00:02:47.680> bad<00:02:47.890> tanks<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.670> tank<00:02:48.880> staying

what I just learn from lure you guys a
little<00:02:54.610> lower<00:02:54.970> from<00:02:55.210> tankspot<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.900> don't<00:02:56.050> know

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
little lower from tankspot I don't know

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.100

have you know a good amount of

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.450 
have you know a good amount of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
reduce the amount of damage mitigation

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.310 
reduce the amount of damage mitigation
they<00:03:20.890> have<00:03:21.100> later<00:03:21.850> but<00:03:22.840> what<00:03:23.080> they're<00:03:23.230> going

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
they have later but what they're going

they have later but what they're going
to<00:03:23.380> do<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.740> they're<00:03:23.890> going<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.070> give<00:03:24.610> that<00:03:24.940> give

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
every class a way to make the mitigation

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780 
every class a way to make the mitigation
the<00:03:28.810> same<00:03:29.110> than<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.440> now<00:03:29.680> through<00:03:30.460> some

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the same than it is now through some

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.170 
the same than it is now through some
form<00:03:31.390> of<00:03:31.660> rotation<00:03:32.850> sustainment<00:03:33.850> meaning

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
form of rotation sustainment meaning

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.280 
form of rotation sustainment meaning
that<00:03:34.270> you<00:03:34.390> have<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.660> do<00:03:34.750> your<00:03:34.870> rotation

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
that you have to do your rotation

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.690 
that you have to do your rotation
properly<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.740> probably<00:03:36.100> have<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.280> hit<00:03:36.490> a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
properly you probably have to hit a

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.660 
properly you probably have to hit a
button<00:03:37.540> every<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:38.560> often<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:39.070> bring<00:03:39.550> your

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
button every so often to bring your

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.580 
button every so often to bring your
mitigation<00:03:40.210> your<00:03:40.420> damage<00:03:40.750> reduction<00:03:40.990> back<00:03:41.350> up

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
mitigation your damage reduction back up

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.040 
mitigation your damage reduction back up
to<00:03:42.190> where<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.460> is<00:03:42.520> now<00:03:42.790> but<00:03:43.390> what<00:03:43.870> they're

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
to where it is now but what they're

to where it is now but what they're
going<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.230> do<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.650> basically<00:03:44.860> so<00:03:45.370> right<00:03:45.880> now<00:03:45.910> if

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
damage as you do currently on live so I

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.550 
damage as you do currently on live so I
hope<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.820> explained<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.510> he<00:04:16.989> explained<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.440> a

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
hope I explained that he explained it a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.240 
hope I explained that he explained it a
lot<00:04:17.770> better<00:04:18.040> if<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.400> guys<00:04:18.549> haven't<00:04:18.910> see

his a new PST on tankspot but he

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.570 
his a new PST on tankspot but he
explained<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.620> lot<00:04:24.710> better<00:04:24.980> so<00:04:25.160> basically

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
explained a lot better so basically

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.120 
explained a lot better so basically
mitigations<00:04:26.450> going<00:04:26.720> down<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.950> do<00:04:28.100> a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
mitigations going down but if you do a

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.520 
mitigations going down but if you do a
proper<00:04:28.460> rotation<00:04:28.990> AKA<00:04:29.990> survivability

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
proper rotation AKA survivability

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.810 
proper rotation AKA survivability
rotation<00:04:31.150> you'll<00:04:32.150> be<00:04:32.330> able<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.690> have<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:33.320> same

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
rotation you'll be able to have the same

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.890 
rotation you'll be able to have the same
mitigation<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:35.180> have<00:04:35.330> currently<00:04:35.660> on

set together so nicely so that's

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.610
