00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
now we've got here's here's the wheel

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.299 
now we've got here's here's the wheel
that<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.960> sprocket<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> connects<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
that the sprocket that connects up to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.260 
that the sprocket that connects up to
the<00:00:32.430> engine<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:34.100> right<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:36.120> thing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the engine here right here and one thing

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
the engine here right here and one thing
I<00:00:36.360> had<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.899> cut<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.399> cut<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> chain

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I had to do was cut this cut the chain

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.850 
I had to do was cut this cut the chain
so<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:40.079> would<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.940> would<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.239> no<00:00:42.390> slack

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
so that it would it would have no slack

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.750 
so that it would it would have no slack
so<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.030> pedal<00:00:45.980> using<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so you can you can pedal using this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.319 
so you can you can pedal using this
other<00:00:48.090> chain<00:00:48.539> over<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> when<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.940> run

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
other chain over here so when you run

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.860 
other chain over here so when you run
out<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> gas<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.920> pedal<00:00:53.210> now<00:00:54.210> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
out of gas you can you can pedal now I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.740 
out of gas you can you can pedal now I
did<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.620> did<00:00:56.129> start<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.539> see

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
did I did start at one time just to see

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.729 
did I did start at one time just to see
if<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> would<00:00:58.129> fit<00:00:59.129> what<00:00:59.219> start<00:01:00.590> check<00:01:01.590> this

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
if it would fit what start check this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.299 
if it would fit what start check this
out

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.350 

I<00:01:18.500> push<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.460> gas<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:20.710> push<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.890> gas<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.760> don't
