so<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.109> does<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.369> called<00:00:26.580> sync

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
so what this does is it's called sync

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.910 
so what this does is it's called sync
and<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.240> basically<00:00:27.359> adds<00:00:27.779> four<00:00:28.260> new<00:00:28.410> items<00:00:28.800> who

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and it basically adds four new items who

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.070 
and it basically adds four new items who
put<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> shell<00:00:29.369> constructor<00:00:30.000> we've<00:00:30.570> got<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> sync

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
put a shell constructor we've got a sync

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.979 
put a shell constructor we've got a sync
core<00:00:31.500> we've<00:00:32.160> got<00:00:32.340> shell<00:00:32.610> storage<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.390> we've

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
core we've got shell storage and we've

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.709 
core we've got shell storage and we've
got<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> treadmill<00:00:35.210> basically<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.480> does

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
got a treadmill basically what this does

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.770 
got a treadmill basically what this does
is<00:00:36.930> allows<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.500> create<00:00:38.040> clones<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.969> they

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is allows you to create clones and they

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.330 
is allows you to create clones and they
enable<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> sort<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.710> teleport<00:00:41.129> wherever

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
enable you to sort of teleport wherever

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.270 
enable you to sort of teleport wherever
you<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> world<00:00:42.300> swap<00:00:43.290> bodies<00:00:43.770> which

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you want in the world swap bodies which

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.090 
you want in the world swap bodies which
is<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.610> cool<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.059> basically<00:00:45.570> cheat<00:00:46.170> death<00:00:46.590> now

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
is so cool and basically cheat death now

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490 
is so cool and basically cheat death now
is<00:00:47.340> pretty<00:00:47.670> awesome<00:00:47.879> type<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.600> model<00:00:48.989> so

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
is pretty awesome type of model so

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.779 
is pretty awesome type of model so

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
basically what we're gonna do first of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.360 
basically what we're gonna do first of
all<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.910> we're<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.390> ourselves<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.989> shell

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
all is we're gonna get ourselves a shell

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
all is we're gonna get ourselves a shell
constructor<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.850> gonna<00:00:53.940> place<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.239> right

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
constructor we're gonna place it right

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.810 
constructor we're gonna place it right
here<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:55.890> looks<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.280> curls<00:00:56.610> just

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
here and one looks pretty curls just

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
here and one looks pretty curls just
like<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> glass<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.690> cage<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.100> what<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.550> need

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
like a glass a cage and what we now need

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.209 
like a glass a cage and what we now need
to<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:00.899> basically<00:01:01.219> just

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to do is this will basically just

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.299 
to do is this will basically just
construct<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.239> clawed<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> needs<00:01:05.040> power

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
construct your clawed but it needs power

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
construct your clawed but it needs power
so<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.820> why<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.020> treadmill

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
so that is why we have this treadmill

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.320 
so that is why we have this treadmill
which<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.710> place<00:01:07.950> directly<00:01:08.490> next<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.210> got

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
which we place directly next to it's got

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.000 
which we place directly next to it's got
a<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.600> cool-looking<00:01:09.810> model<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
a really cool-looking model and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
a really cool-looking model and
unfortunately<00:01:11.670> can't<00:01:11.909> power<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> treadmill

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
unfortunately can't power the treadmill

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.620 
unfortunately can't power the treadmill
yourself<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.159> why<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> need<00:01:14.970> either<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
yourself which is why you need either a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.109 
yourself which is why you need either a
pig<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> wolf<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.280> we're<00:01:17.369> gonna<00:01:17.460> spawn<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> pig

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
pig or a wolf so we're gonna spawn a pig

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.310 
pig or a wolf so we're gonna spawn a pig
just<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> need<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> just

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
just like that and then you need to just

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
just like that and then you need to just
get<00:01:19.439> yourself<00:01:19.560> elite<00:01:20.070> right<00:01:20.759> click<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
get yourself elite right click it and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
get yourself elite right click it and
then<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.840> click<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.640> treadmill

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
then right click on the the treadmill

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.609 
then right click on the the treadmill
just<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.170> you'll<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.470> you'll

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
just like that and you'll see you'll

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
just like that and you'll see you'll
start<00:01:25.890> walking<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.700> won't<00:01:26.850> actually

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
start walking but it won't actually

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
start walking but it won't actually
construct<00:01:27.659> anything<00:01:27.900> until<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.710> give<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
construct anything until you give a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
construct anything until you give a
segment<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.670> DNA<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.479> done<00:01:30.780> by

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
segment of your DNA which is done by

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
segment of your DNA which is done by
right<00:01:31.290> clicking<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.610> obviously<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
right clicking and there obviously it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.060 
right clicking and there obviously it
hurts<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.960> prick<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.350> yeah

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
hurts it's a little bit prick but yeah

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.420 
hurts it's a little bit prick but yeah
and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.630> very<00:01:37.439> slowly<00:01:37.680> pixels

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and then you see that very slowly pixels

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.090 
and then you see that very slowly pixels
will<00:01:38.640> start<00:01:38.939> forming<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.259> they

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
will start forming one by one and they

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
will start forming one by one and they
will<00:01:41.400> create<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:42.060> body<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.600> we've<00:01:42.720> got<00:01:42.899> one

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
will create your body so we've got one

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
will create your body so we've got one
here<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> entire<00:01:43.619> process<00:01:44.009> takes<00:01:44.189> about<00:01:44.369> 15

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
here the entire process takes about 15

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
here the entire process takes about 15
minutes<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.299> tall<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.320> we've<00:01:46.470> got

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
minutes in tall but you see we've got

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.350 
minutes in tall but you see we've got
ones<00:01:46.920> aren't<00:01:47.280> different<00:01:47.520> stages<00:01:48.119> right<00:01:48.299> now

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
ones aren't different stages right now

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you can see what the process looks like

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.209 
you can see what the process looks like
the<00:02:04.140> first<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.469> all<00:02:04.560> we're<00:02:04.649> gonna<00:02:04.740> stare<00:02:05.040> this

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
I've noticed that this is fixed if you

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.940 
I've noticed that this is fixed if you
just<00:02:09.390> solve<00:02:09.509> walked<00:02:09.810> very<00:02:09.989> near<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:10.800> yet

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
just solve walked very near it but yet

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
so you see that all pixels are just

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.330 
so you see that all pixels are just
about<00:02:28.670> done<00:02:28.960> wait<00:02:29.960> for<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:30.860> looking<00:02:31.220> at
