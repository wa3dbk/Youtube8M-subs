00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.319
 the president dilma rousseff gave a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.839
 explanation for the tax increase 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.719
 about imported cars announced this 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.820
 month, the goal is to keep the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 jobs of Brazilians some models 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.859
 have already risen in price, Brazil is one of the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.109
 countries where cars are more expensive 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.840
 even the vehicles manufactured here are 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.310
 sold at a lower price abroad 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 Antonio is interested here in this 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 car while coast 27 thousand 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 and did you know that a car just like 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.009
 The one in manufacturing in Brazil walks two thousand 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.230
 miles of ship truck and arrives 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.059
 the cheapest Argentina here not 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 I do not even know what you think of this is a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.660
 absurd this is our correspondent 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 jacques gomes son went to a 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.399
 dealership in buenos aires check 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 that's right here in Argentina the same 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.280
 car cost the equivalent of 19 thousand 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.760
 actual or 30% cheaper and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.590
 sellers here risks an explanation 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.539
 never tangos and pure water from the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.000
 increases according to oscar 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.489
 the Argentines would not get used to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.799
 moments and raising the price would 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.229
 the purchase of cars but their 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.450
 influences at the time of purchase the jump of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.950
 Around SÃ£o Paulo we ask anfavea 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.900
 which represents the manufacturers of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.580
 vehicles because the most expensive car in the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.430
 Brazil anfavea did not want to record 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.689
 interview but sent a note 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.700
 responsible for cost Brazil and the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.920
 imposed the Brazilian cost that that value 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 paid for both energy for transportation 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.130
 for labor costs 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.439
 this does not make sense since the car 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.240
 sold in argentina was manufactured here 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.250
 In Brazil, how do we see a lawyer? 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 to try to understand the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.090
 difference in taxes 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.850
 nelson lacerda explains that the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 taxes in Brazil reaches 40% in price 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 of the car but when the vehicle will be 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 sold outside the automakers receive 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.210
 abatement of these taxes and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.310
 earn credits to use here in the country 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.500
 so they can sell cheaper on the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.110
 Argentina is interesting for industries 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.390
 including the doors and no penny 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.119
 because she has credit of ipi credit 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.430
 That she's going to the good Brazilian. 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.409
 charge 40% and keep the money 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.509
 we then asked him to do the math 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.629
 what is the price of the car without taxes 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.030
 in the two countries and came another surprise 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.640
 in Brazil that car that was bought 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.220
 for 27 thousand reais 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.950
 costs $ 16,000 without taxes on 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.800
 Argentina costs 13 thousand as the same 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.050
 car paid freight and still remained 3 thousand 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.090
 cheaper this consultant of your 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.550
 opinion we have some 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.370
 international studies showing that the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.110
 profit margin in Brazil is also higher 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.390
 than in other countries 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.720
 the tax is more expensive but the margin of 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.720
 profit as well
