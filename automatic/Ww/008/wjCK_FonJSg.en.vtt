00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.619
 animation ie we are we are 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.140
 an animation studio and he said good 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.420
 I'm a scriptwriter I knew him as 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.219
 novelist and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.739
 and I really want to write a 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.390
 script for animation and the present of 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.609
 book choose good I know that you have 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.640
 your novels but I would like to do 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:50.960
 this book and Federico read it and it was uploaded 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.940
 to the project and he did it and we were 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 working just thinking about doing 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.320
 a script how are we going to make the movie 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.500
 then then we concentrate a lot 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.299
 in having an adaptation here although we 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.850
 the follower will like what transforms 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.340
 a work tool and this and it 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.420
 I showed it to Julia before going to the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.030
 german 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.039
 Julian Goyoaga and German Tejeira who are 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.509
 two friends who came from the school of 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.130
 cinema with which I had contacted 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.500
 to do the direction of adapting your 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.380
 short films and so on through links 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.880
 friendship and wanting to do things this one 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.030
 He is thrilled with the project also 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.600
 and they decided to start producing has 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.810
 this feature is not his name are 3 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.670
 Triple palindromes capiculate as good 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.039
 River Plate I think the triple capicÃºa 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 is going to ensure life this luck in 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.280
 life forever 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.200
 there is much more than one and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.580
 yet this name them 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.799
 generates problems at school because 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.590
 his classmates make fun of her because 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.450
 they are funny and funny names and it has 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.390
 like this conflict this double conflict 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.710
 do not come in who loves your name and hates it 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.360
 it has to do a little with herself 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.259
 I say what defines it generates 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.070
 many problems and good finally to 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.140
 nin makes set his patience is fulfilled and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.319
 ends up fighting with a companion of 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.270
 class and from there the director of 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.950
 The school will he puts them both one 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.350
 sanction that is a sealed envelope that does not 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.360
