00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
sorts of things and then all this other

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
sorts of things and then all this other
music<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.390> remember<00:01:28.049> from<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> childhood

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
music that I remember from the childhood

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.300 
music that I remember from the childhood
came<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.290> now<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.070> quite

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
came back and and so now it's quite

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.280 
came back and and so now it's quite
strange<00:01:32.640> even<00:01:33.119> though<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.630> these<00:01:33.869> great

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
strange even though all these great

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.550 
strange even though all these great
songs<00:01:34.650> are<00:01:34.890> from<00:01:35.659> American<00:01:36.659> artists<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.229> still

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
songs are from American artists I still

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
songs are from American artists I still
associate<00:01:38.070> them<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.369> being<00:01:38.579> young<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
associate them as being young in

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
associate them as being young in
Manchester<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:40.950> my<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
Manchester so that's my kind of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
Manchester so that's my kind of
connection

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.249 

I<00:01:58.340> think<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> whole<00:01:59.759> Robbie<00:02:00.509> Williams<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I think the whole Robbie Williams and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.320 
I think the whole Robbie Williams and
Michael<00:02:01.650> bublé's<00:02:02.070> sort<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.580> bringing<00:02:03.180> back

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
Michael bublé's sort of bringing back

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.820 
Michael bublé's sort of bringing back
the<00:02:03.570> swing<00:02:03.840> thing<00:02:04.049> has<00:02:04.200> been<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.470> has<00:02:04.590> been

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
the swing thing has been it has been

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.550 
the swing thing has been it has been
it's<00:02:05.130> been<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.460> great<00:02:05.700> thing<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:05.970> us<00:02:06.299> because

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's been a great thing for us because

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.510 
it's been a great thing for us because
people<00:02:07.560> come<00:02:07.740> along<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.009> they'll<00:02:08.280> they'll

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
people come along and they'll they'll

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
say off play Mack the Knife not because

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.260

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.690 
things and so and I think with this kind
of<00:02:21.000> music<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.480> does<00:02:21.800> keep<00:02:22.800> coming<00:02:23.190> around<00:02:23.370> so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
of music it does keep coming around so

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.930 
of music it does keep coming around so
every<00:02:24.030> 10-15<00:02:24.930> years<00:02:25.260> you'll<00:02:25.769> get<00:02:25.980> Rod<00:02:26.550> Stewart

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
every 10-15 years you'll get Rod Stewart

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.610 
every 10-15 years you'll get Rod Stewart
bringing<00:02:27.269> out<00:02:27.390> another<00:02:27.420> album<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> swings

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620

it's<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.319> popular<00:02:31.560> genre<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:33.090> cover<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.470> I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
it's a popular genre to cover and so I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.110 
it's a popular genre to cover and so I
