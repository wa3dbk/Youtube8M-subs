process<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.020> complete<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.860> need<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
process is complete we need to do a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.859 
process is complete we need to do a
second<00:01:36.659> flash<00:01:37.610> otherwise<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.210> bike<00:01:39.450> won't

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
second flash otherwise the bike won't

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.609 
second flash otherwise the bike won't
start<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.540> this<00:01:42.540> first<00:01:42.869> flash<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
start because this this first flash is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.179 
start because this this first flash is
just<00:01:44.130> preparing<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> ECU<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.649> used<00:01:46.920> with

this will take

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.740 
this will take
and<00:01:55.280> then<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.580> also

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.940 

now<00:04:34.420> this<00:04:35.420> is<00:04:35.570> connected<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.230> ECU<00:04:36.530> again

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
now this is connected to the ECU again

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.250 
now this is connected to the ECU again
let's<00:04:37.820> read<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.330> serial<00:04:38.720> number<00:04:39.020> from<00:04:39.170> the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
let's read the serial number from the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.850 
let's read the serial number from the
ECU

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
ECU

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.400 
ECU
and<00:04:40.480> it's<00:04:41.480> asking<00:04:41.690> me<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.170> generate<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.560> key<00:04:42.970> my

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
and it's asking me to generate a key my

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.430 
and it's asking me to generate a key my
ID<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.830> password<00:04:46.220> have<00:04:46.550> already<00:04:46.820> been<00:04:47.000> into

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
ID and password have already been into

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.270 
ID and password have already been into
so<00:04:48.490> I'll<00:04:49.490> just<00:04:49.670> generate<00:04:50.920> pops<00:04:51.920> up<00:04:52.130> with<00:04:52.250> a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
so I'll just generate pops up with a

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.940 
so I'll just generate pops up with a
number<00:04:52.580> they're<00:04:52.760> telling<00:04:53.330> me<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.950> serial

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
number they're telling me the serial

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.160 
number they're telling me the serial
number<00:04:54.980> that's<00:04:55.370> been<00:04:55.580> created<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.960> should

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
number that's been created you should

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.310 
number that's been created you should
write<00:04:57.410> this<00:04:57.590> down<00:04:58.960> click<00:04:59.960> OK<00:05:00.520> at<00:05:01.520> this<00:05:01.640> point

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
write this down click OK at this point

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:11.440 
write this down click OK at this point
exit<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.410> program<00:05:05.200> stop<00:05:06.200> program<00:05:06.860> again

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.850 

now<00:05:12.020> we<00:05:12.080> want<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.620> select<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.100> churn<00:05:14.860> again

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
now we want to select the churn again

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.830 
now we want to select the churn again
I'm<00:05:16.070> going<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.370> select<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:17.000> toilet<00:05:17.450> for<00:05:17.660> eight

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
I'm going to select the toilet for eight

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.950 
I'm going to select the toilet for eight
seven<00:05:18.140> check<00:05:19.690> open<00:05:21.820> now<00:05:22.820> we<00:05:22.880> have<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.540> option

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
seven check open now we have the option

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.700 
seven check open now we have the option
to<00:05:24.170> either<00:05:24.620> apply<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.250> trim<00:05:25.730> table<00:05:26.270> or<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.380> flash

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
to either apply a trim table or to flash

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.660 
to either apply a trim table or to flash
the<00:05:28.070> map<00:05:28.250> into<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.580> ECU<00:05:30.070> actually<00:05:31.070> flash<00:05:31.400> map

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
the map into the ECU actually flash map

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.540 
the map into the ECU actually flash map
into<00:05:31.940> ECU

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
into ECU

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.110 
into ECU
this<00:05:34.550> again<00:05:34.880> will<00:05:35.210> raise<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.780> flash<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:37.790> then

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
this again will raise the flash and then

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:48.110 
this again will raise the flash and then
start<00:05:38.480> the<00:05:38.780> flash<00:05:39.200> process

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.629 

once<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:49.020> second<00:05:49.530> flash<00:05:50.340> has<00:05:51.330> completed<00:05:52.639> the

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
once the second flash has completed the

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.670 
once the second flash has completed the
bike<00:05:53.820> can<00:05:54.030> be<00:05:54.090> started<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:55.260> can<00:05:55.410> start

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
bike can be started and you can start

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.960 
bike can be started and you can start
using<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.280> jimboy<00:05:57.150> trim<00:05:57.419> software
