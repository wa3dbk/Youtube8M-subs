00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.080 

this<00:00:01.560> question<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:01.979> about<00:00:02.070> token<00:00:02.550> ring<00:00:02.730> they

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
this question is about token ring they

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.910 
this question is about token ring they
are<00:00:03.120> talking<00:00:03.360> about<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.750> early<00:00:04.470> token<00:00:04.799> tree

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
are talking about a early token tree

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.099 
are talking about a early token tree
insertion<00:00:05.370> so<00:00:05.970> in<00:00:06.089> elite<00:00:06.330> organization<00:00:06.930> what

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
insertion so in elite organization what

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.140 
insertion so in elite organization what
happens<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:08.160> release<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.639> data<00:00:08.820> and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
happens is we release the data and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
happens is we release the data and
immediately<00:00:09.929> we<00:00:10.080> leave<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> token<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.040> data

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
immediately we leave the token so data

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.400 
immediately we leave the token so data
will<00:00:11.519> be<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:12.090> followed<00:00:12.750> by<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> token

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
will be going on followed by the token

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560 
will be going on followed by the token
so<00:00:13.980> they<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.190> saying<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.880> early<00:00:15.240> token

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
so they are saying that in early token

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.630 
so they are saying that in early token
tree<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.809> session<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.500> station<00:00:17.039> releases<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
tree in session this station releases a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.570 
tree in session this station releases a
token<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.300> soon<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.439> completes<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> frame

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
token as soon as it completes the frame

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.300 
token as soon as it completes the frame
transmission<00:00:21.420> which<00:00:21.750> means<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.650> finish<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
transmission which means we finish the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.040 
transmission which means we finish the
frame<00:00:23.550> transmission<00:00:23.970> immediately<00:00:24.960> we

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
frame transmission immediately we

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.830 
frame transmission immediately we
release<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> token<00:00:25.800> whether<00:00:26.670> or<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
release the token whether or not the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200 
release the token whether or not the
frame<00:00:28.260> header<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.949> written<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.699> station

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
frame header has written to this station

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.020 
frame header has written to this station
which<00:00:30.510> means<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.920> transmit<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> frame

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
which means we just transmit the frame

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.910 
which means we just transmit the frame
and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.690> immediately<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.200> transmit<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and then immediately we transmit the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 
and then immediately we transmit the
token<00:00:35.340> without<00:00:35.790> thinking<00:00:36.300> whether<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.260> frame

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
token without thinking whether the frame

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.799 
token without thinking whether the frame
header<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.190> released<00:00:38.520> come<00:00:38.850> back<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.450> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
header has released come back or not so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.319 
header has released come back or not so
the<00:00:39.930> problem<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:41.070> case<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> delayed<00:00:41.940> token

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the problem is in case of delayed token

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.690 
the problem is in case of delayed token
rain<00:00:42.510> session<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.350> send<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.800> data<00:00:44.040> packet<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
rain session we send a data packet and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
rain session we send a data packet and
when<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> data<00:00:45.510> packet<00:00:45.899> comes<00:00:46.140> back<00:00:46.440> whatever

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
when the data packet comes back whatever

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
when the data packet comes back whatever
is<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> priority<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> data<00:00:48.539> packet<00:00:49.050> or

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
is the priority on the data packet or

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.319 
is the priority on the data packet or
whatever<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:49.980> reservation<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> data

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
whatever is reservation on the data

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.750 
whatever is reservation on the data
packet<00:00:51.809> will<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.620> become<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.190> priority<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
packet will now become the priority of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.819 
packet will now become the priority of
the<00:00:53.879> token<00:00:54.270> therefore<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.140> advantage<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the token therefore the advantage of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.310 
the token therefore the advantage of
waiting<00:00:56.280> until<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.180> data<00:00:57.360> packet<00:00:57.809> comes<00:00:58.079> back

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
waiting until the data packet comes back

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
waiting until the data packet comes back
is<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.030> entire<00:01:00.390> ring<00:01:00.690> who<00:01:01.020> has

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
is we can see in the entire ring who has

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100 
is we can see in the entire ring who has
reserved<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> token<00:01:02.609> depending<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.629> which<00:01:03.840> we

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
reserved the token depending on which we

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.840 
reserved the token depending on which we
can<00:01:04.229> increase<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.710> priority<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> token

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
can increase the priority of the token

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390 
can increase the priority of the token
to<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.119> reservation<00:01:06.510> field<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to that reservation field but because of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.190 
to that reservation field but because of
this<00:01:08.520> early<00:01:08.850> token<00:01:09.180> reinsertion<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.140> not

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
this early token reinsertion we do not

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
this early token reinsertion we do not
have<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> strategy<00:01:10.950> which<00:01:11.400> means<00:01:11.640> serious

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
have that strategy which means serious

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.960 
have that strategy which means serious
what<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> mean<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> say<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.460> many

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
what I mean to say is if you have many

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
what I mean to say is if you have many
stations<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.950> if<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.310> four

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
stations like this if you have four

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.340 
stations like this if you have four
stations<00:01:18.770> now<00:01:19.770> assume<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.570> station<00:01:22.080> 1

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
stations now assume that this station 1

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.190 
stations now assume that this station 1
when<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> priorities<00:01:24.210> 1<00:01:24.509> 2<00:01:24.689> 3<00:01:24.869> 4

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
when these are the priorities 1 2 3 4

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
when these are the priorities 1 2 3 4
then<00:01:26.750> let<00:01:27.750> us<00:01:27.780> say<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.710> station<00:01:29.220> 1<00:01:29.430> has<00:01:29.670> sent

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
then let us say this station 1 has sent

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.539 
then let us say this station 1 has sent
out<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> data<00:01:30.509> packet<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.200> by<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
out the data packet and by the time the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.880 
out the data packet and by the time the
data<00:01:32.759> packet<00:01:33.210> comes<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.650> data

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
data packet comes back if the data

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.390 
data packet comes back if the data
packet<00:01:35.460> has<00:01:35.850> come<00:01:36.689> back<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.799> reservation

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
packet has come back with a reservation

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.600 
packet has come back with a reservation
on<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.210> 4<00:01:39.630> which<00:01:40.049> means<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.530> station<00:01:41.369> with

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
on that as 4 which means a station with

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
on that as 4 which means a station with
priority<00:01:42.090> 4<00:01:42.360> wants<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> token<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
priority 4 wants the token then now the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670 
priority 4 wants the token then now the
station<00:01:44.970> 1<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> releases<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.140> token<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
station 1 when it releases the token it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560 
station 1 when it releases the token it
will<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> priority<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.060> token<00:01:48.420> 2

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
will make the priority of the token 2

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
will make the priority of the token 2
before<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.320> will<00:01:49.439> release<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.189> so

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
before and it will release it right so

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.609 
before and it will release it right so
that<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.149> how<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> priority<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.020> implemented

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that is how the priority is implemented

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
that is how the priority is implemented
but<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> problem<00:01:53.729> with<00:01:53.850> early<00:01:54.030> token<00:01:54.450> rain

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
but the problem with early token rain

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
but the problem with early token rain
session<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.470> should<00:01:55.680> release<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> data

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
session is you should release the data

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459 
session is you should release the data
and<00:01:56.729> immediately<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> release<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.869> ok<00:01:58.170> then

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and immediately to release it ok then

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.100 
and immediately to release it ok then
you<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:59.040> who<00:01:59.850> wants<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> token<00:02:00.750> next

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you don't know who wants the token next

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.660 
you don't know who wants the token next
then<00:02:01.500> how<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> solve<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
then how are you going to solve this

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.940 
then how are you going to solve this
problem<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.840> asking<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
problem that is what they are asking so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.069 
problem that is what they are asking so
then<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.670> asking<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.240> whether<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:06.930> not

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
then they are asking that whether or not

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.960 
then they are asking that whether or not
the<00:02:07.290> frame<00:02:07.740> header<00:02:08.039> has<00:02:08.280> returned<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the frame header has returned to the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.150 
the frame header has returned to the
station<00:02:09.270> which<00:02:09.690> means<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.379> are<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.739> worrying

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
station which means we are not worrying

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.620 
station which means we are not worrying
whether<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> frame<00:02:11.849> header<00:02:12.120> has

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
whether the frame header has

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.750 
whether the frame header has
to<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> returned<00:02:13.380> back<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.860> station<00:02:14.100> in

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
to the returned back to the station in

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.240 
to the returned back to the station in
case<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.420> frame<00:02:15.690> header<00:02:15.930> has<00:02:16.200> returned<00:02:16.650> we

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
case if the frame header has returned we

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.210 
case if the frame header has returned we
have<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> opportunity<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.270> look<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
have a opportunity to look at the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.290 
have a opportunity to look at the
reservation<00:02:20.220> field<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> header<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.270> we

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
reservation field of the header and we

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300 
reservation field of the header and we
can<00:02:21.900> decide<00:02:22.260> what<00:02:22.500> should<00:02:22.650> be<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.860> priority

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
can decide what should be the priority

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.430 
can decide what should be the priority
of<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.580> day<00:02:23.820> or<00:02:24.060> token<00:02:24.450> next<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:24.990> then<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.290> do

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
of this day or token next but then we do

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.100 
of this day or token next but then we do
not<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.830> chance<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.400> right<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.510> what

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
not have that chance now right then what

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.050 
not have that chance now right then what
will<00:02:28.350> be<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.710> priority<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.610> token

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
will be the priority of the token

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.880 
will be the priority of the token
released<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:30.750> they<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.020> asking<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.650> this

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
released then they are asking in this

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.980 
released then they are asking in this
case<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:32.880> should<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.300> priority<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
case what should be the priority of the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.770 
case what should be the priority of the
token<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.770> going<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.070> be<00:02:35.160> reduced<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.780> the

token that is going to be reduced a the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.810 
token that is going to be reduced a the

please set the knot token tokens party

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.200 
please set the knot token tokens party
to<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:49.620> if<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.250> every<00:02:51.180> time

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
to be that but if you do that every time

to be that but if you do that every time
the<00:02:51.600> token<00:02:51.990> is<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.770> priority

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the token is going to get the priority

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.460 
the token is going to get the priority
of<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.430> station<00:02:53.940> which<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.360> crossed<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.350> is

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
of the station which it crossed so it is

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.180 
of the station which it crossed so it is
not<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.830> answer

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
not the answer

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.090 
not the answer
now<00:02:56.880> what<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.630> answer<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.080> how<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.770> solve

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
now what is the answer is how to solve

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.880 
now what is the answer is how to solve
it<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.490> before<00:03:00.480> when<00:03:01.020> you<00:03:01.140> are<00:03:01.230> releasing<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
it is before when you are releasing the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.000 
it is before when you are releasing the
token<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:03.450> do<00:03:03.660> not<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.110> choice<00:03:04.380> or<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
token you do not have the choice or you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.670 
token you do not have the choice or you
do<00:03:05.190> not<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.550> opportunity<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:07.080> see<00:03:07.410> what

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
do not have the opportunity to see what

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.460 
do not have the opportunity to see what
is<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.610> reservation<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.720> data<00:03:09.960> packet

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
is the reservation on the data packet

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.620 
is the reservation on the data packet
you<00:03:10.620> released<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.450> could

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
you released but then you could

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.110 
you released but then you could
definitely<00:03:12.840> see<00:03:13.470> what<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.640> reservation

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
definitely see what is the reservation

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.900 
definitely see what is the reservation
on<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.600> data<00:03:15.840> packet<00:03:16.380> which<00:03:16.860> someone<00:03:17.730> else

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
on the data packet which someone else

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.330 
on the data packet which someone else
has<00:03:18.180> sent<00:03:18.540> before<00:03:18.780> which<00:03:19.620> means<00:03:19.800> before

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
has sent before which means before

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.460 
has sent before which means before
sending<00:03:20.640> your<00:03:20.820> data<00:03:21.080> someone<00:03:22.080> else<00:03:22.260> have

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
sending your data someone else have

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.130 
sending your data someone else have
circulated<00:03:22.830> some<00:03:23.190> data<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.660> data<00:03:24.930> you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
circulated some data on the data you

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.740 
circulated some data on the data you
might<00:03:25.320> have<00:03:25.530> seen<00:03:25.800> what<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.760> reservation<00:03:27.600> is

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
might have seen what the reservation is

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.890 
might have seen what the reservation is
therefore<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.920> previous<00:03:29.430> cycle<00:03:29.900> whatever

therefore in the previous cycle whatever

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.650 
therefore in the previous cycle whatever
is<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.350> our<00:03:31.640> reservation<00:03:32.640> made<00:03:33.090> by<00:03:33.390> some

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
is the our reservation made by some

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.290 
is the our reservation made by some

which means look at this option the
priority<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.490> reservation<00:03:41.910> field<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.600> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
priority in the reservation field of the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.830 
priority in the reservation field of the
most<00:03:43.350> recently<00:03:44.250> received<00:03:44.820> frame<00:03:45.150> which<00:03:45.600> means

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
most recently received frame which means

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.260 
most recently received frame which means
whatever<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.100> priority<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.910> is

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
whatever is the priority that is

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.930 
whatever is the priority that is
reserved<00:03:48.690> by<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.900> lost<00:03:49.800> recently<00:03:50.670> seen

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
reserved by the lost recently seen

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.180 
reserved by the lost recently seen
packet<00:03:51.420> most<00:03:51.810> recently<00:03:52.260> seen<00:03:52.530> packet<00:03:52.920> which

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
packet most recently seen packet which

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.300 
packet most recently seen packet which
means<00:03:53.430> he<00:03:54.330> don't<00:03:54.720> follow<00:03:55.050> your<00:03:55.320> data<00:03:55.709> because

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
means he don't follow your data because

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.190 
means he don't follow your data because
your<00:03:56.459> data<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.910> obviously<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.600> going<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.959> come

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
your data is obviously not going to come

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.050 
your data is obviously not going to come
back<00:03:58.230> by<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.920> time<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.310> release<00:03:59.550> it<00:03:59.580> okay

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
back by the time you release it okay

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.540 
back by the time you release it okay
therefore<00:04:00.930> previously<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:01.950> might<00:04:02.130> have<00:04:02.340> seen

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
therefore previously you might have seen

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.520 
therefore previously you might have seen
some<00:04:02.850> data<00:04:03.090> which<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.510> going<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.840> take<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.110> long

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
some data which is going to take a long

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.530 
some data which is going to take a long
ride<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.010> now<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.520> are<00:04:05.640> going<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.120> use<00:04:06.360> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
ride and now you are going to use the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.110 
ride and now you are going to use the
parity<00:04:07.050> of<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.170> previous<00:04:07.800> data<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.820> this

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
parity of the previous data in this

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.660 
parity of the previous data in this
packet<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.650> priority<00:04:11.340> in<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
packet so the priority in the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.480 
packet so the priority in the
reservation<00:04:12.600> field<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.530> most<00:04:13.830> recently

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
reservation field of the most recently

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.160 
reservation field of the most recently
received<00:04:14.880> frame<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.360> going<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.750> be<00:04:15.870> priority

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
received frame is going to be priority

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.740 
received frame is going to be priority
for<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.739> next<00:04:17.220> token<00:04:17.609> right<00:04:17.970> this<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
for the next token right this is the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.150 
for the next token right this is the
answer<00:04:19.790> so<00:04:20.790> what<00:04:21.000> about<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.800> delay<00:04:22.800> token

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
answer so what about the delay token

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.360 
answer so what about the delay token
reinsertion<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
reinsertion in the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.060 
reinsertion in the
the<00:04:24.460> priority<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.440> data<00:04:26.440> packet<00:04:26.889> which

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
the priority of the data packet which

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.680 
the priority of the data packet which
you<00:04:27.220> have<00:04:27.400> sent<00:04:27.669> is<00:04:27.850> going<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.479> be<00:04:28.630> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
you have sent is going to be the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.699 
you have sent is going to be the
priority<00:04:28.960> next<00:04:29.410> right<00:04:29.699> okay
