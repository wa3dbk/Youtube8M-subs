want to talk to you a little bit of a
public<00:00:17.590> system<00:00:18.660> when<00:00:19.660> we're<00:00:19.779> talking<00:00:19.930> about

this<00:00:20.410> bottle<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.670> hoses<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:22.869> a<00:00:23.020> small<00:00:23.410> little

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
this bottle the hoses and a small little

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.029 
this bottle the hoses and a small little
pump<00:00:23.920> right<00:00:24.400> here<00:00:24.640> it's<00:00:25.480> on<00:00:25.600> the<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.750> side<00:00:26.230> right

pump right here it's on the a side right
by<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.280> proportioning<00:00:27.910> pump<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:29.710> the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
by the proportioning pump this is the

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.290 
by the proportioning pump this is the
most<00:00:29.980> important<00:00:30.610> piece<00:00:30.730> of<00:00:30.789> maintenance<00:00:31.119> that
