Legos<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:36.220> swing<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.580> like<00:04:36.729> if<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.419> swing<00:04:37.810> it

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
Legos you swing it like if you swing it

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.510 
Legos you swing it like if you swing it
like<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.289> and<00:04:39.210> like<00:04:40.259> I<00:04:41.259> guess<00:04:41.710> it's<00:04:41.889> like<00:04:42.340> the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
like that and like I guess it's like the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.950 
like that and like I guess it's like the
heavy<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.300> part<00:04:43.539> is<00:04:43.630> actually<00:04:43.720> very

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
heavy the this part is actually very

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.710 
heavy the this part is actually very
dense<00:04:44.380> but<00:04:44.620> it's<00:04:44.740> extremely<00:04:45.520> light<00:04:45.910> so<00:04:46.090> if<00:04:46.630> i

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
dense but it's extremely light so if i

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.870 
dense but it's extremely light so if i
swing<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.199> basically<00:04:47.680> looks<00:04:47.919> like<00:04:47.949> this<00:04:48.250> it's

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
swing it basically looks like this it's

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.029 
swing it basically looks like this it's
something<00:04:49.449> slow<00:04:49.630> motion<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.080> just<00:04:50.259> bends<00:04:50.650> as

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
something slow motion it just bends as

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.310 
something slow motion it just bends as
it's<00:04:51.550> going<00:04:51.729> through<00:04:51.849> and<00:04:52.419> then<00:04:52.840> when<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.020> stop

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
it's going through and then when I stop

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.719 
it's going through and then when I stop
it<00:04:53.650> stop<00:04:54.550> spending<00:04:55.560> if<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.740> were<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.949> bend<00:04:57.610> it

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
it stop spending if you were to bend it

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.400 
it stop spending if you were to bend it
like<00:04:57.759> this<00:04:58.150> like<00:04:58.599> you're<00:04:58.750> really<00:04:58.990> going<00:04:59.320> to
