protein<00:00:09.330> shakes<00:00:09.630> but<00:00:10.320> lately<00:00:11.099> i've<00:00:11.340> been

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
protein shakes but lately i've been

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.239 
protein shakes but lately i've been
using<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.940> stuff<00:00:12.150> called<00:00:12.360> almond<00:00:12.780> dream<00:00:13.249> it's

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
using the stuff called almond dream it's

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.770 
using the stuff called almond dream it's
basically<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.730> substitute<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.209> milk<00:00:15.570> it's

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
basically a substitute for milk it's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.990 
basically a substitute for milk it's
just<00:00:15.959> slightly<00:00:16.230> healthier<00:00:16.530> for<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.670> I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
just slightly healthier for you and I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.940 
just slightly healthier for you and I
find<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.270> tastes<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.630> little<00:00:18.720> bit<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:19.020> two<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.920> I

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
find it tastes a little bit or two so I

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.570 
find it tastes a little bit or two so I
pour<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:21.020> about<00:00:22.020> half<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.010> cup<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.430> would

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
pour a little about half a cup I would

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.260
