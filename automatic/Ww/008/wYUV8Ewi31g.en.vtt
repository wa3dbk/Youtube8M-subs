00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.320
 in this video we'll talk about 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.000
 space lab 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.869
 namely, how can you use this 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.380
 space I want to change color immediately 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.509
 say that this option is not always 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.520
 suitable but for example for many 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.250
 photos this will be the only chance 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.170
 change any color like here 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.680
 very interesting you can control 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.860
 colors and i think that for your development 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.580
 and communicating for your own development 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.700
 It will be useful to know this option. 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.430
 replacements 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.160
 I think you no longer need to explain how 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.000
 change the mode of this image mode and 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.820
 paws we have part 1 image 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.290
 and we will change the color using the curves 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.510
 click adjustment layer choose 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.759
 the curves are exactly the adjustment layer because 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.729
 that if you clean up the image 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.680
 correction and there curves the data option is not 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.170
 will turn out 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.009
 remove the curves and we now have here 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.039
 three channels you brightness a and b as you 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.679
 you know what data we have 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:25.490
 hardly part for brightness namely for 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:29.509
 lightness to be more precise channel and we 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.350
 responsible for magenta green and channel b 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.600
 responsible for yellow to blue so 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.369
 knowing these parameters we can 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.249
 adjust our curves let's 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.350
 start correction with 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.389
 I want to make a car green 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.869
 colors and we need to adjust 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:50.240
 dots black and white and kuwait 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.289
 when we shift anything bending given 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.179
 the case does not need moving up to such 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.649
 values ​​to make our car turned 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.899
 such a greenish color and after that 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.149
 we can adjust a little bit 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.700
 channel brightness if you want to do 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.709
 car color is a little bit darker or vice versa 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.910
 lighter 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.750
 more contrast and we can stop there 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.180
 as you can see with him now 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.689
 adjust the channel b cottages for 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.610
 we have yellow and blue in general 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.230
 nothing will change we can 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.900
 Of course, correct him a little 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.959
 make more greenish and more 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.330
 dark as you see we will 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:38.330
 a little bit not exactly change as well 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.610
 here is such a simple option now 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.500
 we move to our collection as 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.349
 see what we have left we need 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.510
 now separate our green color which 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.400
 was and which is now by car and 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.769
 the color that we have covered 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.110
 we absolutely do not need things this here 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.840
 stones of the mountain and in general another space 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.450
 we click this icon transition 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.120
 blending options 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.209
 below now show here there are overlays 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.720
 on dina will need to shoot him down 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.250
 using these sliders as we see 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.470
 can adjust and by in different 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.930
 channels it is like brightness and channel 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.280
 fishes 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.680
 let's have 2 little black black 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.829
 marker on those later moments when we have 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.870
 no means all appear red 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.870
 on this until we finish press 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.940
 the alt key and divide our themes slider 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:44.120
 most now our changes have become more 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:47.840
 smooth this color then go 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.180
 on channel a and move our slider then 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.849
 the moment when we only have a car 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.370
 green and already with the right slider it on 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:59.359
 there is such a purple color can 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.099
 a little more correct and accurate 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:05.810
 also let us divide our call and 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.930
 correct the knife our passivity 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.340
 colors 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.090
 move to channel bm see what 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.739
 get to do with it like 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.539
 see in this case we are in general 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.120
 we can't do anything because 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:25.150
 of our color that we need all of it 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.150
 do not go to channel a 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.100
 We try to correct so to remove 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.009
 slightly green areas on the stones 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.620
 but it's really impossible to remove everything 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.990
 for this we have bridges we take a mask 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.949
 take a black brush can rigidity 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.259
 put one hundred percent or 0 and in those 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.110
 places where we think green 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:52.340
 too much we are very simple ryabov 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.340
 this way we remove 

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:06.869
 the same goes for the whole back end 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:12.239
 Here is such a small nuance when 

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:14.369
 it will be necessary to remove something so 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:15.899
 we look it's all good and now the most 

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:18.589
 the main thing we can remove some 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:24.559
 pieces especially here on the turn signals 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:24.559
 select the desired diameter already select 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.679
 in this way we can neatly 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:35.639
 all correct the same applies 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:39.269
 here in this way we are very 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.769
 just changed color using color 

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:43.919
 paw spaces are not curves 

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:45.749
 Here is a simple option we bring 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.879
 corrected for just some five 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.800
 minutes and in fact it is not much 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.999
 if many other tools with 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.969
 the help of which you can much 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:56.759
 change quickly but I wanted this lesson 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.679
 show exactly considered space lab 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.589
 so do not write what if others 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:03.809
 options are much faster in this case 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.489
 it is for development to learn 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:09.539
 what really there are other ways 

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:10.860
 color swap and in this on that note I 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.349
 want to finish 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.149
 I hope this lesson was useful for you 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.399
 and you learned something new for yourself 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:20.309
 surely there is such a space that 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:22.469
 I can move the same and can 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:25.769
 find certain advantages in 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:27.659
 this mode up on replacing colors with you 

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:29.399
