00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.370
 There you go, little boy, and today we're going to show the beer powder. 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.370
 That's right! Japanese technology Lord Vinnie goes there, dumps H2O there until 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.680
 the half of the mug that already comes with the product 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.890
 This mug is special to do this, from the Crayon Shin Chan 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 And he goes there, there he unpacks beautifully Breaks the seal, and now, he'll dump the 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:42.039
 powder. An initial white powder 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:48.699
 played there, and look, there's the mixology 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.699
 And there it is brewing the beer. Look, he created a tuned collar. 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:03.979
 that goes up and goes to leak! And he cleverly places a plate there 

00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:13.150
 - Our Lady! What a sight, huh! Fantastic! 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 - Watch her boiling! What a beautiful thing! The beer was not made there 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.079
 alcohol can obviously be enjoyed by children, it is released 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.710
 in Japan, and Lord Vinteiro shows the taste there 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 He sent it all at once. Yes, it is! 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 Perfect He goes there, which is the only moment 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.729
 The great chef de cuisine, Lord Vinheteiro experiments and caresses with his taste buds 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.649
 the hops coming from Czechoslovakia. Let's see, Wonderful! 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.649
 Lip reading, one of the best beers I've ever tasted in my life, says Lord, 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.640
 our great hero. It's the Wacky Science showing that there is 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.390
 What powder beer is that? 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.580
 Keep it all! And a happy 2015 for all of you, is what 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.580
 wish the Mad Science of the Himalayas!
