 look friends we have opened the box and this is what was inside 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.240
 a board with a lot of chips and this pen that serves to know if 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.090
 the answer is correct or it is false 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.450
 look here Sven and Olaf come out that chuli let's open this to see see 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.330
 wooow come a lot of chips 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.130
 a lot of questions each one has five 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.630
 look on both sides there are questions 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.120
 [music] 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.410
 is here for example is to know according to the fingers that have here posts 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.280
 which of these corresponds for example here has a finger then ... 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.140
 corresponds to this here that there is only one doll 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.820
 and this one has to solve the forms for example these two here which would be his silhouette 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.980
 look there are different heap remember that there are on both sides 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.700
 this one here we have to guess the number with the characters that are here for example here they are 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.900
 Sven and Olaf wue are two dolls because we have to point the two 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.080
 and there is a lot but I'm not going to tell you the answers of all because if not then you already know them 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 you see 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.119
 and there are a lot different with numbers with shapes 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.619
 with colors with body parts 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.820
 Behold 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.509
 and here that I have not taught you from behind 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.990
 this 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.149
 this wooow 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.509
 other 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.669
 this forms I like, I'm going to keep it here 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:39.929
 and also to save this one here 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.280
 and this 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.140
 Look behind and I'll show you how the pen works 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:53.030
 let's see we're going to take the card, for example, okay? 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.969
 Look, we have to know what figure Anna has here 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.419
 let's try first 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.560
 with the star we have to put the tip of the pen on the round this one here black 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.079
 and well straight because if you can not give us error 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.479
 let's try the triangle is not to see this if it is to see 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.180
 Look if this tells us that is the way Anna 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.199
 and now we are going to approve for example the one of Olaf we are going to see what is 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.769
 look here you see it well to see if it is the star nooo 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.219
 the nooo triangle 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.459
 round 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.699
 to see what you have to put on top of the point eh look at the round if 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.799
 because if you do not put it right on top of the point we can error even if true 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.149
 and now let's try this here look 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:49.189
 this little hand here that has? one finger only then let's see 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.279
 if this here that there are three characters is not that there are four no 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.700
 and this that there is one 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.269
 to see .. yes right! 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.939
 and now I'm going to show you another tab 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.609
 for example is here that consist of guessing 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.879
 which of these forms belongs to this character 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.539
 Let's see here we have Elsa so we have to know what her hand is 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.080
 this one for example this one 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.599
 this one I think not because she has an orange braid and she is blonde 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.099
 then this would be Anna's 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.680
 this is not because it looks like an animal 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.050
 it will be this to see to see 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.170
 let's try we have to put it well on 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.710
 to see wait 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.180
 if it is that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.469
 and now we're going to this one here 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.449
 for example 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.099
 which of these is Olaf's 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.050
 this one is not can not be can be 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.279
 this one I think this is from Anna but let's put the tip well over 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.830
 red or not is not correct to see .. 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.950
 to see if this is here, uuu, although it is correct 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.580
 this little hand here is Olaf's 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.699
