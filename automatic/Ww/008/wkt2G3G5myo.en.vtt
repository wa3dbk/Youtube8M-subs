00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 bathe games save in gamma 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.150
 link in the description hello my name is 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 Michael and today I would like to talk to 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 you about cheats and chihiro 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.020
 the fact is that the other day I released a video 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.170
 about my mouse after that to me in to 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.329
 wrote one of the subscribers he asked 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.239
 something like this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.539
 I tried these macros in the mouse or did not want 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.700
 ever try and answered no to 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.520
 my mind cheats macros 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.670
 and these other gadgets for 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 cheating games are enjoyed exclusively 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.190
 children are either extremely stupid people then 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.589
 there is fly by basically everything is clear they 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.549
 not yet sufficiently developed to understand 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.400
 the essence of the game then an adult should 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.650
 definitely understand that the game is a challenge 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 challenge your mastery 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.259
 that is, the essence of the game is not to 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 to win by any means the essence of the game is 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.830
 what you don't know whether you win or not 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.350
 challenge your mastery 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.509
 checking your skill is intrigue 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.670
 because it makes no sense to watch some sort 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.729
 thriller or horror movie if you already 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.860
 know the ending is the same in the game which 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.560
 meaning to play if you know what you are 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.990
 winner and win and dishonest 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.869
 I think any adult is reasonable 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 man must understand all this but on 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.149
 It turns out everything is not so what 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.390
 As for the cheats themselves, I think that they 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.680
 have been and always will be while there are games 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.290
 and there are players 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.659
 it's like real-world crime then 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.120
 There was always crime even when 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.490
 we are tribes 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.130
 there were always people who did not want 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.860
 follow the laws of the community 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.200
 the law of societies so with cheats always 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.470
 there is a person who wants to cheat 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 system let's say this but repeat it on 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.050
 my mind is extremely strange people just 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.830
 very strange the other day by the way discovered 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.420
 still such a topic, many people justify 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.480
 using cheats so that I now 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.300
 I'll play with shields for a couple of months since I 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.790
 I play weakly under my skill 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.400
 and then turn off I will play normally 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.640
 here's more nonsense I'm still in my life 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.830
 didn't hear it really impossible 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.470
 improve your skills 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.230
 the game and not fair it's just impossible 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.370
 that's where people have such thoughts in my head 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.740
 are taken 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.020
 I do not understand there you eg 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.690
 are you using which macro is not read there 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.630
 to suppress recoil and running with it well 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.020
 how do you learn to suppress hand returns 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.720
 itâ€™s impossible to raise your own 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.090
 skill play shields macros and 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.520
 so on and the last thing I wanted 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.580
 talk this video about cheats and 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.840
 cheaters like this 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.080
 common opinion is that for example in 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.959
 battles their clouds just crowds run there 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.030
 almost every second read 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.780
 Naturally this is not true that is cheater 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.440
 of course there are 4 but they are not so 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.260
 much as it seems to many players in 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.900
 mostly children of course that is, we play 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.450
 For example, on any card, click 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.450
 tab and see that the guy is playing there with 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.710
 90 0 well, of course he cheater 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.520
 first thought we have 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.030
 we do not have the idea that he 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.070
 great player 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.630
 we first come to mind 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.200
 the idea that he is a cheater 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.590
 because purely psychologically man 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.380
 it's very hard to admit that another 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.780
 plays better than the floor that is much 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.960
 it's easier for us to think about what he read about 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.790
 although I myself have seen the streams where the guy 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.230
 I don't remember what his nickname is 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.500
 did score 90 0 on the marcos array on 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.440
 developed a helicopter there in the chat just 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.230
 broke off oh you cheater cheater shame 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.560
 there he swore at him he played on stream 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.370
 without any cheats he's just a master on 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.730
 helicopters 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.670
 that is, guys do not rush to draw conclusions 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:36.060
 Do not rush another option when the game 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.030
 curve and you think that the terms of cheaters 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.340
 for example, recently I ran a deiz in the middle 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.260
 Berezina there was nobody around me 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.050
 specifically looked around and here 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.120
 bang i died i mean there was no 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.060
 shots just black screen 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.300
 yuar yes I naturally die read 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.430
 Well, just got and then it turned out that 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.280
 I have a buggy game and now I have 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.890
 quite often not heard shots from 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.930
 masin I came running back to the place where 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.600
 was my dead body and really there 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.060
 turned out to be an ordinary guy tuxedo he 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.120
 maybe sitting in one of the houses just 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.670
 shot me and I didn't hear the sound of a shot 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.640
 that is, it seemed to me that this is a cheat though 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.620
 in fact it was a common situation here 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.520
 actually all that I wanted you today 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.430
 to tell 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.340
 I hope you were interested in offering 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.530
 some new topics in the comments 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.660
 maybe I will like something i will do 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.660
 video all good luck chan
