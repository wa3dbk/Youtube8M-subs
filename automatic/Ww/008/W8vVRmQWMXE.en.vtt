five-year plan you can start to look

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
five-year plan you can start to look
into<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> better<00:01:18.420> body<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> nothing

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
into a better body but there is nothing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that you're really going to benefit from

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
that you're really going to benefit from
I<00:01:22.259> mean<00:01:22.380> other<00:01:22.560> than<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> newer<00:01:23.189> body<00:01:23.460> sure

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I mean other than it's a newer body sure

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.399 
I mean other than it's a newer body sure
it<00:01:24.210> has<00:01:24.330> more<00:01:24.509> bells<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> whistles<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it has more bells and whistles and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 
it has more bells and whistles and
probably<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.490> take<00:01:26.700> pictures<00:01:27.299> better<00:01:27.630> in

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
probably will take pictures better in

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.710 
probably will take pictures better in
certain<00:01:28.229> low-light<00:01:28.619> situations<00:01:29.720> you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
certain low-light situations you

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390 
certain low-light situations you
shouldn't<00:01:31.110> spend<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.680> money<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.159> body

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
shouldn't spend your money on a body

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
shouldn't spend your money on a body
because<00:01:32.790> every<00:01:33.030> two<00:01:33.270> years<00:01:33.540> these<00:01:34.049> bodies<00:01:34.530> are

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
because every two years these bodies are

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
because every two years these bodies are
being<00:01:34.890> replaced<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.970> put<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.390> money<00:01:36.540> into

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
being replaced you put your money into

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
being replaced you put your money into
the<00:01:37.290> lenses<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.000> beginning<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the lenses right at the beginning and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
the lenses right at the beginning and
then<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.500> learn<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> body<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
then you learn with the body that you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.450 
then you learn with the body that you
have<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.350> move<00:01:43.710> forward<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.280> your

that<00:01:47.399> two-year<00:01:48.000> area<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.619> already<00:01:49.770> have

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that two-year area then you already have

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.069

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
a build-up collection of glass then you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440

nikon f 42 the nikon f 5 was a 10-year
span<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:06.240> back<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.229> would<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> pro

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
span so back then you would have a pro

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.339 
span so back then you would have a pro
body<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.489> 10<00:02:08.700> years<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.209> pro<00:02:09.810> bodies<00:02:10.200> are

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
body for 10 years now pro bodies are

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
body for 10 years now pro bodies are
every<00:02:10.590> two<00:02:10.830> years<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.270> 20<00:02:12.720> well

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
every two years to you know 20 well

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
every two years to you know 20 well
but<00:02:14.100> two<00:02:14.340> men<00:02:14.610> almost<00:02:14.850> two<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.570> half<00:02:15.720> years

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
but two men almost two and a half years

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.350 
but two men almost two and a half years
maybe<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.500> little<00:02:16.680> less<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:17.220> until<00:02:18.210> they're

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
maybe a little less now until they're

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.220 
maybe a little less now until they're
replaced<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.370> pro<00:02:20.670> end<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.330> see<00:02:22.110> in

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
replaced so in the pro end I see in

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.590 
replaced so in the pro end I see in
importance<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.830> for<00:02:23.340> me<00:02:23.490> replacing<00:02:24.060> my<00:02:24.240> pro

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
importance in for me replacing my pro

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.420 
importance in for me replacing my pro
body<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> next<00:02:25.740> one<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:25.980> comes<00:02:26.040> out

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
body with the next one that comes out

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.090 
body with the next one that comes out
because<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.060> will<00:02:27.300> lose<00:02:27.540> too<00:02:27.870> much<00:02:28.050> money<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.710> I

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
because it will lose too much money if I

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.050 
because it will lose too much money if I
sit<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.570> low<00:02:30.780> end<00:02:31.310> d3000<00:02:32.310> d60

sit on it but on the low end d3000 d60
d40<00:02:33.780> things<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.710> learn<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.700> camera

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
d40 things like that learn the camera

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.140 
d40 things like that learn the camera
first<00:02:36.360> spend<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.200> time<00:02:37.440> learning<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.400> invest

time is right then you move into the
next<00:02:44.130> camera<00:02:44.490> it's<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.150> going<00:02:45.330> from<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.660> d90

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
next camera it's like going from a d90

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.220 
next camera it's like going from a d90
to<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.940> d7000<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.240> probably<00:02:48.540> not<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.020> right

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
to a d7000 it's probably not the right

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.220 
to a d7000 it's probably not the right
progression<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.850> make<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.660> know<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.020> next

progression above the d90 would probably

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.240 
progression above the d90 would probably
be<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.550> d300s<00:02:56.550> replacement<00:02:57.510> or<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:58.260> d700

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
be a d300s replacement or the d700

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.420 
be a d300s replacement or the d700
replacement<00:03:00.090> depending<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:02.250> you're
