the heck's a headphone amplifier i've

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.560 
the heck's a headphone amplifier i've
never<00:00:17.160> heard<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.760> those<00:00:17.940> well

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
never heard of one of those well

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.120 
never heard of one of those well
basically<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.140> does<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.590> grabs<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
basically what it does is it grabs the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
basically what it does is it grabs the
audio<00:00:20.460> from<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.850> source<00:00:21.119> whether<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.720> your

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
audio from a source whether it be your

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.349 
audio from a source whether it be your
phone<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.439> your<00:00:22.470> mp3<00:00:22.980> player<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.730> grabs<00:00:24.060> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
phone or your mp3 player it grabs it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.599 
phone or your mp3 player it grabs it
cleans<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.859> makes<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.400> lot

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
cleans it up and it just makes it a lot

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.640 
cleans it up and it just makes it a lot
nicer<00:00:26.939> sounding<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> lot<00:00:27.810> more<00:00:27.869> high<00:00:28.349> fidelity

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
nicer sounding a lot more high fidelity

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.919 
nicer sounding a lot more high fidelity
not<00:00:29.429> only<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.760> it'll<00:00:30.090> power<00:00:30.330> headphones

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
not only that but it'll power headphones

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.990 
not only that but it'll power headphones
or<00:00:31.230> power-hungry<00:00:31.740> headphones<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.550> you

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
or power-hungry headphones that you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
or power-hungry headphones that you
can't<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.510> use<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> regular<00:00:35.070> audio

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
can't really use with a regular audio

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
can't really use with a regular audio
source<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.030> headphones<00:00:36.239> out<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
source some headphones out there have a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680 
source some headphones out there have a
higher<00:00:37.440> impedance<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.640> causes<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> not

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
higher impedance which causes it to not

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.139 
higher impedance which causes it to not
work<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.620> things<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.250> phone<00:00:41.640> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
work as well with things like a phone so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
work as well with things like a phone so
you<00:00:42.210> need<00:00:42.390> some<00:00:42.570> extra<00:00:42.719> juice<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.710> will

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you need some extra juice and this will

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.950 
you need some extra juice and this will
supply<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.300> isn't<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.870> for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
supply that now this isn't just for

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
supply that now this isn't just for
headphones<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.500> need<00:00:46.829> high<00:00:47.250> power<00:00:47.640> or

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
headphones that need high power or

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
headphones that need high power or
anything<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:49.050> thing<00:00:49.289> works

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
anything like that this thing works

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
anything like that this thing works
great<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.219> headphones<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> cost

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
a lot bigger they're probably double in

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
thickness or maybe even a little bit

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
thickness or maybe even a little bit
more<00:01:18.840> than<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> than<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.740> guy<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
more than that than this guy but the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.219 
more than that than this guy but the
thing<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.600> something<00:01:21.840> small

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
thing is when you have something small

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.410 
thing is when you have something small
like<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:23.009> usually<00:01:23.310> considered<00:01:24.030> worse

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
like this it's usually considered worse

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.570 
like this it's usually considered worse
or<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.350> wimpy<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
or when you know more wimpy it's just it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700 
or when you know more wimpy it's just it
can't<00:01:26.880> power<00:01:27.210> headphones<00:01:27.869> well<00:01:28.530> although

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
can't power headphones well although

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
can't power headphones well although
that<00:01:29.009> may<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.220> true<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.450> guy<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.659> guy

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that may be true with this guy this guy

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.480 
that may be true with this guy this guy
should<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.380> able<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> power<00:01:31.860> most<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.369> day

don't have to be powered that much they
do<00:04:40.370> have<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.729> be<00:04:40.819> powered<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.210> little<00:04:41.509> but<00:04:41.900> not

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
do have to be powered a little but not

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.409 
do have to be powered a little but not
that<00:04:42.319> much<00:04:42.590> then<00:04:43.069> if<00:04:43.250> we<00:04:43.370> turn<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:43.729> up<00:04:43.879> you<00:04:44.240> guys

that much then if we turn it up you guys
will<00:04:44.629> see<00:04:44.659> that<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.740> starts<00:04:45.889> changing<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.520> more

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
of a purplish color so now we're in the

purple zone you guys can't really see
this<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.199> camera<00:04:51.470> can't<00:04:51.710> really<00:04:51.770> capture<00:04:52.310> it

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
this the camera can't really capture it

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.740 
this the camera can't really capture it
but<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.580> guys<00:04:52.699> can<00:04:52.879> see<00:04:53.000> that<00:04:53.150> that's<00:04:53.270> purple

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750

but you guys can see that that's purple
right<00:04:53.900> there<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.610> once<00:04:55.610> you're<00:04:55.699> in<00:04:55.789> the

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
purple zone this is where you start

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.600 
purple zone this is where you start
powering<00:04:57.470> some<00:04:58.159> of<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.370> higher-end

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
powering some of the higher-end

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.210 
powering some of the higher-end
headphones<00:04:59.330> if<00:04:59.870> we<00:04:59.990> bring<00:05:00.199> it<00:05:00.349> up<00:05:00.470> even<00:05:00.979> more

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
headphones if we bring it up even more

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.670 
headphones if we bring it up even more
we'll<00:05:01.669> turn<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.060> gain<00:05:02.240> up<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.569> lot<00:05:03.050> more<00:05:03.289> once

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
we'll turn the gain up a lot more once

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.129 
we'll turn the gain up a lot more once
we<00:05:03.740> get<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.009> pink<00:05:04.280> it<00:05:04.460> has<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.639> huge<00:05:05.389> jump<00:05:05.930> in

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.920 
we get to the pink it has a huge jump in
volume<00:05:06.830> because<00:05:07.400> you<00:05:07.550> have<00:05:07.789> that<00:05:08.030> gain<00:05:08.270> up<00:05:08.539> so

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
doesn't make that much sense and it's

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.920 
doesn't make that much sense and it's
not<00:06:01.159> really<00:06:01.430> practical<00:06:01.669> what<00:06:02.479> I<00:06:02.509> would<00:06:02.900> have

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.469 
not really practical what I would have
loved<00:06:03.259> to<00:06:03.289> see<00:06:03.469> is<00:06:03.860> have<00:06:04.099> this<00:06:04.460> in<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:05.060> output

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
loved to see is have this in the output

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.360 
loved to see is have this in the output
down<00:06:05.719> here<00:06:06.020> that<00:06:06.199> way<00:06:06.319> it<00:06:06.409> becomes<00:06:06.560> more<00:06:06.949> part

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
down here that way it becomes more part

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.850 
down here that way it becomes more part
of<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.580> cable<00:06:08.029> rather<00:06:08.569> than<00:06:08.870> intrusive<00:06:09.590> part

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
of the cable rather than intrusive part

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.610 
of the cable rather than intrusive part
of<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.099> system<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:11.389> in<00:06:11.599> the<00:06:11.750> end<00:06:11.779> is<00:06:12.169> this<00:06:12.409> guy

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
of the system so in the end is this guy

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.830 
of the system so in the end is this guy
worth<00:06:12.949> the<00:06:13.219> expensive<00:06:13.940> price<00:06:14.210> point<00:06:14.479> compared

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
worth the expensive price point compared

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.920 
worth the expensive price point compared
to<00:06:14.960> like<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.259> Pheo<00:06:15.500> e7<00:06:16.279> or<00:06:16.460> 11<00:06:17.060> well<00:06:17.599> i<00:06:17.630> gotta

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
to like the Pheo e7 or 11 well i gotta

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.920 
to like the Pheo e7 or 11 well i gotta
say<00:06:18.169> yes<00:06:18.500> although<00:06:19.099> the<00:06:19.219> Pheo<00:06:19.460> e7<00:06:20.120> and<00:06:20.270> 11<00:06:20.750> may

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
say yes although the Pheo e7 and 11 may

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.749 
say yes although the Pheo e7 and 11 may
be<00:06:20.990> able<00:06:21.229> to<00:06:21.380> power<00:06:21.650> headphones<00:06:22.219> better<00:06:22.520> than

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
be able to power headphones better than

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.149 
be able to power headphones better than
