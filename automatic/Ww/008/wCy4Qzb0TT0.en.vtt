00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.429
 turf tv for your daily received five 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 out of five the quinté plus missions and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.570
 from 5-5 to accompany me today a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.680
 coming back down to manizales hello not 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.570
 really a philippe day will play all 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.710
 so this saturday vincennes direction with 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.330
 a test that should be part of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.500
 beautiful favorites but exactly whose 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.210
 it is a test that is disputed either 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.019
 2700 meters from the big track so a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.490
 run course 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.109
 sessions all from the same starting level 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.830
 so but finally I think the most 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.599
 rich people should be able to express themselves 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 fully on the occasion of this test 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.669
 Well, we'll see if you put the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.450
 richer at the top of our selection 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.070
 listen to you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.200
 so I put in the top 14 ripper 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.809
 thank you in front of the ursula of bouffey 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 the 15 triskell pasha the global set 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.989
 insight on the 5th 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.030
 rib ultimate xiii ultimate queen 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.000
 the 6 oriane and guides and there is the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 12th band indeed ok so May 14th 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.199
 thank you it's not complicated his milan 2014 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
 is excellent in 15 attempts five 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.860
 wins 8 accessits and he comes 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 especially to win the prize provence 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 on this same route 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.899
 that's the logic yes it's logic in 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.649
 more horse has a commitment 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.629
 favorable 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.189
 he remains on two victories whose 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.310
 last on the course facing a 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.049
 similar opposition it's again 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 confided to jean michel bazire so with 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.140
 jean michel bazire these three out of three 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.500
 including two victories and one accessit 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.299
 honor 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.890
 the horse is four feet unshod 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 in this configuration it's fine 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.650
 mostly met I see 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.580
 not what would prevent him from continuing 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.049
 in its stride it's the horse to beat 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.800
 we tell him exactly how to oppose 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.070
 his dolphin lately in the price of 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.090
 Provence was a fabulous victory 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.190
 two accessits 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.750
 good it's quite logical too yes yes 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.060
 well she just concluded in the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.620
 wake of my favorite she is not 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.640
 out of the first three during his 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.830
 last five outings 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.830
 she is confirmed on the course these 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.790
 seven years out of which four wins 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.680
 commitment is ideal it's the most 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.300
 rich of the lot we know that she is held 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.740
 between you estimate by his entourage 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.390
 she should just bring a good 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.290
 replica to the favorites rightly you 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.270
 talk about his surroundings 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.430
 bruno ranc ur was at the meeting of 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.270
 stone yves verva who tells us about his 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.360
 protected 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.100
 it's the midfielder who's coming 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.740
 when we are definitely back to school 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.670
 hardened eat ouais is the superficial 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.880
 less in principle 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.730
 a beautiful course we did online 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.840
 with resources she finished well 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.660
 so ready for this for this commitment 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:22.580
 Saturday favorable struggling to recover well 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.860
 all logic on the same bases 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.650
 kim and who wants to do some 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.660
 lengths starting but this is good 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.360
 will understand it is a little confidence 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.800
 it's quite logical 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.200
 in third position number 15 a 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.910
 triskell then pacha who is somewhat 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.890
 disappointed lately at pornichet now 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.660
 he will be much better at vincennes on 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.100
 this course déferré of the four will 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.480
 buy yes me I relativize her 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.510
 last performance was his second 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.890
 course after an absence landais do 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.720
 four feet franck nivard is 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.370
 called to the rescue it's still 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.720
 a horse that beat role models 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.250
 so it's not bad it's very good for 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.720
 me it is a candidate to be the podium 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.810
 redeem totally more commitment 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.700
 is favorable action is done to him 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.370
 confidence and trust you in 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.590
 4th position number 7 global midnight which 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.470
 remains on three successes including two on the 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.970
 course of 4 on sea is the form 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.560
 maertens there too we can not dismiss it 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.490
 but hey we can not dismiss him we know 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.290
 that the mare is in excellent 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.690
 condition as you just said to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.400
 on three consecutive wins 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.959
 she placed herself during these two 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.940
 balances and it's on the course that we 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.140
 is proposed I do not see what 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.019
 would not stop fighting for places 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.640
 we move the win ah no here are the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.290
 places we agree brews in 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.600
 fifth position number 5 ultimate 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.370
 of the rib that has already protested trait on this 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.840
 course now I think it wants 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.280
 say what maybe get off a whole 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.959
 little bit below you to hope 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.190
 so prevail there rather for a 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.660
 it's okay for a place 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.269
 logically it should work a big 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.250
 twelve enemies on this on this plot so 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.830
 For me, it's more competitive for 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.360
 to be 4/5 my certainly the choice of comes 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.590
 to display a net shape boost in 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.410
 seizing an excellent fifth 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.459
 place to point the finger at the last 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.140
 turning he was still among the 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.110
 last of the income very well finish 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.190
 it's a bit of a note that day even though 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.209
 it's one of the regulated months and 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.130
 certainly not the least talented 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.019
 So I trust for 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.640
 accessits also to be 4/5 that's 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.950
 we are wary of the ultimate number five 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.810
 lasted bah listens and benjamin full 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.310
 thank you very much prognosis that is 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.780
 logically we will have understood the 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.030
 14 the horse to beat 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.170
 a young person added in relation to that me 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.630
 I give you an appointment on the other hand 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.100
 tomorrow on this same plateau with the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.690
 place of benjamin the trump charm of 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.510
 the philippines chignon issue that we 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.460
 will speak of a 5.5 on Sunday 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.139
 thank you very much thank you, thank you 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.350

 goodbye
