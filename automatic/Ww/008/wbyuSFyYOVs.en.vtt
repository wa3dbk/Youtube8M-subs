880<00:00:10.440> headphone<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.730> headphone<00:00:12.059> comes<00:00:12.389> in

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
880 headphone this headphone comes in

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.689 
880 headphone this headphone comes in
three<00:00:13.110> different<00:00:13.619> flavors<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.730> 32<00:00:15.480> ohm<00:00:16.699> 250

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
three different flavors the 32 ohm 250

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.630 
three different flavors the 32 ohm 250
ohm<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:19.250> 600<00:00:20.250> ohm<00:00:20.429> version<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:23.310> reason<00:00:23.550> why

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
ohm and a 600 ohm version the reason why

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640 
ohm and a 600 ohm version the reason why
they<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:23.880> three<00:00:24.570> different<00:00:24.810> impedance

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
they do three different impedance

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
they do three different impedance
headphones<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.999> try<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> make<00:00:27.480> them

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
headphones here is to try to make them

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.409 
headphones here is to try to make them
suitable<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.380> various<00:00:28.980> applications<00:00:29.820> with

suitable for various applications with

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.090 
suitable for various applications with
the<00:00:30.630> 32<00:00:31.199> ohm<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.800> portable<00:00:32.250> use<00:00:32.690> the<00:00:33.890> 250<00:00:34.890> ohm

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the 32 ohm for portable use the 250 ohm

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.029 
the 32 ohm for portable use the 250 ohm
for<00:00:35.460> general<00:00:35.910> purpose<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.410> 600<00:00:37.680> ohm

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
for general purpose use and the 600 ohm

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.410 
for general purpose use and the 600 ohm
for<00:00:38.399> professional<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.270> high-end<00:00:39.719> home<00:00:40.020> use

for professional and high-end home use

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.229 
for professional and high-end home use
basically<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.949> 32<00:00:43.949> M<00:00:44.010> headphone<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.850> designed

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
basically the 32 M headphone is designed

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.349 
basically the 32 M headphone is designed
to<00:00:45.449> be<00:00:45.629> easy<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.350> drive<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:48.000> achieve<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
to be easy to drive and to achieve a

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.900 
to be easy to drive and to achieve a
louder<00:00:48.780> listening<00:00:49.530> level<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.070> portable

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
louder listening level on portable

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.689 
louder listening level on portable
players<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.859> kind<00:00:52.859> of<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> problem<00:00:53.550> with

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
players I kind of have a problem with

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.540 
players I kind of have a problem with
that<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.920> portable<00:00:55.920> players<00:00:56.160> have

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that because portable players have

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.410 
that because portable players have
relatively<00:00:57.329> high<00:00:57.480> output<00:00:58.199> impedances<00:00:59.420> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
relatively high output impedances and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.150 
relatively high output impedances and
iTouch<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.140> about<00:01:01.410> 32<00:01:02.160> ohms<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.710> these

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
iTouch is about 32 ohms and these

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.580 
iTouch is about 32 ohms and these
headphones<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.000> 32<00:01:06.540> moams<00:01:06.750> what<00:01:07.440> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
headphones are about 32 moams what that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.680 
headphones are about 32 moams what that
means<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.730> don't<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> very

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
means is that they don't have a very

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.570 
means is that they don't have a very
good<00:01:09.810> damping<00:01:10.350> factor<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.100> damping<00:01:11.460> factor

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
good damping factor the damping factor

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.200 
good damping factor the damping factor
of<00:01:11.880> 1<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.690> case<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.260> found<00:01:14.160> with<00:01:14.580> these

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
of 1 in this case I found with these

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
of 1 in this case I found with these
headphones<00:01:15.510> that<00:01:16.260> I'm<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:17.190> them<00:01:17.490> with

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
headphones that I'm using them with

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.480 
headphones that I'm using them with
portable<00:01:18.090> players<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:19.170> sound<00:01:19.980> somewhat

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
portable players they sound somewhat

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.470 
portable players they sound somewhat
confused<00:01:21.090> uh<00:01:21.480> and<00:01:22.170> um<00:01:22.820> really<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:26.390> sort<00:01:27.390> of

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
confused uh and um really it's sort of

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.510 
confused uh and um really it's sort of
like<00:01:27.660> taking<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.380> headphone<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.130> making

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
like taking a good headphone and making

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
like taking a good headphone and making
a<00:01:29.640> lesser<00:01:30.090> headphone<00:01:30.510> just<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.260> use

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
a lesser headphone just so you can use

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.860 
a lesser headphone just so you can use
it<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.920> portable<00:01:32.400> player<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.300> kind<00:01:33.660> of

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
it on a portable player and I kind of

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.370 
it on a portable player and I kind of
don't<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.980> very<00:01:35.130> good<00:01:35.250> trade-off

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
don't think that's a very good trade-off

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
don't think that's a very good trade-off
so<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> end<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.940> don't<00:01:39.090> recommend<00:01:39.390> these

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so in the end I don't recommend these

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.230 
so in the end I don't recommend these
headphones<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.320> think<00:01:40.530> they're<00:01:41.180> kind<00:01:42.180> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
headphones I think they're kind of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
headphones I think they're kind of
expensive<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:42.870> what<00:01:43.200> you're<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:44.160> getting

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
expensive for what you're really getting

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
expensive for what you're really getting
in<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.730> case<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.880> 250<00:01:48.780> ohm<00:01:48.990> headphone<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
in that case the 250 ohm headphone is a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.800 
in that case the 250 ohm headphone is a
very<00:01:50.010> good<00:01:50.220> sounding<00:01:50.550> headphone<00:01:50.940> it's<00:01:51.660> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
very good sounding headphone it's a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960 
very good sounding headphone it's a
little<00:01:52.350> bit<00:01:52.440> bright<00:01:52.710> way<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.190> high<00:01:53.400> it's<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
little bit bright way up high it's a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.610 
little bit bright way up high it's a
kind<00:01:54.480> of<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.630> tizzy<00:01:54.930> sound<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:57.110> has<00:01:58.110> very<00:01:58.380> nice

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
kind of a tizzy sound and has very nice

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.550 
kind of a tizzy sound and has very nice
sense<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.950> air<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.550> depth<00:01:59.760> to<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
sense of air and depth to it and the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.380 
sense of air and depth to it and the
bass<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.070> nice<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.730> strong<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:04.260> overly<00:02:04.740> so

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
bass is nice and strong not overly so

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
bass is nice and strong not overly so
but<00:02:06.390> lacks<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.230> little<00:02:07.350> tightness<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:08.069> seems<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
but lacks a little tightness it seems to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.499 
but lacks a little tightness it seems to
be<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:08.729> bit<00:02:08.970> loose

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
be a little bit loose

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.360 
be a little bit loose
because<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.409> base<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.890> highs<00:02:12.069> are

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
because the base and the highs are

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.640 
because the base and the highs are
fairly<00:02:12.700> strong<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.690> mid-range<00:02:14.080> seems<00:02:14.470> a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
fairly strong the mid-range seems a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.509 
fairly strong the mid-range seems a
little<00:02:14.950> bit<00:02:15.069> recessed<00:02:15.549> still<00:02:16.500> these<00:02:17.500> are<00:02:17.560> one

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
little bit recessed still these are one

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.250 
little bit recessed still these are one
of<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.909> three<00:02:19.890> headphones<00:02:20.890> around<00:02:21.190> $500<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
of the three headphones around $500 that

of the three headphones around $500 that

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
have been around a long time

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.770 
have been around a long time

the<00:02:36.790> headphone<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.299> was<00:02:37.599> sort<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.049> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the headphone that was sort of on the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.839 
the headphone that was sort of on the
fast<00:02:39.790> side<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:41.530> liked<00:02:42.010> these<00:02:42.159> headphones<00:02:42.400> I

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
fast side I liked these headphones I

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.289 
fast side I liked these headphones I
think<00:02:43.030> they're<00:02:43.180> pretty<00:02:43.540> good<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.700> good<00:02:46.060> for

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
think they're pretty good and good for

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.380 
think they're pretty good and good for
general<00:02:46.599> purpose<00:02:47.049> home<00:02:47.260> use<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:48.209> when<00:02:49.209> you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
general purpose home use the when you

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.599 
general purpose home use the when you
plug<00:02:49.629> them<00:02:49.780> into<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.959> portable<00:02:50.319> player<00:02:50.590> they<00:02:51.040> do

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
plug them into a portable player they do

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.449 
plug them into a portable player they do
get<00:02:51.910> loud<00:02:52.120> enough<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.720> listen<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.680> adequately

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
get loud enough to listen to adequately

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.430 
get loud enough to listen to adequately
but<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> wouldn't<00:02:55.390> say<00:02:55.599> they're<00:02:55.840> they<00:02:56.109> could<00:02:56.349> be

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
but I wouldn't say they're they could be

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.229 
but I wouldn't say they're they could be
driven<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.829> very<00:02:57.040> loud<00:02:57.250> levels<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:57.819> portable

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
driven to very loud levels on portable

driven to very loud levels on portable
players<00:02:58.450> at<00:02:58.690> all<00:02:58.810> okay<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.709> they're<00:03:00.069> they're

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
much better than the 32 own version off

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.500 
much better than the 32 own version off
the<00:03:08.530> same<00:03:08.739> player<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:11.010> 600<00:03:12.010> ohm<00:03:12.069> version<00:03:12.579> is<00:03:13.420> a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the same player the 600 ohm version is a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.470 
the same player the 600 ohm version is a
little<00:03:13.959> bit<00:03:14.349> cleaner<00:03:14.680> sounding<00:03:15.280> than<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.730> 250

ohm<00:03:16.599> version<00:03:17.049> again<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:17.859> is<00:03:18.130> because<00:03:18.310> the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
ohm version again this is because the

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.280 
ohm version again this is because the
600<00:03:19.120> ohm<00:03:19.209> version<00:03:19.660> will<00:03:19.780> give<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.109> better
