00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.520
 on the 14th a plaque of edson and not here 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.000
 can serve 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.790

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:37.239
 maximum of 30 cities there is a 1.4 motor 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.600
 support support and made 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:56.239
 it is locked two stick supports of the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:58.970
 sport brand in the luggage rack crosses 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.820
 american barack hussein from within 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.550
 pipe was with the butterfly door 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:12.080
 and more it around and put me a to 100 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.630
 ac and otavio that the pack wakes up at the table 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.750
 then this pipe is taken up there in the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.569
 stern of the kayak canes and has that always is 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.250
 the stand it has to be tilted 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.920
 he can not be straight as you can 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.380
 see I have to have this inclination 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.869
 get better performance and all 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.179
 gacs commands is triggered by 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.850
 distance from where the wall of the 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.429
 neighbor even in the bank 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.690
 So then one meter and a half meters 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:44.630
 There is no substance in jay kayatt. 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.110
 on the one hand to the other is made normal and is 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 a rod can be made at least or 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.250
 any other material that goes to the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.009
 motor engine I put four 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.610
 the stainless steel clamp of firmness in this 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:07.369
 year here and also work because you can 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 be a pipe from a hole that passes the 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:15.349
 toucan that as you go to take 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:20.020
 He's going to bring me here not to 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:23.390
 You know that's what you 're talking about now. 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.530
 the cordinha I do 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.140
 I regret that the boat is in the distance. 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.150
 one of them is up to you and more important is 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.860
 the design content 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.590
 brought him under the seat of the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.880
 kayak how was it done just 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.370
 I bought two meters from the view. 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.060
 there in the driver's head and even under 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.040
 from the bank 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.470
 then say that it is practical upside 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.070
 You, because if you happen to hit 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.070
 something 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.950
 if you fall it's not something else then 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.560
 turn off the engine you'll talk to the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.260
 people who left here so a good 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.459
 very good header so it's this time 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.370
 have to stay here 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:14.660
 already the march forward 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.730
 this forward march back is very 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 simple the staff thinks he is 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.450
 different because it's not the next I put 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.000
 a pulley behind the engine 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.900
 indexed to the bar there and here in the manche 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.769
 Yes, to put the taboo ahead of me. 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.760
 I went to look for it here but it will stay 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.530
 more by car 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:43.400
 so there are two strings two string that 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.400
 from above I in a cat and this one under a 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.880
 pulling on and off when I pull her 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.970
 was not strong and will bring these magnets 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.410
 back and will do so here goes 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.030
 go back when I want to enter the 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.980
 cut that up 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.470
 they can see the two pieces from above it 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.100
 will engage the march is from below 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.680
 She's going to spend it so this is the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.640
 I had to take the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.670
 front 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.680
 close to the little engine on and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.239
 turn off the other two little things 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.970
 disconnect there only long her that the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.260
 starting the engine that the herein 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.890
 engine start 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.979
 the other is to raise the engine to the head of the 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.860
 motor in the installation itself of the pipe 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.720
 put a screw here another screw 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.770
 here that this rope passes within itself 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.810
 screws 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.300
 so I pull fla this rope to pull 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.520
 at the front it will raise an engine 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.310
 fan and beauty arrived at the fishing spot 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.430
 in which the engine what is tranquil 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.360
 acceleration generation simpler yet 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.610
 I put on a clothes, I put a cord 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.569
 It's a little ball down because 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.470
 little ball 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:03.680
 I use the same system as Brazil Kaka. 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.199
 I did not use the pedalboard 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.030
 measure of the right foot that I 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:12.440
 Do you want to do this here? 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.500
 if I let go of my foot 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:21.620
 so the ball slows down so this 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:25.099
 ball because I accelerated fast in 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.690
 beautiful drawing the ball will return to 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.860
 slow down the engine of the day 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:34.879
 So that's the only way I enjoyed the system. 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.889
 problem there instead of becoming law n 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.610
 I came here put the cord a carabiner 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.380
 zin here simple zinic installation 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.289
 simple and practical 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.360
 I kicked my right foot, I shot my foot. 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.840
 right and decelerates then it has no 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.810
 That's the secret, is there? 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.500
 authorization is very simple motor 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.360
 It was nice to have a kayak that does not 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.949
 in no way does the structure of the kayak because 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.130
 As you can see, the 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.889
 two cuts of scot 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.020
 kayak and also to give 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.469
 more reinforcement to put on this rope in 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.770
 a strap goes over the cam then 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:19.009
 nothing affects the thickness of the kayaking 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.259
 streak does not vibrate and nothing a corner in which 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:24.830
 100 nox or aluminum is because it does not 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:28.090
 rusting support in names that goes to 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:32.960
 in the savings has more this barrel was 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.630
 soldier also crossed here 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.509
 as you can see and this is because the 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.969
 can not even come and he does not 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:44.419
 stay like this is to and fro and not 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:47.220
 wins through to give you more firmness 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:50.790
 which also put two hooks 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.100
 well at the end the aid and another of lake 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:07:15.030
 spent the cord here to give more 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:17.520
 firmness and do not support the sport goes to 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:25.080
 wood which way you can put 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:29.360
 even more so because so and who stays with 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.360
