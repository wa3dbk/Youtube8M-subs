00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 what ice cream in my opinion the most 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.980
 tasty white brown chocolate 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.750
 icing or chewing cups on 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.519
 Indeed the most delicious seed can 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.540
 packaging because a lot of noise 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:47.930
 enough for everyone 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:50.360
 it is now proceed to four parts 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.949
 why are you doing 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:01:02.309

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:06.360

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:19.140
 it means that was so beautiful and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:28.170
 blueberry sprinkle chocolate on camera 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:36.259
 look without interrupting the camera look here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.259

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.330
 tell completion for really tastier 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.860
 than on a stick or waffle cup 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.470
 do you recommend any syrup 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:29.860
 that's how people eat delicious syrup 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:32.049
 this ice cream and with some chocolate there is no 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:39.150
 chocolate black is more likely to multiply by color and 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:42.959
 brown is not true with dark chocolate 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.019
 someone as you like is not here comes the contrast 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.019
 sweet and bitter 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.790
 so with what chocolate is it better to do 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.910
 ice cream like black right 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.910
 the answer and the second question is which syrup 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:08.390
 cherry up the reference question then what is syrup 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.180
 You can use absolutely any well 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.080
 here with our favorite syrup and it's cherry 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.200
 then comes strawberry and then later 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.470
 crimson 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.880
 yes, but it also creates a cherry 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.110
 interesting contrast is obtained 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.890
 sweet and sour mountains 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.220
 bitter so everything is balanced very 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.220
 yummy 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:43.420
