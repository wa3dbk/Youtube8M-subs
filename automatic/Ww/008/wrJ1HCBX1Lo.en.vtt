read if you want to go ahead and launch

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.640 
read if you want to go ahead and launch
it<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.430> i<00:02:21.239> need<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:21.870> connect<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.440> to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
it and i need to actually connect it to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.690 
it and i need to actually connect it to
my<00:02:23.160> virtual<00:02:23.910> machine

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.339 

make<00:02:29.700> sure<00:02:29.730> that's<00:02:29.970> connected<00:02:32.810> before<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.170> do

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
make sure that's connected before you do

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.040 
make sure that's connected before you do
this<00:02:34.819> before<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.150> start<00:02:36.390> doing<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.810> you

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
this before you start doing this you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.000 
this before you start doing this you
probably<00:02:37.170> should<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:37.739> controller

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
probably should have your controller

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.880 
probably should have your controller
plugged<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:40.170> before<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.590> turn<00:02:40.769> on<00:02:40.860> your

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
plugged in like before you turn on your

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.530 
plugged in like before you turn on your
computer<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.879> have<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.090> plugged<00:02:42.269> in

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
computer so if you have it plugged in

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.890 
computer so if you have it plugged in
restart<00:02:43.500> your<00:02:43.560> computer<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:44.870> come<00:02:45.870> back

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
restart your computer and then come back

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.140 
restart your computer and then come back
and<00:02:46.290> then<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.190> process<00:02:47.430> again<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.060> it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
and then do this process again if it

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.589 
and then do this process again if it
doesn't<00:02:48.540> work<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> first<00:02:48.870> time<00:02:50.420> install<00:02:51.420> it

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
doesn't work the first time install it

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.720 
doesn't work the first time install it
when<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> controller<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.830> plugged<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.340> while

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
when the controller is plugged in while

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.789 
when the controller is plugged in while
you<00:02:54.239> know<00:02:54.360> without<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.930> program<00:02:55.560> running

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
you know without the program running

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.490 
you know without the program running
first<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.549> if<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.940> doesn't<00:02:57.239> work<00:02:57.269> then<00:02:57.629> just

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
first so if that doesn't work then just

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.000 
first so if that doesn't work then just
do<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.739> instead<00:02:59.930> go<00:03:00.930> ahead<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.380> go<00:03:01.980> to

do that instead go ahead and go to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.059 
do that instead go ahead and go to

better<00:03:44.880> ds3<00:03:45.470> drag<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.859> really<00:03:47.700> anywhere

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
better ds3 drag it on to really anywhere

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.069 
better ds3 drag it on to really anywhere
so<00:03:48.620> since<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.769> is<00:03:49.920> it's<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.609> portable<00:03:50.940> exe<00:03:51.870> file

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
so since it is it's a portable exe file

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.059 
so since it is it's a portable exe file
which<00:03:52.260> means<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.650> doesn't<00:03:52.769> need<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:52.950> be

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
which means it doesn't need to be

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.160 
which means it doesn't need to be
installed<00:03:53.639> on<00:03:53.940> your<00:03:54.060> computer<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.079> be

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
probably install that and then you're

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.219 
probably install that and then you're
good<00:05:19.169> everything's<00:05:20.039> done<00:05:20.780> now<00:05:21.780> if<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.050> want

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
good everything's done now if you want

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.159 
good everything's done now if you want
to<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:23.120> think<00:05:24.120> if<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.389> hit<00:05:24.539> disconnect<00:05:25.020> this

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
to I think if you hit disconnect this

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.390 
to I think if you hit disconnect this
will<00:05:25.349> just<00:05:25.440> disconnect<00:05:25.919> your<00:05:26.070> controller

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
will just disconnect your controller

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.820 
will just disconnect your controller
entirely<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:29.060> wouldn't<00:05:30.650> recommend<00:05:31.650> that

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
entirely so I wouldn't recommend that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.450 
entirely so I wouldn't recommend that
entirely<00:05:32.400> but<00:05:33.620> you<00:05:34.620> can<00:05:34.740> also<00:05:34.889> disconnect

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
entirely but you can also disconnect

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.589 
entirely but you can also disconnect
your<00:05:35.550> drive<00:05:35.789> from<00:05:35.940> here<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.210> can<00:05:36.330> also<00:05:36.450> go

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
your drive from here you can also go

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:37.909 
your drive from here you can also go
into<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.900> control<00:05:36.990> panel<00:05:37.200> and<00:05:37.620> view<00:05:37.889> your

into the control panel and view your

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.860 
into the control panel and view your
controllers<00:05:38.639> that<00:05:38.669> would<00:05:39.000> be<00:05:39.120> there<00:05:39.360> but<00:05:39.810> I

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
controllers that would be there but I

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.360 
controllers that would be there but I
just<00:05:40.010> asked<00:05:41.010> accidentally<00:05:41.639> dismounted<00:05:42.419> it

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
just asked accidentally dismounted it

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.469 
just asked accidentally dismounted it
I'll<00:05:44.729> see<00:05:45.090> where's<00:05:45.300> that<00:05:46.970> doesn't<00:05:47.970> hurt<00:05:50.479> oh
