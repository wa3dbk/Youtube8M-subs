these two little ramps as you can see
here<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:34.020> try<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.309> you're<00:00:35.579> going

here now try to have it so you're going
straight<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.450> into<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.320> front<00:00:37.559> wheel

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
straight up into it so your front wheel

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
straight up into it so your front wheel
will<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.040> front<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> ramp<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> can

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
will be in front of the ramp as you can

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.750 
will be in front of the ramp as you can
see<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:40.770> self<00:00:41.100> explanatory

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
see here it's a pretty self explanatory

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
see here it's a pretty self explanatory
if<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.149> watch<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> video<00:00:42.719> or<00:00:43.050> watch

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
what I'm doing on screen you hopefully

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.330 
what I'm doing on screen you hopefully
survive<00:00:45.539> usually<00:00:46.289> survive<00:00:46.590> every<00:00:46.920> time<00:00:47.129> which

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
survive usually survive every time which

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
survive usually survive every time which
is<00:00:47.460> really<00:00:47.670> good<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.120> don't<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> keep

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
is really good so you don't have to keep

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.910 
is really good so you don't have to keep
respawning<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.289> coming<00:00:49.530> back<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> this

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
respawning and coming back to this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.369
