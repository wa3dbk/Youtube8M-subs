00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the end of windows 10 too 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.569
 will not jump on what it is up to 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.250
 Everything is up to date in the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.630
 flourishing streaming market why 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.280
 troll google into spas and that 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.780
 and who did that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.900
 won samsung galaxy 6, the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.410
 end of windows no windows 10 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.449
 no follower you can do you can 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 do many things 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.939
 can think twice - 11 already last 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.070
 week we already have apples 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.020
 Questionable methods reported the start 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.340
 her streaming service too bare 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.079
 successful 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.120
 but where you supposedly still 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.710
 wanted to discourage their record companies 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.750
 music for the free service of 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 to offer spotify is now suddenly 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.710
 also a free version of the new one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.719
 offers of apple in the room, however 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 only for a short test period around 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.140
 Take a look at the offer apple 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.340
 he assumes that a free 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.020
 Model not enough revenue 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.000
 generated and, above all, the user 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.480
 The payment option prevents this from happening 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.770
 choose 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 therefore it will be a completely free 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.670
 very likely will not give variation 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.559
 artist of his choice possibly the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 You can also get funds for free 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.350
 to provide 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.060
 Spotify is ready for any eventuality 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.070
 Schonmal and would like to soon 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 Videostream around itself just before the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.880
 start of apples streaming service yet 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.549
 could make it wider 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.680
 possibly also the loss of 197 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.049
 millions of dollars are declared the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.439
 list 2014 streaming service 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.570
 would have 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.950
 because it was probably rather invested with 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 to earn streaming over a lot 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.009
 is reflected in the record company 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.630
 warner music deserves that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.430
 meanwhile more money through streaming 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.950
 as by downloads clear that apple 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.079
 would like to take off with it apparently and 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.340
 spotify course and blame and 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:45.899
 soundcloud and youtube this and simfy 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 gta 5 just makes it feel like itself 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.439
 Play on the PC graphics moderately again 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.630
 clearly from the console version 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.040
 can take off just because of 4 k 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.780
 just a pity that hardly anyone 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.130
 appropriate hard possesses about that too 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 really savor 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.630
 that would like to change that in a timely manner and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 probably already in the middle of june 2015 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.210
 the speech 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.420
 93 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.280
 90 and again 390 exr from the one new 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.280
 pile storage technology will use 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.380
 which hbm high bandwidth memory calls 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.500
 and with 500 gb second clearly 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.470
 should be faster than gddr5 ram the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.690
 only 320 gb seconds will either create 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.630
 this technique probably only 2016 his 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.980
 but will install models with the gtx 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.900
 960t him one more year 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.489
 competitors to arm of the new fuji 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.510
 generations mentioned on graphic cards 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.520
 publish 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.569
 what the full 4k pixel then magnificently but 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.370
 in the end, wants holes in the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.959
 Purse rips remains to be seen 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.180
 big one of you already plays on 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.830
 pc in 4k let's go downstairs again 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:51.459
 Above all, the comments also know the comments 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:51.459
 with which setup 610 euro for me 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.790
 text again changes , however 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.260
 pixar is just a project 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.870
 pretty much through the ceiling in which one 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.570
 fully functional pc for only 9 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.150
 euro was still 25 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.870
 days are already almost 970,000 dollars 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.209
 come together 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.340
 and only 50,000 were targeted 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.650
 Small calculator banana in front of scale 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.570
 is with a 1 gigahertz processor 500 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.510
 megabyte of RAM 4 gb internal 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.940
 memory wifi and bluetooth equipped 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.320
 clear for gta 5 in 4k and 60 pictures 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.519
 it probably rather tight but for 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.870
 Office applications simple 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.519
 Image editing and one or the other 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.110
 Give it enough 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.940
 In addition, there is still the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.829
 so-called pocket chip from the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.900
 small calculator keeps a mini hand holding 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.940
 including touchscreen keyboard and one 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.950
 Battery then costs the whole but synonymous 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.079
 already 49 dollars looks in any case 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.420
 exciting from times to see if it's the chip 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.200
 in the form also with the price really 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.200
 creates on the market 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.390
 Windows 11 is probably on the chip sooner 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.610
 do not walk because it will not be 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.090
 windows elf give that said jerry nixon 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.430
 at the microsoft conference the end of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.379
 windows perfect nonsense rather 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.299
 microsoft changes its strategy and 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.129
 from now on his system will be steady 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.930
 improve instead of every few years 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.549
 to release a completely new os 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.849
 apple makes it similar there runs 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.380
 since 2001 asx which beside 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.269
 regular updates and new features 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.400
 just to distinguish first 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.650
 wildcats and beautiful landscapes now 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.450
 gets donated in the usa as often only 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.400
 regularly then updates and new 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.900
 will certainly show then still 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.130
 but that could then be doing a 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.260
 Become a bit more interesting then 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.000
 windows is synonymous very many screen 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.250
 you have computers and companies 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.930
 may not like so much 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.430
 often cede the system if the 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.570
 Software manufacturer there as well 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.220
 but afterwards come to the first 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.229
 update after the release is yes 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.229
 hopefully still time or microsoft 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.550
 internet gives you google the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.229
 Possibility to actively help google 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.180
 to improve maps, what was that for her ? 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.160
 pity and that is unfortunately only synonymous 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.289
 The tip of the iceberg is reason enough for 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.270
 google the make up program once 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.190
 suspend so that the trolls 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.729
 calm down and let off steam elsewhere 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.800
 youtube comments grace yourself 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.900
 Fortunately, our fans are no division 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.190
 leave nice constructive 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.169
 Comments are also on facebook 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.139
 instagram and will be very nice 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.760
 not exactly accurate and therefore gets 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.430
 now one of you a samsung 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.430

 we will contact you have fun 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.400
 With the win, everyone has to left 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.840
 By the way, the topics today are in steps 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.880
 the video description also the joke of the 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.360
 Really , players like us know them 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.000
 now on the chip computer gta 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.460
 5 to run and battlefield 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.460
 blog now and that hesse speaks
