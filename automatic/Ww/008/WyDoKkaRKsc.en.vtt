in the theory and you just want to play
it

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
it

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.840

just click where it says practice room
hero<00:00:38.120> intro<00:00:38.810> music<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:40.489> can<00:00:40.520> just<00:00:40.760> print

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
hero intro music and you can just print

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.290 
hero intro music and you can just print
it<00:00:41.090> off<00:00:41.239> from<00:00:41.360> there<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.660> play

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.240 

so<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.480> video<00:00:51.720> called<00:00:52.020> upper<00:00:52.470> structures<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so my video called upper structures I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
so my video called upper structures I
showed<00:00:53.700> you<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.880> way<00:00:54.060> of<00:00:54.090> generating<00:00:54.570> quite

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
showed you a way of generating quite

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.920 
showed you a way of generating quite
complex<00:00:55.910> voicings<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.030> dominant<00:00:57.600> seven

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
complex voicings for dominant seven

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.600 
complex voicings for dominant seven
chords<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.460> play<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.700> root<00:01:00.890> major<00:01:01.890> third<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
chords so play the root major third and

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.950 
chords so play the root major third and
the<00:01:03.210> flat<00:01:03.420> seventh<00:01:03.900> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.170> left<00:01:04.410> hand<00:01:05.960> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the flat seventh in the left hand so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870 
the flat seventh in the left hand so
once<00:01:07.140> we've<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.350> these<00:01:07.590> three<00:01:07.920> tones<00:01:08.400> covered

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
once we've got these three tones covered

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.680 
once we've got these three tones covered
in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> left<00:01:09.240> hand<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.560> right<00:01:10.770> hand<00:01:10.800> can<00:01:11.280> play

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
in the left hand the right hand can play

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.780 
in the left hand the right hand can play
various<00:01:12.690> triads<00:01:13.590> triad<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.550> three

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
various triads triad is just a three

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.570 
various triads triad is just a three
note<00:01:15.030> chord<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:16.530> play<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> D<00:01:17.040> major

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.500 

that<00:01:20.580> implies<00:01:20.910> C<00:01:21.330> dominant<00:01:21.510> seven<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> 9

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
that implies C dominant seven with a 9

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.000 
that implies C dominant seven with a 9
sharp<00:01:24.510> 11<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.710> 13<00:01:27.050> if<00:01:28.050> I<00:01:28.200> played<00:01:28.440> an<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> major

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
sharp 11 and a 13 if I played an a major

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.530 
sharp 11 and a 13 if I played an a major
triad<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.290> first<00:01:31.590> inversion<00:01:32.540> could

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
triad this is in first inversion could

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.920 
triad this is in first inversion could
give<00:01:33.720> me<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> flat<00:01:34.260> nine<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> third<00:01:36.300> again<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
give me a flat nine the third again and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.890 
give me a flat nine the third again and
the<00:01:37.970> thirteenth<00:01:41.180> but<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.300> practice<00:01:42.690> room

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
the thirteenth but the practice room

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.250 
the thirteenth but the practice room
hero<00:01:43.470> ident<00:01:44.040> uses<00:01:44.729> two<00:01:45.420> triads

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.460 

so<00:01:49.260> it<00:01:49.380> has<00:01:50.360> triad<00:01:51.360> built<00:01:51.600> with<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> flat<00:01:52.080> six

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so it has triad built with the flat six

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.950 
so it has triad built with the flat six
so<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.369> flat<00:01:53.640> major<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.429> has<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:57.030> G<00:01:57.720> flat

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
so a flat major and then it has a G flat

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.959 
so a flat major and then it has a G flat
major<00:01:58.140> triad

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.779 

and<00:02:01.149> both<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.689> these<00:02:01.899> triads<00:02:02.320> are<00:02:02.710> found<00:02:02.979> in

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
and both of these triads are found in

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.449 
and both of these triads are found in
the<00:02:04.329> altered<00:02:04.719> scale<00:02:04.899> so<00:02:05.649> see<00:02:06.189> altered

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.089 

so<00:02:10.459> we've<00:02:10.580> got<00:02:10.759> an<00:02:10.849> a-flat<00:02:11.120> major<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.980> we've

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
so we've got an a-flat major and we've

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.100 
so we've got an a-flat major and we've
got<00:02:13.250> G<00:02:13.849> flat<00:02:14.120> major<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.700> these<00:02:17.000> two<00:02:17.360> triads

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
got G flat major so these two triads

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.750 
got G flat major so these two triads
I<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.530> outline<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.420> altered<00:02:20.420> mode<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
I can outline the altered mode so in the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.680 
I can outline the altered mode so in the
left<00:02:22.940> hand<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:23.690> play<00:02:23.870> quarter<00:02:24.290> notes<00:02:28.690> then

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
left hand I just play quarter notes then

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.070 
left hand I just play quarter notes then
in<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> right<00:02:30.110> hand<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.680> alternate<00:02:31.250> between

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
in the right hand I alternate between

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.699 
in the right hand I alternate between
the<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> flat<00:02:33.560> major<00:02:34.099> triad<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:36.290> G<00:02:36.470> flat

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
the a flat major triad and the G flat

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.970 
the a flat major triad and the G flat
major<00:02:36.920> triad<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.319> then<00:02:39.319> I<00:02:39.349> go<00:02:39.530> through<00:02:39.560> each

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
major triad and then I go through each

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.860 
major triad and then I go through each
inversion<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.030> start<00:02:41.450> off<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.690> root

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
inversion so I start off in root

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.100 
inversion so I start off in root
position<00:02:44.530> then<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.650> go<00:02:45.799> down<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:47.110> second

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
position then I go down to second

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.600 
position then I go down to second
inversion<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.890> flat<00:02:52.130> major<00:02:52.280> and

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
inversion so this is a flat major and

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.619 
inversion so this is a flat major and
second<00:02:52.940> inversion<00:02:54.640> G<00:02:55.640> flat<00:02:55.849> major<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.299> second

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
second inversion G flat major and second

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.640 
second inversion G flat major and second
inversion<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:58.269> then<00:02:59.269> I<00:02:59.390> go<00:02:59.629> to<00:02:59.660> a<00:03:00.170> flat<00:03:00.500> major

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
inversion and then I go to a flat major

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.530 
inversion and then I go to a flat major
in<00:03:01.069> first<00:03:01.489> inversion<00:03:03.670> G<00:03:04.670> flat<00:03:04.910> major<00:03:05.090> and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
in first inversion G flat major and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.710 
in first inversion G flat major and
first<00:03:05.870> inversion<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:07.190> then<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.329> repeat<00:03:08.660> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
first inversion and then I repeat the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:18.220 
first inversion and then I repeat the
pattern<00:03:08.989> so

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.240 

and<00:03:20.409> rhythmically<00:03:21.409> this<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.890> kind<00:03:22.129> of

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
and rhythmically this is kind of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.940 
and rhythmically this is kind of
interesting<00:03:22.790> because<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:24.260> four<00:03:24.530> notes<00:03:24.769> in

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
interesting because I have four notes in

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.899 
interesting because I have four notes in
the<00:03:25.069> left<00:03:25.250> hand<00:03:27.310> these<00:03:28.310> are<00:03:28.370> just<00:03:28.640> playing

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
the left hand these are just playing

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.920 
the left hand these are just playing
quarter<00:03:29.360> notes<00:03:30.340> but<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.370> have<00:03:31.640> six<00:03:32.030> chords<00:03:32.540> to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
quarter notes but I have six chords to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.880 
quarter notes but I have six chords to
fit<00:03:33.140> in<00:03:33.319> in<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:34.069> same<00:03:34.250> space<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.700> time<00:03:35.120> as<00:03:35.890> the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
fit in in the same space of time as the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.390 
fit in in the same space of time as the
left<00:03:37.099> hand<00:03:37.370> plays<00:03:37.610> four<00:03:38.030> notes<00:03:39.099> so<00:03:40.099> that<00:03:40.129> means

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
left hand plays four notes so that means

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.260 
left hand plays four notes so that means
I<00:03:40.519> have<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.790> play<00:03:40.970> triplets

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.640 

so<00:03:49.270> it's<00:03:49.390> playing<00:03:49.540> three<00:03:49.900> notes<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.620> right

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
so it's playing three notes in the right

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.680 
so it's playing three notes in the right
hand<00:03:51.040> for<00:03:51.310> every<00:03:51.610> two<00:03:51.849> notes<00:03:52.120> in<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.450> left

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
hand for every two notes in the left

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:08.190 
hand for every two notes in the left
hand<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.480> I'm<00:04:01.959> using<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.470> pattern

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.040 

and<00:04:08.739> all<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:09.610> is<00:04:09.790> outlining<00:04:10.270> an<00:04:10.629> altered

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
and all of this is outlining an altered

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.440 
and all of this is outlining an altered
chord<00:04:11.319> and<00:04:11.640> altered<00:04:12.640> chords<00:04:13.000> are<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> type<00:04:13.420> of

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
chord and altered chords are a type of

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.860 
chord and altered chords are a type of
dominant<00:04:14.080> chord<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.459> C<00:04:15.940> dominant<00:04:16.480> seven

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
dominant chord so C dominant seven

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.610 
dominant chord so C dominant seven
always<00:04:17.410> wants<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.739> resolve<00:04:18.130> down<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.639> fifth<00:04:19.620> to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
always wants to resolve down a fifth to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.740 
always wants to resolve down a fifth to
F<00:04:20.919> major<00:04:21.430> or<00:04:21.760> F<00:04:21.910> minor<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.729> resolve<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.360> F

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
F major or F minor and I resolve it to F

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:40.759 
F major or F minor and I resolve it to F
minor<00:04:26.310> with<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.340> 6<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.300> 9

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:40.769 

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:44.249
