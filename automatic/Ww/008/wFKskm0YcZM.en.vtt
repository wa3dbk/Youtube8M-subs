00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.819 
and how many years it would take here's
what<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.780> nation<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.320> been<00:01:43.470> treated<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
what this nation has been treated to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.789 
what this nation has been treated to
from<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> president<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.909> recent<00:01:45.390> months<00:01:45.799> we

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
from the president in recent months we

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980 
from the president in recent months we
should<00:01:47.070> balance<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.610> budget<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.360> could<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
should balance the budget we could do it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
should balance the budget we could do it
in<00:01:49.110> seven<00:01:49.439> years<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.250> believe<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
in seven years I do not believe it is

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.380 
in seven years I do not believe it is
good<00:01:51.149> policy<00:01:51.560> based<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:53.520> understanding<00:01:53.790> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
good policy based on my understanding of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
good policy based on my understanding of
this<00:01:54.509> budget<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.229> pretty<00:01:55.409> good<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
this budget which is pretty good now to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.310 
this budget which is pretty good now to
do<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.090> seven<00:01:57.450> years<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.899> think<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
do it in seven years I think with the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.899 
do it in seven years I think with the
recent<00:01:58.619> nine<00:01:58.829> years<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.159> balanced<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
recent nine years you balanced the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.389 
recent nine years you balanced the
budget<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.479> ten<00:02:01.049> years<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.219> could

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
budget in ten years I think we could

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
budget in ten years I think we could
reach<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.790> eight<00:02:03.210> years<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.840> proposed

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
reach it in eight years I have proposed

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.410 
reach it in eight years I have proposed
a<00:02:04.530> balanced<00:02:04.860> budget<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.310> balances<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
a balanced budget that balances the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
a balanced budget that balances the
budget<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.869> nine<00:02:07.079> years<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.129> could

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
budget in nine years I think we could

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
budget in nine years I think we could
reach<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.729> seven<00:02:09.030> years<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.539> seven<00:02:09.929> year

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
reach it to seven years the seven year

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.290 
reach it to seven years the seven year
period<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.560> an<00:02:10.709> arbitrary<00:02:11.129> period<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.120> we're

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
period is an arbitrary period so we're

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.840 
period is an arbitrary period so we're
between

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
between

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.020 
between
seven<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.270> nine<00:02:13.480> now<00:02:14.280> our<00:02:15.280> budget<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.790> moved

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
seven and nine now our budget is moved

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.460 
seven and nine now our budget is moved
forward<00:02:16.390> from<00:02:16.420> ten<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.840> nine<00:02:17.020> years

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
forward from ten to nine years

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:29.030 
forward from ten to nine years
just<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.950> figure<00:02:18.130> picked<00:02:18.520> out<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.820> air

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.220 

but<00:02:29.280> frightening<00:02:29.909> thing<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.810> frightening

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
but frightening thing is the frightening

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.399
