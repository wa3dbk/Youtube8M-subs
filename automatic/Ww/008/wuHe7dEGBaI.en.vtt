and<00:01:58.300> what<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.230> look<00:01:59.380> for<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.740> pre-workout<00:02:00.100> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and what I look for in a pre-workout a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500 
and what I look for in a pre-workout a
lot<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.720> them<00:02:01.840> are<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.020> same<00:02:03.330> preferably<00:02:04.330> if

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
lot of them are the same preferably if

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.270

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
then I could trust it more because there

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.859
