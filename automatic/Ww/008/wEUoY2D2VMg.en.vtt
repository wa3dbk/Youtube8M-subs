00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.500
 last Wednesday in the google this 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.980
 company presented its new system 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 most recent operative the android l but 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.580
 only for developers here what 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.910
 we have these are the first 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.910
 impressions 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.590
 this time we have the nexus 5 that 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.169
 it's good because it's compatible with this 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.939
 Android version the most current that is 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.460
 for developers and it's also 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.350
 compatible the nexus 7 tablet only 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.690
 these two teams the first thing that we 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.720
 we can find is that in the bar 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.970
 navigation have new icons 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.640
 redesigned and also these buttons with 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.739
 the virtual buttons of bach of the home or 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.839
 good of the options are also a 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.469
 triangle a circle a square 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.440
 press the android version we are going to 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.899
 see what appears here is 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.610
 configuration we go to the party 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.080
 below where it says about the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.810
 device and says version of android l 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.759
 here is the model that is the nexus 5 and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.729
 we give you several clicks and the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.420
 There, there are very rare pictures 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.560
 nothing then and here says android the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.410
 point efe lb script build and good the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.250
 number we return to the home also 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.120
 something that changed is the redesign of the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.030
 notifications 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.550
 in the bar in the bar above as 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.640
 any other android we lower the bar 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.310
 of notifications and it's totally 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.200
 redesigned and here are all the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.300
 notifications that we have and this what 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.160
 I just did something new in the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.680
 previous androids we had to 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.240
 press a button now nothing else with 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.700
 press this bar or slide again 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.160
 appear our say 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.660
 configurations not where we can put 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.170
 the shortcuts of the location the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.400
 rotation the carrier wifi connection 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.800
 bluetooth 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.690
 notifications in airplane mode transmit 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.280
 screen that is the chrome cast that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.070
 that's why we're doing the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.790
 video like this with the camera and not capturing 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.950
 the video from the phone because no 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.530
 we managed to do it with the chrome cast and the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.690
 nexus 5 because it does not have a hdmi port and 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.880
 to do the direct capture then 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.220
 I apologize if you see it suddenly 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.290
 out of focus also some of the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.570
 things that change is the redesign when opening 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.319
 an application for example let's open 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.170
 maps 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.810
 of google maps and the animation appears 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.780
 down up we're going to open by 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.049
 example comcast happens the same thing we're going to 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.520
 opening of music happens the same this 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:56.510
 Android version is 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.430
 android l replaces de liu by arts 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.130
 just to improve the performance and 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.440
 that means that well, there's no 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.750
 cyanogenmod 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.750
 for this phone that is to say the cyan today 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.480
 in mode does not support arts thing that before 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.880
 it supported with the value that another of the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.580
 changes is in the virtual buttons that 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.030
 we have the square at the bottom 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.250
 is shown now in this way the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.640
 applications that you have open either 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.830
 that you can slide them and that's how you 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.280
 close or have a touch and cited in this 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.960
 part 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.290
 Let's see if we can see it 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.000
 s tache to also be able to close the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.770
 application or slide it like this 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.210
 for all those developers that 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.600
 are interested in this version 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.130
 android l we leave the league here in the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.560
 publication of 10 point com 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.800
 inside this post so they can 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.690
 download the developer version of 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.840
 android l that this android version l do not 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.050
 says neither 5.0 nor anything like that then 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.540
 we can assume that l from lollipop 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.570
 that means that possibly if it is 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.000
 the android version 5.0 but who knows 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.500
 those are all good assumptions 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.570
 because in broad strokes is what we can 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.330
 observe on the android l of course 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.850
 later there will be more tests more 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.720
 applications and more news about 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.280
 this operating system 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.280
 but well, it's the one that's coming 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.040
 and the interesting thing is that this matter of 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.920
 android web is the platform or the 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.510
 foundations for all types of applications 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.980
 Voice commands are very important 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.140
 so what you have is basically 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.030
 operating system of android but about 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.200
 all designed to communicate with the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.200
 self -talk way
