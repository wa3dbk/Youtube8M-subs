00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.670 
that and I'll do a more advanced
unwrapping<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.550> while<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.900> now<00:02:22.050> well

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
unwrapping in a while but right now well

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.770 
unwrapping in a while but right now well
I'm<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> basic<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.879> Harry

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
I'm just going to do the basic so Harry

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.380 
I'm just going to do the basic so Harry
a<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.140> select<00:02:25.530> everything<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.280> hit<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.910> euchy

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
a to select everything and hit the euchy

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.670 
a to select everything and hit the euchy
and<00:02:27.950> where<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.040> says<00:02:29.190> unwrapped<00:02:30.290> ok<00:02:31.290> we'll<00:02:31.500> do

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
and where it says unwrapped ok we'll do

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.770 
and where it says unwrapped ok we'll do
that<00:02:31.799> one<00:02:31.950> later<00:02:32.190> that's<00:02:32.489> for<00:02:32.879> more<00:02:33.510> advanced

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
that one later that's for more advanced

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.369 
that one later that's for more advanced
unwrapping<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.530> more<00:02:35.220> Pacific<00:02:35.870> alright<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.019> or

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
unwrapping in more Pacific alright so or

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.140 
unwrapping in more Pacific alright so or
it<00:02:37.470> says<00:02:37.590> unwrap<00:02:38.010> smart<00:02:38.310> projection<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.000> hit

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
it says unwrap smart projection just hit

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.460 
it says unwrap smart projection just hit
that<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:40.250> we're<00:02:41.250> says<00:02:41.599> island<00:02:42.599> margie<00:02:43.140> not<00:02:43.349> to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
that and we're says island margie not to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.559 
that and we're says island margie not to
worry<00:02:43.590> about<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.950> really<00:02:44.400> right<00:02:44.580> now<00:02:44.610> let's

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
worry about that really right now let's

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.160 
worry about that really right now let's
hit<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.890> um<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.190> now<00:02:47.400> we<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:47.989> everything<00:02:48.989> is

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
hit it um and now we have everything is

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.890 
hit it um and now we have everything is
unwrapped<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:49.829> took<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.069> 3d<00:02:50.430> object

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
unwrapped we just took this 3d object

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.809 
unwrapped we just took this 3d object
alright<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.079> took<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.349> 3d<00:02:52.620> object<00:02:53.069> took

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
alright we just took this 3d object took

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.199 
alright we just took this 3d object took
all<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> faces<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:56.090> flattened<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
all the faces on it and flattened it

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.220 
all the faces on it and flattened it
across<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.630> surface<00:02:59.090> now<00:03:00.090> or<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.810> do<00:03:01.049> now

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
across the surface now or we can do now

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.630 
across the surface now or we can do now
is<00:03:01.260> go<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.769> try<00:03:02.610> not<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.879> go<00:03:03.000> too<00:03:03.060> fast<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:04.640> well

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
is go to try not to go too fast but well

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.240 
is go to try not to go too fast but well
now<00:03:06.239> what<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.629> can<00:03:06.810> do<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.170> get<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> image<00:03:07.920> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
now what we can do is get the image and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
doing a game engine just notice that um

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.150 
doing a game engine just notice that um
when<00:03:54.870> you're<00:03:54.989> further<00:03:55.230> away<00:03:55.349> it's<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
when you're further away it's the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.339 
when you're further away it's the
picture<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.579> fuzzier<00:03:57.030> when<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.870> come<00:03:58.019> up<00:03:58.169> the

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
picture is fuzzier when you come up the

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.729 
picture is fuzzier when you come up the
picture<00:03:58.680> gets<00:03:58.889> clearer<00:03:59.430> oh<00:04:00.109> that's<00:04:01.109> just<00:04:01.290> so

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
picture gets clearer oh that's just so

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.559 
picture gets clearer oh that's just so
that<00:04:03.799> it<00:04:04.799> can<00:04:05.010> save<00:04:05.340> speed<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.090> your<00:04:06.209> computer

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
that it can save speed on your computer

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.110 
that it can save speed on your computer
and<00:04:06.750> also<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.859> hit<00:04:08.010> 52<00:04:08.519> where<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:08.880> go<00:04:08.970> in

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
and also if you hit 52 where you go in

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.849 
and also if you hit 52 where you go in
perspective<00:04:09.660> mode<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.079> go<00:04:10.139> inside<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.709> it

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
perspective mode and go inside of it it

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.970 
perspective mode and go inside of it it
looks<00:04:11.549> like<00:04:11.700> there's<00:04:11.910> nothing<00:04:12.030> even<00:04:12.450> there

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
looks like there's nothing even there

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.559 
looks like there's nothing even there
that's<00:04:13.980> because<00:04:14.310> your<00:04:14.519> your<00:04:14.940> texture<00:04:15.359> is<00:04:15.450> on

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
that's because your your texture is on

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.270 
that's because your your texture is on
the<00:04:15.690> other<00:04:15.840> side<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.590> hit<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.769> for

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the other side you have to hit a for

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.199 
the other side you have to hit a for
everything<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.859> then<00:04:19.859> hit<00:04:20.010> W<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.639> then<00:04:21.000> we're

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
everything and then hit W and then we're

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.080 
everything and then hit W and then we're
in<00:04:21.389> any<00:04:21.719> W<00:04:22.260> with<00:04:22.620> specials<00:04:23.099> you<00:04:23.789> have<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.000> hit

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
in any W with specials you have to hit

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.420 
in any W with specials you have to hit
two<00:04:24.330> sided<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.409> will<00:04:25.530> let<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.740> come

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
two sided and that will let it come

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.400 
two sided and that will let it come
2<00:04:26.639> inside<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:27.660> your<00:04:27.720> object<00:04:28.400> all<00:04:29.400> right<00:04:29.610> and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
2 inside of your object all right and

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.100 
2 inside of your object all right and
hit<00:04:31.410> zero<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.539> hopefully<00:04:33.539> I<00:04:33.570> think<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:33.960> did

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
hit zero and hopefully I think I did
