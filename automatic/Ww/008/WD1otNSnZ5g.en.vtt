for<00:00:05.040> me<00:00:05.160> electrical<00:00:05.730> engineering<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.509> taking

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
for me electrical engineering is taking

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.230 
for me electrical engineering is taking
information<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.160> being<00:00:08.580> able<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.849> implement

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
information and being able to implement

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.150 
information and being able to implement
that<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.750> any<00:00:09.929> sort<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.290> electrical<00:00:10.500> system

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
that in any sort of electrical system

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.950 
that in any sort of electrical system
and<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.730> really<00:00:11.910> find<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.269> fascinating<00:00:12.509> and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and I really find that fascinating and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.810 
and I really find that fascinating and
exciting<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:13.950> that's<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.370> way<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
exciting because that's the way of the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.310 
exciting because that's the way of the
future<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:15.540> technology<00:00:15.630> works

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
future and that's how technology works

computer<00:00:31.920> engineering<00:00:34.670> it<00:00:35.670> reminds<00:00:36.120> me<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
computer engineering it reminds me of a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.049 
computer engineering it reminds me of a
saying<00:00:38.280> by<00:00:38.670> arthur<00:00:39.329> c<00:00:39.540> clarke<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:40.610> really<00:00:41.610> an

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
saying by arthur c clarke of really an

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
saying by arthur c clarke of really an
acclaimed<00:00:42.570> science<00:00:43.110> fiction<00:00:43.469> writer<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.040> he

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
acclaimed science fiction writer and he

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.779 
acclaimed science fiction writer and he
said<00:00:44.700> any<00:00:45.710> technology<00:00:46.789> sufficiently

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
said any technology sufficiently

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
said any technology sufficiently
advanced<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.450> indistinguishable<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.469> magic

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
advanced is indistinguishable from magic

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.029 
advanced is indistinguishable from magic
and<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.440> look<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:52.890> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and so really one way to look at is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.799 
and so really one way to look at is
electrical<00:00:53.489> engineering<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.210> understand

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
electrical engineering is to understand

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.229 
electrical engineering is to understand
the<00:00:55.590> advanced<00:00:56.010> technology<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> makes<00:00:56.969> magic

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the advanced technology that makes magic

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
the advanced technology that makes magic
possible<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> few<00:00:59.070> smartphones

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
possible like like the few smartphones

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.450 
possible like like the few smartphones
there's<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.980> billions<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.160> billions<00:01:02.309> of

is then cut into small chips and these

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
is then cut into small chips and these
chips<00:01:09.200> are<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> devices<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.250> enable<00:01:12.119> these

part of undergrad education because they
really<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:36.210> theory<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.899> learn<00:01:37.080> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
really take the theory that you learn in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.609 
really take the theory that you learn in
class<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.369> allow<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.180> apply<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.530> of

how<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.769> use<00:02:10.890> marker<00:02:11.310> processors<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.600> program

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
how to use marker processors to program

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.630 
how to use marker processors to program
them<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.290> interface<00:02:13.950> them<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.400> various

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
them to interface them to various

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.479 
them to interface them to various
sensors<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:16.350> control<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:17.430> example

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
sensors and to control for example

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.660 
sensors and to control for example
motors<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.590> other<00:02:19.590> things<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.070> can<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.519> used

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
motors and other things that can be used

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.920 
motors and other things that can be used
to<00:02:21.110> autonomously<00:02:22.110> control<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.920> example<00:02:22.980> cars

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
to autonomously control for example cars

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.580 
to autonomously control for example cars
and<00:02:24.950> really<00:02:25.950> as<00:02:26.630> much<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> imagination

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
and really as much as the imagination

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.590 
and really as much as the imagination
can<00:02:28.739> allow<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.760> other<00:02:30.000> thing<00:02:30.180> I'd<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
can allow one other thing I'd like to

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.180 
can allow one other thing I'd like to
mention<00:02:31.049> about<00:02:31.350> Electrical<00:02:31.829> Engineering<00:02:32.070> is

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
mention about Electrical Engineering is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.440 
mention about Electrical Engineering is
that<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:33.000> really<00:02:33.239> pervasive<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.769> use

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
that it's really pervasive so we use

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.180 
that it's really pervasive so we use
electrical<00:02:36.450> engineering<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.500> lot<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.709> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
electrical engineering and a lot of the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
electrical engineering and a lot of the
technology<00:02:38.850> enables<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.930> our<00:02:40.170> homes<00:02:40.440> in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
technology enables in our homes in
