00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
that method there were some things

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.660 
that method there were some things
though<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.080> didn't<00:01:38.440> quite<00:01:38.530> work<00:01:38.619> for<00:01:38.860> me<00:01:39.399> I

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
though that didn't quite work for me I

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.200 
though that didn't quite work for me I
think<00:01:40.270> Lorraine<00:01:40.780> um<00:01:41.229> Massey's<00:01:42.159> hair<00:01:42.490> her<00:01:43.180> hair

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
think Lorraine um Massey's hair her hair

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.260 
think Lorraine um Massey's hair her hair
may<00:01:43.659> not<00:01:43.869> have<00:01:44.140> or<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.740> may<00:01:44.859> have<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.430> lot<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:45.880> oil

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
may not have or it may have a lot of oil

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.580 
may not have or it may have a lot of oil
so<00:01:46.570> she's<00:01:46.750> trying<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.079> pull<00:01:47.259> that<00:01:47.380> wall<00:01:47.530> out

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
so she's trying to pull that wall out

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.800 
so she's trying to pull that wall out
I'm<00:01:47.979> not<00:01:48.100> really<00:01:48.250> sure<00:01:48.369> but<00:01:49.270> her<00:01:49.420> book<00:01:49.600> doesn't

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
I'm not really sure but her book doesn't

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.940 
I'm not really sure but her book doesn't
cover<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.920> me<00:01:51.159> in<00:01:51.520> enough<00:01:51.850> detail<00:01:52.060> if<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:53.619> have

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
I'm kinky I'm hair and usually a lot of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.660 
I'm kinky I'm hair and usually a lot of
people<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.750> kinky<00:01:59.079> hair<00:01:59.289> they<00:01:59.679> need<00:01:59.979> oil<00:02:00.310> put

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
people with kinky hair they need oil put

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.300 
people with kinky hair they need oil put
onto<00:02:01.329> their<00:02:01.810> scalp<00:02:02.140> or<00:02:02.380> one<00:02:02.619> their<00:02:02.799> hair<00:02:03.039> your

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
onto their scalp or one their hair your

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.819 
onto their scalp or one their hair your
hair<00:02:03.609> x<00:02:04.359> tends<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.079> function<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> little<00:02:05.710> bit

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
hair x tends to function a little bit

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.609 
hair x tends to function a little bit
better<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.240> had<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:07.749> add<00:02:08.049> that<00:02:08.079> to<00:02:08.530> the

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
better so I had to add that to the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.130 
better so I had to add that to the
method<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.250> when<00:02:10.000> probably<00:02:10.570> like<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.780> second

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
method so when probably like the second

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.020 
method so when probably like the second
day<00:02:11.170> when<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> was<00:02:11.739> getting<00:02:11.829> second<00:02:12.310> day<00:02:12.400> hair<00:02:12.760> I

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
day when I was getting second day hair I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.240 
day when I was getting second day hair I
always<00:02:13.630> went<00:02:13.959> through<00:02:14.170> either<00:02:14.560> with<00:02:14.920> some

always went through either with some

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.710 
always went through either with some
olive<00:02:15.459> oil<00:02:15.910> or<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.299> hobo<00:02:16.750> oil<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:18.269> added<00:02:19.269> oil<00:02:19.480> to
