00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.410
 Barcelona is much more than my city is 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.289
 a place full of inspiration that 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.320
 feeds as an actress both add their 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.240
 mountain its streets its people and its food 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.890
 when I'm not working I like it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.829
 be with my friends around a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.040
 table and this city is full of good 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.040
 tables 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.770
 Marin that you say is around here, it's worth 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.180
 we can go to the nugget not 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.180
 images that you are not now 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.810
 and the nugget is the restaurant is a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.119
 name the name of our grandmothers and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.969
 it's mostly about what it gives 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.159
 meaning to the matter is our version the 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.539
 little veal of a lifetime no longer 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.909
 it's a sandwich now it's made to 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.429
 dish now we saw that we read 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.380
 feminized we have made it softer more 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.899
 thinner lighter 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.340
 is our our pretty girl and is what 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.340
 that makes sense another topic 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.580
 we are a tapas bar 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.230
 as such there are things that you are 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.850
 forced to have the covers of all the 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.860
 life are not the tapas with the braves the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.260
 Salad croquettes of tapas 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.700
 let's say the classic recipes adapt them 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.460
 in our way of doing things which 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.690
 it is this way that we seek with this 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.300
 we always seek rarely provoke in 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.060
 mouth look for nuances look for 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.070
 combinations to the things that ever tdt 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.840
 imaginary as we fear the anchovy 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.149
 that we would be with dulce de leche 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.649
 ask me not to like it but we know a 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.320
 classic point we have here the normal of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.610
 boats of the scale and we combine them 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.470
 with this we are always looking 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.880
 combinations that you will not find 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 in other places a little like what 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.480
 mark the difference we have these two 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.910
 philosophies on the one hand you have to keep 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.800
 this tradition of tapas and on the other hand 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 we have a little bit of getting out of the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.510
 tangent and do things that we are 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.050
 happen and I realized that people are 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.050
 talking about your things 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.519
 they ask you this takes chocolate in 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.870
 this sauce 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.670
 this does not look for the surprise at the plate 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.489
 look for the surprise in the mouth of the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.489
 client at the end and we got it 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.829
 the best are the customers and the people who 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.930
 he wants us to spoil us that returns 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.959
 talks about us and has been the client 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.569
 always our greatest publicist 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.000
 The loyal customer who has 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.159
 fact that we are now where we are and 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.959
 also we have gone 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.019
 reinventing with is obvious that's what 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.569
 better then the power to make people 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.250
 have a good time that you enjoy being 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.829
 we are going to make scams that go back to 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.689
 share good times with people 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.939
 here is this marriage has been requested 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.370
 it was already the last of so many 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.439
 things in the nugget that we could 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.959
 share with customers that for 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.409
 us that's the best without them 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.409
 exists
