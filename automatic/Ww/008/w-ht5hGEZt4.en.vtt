accomplishing that so what we're doing

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500 
accomplishing that so what we're doing
fundamentally<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.000> pushing<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
processing power up into the cloud so

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.319 
processing power up into the cloud so
the<00:00:41.100> consumer<00:00:41.430> doesn't<00:00:41.790> need<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> worry<00:00:42.210> about

what they have in their home any longer

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.400 
what they have in their home any longer
and<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> seven<00:00:46.260> years

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and so to do that it was a seven years

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
and so to do that it was a seven years
of<00:00:46.559> research<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.039> development<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.730> actually

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
of research and development to actually

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.190 
of research and development to actually
be<00:00:48.270> able<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> come<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> world's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
be able to come up with the world's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
be able to come up with the world's

effectively<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:52.050> allows<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
effectively it allows you to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.279 
effectively it allows you to
interactively<00:00:53.250> stream<00:00:53.670> video<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.570> input

and<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.320> quickly<00:00:58.500> enough<00:00:58.829> such<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
and we do it quickly enough such that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.189 
and we do it quickly enough such that
there's<00:00:59.579> no<00:00:59.730> perceptual<00:01:00.300> latency<00:01:00.750> such<00:01:00.960> that

there's no perceptual latency such that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.360 
there's no perceptual latency such that

live on on how you're going to roll that
out<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.630> mean<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.200> are<00:01:40.380> building<00:01:40.650> lots<00:01:41.340> of

out I mean so we are building lots of

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.010 
out I mean so we are building lots of
data<00:01:41.700> centers<00:01:42.119> around<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> country<00:01:42.570> actually

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
data centers around the country actually

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
data centers around the country actually
it<00:01:43.290> turns<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:43.740> five<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.640> on

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it turns out there five we have one on

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.010 
it turns out there five we have one on
the<00:01:44.850> east<00:01:44.880> coast<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> west<00:01:45.630> coast<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the east coast one of the west coast and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.719 
the east coast one of the west coast and
then<00:01:46.470> three<00:01:46.740> kind<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.100> through<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> center

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
then three kind of through the center

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.520 
then three kind of through the center
and<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.450> long<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.689> our<00:01:48.750> users<00:01:49.049> within

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and then as long as our users within

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
and then as long as our users within
exactly<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> thousand<00:01:50.520> miles<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
exactly a thousand miles they can have a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.139 
exactly a thousand miles they can have a
very<00:01:51.810> local<00:01:52.140> experience<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.520> yeah<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.000> our

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
very local experience and so yeah on our

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.639 
very local experience and so yeah on our
set<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> things<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.720> are<00:01:54.750> building<00:01:55.110> server

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
set of things we are building server

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
computing and that's kind of the geeky
term<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.759> what<00:01:59.909> what's<00:02:00.180> delivering<00:02:00.719> the

term for what what's delivering the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.120 
term for what what's delivering the
whole<00:02:01.049> thing<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> front<00:02:01.829> end<00:02:01.979> it's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
whole thing but at the front end it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.219 
whole thing but at the front end it's
essentially<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.820> games<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.329> demand<00:02:03.360> high

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
essentially it's games on demand high

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.929 
essentially it's games on demand high
end<00:02:04.439> games<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.189> delivered<00:02:05.700> straight<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
does something like OnLive you know deal

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.080 
does something like OnLive you know deal
with<00:02:19.200> issues<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> internet

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
with issues like that so if the internet

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.960 
with issues like that so if the internet
is<00:02:21.120> definitely<00:02:21.590> an<00:02:22.590> unstable<00:02:23.130> platform<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
is definitely an unstable platform to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.060 
is definitely an unstable platform to
develop<00:02:24.120> anything<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:24.960> top<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.620> what

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
develop anything on top of and what

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.650 
develop anything on top of and what
we've<00:02:26.220> done<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.460> lot<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.760> our<00:02:26.970> seven<00:02:27.390> years<00:02:27.570> and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
we've done a lot of our seven years and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.150 
we've done a lot of our seven years and
development<00:02:28.080> has<00:02:28.170> been<00:02:28.200> figuring<00:02:28.800> out<00:02:28.920> how<00:02:29.100> do

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
development has been figuring out how do

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.470 
development has been figuring out how do
we<00:02:29.280> fundamentally<00:02:29.610> work<00:02:30.030> with<00:02:30.300> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
we fundamentally work with the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.150 
we fundamentally work with the
properties<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> internet<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.650> delivering

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
properties in the internet so delivering

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.790 
properties in the internet so delivering
packets<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.750> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.810> an<00:02:33.900> unwieldy<00:02:34.230> business

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
packets is kind of an unwieldy business

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.410 
packets is kind of an unwieldy business
so<00:02:34.950> there's<00:02:35.100> lots<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.370> lag<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.880> jitter<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so there's lots of lag and jitter and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.800 
so there's lots of lag and jitter and
latency<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.960> routing<00:02:37.620> built<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.250> that's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
latency and routing built in and that's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.760 
latency and routing built in and that's
fundamentally<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> lot<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.140> what<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:40.380> solved

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
fundamentally a lot of what we solved

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.220 
fundamentally a lot of what we solved
and<00:02:40.890> how<00:02:41.010> do<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.190> get<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> low<00:02:42.060> latency<00:02:42.750> high

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
and how do you get a low latency high

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.470 
and how do you get a low latency high
compression<00:02:43.650> ratio<00:02:44.190> video<00:02:44.430> algorithm<00:02:45.360> in

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
compression ratio video algorithm in

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.440 
compression ratio video algorithm in
place<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> that's<00:02:47.310> that's<00:02:47.610> what<00:02:47.940> we've<00:02:48.060> solved

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
place so that's that's what we've solved

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.120 
place so that's that's what we've solved
and<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.050> play<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.350> at<00:02:49.470> home<00:02:49.590> over<00:02:50.010> your

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
and so you can play it at home over your

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.890 
and so you can play it at home over your
normal<00:02:50.400> dsl<00:02:50.820> or<00:02:50.850> cable<00:02:50.970> modem<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.600> you'll<00:02:51.720> see

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
normal dsl or cable modem and you'll see

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.420 
normal dsl or cable modem and you'll see
when<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> consistent<00:02:52.950> gaming

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
when you get a consistent gaming

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.730 
when you get a consistent gaming
experience<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:55.080> sort<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> secret

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
experience and this sort of the secret

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.400 
experience and this sort of the secret
is<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.890> what<00:02:56.250> we've<00:02:56.370> done<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.670> an<00:02:56.760> adaptive

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
is that what we've done is an adaptive

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.780 
is that what we've done is an adaptive
algorithm<00:02:58.410> such<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.860> as<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.250> internet<00:02:59.520> kind

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
algorithm such that as the internet kind

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.060 
algorithm such that as the internet kind
of<00:02:59.880> gets<00:03:00.060> bigger<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.600> slower<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.140> faster<00:03:01.200> we

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
of gets bigger and slower and faster we

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.920 
of gets bigger and slower and faster we
adapt<00:03:02.430> accordingly<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.390> from<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
adapt accordingly and so from the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.720 
adapt accordingly and so from the
consumers<00:03:04.410> perspective<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.280> know<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.520> image

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
consumers perspective you know the image

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.500 
consumers perspective you know the image
on<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.970> screen<00:03:06.090> stays<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.660> same<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:07.350> 720p

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
on the screen stays the same it's 720p

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.790 
on the screen stays the same it's 720p
60<00:03:09.510> frames<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.870> second<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.350> that's<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.590> standard

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
60 frames a second so that's a standard

there's<00:03:21.600> also<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:21.959> basically<00:03:22.170> a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
there's also going to be basically a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.180 
there's also going to be basically a
like<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.130> very<00:03:23.760> simple<00:03:24.209> small<00:03:24.630> box<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:25.830> if<00:03:26.070> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
like a very simple small box for if you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.470 
like a very simple small box for if you
want<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.459> hook<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.610> up<00:03:26.700> directly<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.120> your<00:03:27.209> TV

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
for this kind of stuff right now we're

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.840 
for this kind of stuff right now we're
not<00:03:30.720> yet

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
not yet

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.820 
not yet
you<00:03:31.970> know<00:03:32.090> we're<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:33.170> fundamental<00:03:33.740> issue

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
you know we're the fundamental issue

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.410 
you know we're the fundamental issue
that<00:03:34.190> we've<00:03:34.310> got<00:03:34.490> is<00:03:34.760> we're<00:03:35.030> building

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
that we've got is we're building

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.180 
that we've got is we're building
infrastructure<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.200> back<00:03:36.350> end<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.830> then

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
infrastructure in the back end and then

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.530 
infrastructure in the back end and then
minimizing<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.820> amount<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.090> hardware<00:03:38.330> the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
minimizing the amount of hardware the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.480 
minimizing the amount of hardware the
consumer<00:03:39.020> needs<00:03:39.200> on<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.500> front<00:03:39.740> end<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.370> know

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
consumer needs on the front end you know

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.710 
consumer needs on the front end you know
so<00:03:40.640> therefore<00:03:41.000> we<00:03:41.090> will<00:03:41.150> be<00:03:41.300> able<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.540> price

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
so therefore we will be able to price

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.510 
so therefore we will be able to price
the<00:03:41.900> service<00:03:42.230> very<00:03:42.440> attractively<00:03:43.040> relative

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
the service very attractively relative

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.280 
the service very attractively relative
to<00:03:43.670> existing<00:03:44.090> consoles<00:03:44.540> today<00:03:44.780> because<00:03:45.080> our

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
to existing consoles today because our

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.930 
to existing consoles today because our
cost<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.740> goods<00:03:45.800> that<00:03:46.190> what<00:03:46.550> goes<00:03:46.670> into<00:03:46.880> your

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
cost of goods that what goes into your

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.150 
cost of goods that what goes into your
home<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.330> so<00:03:47.510> much<00:03:47.660> lower<00:03:47.900> we're<00:03:48.770> not<00:03:48.890> giving

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
home is so much lower we're not giving

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.010 
home is so much lower we're not giving
tax<00:03:49.430> pricing<00:03:49.820> details<00:03:49.910> today<00:03:50.300> but<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.900> know

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
it definitely will be competitive if not

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.300 
it definitely will be competitive if not
