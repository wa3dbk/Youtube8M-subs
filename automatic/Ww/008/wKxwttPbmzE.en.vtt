00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.740
 bus that may not decrease 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.850

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 pumps there we may have used to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.930
 blow up the goal, huh? 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 because of that 250 pounds and let's go 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.480
 People are going to need a ph x card. 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.960
 so I'm going to get a square plate here 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 or line up the bus here and I go there 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.790
 board 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:11.790
 Let's weld the plate here to the galley. 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.570
 now I can solder the board in the air 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 along with the bus and we go to the chips 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.290
 now go 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.189
 the first chip you'll need is a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.040
 of games 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.549

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.430
 lesbian after us we will need 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.130
 a note reverses 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.409
 here also in logic here logic not in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.240
 fertile 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.399
 then logical not hospitalizations need 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.130
 of an ad hoc entity in haiti mexico where it is 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.710
 placed on top and a constant paulo 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.030
 with the value of the speed it goes 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.500
 Explode that's I'm going to put 30 here 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.689
 for us beauty 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.520
 this bus and this system that is based 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.829
 I do not know if you already 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.079
 that it is based on the bus that 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.360
 can not slow down after 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.280
 that you hit it for example if I 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.590
 get here on site 30 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.510
 it will arm pump I lower the pump 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.819
 is going to explode 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.079
 the guys if you want to watch the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:21.590
 movie you leave the description is also 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.329
 so let's play here our system is 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.860
 very simple they will catch the advance guard 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.560
 and I'll use a color for each chip 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.390
 to make it easier for you to understand 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.069
 put the red here he faces the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.659
 We will not play games. 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.370

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.560
 I have not read the forgot to put there 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.769

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.680
 and also the dual velocity media 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.079
 zone and a gallery that will show 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.760
 there panel speed is not necessary 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.250
 but add some in our system 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.500
 so I'll use a screen 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.079
 I will use here the first second and the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.560

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.730
 write here km h h 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.450
 I'll put it on the floor so I can 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:15.650
 move and I will try to position there 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:18.919

 not return to the years of bombs again 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.139
 putting an explosive in the air is normal 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.030
 because many of you can install
