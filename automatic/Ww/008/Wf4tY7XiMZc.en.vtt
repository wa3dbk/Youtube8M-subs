it's<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> fly<00:01:45.049> abstract<00:01:46.049> stuff

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it's kind of on the fly abstract stuff

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's kind of on the fly abstract stuff
you<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.350> another<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> same

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

you get that one another one do the same
thing<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.970> Miller<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.259> size<00:01:52.500> flip<00:01:52.829> it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
thing really Miller but all size flip it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.590 
thing really Miller but all size flip it
around<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.310> other<00:01:53.399> side<00:01:53.520> exact<00:01:54.060> same<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
around the other side exact same like

here Mitchell we get it my ride there
up<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.900> little<00:02:12.260> bit<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.870> get<00:02:15.019> another

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
up a little bit you can get another

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.740 
up a little bit you can get another
shape<00:02:15.530> we'll<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.519> use<00:02:16.730> for<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> good<00:02:17.299> example

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
shape we'll just use for a good example

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.460 
shape we'll just use for a good example
things<00:02:17.989> in<00:02:18.200> weird<00:02:20.349> little<00:02:21.349> bit<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.620> spin<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.099> it

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
things in weird little bit of spin on it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.699 
things in weird little bit of spin on it
move<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.620> about<00:02:24.950> right<00:02:25.580> there<00:02:25.940> will<00:02:26.209> say

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
move it about right there will say

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.240 
move it about right there will say
another<00:02:27.709> rule<00:02:27.909> named<00:02:28.909> Bill<00:02:29.680> Miller<00:02:30.680> bring<00:02:31.129> it

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
another rule named Bill Miller bring it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.569 
another rule named Bill Miller bring it
down<00:02:31.720> flip<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.129> I<00:02:34.220> did<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
down flip it just like I did on the

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.250 
down flip it just like I did on the
other<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:34.819> minus<00:02:35.090> one<00:02:35.239> just<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.959> get<00:02:36.110> on

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
other one minus one just like to get on

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.080 
other one minus one just like to get on
the<00:02:36.379> first<00:02:36.530> side<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:37.069> we'll<00:02:37.700> put<00:02:37.849> spin<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.450> it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
the first side and we'll put spin on it

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.970 
the first side and we'll put spin on it
which<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.239> about<00:02:41.420> right<00:02:41.659> right<00:02:41.930> there<00:02:42.170> may<00:02:42.950> be

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
which is about right right there may be

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.110 
which is about right right there may be
a<00:02:43.099> little<00:02:43.400> more<00:02:45.370> okay<00:02:46.370> let's<00:02:46.879> see<00:02:47.000> if<00:02:47.030> this

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
a little more okay let's see if this

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.640 
a little more okay let's see if this
thing's<00:02:47.420> even<00:02:47.569> you're<00:02:47.959> just<00:02:48.109> I'm<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.290> doing

thing's even you're just I'm just doing
this<00:02:48.709> for<00:02:48.799> reference<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.459> make<00:02:49.609> sure<00:02:49.730> it's

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
this for reference to make sure it's

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.330 
this for reference to make sure it's
even<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.239> was<00:02:50.329> just<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.660> Sweden<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.829> then

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
even it was just like Sweden and then

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
you will put that back right over a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.149 
you will put that back right over a
little<00:02:56.959> bit<00:02:57.760> all<00:02:58.760> right<00:02:59.000> there<00:02:59.239> like<00:02:59.390> then<00:03:00.159> but

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
out like so let's say even and flip it

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:31.270 
out like so let's say even and flip it
same<00:03:24.139> minus<00:03:24.739> one<00:03:25.629> in<00:03:26.629> size<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:30.019> move<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.099> back

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
same minus one in size and move it back

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.369 
same minus one in size and move it back
over<00:03:31.489> like<00:03:31.790> stuff<00:03:34.419> you<00:03:35.419> can<00:03:35.599> make<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:35.959> even<00:03:36.139> it

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
over like stuff you can make it even it

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.789 
over like stuff you can make it even it
up<00:03:36.440> like<00:03:36.680> so<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:38.319> just<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.470> give<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:39.680> an<00:03:39.739> idea
