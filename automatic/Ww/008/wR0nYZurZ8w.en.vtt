00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi everyone how are they how they see ya 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.480
 we finally have the nexus 5 and now 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.069
 we will do a double a boxing of your two 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.069
 black and white versions 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.830
 good to start as you can see in 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.020
 the boxes there are some differences in the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.540
 black only the team of 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.410
 front and on the white is included the 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.539
 side team 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.609
 yes 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.090
 as you know and this fact again 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.700
 the gym in the back and we see the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.310
 Equipment color directly 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.360
 and that would be all the design similar to 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.630
 nexus 7 this year 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.220
 and now we'll see what each team brings 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.820
 as I said this will be a double a boxing 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.820
 very fast 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.350
 here we have the black nexus and this is the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.359
 nexus on white 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.080
 with the first sight it seems that there is no 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.080
 many differences 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.729
 only when we look at it for the part of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.539
 back we'll just notice the color 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.539
 directly 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.160
 now we will see what the boxes include 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.510
 accessories as you know it is simply going to 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.520
 bring the manuals 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.520
 the end to get the microsim 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.620
 some indications in Spanish and others 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.620
 languages the charger and the usb cable 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.620
 good in the white version too 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 the same accessories so we will obviate 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.150
 this good step now we will see 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.670
 quickly some differences between 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.760
 the nexus and black and white 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.020
 first the material that like the one that is 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.640
 built in both is plastic but 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.090
 the finish is different in the black is 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.070
 a half gummy touch 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.070
 and in the white it is smoother 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.910
 also on the sides in the black is 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.760
 a simple finish let's say 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.220
 and on the white the black is a tone 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.920
 bright a gloss and the design is 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.610
 exactly the same on both the buttons 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.950
 of volume on 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.950
 microusb input headphone 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.269
 everything is exactly the same 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.409
 and as you can see in the version in 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.640
 white the headset is also the same 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.890
 colour 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.530
 good once the equipment and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.530
 configured now we will review some 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.520
 very fast functions since a next 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.520
 analysis we can see it completely 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.770
 well you know that android 4.4 includes 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.390
 the navigation bars and 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.420
 transparent notifications 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.500
 and a new way to add widgets 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.500
 the icons are bigger 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.170
 and well that would be all up to the moment 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.400
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel and we 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.400
 we see in a next video
