 he has all day plus type he has behind 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 the little chest in which most likely serves 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 then it will take your money somewhere 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.780
 but authors 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 the creeper is the creeper's anatomy that is it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.340
 half of the creeper and half of its part 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 here is such a cell look even 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 he has a skeletal leg let's talk 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.239
 and here it is the creeper and then 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 move on to the anatomy of our creeper 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.340
 also consists our cry just talk 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.110
 well and all that is when you are that creeper 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.960
 as you can see is the most common creeper from 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.950
 him moving legs here they are like this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 fasten here 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.360
 nothing much no stripes which 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 here close this is all white also 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 no that is very sad but in principle 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 nothing wrong 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.470
 it also has a top attached here 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.020
 big-big message all over your head 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.369
 Tintin is also two small then they are on 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 which is not written throw 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.119
 but there is to know this or where 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 in Hindi and such 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 gossamer it is on top there and also flooded 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.619
 all little little chest all the places for 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.200
 stickers die in this revenue various 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.030
 seem like letters if i'm not mistaken so 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.909
 you do pretty just because 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.200
 what are you patiently toughness and glasses just 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.299
 handsome don't you 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.649
 well guys now we turn with 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.850
 you to 2 to the leader 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.860
 this we set aside for now 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.990
 next we move on to our anatomy 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 creeper is much more interesting because 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.920
 this is exactly what our creeper is 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.270
 austrian you see what it consists of 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.420
 half of a day 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.299
 from bones prince like any other living thing 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.950
 can tell creation and so half 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.619
 our creeper still here but it 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.720
 green it's done as usual here's how 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.910
 normal clipper yes this size is this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.370
 a little more but generally as usual 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.890
 criterion if anything fell into the famous she 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.510
 straight sweep and it goes I think many 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.000
 of you did so i think you know 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.160
 how to do this part of the foot are made 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.790
 usually it is usually done simply that 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.280
 half 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.950
 inside then it is glued in here 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.500
 the red thing is such its 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.420
 chornenkaya. . by the way cut out 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.800
 separately because it's bit by bit 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.690
 section on top of pitlane 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.610
 but even if you didn't succeed 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.890
 ok cut and stick then she 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.420
 there is painted so yes if u 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.340
 you did not work he will be there anyway 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.910
 drawn only bulk and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.920
 drawn head is done 1 by the way 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.110
 saying the head is done they are not half 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.900
 green half white head are made 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.410
 all other such white summer release k from 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.570
 bones 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.400
 it is clear that I am crushed here and this 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.530
 poked toothpicks pretty hard 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.420
 because it's the head I'm when her 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.190
 put the word on this green head 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.910
 she didn't want to take over 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.549
 so I even made a hole in 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.840
 tried to shove something with a toothpick 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.640
 how much happened but still here 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.079
 here here is a video forcibly than anything and you 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.680
 the teeth are not clean 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.600
 straighten 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.220
 it is this place because 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.650
 much i could from the clip roll the head 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.459
 then it got into this green part 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.010
 ganga again you things go on here 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.840
 such here further by the way by the waist 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.510
 I did not succeed at all and did not understand 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.370
 such bend probably my narrow 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.640
 a disadvantage because I did not understand how 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.950
 bend bent somehow see there 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.320
 where is red but from the side it is not particularly 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.780
 visible and in principle it looks waist 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.329
 pretty decent inside our share 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.510
 lies tintin which are glued here 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.370
 bone and pulled this books katenka 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.630
 leave this red thing that time 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.790
 entered the body 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.670
 and half avalanche clouds of our green 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.910
 creeper go further go his legs do not 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.430
 consist of two parts this is the leg itself 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.160
 and the foot itself, that is, pretty 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.470
 just do the main thing out there 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.840
 is done just this is the answer strip and 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.390
 the volume is glued on both sides more precisely 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.310
 there is something like that shorter so much 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.810
 volume will kill volume and stick with two 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.730
 Now these parties here in the parties and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.310
 it turns out that this is how in volume 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.800
 parties who made swords tolerate they will understand 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.570
 principle so here it is done it will knock 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.660
 it's also pretty easy to bend 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.850
 and so on to move the legs below 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.650
 there is here such here but was not attaching 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.560
 here are some squares there 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.600
 creeper years mostly many creepers are not 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.550
 It was to fix these glues 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.170
 This is of course a big minus because 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.690
 agree more beautiful when night 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.240
 stuck in but in general that he will 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.040
 showing the scraper as a whole is pretty 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.780
 did not move his legs well 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.670
 I think maybe he will somehow askew 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.180
 stand but no guys it just stands 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.130
 wonderful so all the creek focusing 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.710
 and here we are with you today 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.390
 there were two dance creeper you liked 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.330
 this video if it is so then of course 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.990
 put husky sweep and this and that 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.420
 creeper will be food 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.000
 the main thing is to straighten his paws because 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.010
 what's half of it 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.310
 discrete and become a little bit skew 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.060
 like this then exactly the size 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.460
 cars volume 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.830
 both creeper description under video well on 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.100
 This is all guys with you was Sasha and all 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.100
 until
