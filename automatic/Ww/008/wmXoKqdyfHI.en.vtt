00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that but i do know that we got in an

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
that but i do know that we got in an
august<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.299> i<00:01:36.450> believe<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> been<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
august so i believe it's been about a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.260 
august so i believe it's been about a
month<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.280> may<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.549> gotten<00:01:38.729> august

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
month actually we may have gotten august

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.359 
month actually we may have gotten august
seven<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.590> honest<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.920> don't<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.130> know

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
seven to be honest I don't really know

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
seven to be honest I don't really know
the<00:01:41.460> exact<00:01:41.759> date<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.150> again<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:42.600> quote<00:01:42.840> me

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the exact date so again don't quote me

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
on that but I do believe that it's been

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.160 
on that but I do believe that it's been
roughly<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> month<00:01:45.299> since<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.689> got<00:01:45.899> our<00:01:46.020> last

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
roughly a month since we got our last

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710 
roughly a month since we got our last
update<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.799> GTA<00:01:47.130> 5<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.970> before<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.450> got<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
update for GTA 5 now before we got the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.880 
update for GTA 5 now before we got the
flight<00:01:48.930> school<00:01:49.140> update<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
flight school update was the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.100 
flight school update was the
Independence<00:01:50.460> Day<00:01:50.520> DLC<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.509> believed<00:01:51.869> at

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
Independence Day DLC and I believed at

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.600 
Independence Day DLC and I believed at
the<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.200> from<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> Independence<00:01:53.280> Day<00:01:53.369> DLC

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the time from the Independence Day DLC

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510 
the time from the Independence Day DLC
to<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> flight<00:01:54.659> school<00:01:54.869> DLC<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.530> was<00:01:55.799> 42<00:01:56.310> days

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
to the flight school DLC it was 42 days

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.010 
to the flight school DLC it was 42 days
since<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.850> had<00:01:56.969> gotten<00:01:57.180> another<00:01:57.479> patch<00:01:57.780> or

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
since we had gotten another patch or

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.200 
since we had gotten another patch or
another<00:01:58.200> DLC<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.280> long<00:01:59.759> time<00:01:59.969> for

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
another DLC that's a very long time for

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
another DLC that's a very long time for
rockstar<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.689> release<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> DLC<00:02:01.530> because<00:02:02.250> I'm<00:02:02.430> if

theory<00:02:50.700> videos<00:02:51.090> or<00:02:51.299> at<00:02:51.420> least<00:02:51.600> some<00:02:51.900> videos

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
theory videos or at least some videos

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.289 
theory videos or at least some videos
including<00:02:53.250> information<00:02:53.489> found<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
including information found in the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.809 
including information found in the
source<00:02:54.540> codes<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.959> GTA<00:02:55.470> 5<00:02:55.680> online<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.790> a

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
source codes of GTA 5 online that a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.120 
source codes of GTA 5 online that a
credible<00:02:57.750> hackers<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.410> credible<00:02:58.769> modders

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
credible hackers and credible modders

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.590 
credible hackers and credible modders
have<00:02:59.340> actually<00:02:59.670> uncovered<00:03:00.120> from<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.390> source

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
have actually uncovered from the source

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.509 
have actually uncovered from the source
codes<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.930> GTA<00:03:01.260> 5<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:02.040> it's<00:03:02.280> very<00:03:02.400> possible

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
codes of GTA 5 so it's very possible

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.280 
codes of GTA 5 so it's very possible
that<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.269> getting<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.540> DLC<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.080> next

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
that we can be getting a DLC in the next

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.350 
that we can be getting a DLC in the next
couple<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.560> days<00:03:04.799> however<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.850> just<00:03:06.090> wanted<00:03:06.330> to

couple of days however I just wanted to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840 
couple of days however I just wanted to
say<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.799> think<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.400> should<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.670> very

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
say that I think that we should be very

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.850 
say that I think that we should be very

in the work to release some okay two

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.330 
in the work to release some okay two
very<00:03:20.880> good<00:03:21.000> deal<00:03:21.299> sees<00:03:21.570> every<00:03:21.930> month<00:03:22.170> or<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.590> so

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
very good deal sees every month or so so

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.590 
very good deal sees every month or so so
we<00:03:23.579> also<00:03:23.700> need<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.940> keep<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.239> mind<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.450> these

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
we also need to keep in mind that these

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.090 
we also need to keep in mind that these
DLCs<00:03:25.049> are<00:03:25.230> free<00:03:25.560> i<00:03:25.590> guess<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:25.920> could<00:03:26.070> argue

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
DLCs are free i guess you could argue

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.560 
DLCs are free i guess you could argue
that<00:03:26.489> they're<00:03:26.609> not<00:03:26.730> free<00:03:27.000> because<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.450> may

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
that they're not free because you may

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.330 
that they're not free because you may
have<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.780> purchase<00:03:27.989> shark<00:03:28.920> cards<00:03:29.190> because

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
have to purchase shark cards because

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.160 
have to purchase shark cards because
everything<00:03:29.820> is<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:29.940> expensive<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.810> those

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
everything is so expensive in those

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.110 
everything is so expensive in those
deals<00:03:31.410> needs<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:31.859> virtually<00:03:32.190> these<00:03:32.489> DLCs<00:03:32.910> are

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
deals needs but virtually these DLCs are

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.060 
deals needs but virtually these DLCs are
free<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.510> they<00:03:34.230> are<00:03:34.440> released<00:03:34.769> pretty

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
free and they are released pretty

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.410 
free and they are released pretty
frequently<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:35.730> we<00:03:35.850> do<00:03:35.970> need<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.239> credit

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
frequently so we do need to credit

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.270 
frequently so we do need to credit
rockstar<00:03:36.930> for<00:03:37.079> that<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:37.799> know<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.040> there

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
rockstar for that now I know that there

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.650 
rockstar for that now I know that there
weren't<00:03:38.430> very<00:03:38.549> many<00:03:38.760> key<00:03:39.150> points<00:03:39.480> made<00:03:39.630> in

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
weren't very many key points made in

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.330 
weren't very many key points made in
today's<00:03:39.989> video<00:03:40.170> however<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.890> just<00:03:40.950> wanted<00:03:41.310> to

get a quick point across to you guys
being<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.140> do<00:03:43.260> think<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:43.769> need<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.980> be

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
being that I do think that we need to be

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.560 
being that I do think that we need to be
a<00:03:44.100> little<00:03:44.400> bit<00:03:44.549> more<00:03:44.670> appreciative<00:03:45.329> towards

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
a little bit more appreciative towards

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.449 
a little bit more appreciative towards
rock<00:03:45.780> star<00:03:46.049> when<00:03:46.410> they<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.620> release<00:03:46.950> DLCs

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
rock star when they do release DLCs

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.460 
rock star when they do release DLCs
considering<00:03:48.030> one<00:03:48.269> they<00:03:48.450> are<00:03:48.630> free<00:03:48.900> with<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
considering one they are free with the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.440 
considering one they are free with the
exception<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.010> possibly<00:03:50.579> buying<00:03:50.820> shark<00:03:51.180> cards

for the content in the dlc and they do

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.069 
for the content in the dlc and they do
release<00:03:53.670> them<00:03:53.880> pretty<00:03:54.150> frequently<00:03:54.569> again

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
release them pretty frequently again

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.479 
release them pretty frequently again
guys<00:03:55.230> there<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> little<00:03:55.799> bit<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.069> variance

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
guys there is a little bit of variance

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.039 
guys there is a little bit of variance
in<00:03:56.640> between<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.120> times<00:03:57.329> where<00:03:57.870> they<00:03:57.989> do

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
in between the times where they do

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.900 
in between the times where they do
release<00:03:58.410> these<00:03:58.620> DLCs<00:03:59.069> but<00:03:59.459> for<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.670> most<00:03:59.790> part

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
release these DLCs but for the most part
