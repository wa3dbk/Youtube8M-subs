meat you're going to put this in a
preheated<00:01:35.520> oven<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.780> at

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
preheated oven which is going to be at

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.880 
preheated oven which is going to be at
225<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.150> then<00:01:39.150> once<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> gets<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.380> you're

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
225 and then once it gets out you're

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
225 and then once it gets out you're
going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.460> break<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.180> into<00:01:42.390> like

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
going to want to break it up into like

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.389 
going to want to break it up into like
three<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.140> four<00:01:43.200> large<00:01:43.560> pieces<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
three or four large pieces so that it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.399 
three or four large pieces so that it
starts<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.790> cool<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
starts to cool this is one of the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
starts to cool this is one of the
smaller<00:01:46.710> pieces<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.369> we've<00:01:47.790> already

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
smaller pieces that we've already

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.210 
smaller pieces that we've already
precooked<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:49.020> ready<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.040> pull

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
precooked and have ready here to pull

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.160 
precooked and have ready here to pull
apart<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> comes<00:01:51.119> apart<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.780> nicely

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
apart and it comes apart so nicely

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.700 
apart and it comes apart so nicely
because<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.799> been<00:01:53.000> slow<00:01:54.000> cooking<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.930> five

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
because it's been slow cooking for five

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.270 
because it's been slow cooking for five
to<00:01:55.890> six<00:01:56.159> hours<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.119> nice<00:01:57.329> low<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.930> slow

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
to six hours so just nice low and slow

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.190 
to six hours so just nice low and slow
for<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> amount<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.880> time<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
for that amount of time so so are you

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
people might do it with a fork can you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.490 
people might do it with a fork can you
just<00:02:06.329> shut<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.960> could<00:02:07.140> shred<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
just shut it up you could shred it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169 
just shut it up you could shred it
definitely<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> fork<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> key<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
definitely with a fork the key is is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.669 
definitely with a fork the key is is
just<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.599> make<00:02:09.780> sure<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.200> cool<00:02:10.440> enough

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
just to make sure that it's cool enough

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.760 
just to make sure that it's cool enough
for<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.310> pull<00:02:11.700> apart<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.239> time

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
for you to pull apart at that time

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.170 
for you to pull apart at that time
so<00:02:13.040> I'm<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.430> do<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:13.730> my<00:02:13.850> hands<00:02:14.030> my

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
so I'm going to do it with my hands my

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.600 
so I'm going to do it with my hands my
hands<00:02:14.360> are<00:02:14.510> gloved<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.100> make<00:02:16.250> sure<00:02:16.280> that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
hands are gloved just to make sure that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.070 
hands are gloved just to make sure that
we're<00:02:16.730> getting<00:02:16.850> some<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.270> larger<00:02:17.870> fat

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
we're getting some of the larger fat

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.930 
we're getting some of the larger fat
pieces<00:02:18.350> out<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.680> there<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.100> those<00:02:19.280> will<00:02:19.550> still

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
pieces out of there so those will still

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.120 
pieces out of there so those will still
exist<00:02:20.600> they<00:02:21.140> might<00:02:21.320> not<00:02:21.470> have<00:02:21.560> all<00:02:21.680> cook<00:02:21.950> down

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
exist they might not have all cook down

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.680 
exist they might not have all cook down
totally<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.030> I'm<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.300> going<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.480> start

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
totally and I'm just going to start

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690 
totally and I'm just going to start
transferring<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.410> pan<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:25.520> I've

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
transferring it to this pan that I've

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.780 
transferring it to this pan that I've
got<00:02:25.910> some<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.450> already<00:02:27.100> done<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.280> here<00:02:28.580> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
