00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 for now well today as I told you we are going 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.650
 to see my top my best apps for 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.059
 root user 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.910
 well then stop talking and let's start 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.160
 good the first my first app 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.160
 what I'm going to teach you is called 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.460
 uninstaller root pro and has that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.810
 icon we give you is everything as your 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.740
 own name indicates serves to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.020
 uninstall applications 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.750
 that come to us or that we have installed 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.430
 to us or especially the system that 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.050
 is what we are going to do in principle 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.059
 download well then this for example 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.550
 I am going to erase now later a 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.590
 background called beach 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.500
 it's good that as you can see it has to the side 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.379
 what does it say even though that is and it means 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.399
 system such as funds from 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.649
 screen the keyboard the browser that 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.260
 otherwise we can not erase it without 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.500
 But with this app although it 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.930
 we give you we are going to erase bits 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.210
 Here we have the options 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.250
 that we initially will only touch 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.610
 one but good 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.640
 it puts us freeze uninstall directory 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.400
 from the state we in principle only 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.930
 we will touch uninstall that is good is 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.810
 for then to uninstall it here 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.790
 We give you to uninstall and we are 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.619
 give up the unap a background a a something of the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.050
 mobile that otherwise we could not 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.720
 uninstall is highly recommended for 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.430
 all those who are root because 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.920
 As you can see, the mobile will fill you 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.009
 shit shit from the operator that if my 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 web of vodafone myth I do not know what of 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.280
 vodafone games of these demos that no 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.640
 you can erase because it's a pain in the ass 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.850
 have there occupying memory 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.420
 occupying memory memory and time because 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.900
 in pounds in short is a mess that you 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.380
 shit well then we go now to the second 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.010
 the second one is called titanium backup in 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.370
 that this is very good especially if 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 change if you're about to change the run if 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.390
 in short this is a 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.080
 this is one that allows you to erase or 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.080
 uninstall applications 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.519
 for example make backup copies of 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.500
 the applications if we want 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.500
 format the phone as we make a 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.629
 backup or just in case 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.760
 we want to delete them we make a copy of 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.400
 security in order that has many 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.140
 lots of options to use this app and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.980
 it's also like I tell you very very 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.230
 recommendable 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.409
 let's go to the third one called root 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.769
 explorer this is very good because it is 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.840
 very good because this in principle is 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.450
 to delete files that we do not 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.740
 we want in the mobile for example work 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.440
 a game 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.780
 Of course, uninstall the game 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.400
 uninstalled but the package in the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.060
 package data are still in the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.240
 phone for us through that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.430
 if we can do it we can get into 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.700
 the folder that we want with care 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.480
 because we can 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.540
 we can mess it up 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.140
 mess it up well because as I say this 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.270
 is you get in the bowels of the phone 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.030
 you can do this with everything but 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.170
 also load the phone should not 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.810
 go you should not be very silly very 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.800
 fast but good here as you see then 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.430
 are the ones that download me in order 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.690
 which is to erase to delete apps or 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.090
 data let's go now with africa atfrie is 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.569
 let's give it here to a normal and every 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.440
 once we get the button on the right 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.600
 normal put and we give 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.120
 this is for each time you download a 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.100
 game or an app 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.560
 it's usually going to put you advertising 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.650
 but I already have it updated 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.670
 from the director but hey we usually 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.590
 going to put publicity worth and as 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.510
 we do not want advertising because 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.330
 you peta the mobile that goes slower than 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.700
 sucks internet in order then simply 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.120
 we give to the free 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.090
 We give you install installs install us 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.340
 and it tells us that the phone is already 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.900
 is free of advertising and now 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.590
 it simply asks us to restart the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.590
 phone for 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.210
 good for what 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:53.169
 perfect fine let's now go to another app that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.139
 it's wifi that this one has a little bit of crumb 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.379
 because this one has a bit of crumb 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.090
 this me the first time he provides it 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:04.110
 leave the internet computer 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.110
 desktop of my house 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.940
 that is bitten vale 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.790
 because it's a bitch I almost got it 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.980
 until I knew it was ice cream and finally 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.280
 and this has nothing, not simply 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.190
 give and you give to scan to activate 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.220
 your wifi when you get into something effective 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.920
 this what he will do will be power as his 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.870
 name indicates killing the wifi or removing the 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.510
 wifi in case you think it steals from you 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.150
 someone wifi from your mobile you can 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.250
 It is highly recommended to do 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.480
 because now steal a password from 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.700
 wifi is very easy and of course it is not 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.530
 well that you are in your house and the wifi 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.290
 you go slower than you are paying and 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.820
 there is another one, your neighbor from 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.640
 up and down because they take away your 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.550
 bad wifi then now from the mobile 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.310
 we can leave it without internet and 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.840
 there are three options to leave it without internet and 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.270
 that he thinks he has internet alone 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.180
 that is slow to leave 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.820
 without internet and networks to redirect 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.070
 what page or leave it without internet 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.580
 and put a message like fuck you 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.360
 bastard for example and now we go for me 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:20.660
 to the jewel in the crown 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:24.410
 lv eprivacy guard this for me is let's go 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.330
 necessary necessary this as you will have 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.360
 I could check the downloads some 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.730
 I play some music player and you 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.820
 asks for access to phone calls that 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.400
 you wonder what the fuck you want 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.529
 access to phone calls a game 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.429
 not the angry birds 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:45.919
 Well, in principle, just in case 

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:48.769
 you never know how to key I guess yoga 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.689
 April read and if not I tell you there 

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:53.299
 people that by downloading a game that 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:55.969
 he asked that he sent a message to all 

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:58.429
 his contacts saying he was a defaulter 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.379
 I do not know what the hell it is that you do not 

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:03.649
 happens to nobody that none of us believe it 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:06.109
 until we have a good time with this 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:09.379
 we can grant permits and deny 

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:12.169
 permits not only for permits to 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:14.119
 call or do not call just in case 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:17.089
 we have an app that our rate of 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:19.729
 internet is limited we can take away the 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:22.099
 internet for for example a game your you 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.929
 download a game and if you mess with 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:26.689
 internet with the internet plugged in 

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:28.759
 mind advertising well with this 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:30.529
 We can deny you the publicity to 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:33.910
 that the internet does not suck us so 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:36.970
 have to disconnect the internet 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:39.340
 or spend internet foolishly this good 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.710
 well it is very very highly recommended here 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.320
 you see all my apps that ask us good 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.310
 then phone calls call send 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.850
 sms 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.530
 things that I have now deactivated 

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.860
 but that now in the camera the video 

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.440
 activate and good because in principle that is 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.380
 all 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.660
