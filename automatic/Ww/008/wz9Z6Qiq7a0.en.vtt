decided to skip the flyweight division
for<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.190> reason<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.760> mean<00:00:42.270> there's<00:00:42.329> only<00:00:42.600> one

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
for some reason I mean there's only one

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.450 
for some reason I mean there's only one
reason<00:00:43.020> why<00:00:43.260> he<00:00:43.410> would<00:00:43.530> skip<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.160> it's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
reason why he would skip it because it's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.010 
reason why he would skip it because it's
just<00:00:44.550> packed<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.180> talent<00:00:45.660> at<00:00:45.750> least<00:00:45.870> that's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
just packed with talent at least that's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.150 
just packed with talent at least that's
what<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> mean<00:00:46.829> there's<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
what I think so I mean there's the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.880 
what I think so I mean there's the
chocolatito<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.300> strata<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.960> there's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
chocolatito there's a strata and there's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.930 
chocolatito there's a strata and there's
some<00:00:50.160> um<00:00:52.190> another<00:00:53.190> bunch<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> fighters<00:00:53.760> but

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
some um another bunch of fighters but
