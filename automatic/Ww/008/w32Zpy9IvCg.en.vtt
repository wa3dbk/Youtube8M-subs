the first thing we have to talk about

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.240 
the first thing we have to talk about
though<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.120> fact<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:43.260> still<00:00:43.860> looks

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
though is the fact that it still looks

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
though is the fact that it still looks
as<00:00:44.460> good<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> day<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> got<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.020> I've

as good as the day I got it and I've

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
as good as the day I got it and I've
been<00:00:46.170> using<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.620> thing<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.070> two<00:00:47.280> weeks<00:00:47.520> so

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
been using this thing for two weeks so

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
been using this thing for two weeks so
whatever<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.149> made<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.600> case<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> it's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
whatever they made this case out of it's

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
whatever they made this case out of it's
pretty<00:00:50.190> impressive<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.239> does<00:00:51.600> seem

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
pretty impressive because it does seem

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
pretty impressive because it does seem
to<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.140> incredibly<00:00:52.949> durable<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.430> something

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to be incredibly durable it's something

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
to be incredibly durable it's something

I've got some charging cables as well as

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.479 
I've got some charging cables as well as
some<00:03:17.220> nuts<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.079> bolts<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:19.799> really<00:03:20.340> that's

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
some nuts and bolts so really that's

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.240 
some nuts and bolts so really that's
about<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.910> for<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> tour<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:22.139> case<00:03:22.440> we've

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
about it for the tour of the case we've

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.559 
about it for the tour of the case we've
seen<00:03:23.489> cases<00:03:23.700> like<00:03:23.819> this<00:03:23.940> before<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
seen cases like this before with the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.720 
seen cases like this before with the
same<00:03:24.810> interior<00:03:25.200> layouts<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:26.340> got<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.579> same

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
same interior layouts it's got the same

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.940 
same interior layouts it's got the same
plusses<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.180> minuses<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.720> almost<00:03:28.560> all<00:03:28.799> in

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
plusses and minuses of almost all in

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.490 
plusses and minuses of almost all in
case<00:03:29.069> we<00:03:29.190> looked<00:03:29.370> at<00:03:29.459> like<00:03:29.579> this<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:30.000> has<00:03:30.500> it's

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
case we looked at like this it has it's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.629 
case we looked at like this it has it's
great<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.769> keeping<00:03:31.920> things<00:03:32.190> organized

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
great for keeping things organized

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.610 
great for keeping things organized
because<00:03:33.030> everything<00:03:33.480> has<00:03:33.660> their<00:03:33.840> own<00:03:34.079> pocket

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
because everything has their own pocket

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.199 
because everything has their own pocket
but<00:03:34.799> then<00:03:34.980> again<00:03:35.099> it's<00:03:35.459> not<00:03:35.639> so<00:03:35.790> great<00:03:35.910> because

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
but then again it's not so great because

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.330 
but then again it's not so great because
the<00:03:36.299> use<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.599> space<00:03:36.810> isn't<00:03:37.139> as<00:03:37.440> good<00:03:38.160> as

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
the use of space isn't as good as

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.410 
the use of space isn't as good as
something<00:03:38.579> that's<00:03:38.670> more<00:03:38.849> open<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.359> more

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
something that's more open and more

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.910 
something that's more open and more
flexible<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.290> protection<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.829> these

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
flexible but the protection of these

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.830 
flexible but the protection of these
kind<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.160> cases<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.609> higher<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.299> there's

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
kind of cases is higher so there's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.089 
kind of cases is higher so there's
trade-offs<00:03:43.169> on<00:03:43.440> both<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.739> them<00:03:43.889> if<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.069> have

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
trade-offs on both of them if you have

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.920 
trade-offs on both of them if you have
something<00:03:44.489> that's<00:03:44.639> just<00:03:44.819> one<00:03:45.120> big<00:03:45.299> pocket<00:03:45.510> yes

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
something that's just one big pocket yes

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.900 
something that's just one big pocket yes
you'll<00:03:46.139> fit<00:03:46.290> more<00:03:46.470> stuff<00:03:46.709> inside<00:03:46.889> of<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.280> but

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
you'll fit more stuff inside of it but

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.640 
you'll fit more stuff inside of it but
you're<00:03:48.180> also<00:03:48.209> gonna<00:03:48.510> have<00:03:48.750> more<00:03:49.139> chances<00:03:49.530> of

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
you're also gonna have more chances of

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.409 
you're also gonna have more chances of
damaging<00:03:50.010> your<00:03:50.040> cameras<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.299> just

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
damaging your cameras so you can just

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.240 
damaging your cameras so you can just
kind<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.569> have<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.720> decide<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.440> what<00:03:52.769> works

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
kind of have to decide on what works

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.720 
kind of have to decide on what works
best<00:03:53.760> for<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:55.079> case<00:03:55.380> I've<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:56.190> found

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
best for you this case I've I found

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.699 
best for you this case I've I found
doesn't<00:03:57.269> work<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.599> great<00:03:57.660> for<00:03:58.019> storing<00:03:58.380> many

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
doesn't work that great for storing many

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.930 
doesn't work that great for storing many
accessories<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.430> just<00:03:59.579> doesn't<00:03:59.819> have<00:03:59.910> that

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
accessories it just doesn't have that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.319 
accessories it just doesn't have that
much<00:04:00.389> space<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:00.959> pocket<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.500> fairly<00:04:01.950> small

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
much space this pocket is fairly small

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.059 
much space this pocket is fairly small
so<00:04:03.329> it's<00:04:03.720> really<00:04:03.870> just<00:04:04.049> kind<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.410> camera<00:04:04.889> and

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
so it's really just kind of a camera and

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.210 
so it's really just kind of a camera and
battery<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:06.290> small<00:04:07.290> accessories<00:04:07.889> kind<00:04:08.160> of

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
battery and small accessories kind of

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.550 
battery and small accessories kind of
like<00:04:08.340> basically<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.359> can<00:04:09.480> take<00:04:09.510> exactly<00:04:10.260> what

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
like basically you can take exactly what

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.470 
like basically you can take exactly what
comes<00:04:10.799> with<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:11.010> hero<00:04:11.220> 4<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.120> can<00:04:12.209> fit<00:04:12.389> it

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
comes with a hero 4 and you can fit it

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.659 
comes with a hero 4 and you can fit it
perfectly<00:04:12.750> into<00:04:13.349> this<00:04:13.500> case<00:04:13.799> that's<00:04:14.310> how<00:04:14.519> I

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
perfectly into this case that's how I

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.430 
perfectly into this case that's how I
was<00:04:14.880> using<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.480> basically<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.840> got<00:04:16.079> my<00:04:16.169> hero4

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
was using it so basically I got my hero4

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.770 
was using it so basically I got my hero4
black<00:04:16.590> i<00:04:17.010> unboxed<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.180> unpacked<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.690> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
black i unboxed it and unpacked it and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.779 
black i unboxed it and unpacked it and
then<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.530> make<00:04:19.560> sure<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.010> kept<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.459> hero4

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
then to make sure that I kept the hero4

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.640 
then to make sure that I kept the hero4
black<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.419> hero4<00:04:21.690> silver<00:04:21.959> accessories<00:04:22.289> them

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
black and hero4 silver accessories them

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.990 
black and hero4 silver accessories them
to<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:22.830> separate<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.280> put<00:04:23.460> each<00:04:23.580> one<00:04:23.640> of<00:04:23.880> them

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
to be separate I put each one of them

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.020 
to be separate I put each one of them
into<00:04:24.599> its<00:04:24.719> own<00:04:24.930> case<00:04:25.530> just<00:04:25.979> like<00:04:26.130> this

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
into its own case just like this

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.760 
into its own case just like this
then<00:04:27.180> four<00:04:27.420> out<00:04:27.600> all<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.900> my<00:04:28.080> review<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.440> kept

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
then four out all of my review I kept

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.930 
then four out all of my review I kept
all<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.889> accessories<00:04:29.430> for<00:04:29.610> each<00:04:29.730> of<00:04:29.880> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
all the accessories for each of the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.060 
all the accessories for each of the
cameras<00:04:30.300> organized<00:04:31.200> that<00:04:31.470> way<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.830> didn't

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
cameras organized that way so I didn't

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.650 
cameras organized that way so I didn't
they<00:04:32.280> didn't<00:04:32.490> walk<00:04:32.790> away<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.060> didn't<00:04:33.330> lose<00:04:33.480> them

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
they didn't walk away I didn't lose them

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.730 
they didn't walk away I didn't lose them
because<00:04:33.720> each<00:04:33.960> one<00:04:34.110> had<00:04:34.290> different<00:04:34.320> back

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
because each one had different back

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.440 
because each one had different back
doors<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.100> stuff<00:04:35.340> like<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.639> so<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:36.330> was

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
doors and stuff like that so that was

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.270 
doors and stuff like that so that was
how<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:36.630> was<00:04:36.690> using<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.230> for<00:04:37.710> storing<00:04:38.190> the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
how I was using it and for storing the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.710 
how I was using it and for storing the
accessories<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:38.700> come<00:04:38.880> just<00:04:39.480> with<00:04:39.630> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
accessories that come just with the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.980 
accessories that come just with the
camera<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.230> case<00:04:40.860> like<00:04:41.070> this<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.520> perfect<00:04:42.180> so

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
camera a case like this is perfect so

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.960 
camera a case like this is perfect so
the<00:04:43.440> conclusion<00:04:43.950> comes<00:04:44.160> out<00:04:44.280> like<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
the conclusion comes out like this the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.260 
the conclusion comes out like this the
zinc<00:04:45.240> case<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:46.190> very<00:04:47.190> similar<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.610> many<00:04:47.850> others

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
zinc case is very similar to many others

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.510 
zinc case is very similar to many others
we've<00:04:48.480> seen<00:04:48.840> but<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.470> does<00:04:49.680> have<00:04:49.919> this<00:04:50.100> very

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
we've seen but it does have this very

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.540 
we've seen but it does have this very
cool<00:04:51.150> texture<00:04:52.110> on<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.800> top<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:53.130> it<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.280> makes

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
cool texture on the top of it that makes

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.909 
cool texture on the top of it that makes
it<00:04:53.669> kind<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.150> stand<00:04:54.690> out<00:04:54.840> from<00:04:55.110> other<00:04:55.290> cases<00:04:55.770> on

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
it kind of stand out from other cases on

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.890 
it kind of stand out from other cases on
the<00:04:56.070> market<00:04:56.430> there's<00:04:57.060> something<00:04:57.419> with<00:04:57.540> cloth

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
the market there's something with cloth

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.590 
the market there's something with cloth
tops<00:04:58.260> or<00:04:58.560> some<00:04:58.740> with<00:04:58.889> kind<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.310> hard<00:04:59.610> mesh<00:05:00.330> tops

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
tops or some with kind of hard mesh tops

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.570 
tops or some with kind of hard mesh tops
but<00:05:00.750> this<00:05:00.900> one<00:05:01.020> has<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.290> really<00:05:01.530> kind<00:05:02.520> of

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
but this one has this really kind of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.360 
but this one has this really kind of
shine<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.390> slightly<00:05:03.780> shiny<00:05:04.230> fake<00:05:04.830> carbon

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
shine and slightly shiny fake carbon

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.620 
shine and slightly shiny fake carbon
looks<00:05:06.090> like<00:05:06.270> carbon<00:05:07.370> top<00:05:08.370> on<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:08.910> it<00:05:09.450> is

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
looks like carbon top on it and it is

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.260 
looks like carbon top on it and it is
pretty<00:05:10.590> rigid<00:05:10.770> there<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.310> flex<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:11.970> but<00:05:12.180> it

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
pretty rigid there is flex to it but it

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.080 
pretty rigid there is flex to it but it
is<00:05:12.390> definitely<00:05:12.710> molded<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.669> is<00:05:14.790> fairly

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
is definitely molded and it is fairly

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.780 
is definitely molded and it is fairly
waterproof<00:05:15.630> so<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:15.930> top<00:05:16.169> is<00:05:16.470> this<00:05:17.370> material

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
waterproof so this top is this material

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.680 
waterproof so this top is this material
at<00:05:17.850> least<00:05:17.910> they're<00:05:18.120> advertising<00:05:18.600> as

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
at least they're advertising as

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.090 
at least they're advertising as
water-resistant<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:19.560> you<00:05:19.620> can<00:05:19.800> pour<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.010> glass

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
water-resistant so you can pour a glass

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.500 
water-resistant so you can pour a glass
of<00:05:20.280> water<00:05:20.460> on<00:05:20.610> top<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.850> this<00:05:20.970> nothing<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.390> gonna

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
of water on top of this nothing is gonna

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.870 
of water on top of this nothing is gonna
happen<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:22.169> your<00:05:22.710> stuff<00:05:22.950> inside<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.669> it<00:05:23.760> does

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
happen to your stuff inside and it does

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.520 
happen to your stuff inside and it does
have<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.090> little<00:05:24.360> bit<00:05:24.600> of<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.870> water<00:05:25.050> resistant

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
have a little bit of a water resistant

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.750 
have a little bit of a water resistant
zipper<00:05:25.800> this<00:05:25.979> is<00:05:26.100> definitely<00:05:26.280> more<00:05:26.520> water

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
zipper this is definitely more water

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.820 
zipper this is definitely more water
resistant<00:05:27.120> than<00:05:27.180> most<00:05:27.450> zippers<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.440> could

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
resistant than most zippers so you could

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.230 
resistant than most zippers so you could
probably<00:05:29.130> feel<00:05:29.340> fairly<00:05:29.580> confident<00:05:29.970> having

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
probably feel fairly confident having

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.810 
probably feel fairly confident having
this<00:05:30.300> thing<00:05:30.479> splashed<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.380> your<00:05:32.220> gear<00:05:32.490> inside

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
this thing splashed and your gear inside

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.110 
this thing splashed and your gear inside
would<00:05:33.270> not<00:05:33.540> get<00:05:34.110> wet<00:05:34.650> kind<00:05:35.310> of<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.460> cool<00:05:35.729> feature

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
would not get wet kind of a cool feature

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.990 
would not get wet kind of a cool feature
of<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.660> and<00:05:36.840> kind<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.740> maybe<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:38.040> factor<00:05:38.790> that's

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
of it and kind of maybe a factor that's

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.180 
of it and kind of maybe a factor that's
this<00:05:39.120> apart<00:05:39.510> from<00:05:39.630> others<00:05:39.930> cases<00:05:40.320> if<00:05:40.890> you<00:05:41.070> guys
