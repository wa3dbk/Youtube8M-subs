hey<00:00:06.450> guys<00:00:06.660> want<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.140> quick<00:00:07.379> video<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
hey guys want to do a quick video on a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.860 
hey guys want to do a quick video on a
mutation<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.910> think<00:00:09.150> doesn't<00:00:09.420> get<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> lot<00:00:09.750> of

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
mutation I think doesn't get a lot of

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.570 
mutation I think doesn't get a lot of
play<00:00:10.139> but<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:11.160> that's<00:00:11.190> really

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
play but it's one that's really

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.030 
play but it's one that's really
accessible<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.330> folks<00:00:12.480> even<00:00:12.900> though<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.139> don't

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
accessible for folks even though I don't

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.470 
accessible for folks even though I don't
really<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> big<00:00:14.670> budget<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.269> can<00:00:15.360> add<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
really have a big budget and can add a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.420 
really have a big budget and can add a
lot<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.020> don't<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.500> know<00:00:16.590> kick<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> lot<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
lot of I don't you know kick to a lot of

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.519 
lot of I don't you know kick to a lot of
different<00:00:17.580> projects<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.480> won't<00:00:19.140> claim<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
different projects I won't claim to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.740 
different projects I won't claim to
nearly<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> master<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.029> mutation

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
nearly be the master of this mutation

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.330 
nearly be the master of this mutation
that<00:00:21.960> goes<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.560> been<00:00:22.710> Renick<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> few

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
that goes to have been Renick and a few

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.009 
that goes to have been Renick and a few
folks<00:00:23.550> like<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.779> few

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
folks like that but I have a few

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
folks like that but I have a few
different<00:00:25.230> variations<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.130> no<00:00:26.939> combos

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
different variations of this no combos

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.519 
different variations of this no combos
of<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.539> gene<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:27.900> collection<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> thought

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
of this gene in my collection I thought

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.300 
of this gene in my collection I thought
I<00:00:28.560> talked<00:00:28.800> about<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I talked about it

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
I talked about it
so<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.789> mutation<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.240> called<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> spot<00:00:30.840> nose

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so this mutation is called the spot nose

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.069 
so this mutation is called the spot nose
so<00:00:31.940> for<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> folks<00:00:33.149> who<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.870> worked

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
so for the folks who have not worked

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.720 
so for the folks who have not worked
with<00:00:34.290> them<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> have

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
with them how do you know if you have

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.819 
with them how do you know if you have
you<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> spot<00:00:36.660> most<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.469> thing<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
you see a spot most but one thing is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
you see a spot most but one thing is

the face the reason they called the spot

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.859 
the face the reason they called the spot
nose<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.470> she<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:07.740> has<00:01:08.270> spots<00:01:09.270> out<00:01:09.689> there

nose is she actually has spots out there
along<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> nose<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.700> strong

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
along the nose so really really strong

along the nose so really really strong
head<00:01:12.150> stamp<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.659> these<00:01:12.840> guys<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
head stamp on these guys and then the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
head stamp on these guys and then the
spot<00:01:14.070> nose<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:16.530> coloration<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.850> vary

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
spot nose there the coloration can vary

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.249 
spot nose there the coloration can vary
a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.299> bit<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.689> they're<00:01:18.780> generally<00:01:18.900> about

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
a little bit but they're generally about

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.490 
a little bit but they're generally about
this<00:01:19.439> color<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> dark<00:01:20.280> golden<00:01:20.490> color<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
this color kind of a dark golden color a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.740 
this color kind of a dark golden color a
little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.650> darker<00:01:23.009> along<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.610> sides<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
little bit darker along the sides and a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.560 
little bit darker along the sides and a
little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.080> lighter<00:01:25.229> along<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> dorsal

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
little bit of lighter along the dorsal

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
little bit of lighter along the dorsal
so<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:27.810> let's<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.200> let's<00:01:28.829> compare<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so but let's see let's compare this to a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.140 
so but let's see let's compare this to a
combination<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:36.259> smaller<00:01:37.259> girl<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
combination a smaller girl here is a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.980 
combination a smaller girl here is a
fire<00:01:39.570> spot<00:01:39.990> nose<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:42.090> big<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.630> stay

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
fire spot nose and the big one will stay

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.240 
fire spot nose and the big one will stay
in<00:01:43.110> place<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.799> put<00:01:43.950> her<00:01:44.009> away<00:01:44.130> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
in place and they have to put her away I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
in place and they have to put her away I
just<00:01:44.369> wanted<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> show<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:45.810> real<00:01:46.020> quick

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just wanted to show them real quick

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600 
just wanted to show them real quick
together<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:46.950> how<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.250> lighter

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
together so you can see how much lighter

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.950 
together so you can see how much lighter
the<00:01:47.850> fire<00:01:48.090> version<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.860> general

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
the fire version is just in general

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.730 
the fire version is just in general
alright<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.939> when<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> fire<00:01:54.450> version<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.649> I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
alright so when the fire version like I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.039 
alright so when the fire version like I
said<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.250> saw<00:01:56.460> them<00:01:56.579> side<00:01:56.790> by<00:01:56.820> side<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.810> fire

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
said you saw them side by side the fire

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.440 
said you saw them side by side the fire
is<00:01:58.229> lighter<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.430> headstand<00:01:59.850> becomes<00:02:00.180> even

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is lighter the headstand becomes even

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
is lighter the headstand becomes even
more<00:02:00.479> pronounced<00:02:01.259> mainly<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.490> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
more pronounced mainly because it just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
more pronounced mainly because it just
fades<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.810> interior<00:02:04.200> part<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.619> gets

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
fades the interior part of it gets

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
fades the interior part of it gets
lighter<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.610> makes<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> really

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
lighter so it really makes it really

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.580 
lighter so it really makes it really
makes<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.509> stand<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.280> fire<00:02:09.590> spa

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
makes it stand out now not all fire spa

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.380 
makes it stand out now not all fire spa
nose<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.220> clean<00:02:11.640> she<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:12.060> happens<00:02:12.330> to

lo pattern but you know that fire some

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.260 
lo pattern but you know that fire some
fires<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.980> tend<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.280> clean<00:02:17.460> up<00:02:17.550> pattern<00:02:17.910> as

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
fires can tend to clean up pattern as

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.490 
fires can tend to clean up pattern as
you<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.540> see<00:02:18.660> though<00:02:18.810> even<00:02:19.080> though<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.290> girl

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you know in most fires that becomes a

you know in most fires that becomes a
kind<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.190> chocolate<00:02:29.670> brown<00:02:29.910> almost<00:02:30.390> of

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
girl to fire this is the fire that's a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.120 
girl to fire this is the fire that's a
little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:42.960> older<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.350> it's<00:02:43.650> lightened<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
little bit older so it's lightened up a

little bit more you can see just if you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.830 
little bit more you can see just if you
see<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.220> patterning<00:02:48.060> next<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.540> each<00:02:48.630> other

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
see the patterning next to each other

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.580 
see the patterning next to each other
the<00:02:49.830> actual<00:02:50.250> fire<00:02:50.520> has<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> lighter<00:02:51.590> lighter

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the actual fire has a lighter lighter

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.560 
the actual fire has a lighter lighter
pattern<00:02:53.070> along<00:02:53.280> here<00:02:53.520> than<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.880> fire<00:02:54.240> spot

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
pattern along here than the fire spot

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.790 
pattern along here than the fire spot
nose<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.050> see<00:02:58.200> that's<00:02:58.380> what<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
nose so you can see that's what the to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.960 
nose so you can see that's what the to
look<00:02:58.980> like<00:02:59.160> next<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.490> each<00:02:59.550> other<00:02:59.760> so<00:02:59.880> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
look like next to each other so the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.750 
look like next to each other so the
colorings<00:03:00.360> close<00:03:00.660> when<00:03:00.990> this<00:03:01.190> fire<00:03:02.190> spot<00:03:02.550> girl

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
colorings close when this fire spot girl

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.280 
colorings close when this fire spot girl
gets<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.300> bit<00:03:03.480> bigger<00:03:03.720> she'll<00:03:04.080> lighten
