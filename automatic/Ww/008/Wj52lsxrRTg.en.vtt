00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 February 6, 1995 I gave birth to one 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.599
 of the most emblematic pokemon and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.240
 strong of the youtube saga if guys today 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.250
 just 20 years since his birth 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.350
 I would like to honor him by telling you 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.910
 small story about its origin 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.369
 this story that I am going to tell you is the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.230
 short of the first pokemon movie there 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 However, this short was not issued in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 many countries for the content on 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.280
 ethical issues said this we go for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.410
 there 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.300
 two years after the terrible tragedy 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.490
 that took the life of Miss 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.890
 miyamoto a team rocket group was 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.990
 look for remnants of your research and the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.850
 body of the same girl when arriving at 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.040
 guyanas and looking in the mountain where 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.900
 it had disappeared thanks to a gps 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.760
 that all rocket members have 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.590
 they could find the exact location 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.930
 from where he was when he arrived 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.760
 They found a frozen corpse but no 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.340
 just that but with a smile on his 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.440
 face and in your hand the voice recorder 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.870
 that took to the trip the information that 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.980
 contained surprised many and from that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.420
 exact day started the youtube project the 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.020
 creation of the strongest pokemon in 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 world having adn of my own the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.040
 commissioned this funded research 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.360
 by giovanni is the doctor or fuji many 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.340
 they believe that doctor fuji is the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.750
 counterpart of the Lord I was the one who gives you 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.580
 the little flute and the one in charge of 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.710
 pokemon cemetery others have the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.140
 theory that the same fuji doctor is the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.850
 same sir fuji from town the band that 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.560
 then declare fear and survive from the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.760
 destruction that this caused in the first 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.159
 pokemon movie and all that 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.259
 paradoxically it came and went back to 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.790
 put the band to be the protector of 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.130
 life and death that's why they're 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.960
 in the cemetery in the end this expedition 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090
 I had the mission of traveling the Guianas 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.700
 in order to find DNA 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.770
 very miu to start the process of 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.900
 cloning and the miuto and the little more 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.210
 powerful and all that after several days 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.550
 They found a temple dedicated to me 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.250
 where what appeared to be a 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.960
 little eyelash but actually 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.880
 it looks like a thorn but this is not very 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 Of course in fact you do not know almost not good 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.110
 you will never know where they got the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.150
 adn of mine because this one can not have 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.190
 children or anything like that when you get 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.590
 the DNA started the second phase of the plan 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.380
 break down all the genetic code of mine 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.180
 and improve it duplicate it and clone it this 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.040
 process can last for many years now 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.959
 that the DNA sequence of a species 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.270
 it's so long and every part is important 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.860
 to produce a new being maybe in 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.080
 about 15 years could be obtained this 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.540
 information and so proceed to the next step 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.830
 difficult cloning this step in 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.660
 special reason why the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.590
 doctor bellows accepted to be part of the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.390
 investigation 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.340
 I needed knowledge about creating life 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.350
 so bring your daughter back 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.030
 amber who died as a child was so much 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.459
 his obsession was so much that day and night 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.330
 study how to bring her back and 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.490
 it was so many 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.410
 despair that even his wife what 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.780
 He left other pokemon charm under chu 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.460
 squirt the her vulva search were also 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.000
 part of the tests and it was so that a 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.430
 miuto day was born the term in live steel 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.900
 light is unlikely since my 1 was 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.970
 captured is also a pokémon 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.040
 legendary and I could not have offspring 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.270
 but the scientists had to write 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.000
 gave birth because of the fear of having 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.950
 challenged the same creation and create life 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.840
 being a very intelligent pokémon in 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.430
 youtube communicates by telepathy with 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.140
 other pokemon that were cloned with 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.900
 square is he with south vulva with charm 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.180
 under even with the same cloned amber 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 who taught her memories when she did not 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.330
 was cloned when he lived with his 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.000
 parents also taught him his neighborhood 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.430
 the sky the stars the night the sun 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.990
 all that he taught her to see was new 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.520
 for me youtube the saddest moment 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.280
 for me youtube was when the clones 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.980
 for their instability they die but on 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.180
 all when amber dies also aven 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.100
 dies because it is being chlorinated 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.780
 simply his natural life is over 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.880
 remember that for more than 15 years 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.740
 initiated the investigation maybe to see already 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.020
 I was destined to die late or 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.880
 early myth altered by the death of 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.750
 the girl and the pokemon demonstrate 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.240
 its power 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.400
 and completely destroys all 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.310
 pokemon lab and that's where 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.380
 the first movie starts and you're 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.480
 laws three guys from the origin of mutu the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.020
 The truth is that the subject is very interesting 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.060
 of amber that is the girl the daughter of 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.440
 doctor figueroa hours that I found a 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.670
 quite interesting and I wanted to tell you 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.650
 what I most wanted to bring this video and 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.110
 have it in my channel for the memory 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.790
 when it's older basically so 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.950
 nothing fits is crepe and pasta if 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.239
 you want more always in consequent leave 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.160
 here a like parrot that would be appreciated 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.810
 enormously sincerely so we are going to more
