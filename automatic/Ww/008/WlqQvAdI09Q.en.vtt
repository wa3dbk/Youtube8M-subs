00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
speed about the finish up it's gonna be

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.979 
speed about the finish up it's gonna be
big<00:03:26.919> problem<00:03:27.819> they<00:03:28.329> also<00:03:28.480> gonna<00:03:28.659> do<00:03:28.780> anything

the<00:03:41.439> low<00:03:41.590> ground<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:41.980> guess<00:03:42.069> what<00:03:42.280> its<00:03:42.969> gonna

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
the low ground but guess what its gonna

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.420 
the low ground but guess what its gonna
die<00:03:43.389> unless<00:03:44.230> more<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.680> could<00:03:44.769> just<00:03:44.859> run<00:03:45.159> by<00:03:45.370> it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
die unless more you could just run by it

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.490
