00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.750
 a piece of the 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.719
 This is not the time for such a point 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.339
 no, I do not think so 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.439
 every time I catch my breath it would be like music 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.220
 after about three weeks aside 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.160
 I just want that people are sitting there looking at possible problems for the 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.019
 competition 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.720
 Traders think that has to do 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.380
 also a bit overly big what do you think I don't think so 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 must say the operator 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.140
 just for a while 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.580
 who is a mom and dad 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.040
 Hey 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.100
 and if you see this then you are not at home but then you are at Mrs. Baker's 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.750
 and Mrs. box is not entirely true 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 no it is paid for it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 that must be awake 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 and mom and dad are working now 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.200
 how many packages can pay with stones 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 they're in the car to pick you up 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.890
 anyway was 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.850
 dad mama think very small 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.510
 imaginable all day 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.770
 and if you bring Mrs. Baker then 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.910

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.409
 because the left 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.950
 We have no choice and why is that being on the couch or angry? 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 100 tons 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.610
 this time also in the list 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.400
 that is not alone 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.580
