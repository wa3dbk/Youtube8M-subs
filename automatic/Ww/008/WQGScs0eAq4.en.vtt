00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
enough to make it sizzle when it lands

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.960 
enough to make it sizzle when it lands
on<00:03:58.250> there<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.160> fill<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.730> griddle

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
on there and you just fill that griddle

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.539 
on there and you just fill that griddle
up<00:04:02.180> with<00:04:02.390> as<00:04:02.510> many<00:04:02.540> pieces<00:04:03.049> as<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.380> want<00:04:03.680> like

up with as many pieces as you want like
I<00:04:04.700> say<00:04:04.880> this<00:04:05.030> is<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.209> very<00:04:05.450> typical<00:04:06.010> recipe<00:04:07.010> from

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
I say this is a very typical recipe from

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.370 
I say this is a very typical recipe from
the<00:04:07.400> period<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.120> it's<00:04:08.690> something<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.109> could

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
the period and it's something that could

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.550 
the period and it's something that could
have<00:04:09.500> been<00:04:10.359> cooked<00:04:11.359> up<00:04:11.570> ahead<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.900> time<00:04:12.230> in<00:04:12.410> it

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
have been cooked up ahead of time in it

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.250 
have been cooked up ahead of time in it
if<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:13.130> were<00:04:13.220> traveling<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:14.480> could<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:15.199> could

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
right now right and we'll get ourselves

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.250 
right now right and we'll get ourselves
a<00:04:31.340> spatula<00:04:31.640> here<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:35.510> might<00:04:35.720> have<00:04:36.200> a

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
a spatula here and you might have a

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.880 
a spatula here and you might have a
little<00:04:36.740> bit<00:04:36.920> of<00:04:37.090> success<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:39.410> these<00:04:39.650> things

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
little bit of success in these things

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.860 
little bit of success in these things
browning<00:04:40.430> up<00:04:40.550> really<00:04:40.880> quick<00:04:41.120> for<00:04:41.390> us<00:04:41.450> there<00:04:41.720> oh

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
browning up really quick for us there oh

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.580 
browning up really quick for us there oh
yeah<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.620> one<00:04:42.860> looks<00:04:42.890> nice

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
yeah that one looks nice

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.520 
yeah that one looks nice
yeah<00:04:46.180> they<00:04:47.180> cook<00:04:47.450> up<00:04:47.600> pretty<00:04:47.870> quick

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
yeah they cook up pretty quick

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.800 
yeah they cook up pretty quick
I<00:04:48.560> guess<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:49.880> they<00:04:49.970> probably<00:04:50.450> keep<00:04:50.660> a

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
I guess so and they probably keep a

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.620 
I guess so and they probably keep a
while<00:04:51.050> too<00:04:51.410> because<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:52.250> cornmeal<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:52.760> flour

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
while too because the cornmeal and flour

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.340 
while too because the cornmeal and flour
they<00:04:54.320> keep<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:54.770> months<00:04:59.020> think<00:05:00.020> they're<00:05:00.170> ready

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
they keep for months think they're ready

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.290 
they keep for months think they're ready
to<00:05:00.440> come<00:05:00.680> off<00:05:00.740> well<00:05:01.580> they're<00:05:01.820> getting<00:05:02.000> there

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
to come off well they're getting there

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.970 
to come off well they're getting there
some<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.660> these<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.930> might<00:05:03.110> want<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.470> flip<00:05:03.890> them

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
some of these I might want to flip them

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.740 
some of these I might want to flip them
back<00:05:04.130> again<00:05:04.490> one<00:05:04.700> time<00:05:04.970> just<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.420> get<00:05:05.540> them<00:05:05.690> a

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
back again one time just to get them a

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.900 
back again one time just to get them a
little<00:05:05.840> bit<00:05:05.990> browner<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:07.340> want<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.580> make<00:05:07.700> sure
