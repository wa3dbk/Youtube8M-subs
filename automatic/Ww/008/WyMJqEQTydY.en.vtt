00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
some people do this a little bit

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.920 
some people do this a little bit
differently<00:00:38.300> they'll<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.600> through<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
options when they want to program it

they<00:00:43.170> want<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.680> strategy<00:00:44.520> tune<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.410> had

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
they want to go to a strategy tune I had

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
they want to go to a strategy tune I had
a<00:00:46.440> friend<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.789> reverted<00:00:48.329> to

a friend do this and it's reverted to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
a friend do this and it's reverted to
stock<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.110> not<00:00:49.500> believe<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:49.890> correct<00:00:50.160> we

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
stock I do not believe that's correct we

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.369 
stock I do not believe that's correct we
just<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:51.329> ahead<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.750> custom<00:00:52.199> tune

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
just go ahead and go to your custom tune

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.569 
just go ahead and go to your custom tune
just<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> would<00:00:52.949> program<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.399> car

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
just like you would program your car

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
just like you would program your car
normally<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.800> ki<00:00:59.539> turn<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:01.379> start

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
normally and get ki turn on don't start

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:11.600 
normally and get ki turn on don't start
it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
looking at right here see that you have

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.749 
looking at right here see that you have
rev<00:01:49.660> limit<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.440> drive<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.280> rev<00:01:51.460> limit

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
rev limit and drive and rev limit

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.840 
rev limit and drive and rev limit
neutral<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:53.320> drive<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.190> like<00:01:54.490> when<00:01:54.700> you're

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
neutral the drive is like when you're

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.520 
neutral the drive is like when you're
going<00:01:55.360> through<00:01:55.540> your<00:01:55.600> gears<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.200> like<00:01:56.380> your

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
going through your gears and like your

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.800 
going through your gears and like your
max<00:01:56.740> rpm<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.610> your<00:01:57.940> engine<00:01:58.149> as<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.360> go<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.540> and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
max rpm the your engine as you go to and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.389 
max rpm the your engine as you go to and
the<00:01:58.869> neutrals<00:01:59.290> like<00:01:59.560> if<00:01:59.680> it's<00:01:59.830> just<00:02:00.040> setting

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
the neutrals like if it's just setting

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.310 
the neutrals like if it's just setting
from<00:02:00.790> like<00:02:01.149> at<00:02:01.300> zero<00:02:01.479> miles<00:02:01.690> an<00:02:01.750> hour<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:02.080> stop

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
from like at zero miles an hour to stop

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.650 
from like at zero miles an hour to stop
but<00:02:03.160> this<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.460> also<00:02:03.640> how<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.940> set<00:02:04.360> up<00:02:04.390> like<00:02:04.630> a

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
but this is also how you set up like a

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.630 
but this is also how you set up like a
launch<00:02:04.930> control<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.920> go<00:02:06.040> ahead<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.190> do<00:02:06.340> that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
launch control so go ahead and do that

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.930 
launch control so go ahead and do that
and<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:08.170> think<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.709> lowest<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.310> can<00:02:09.459> set<00:02:09.700> that

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and I think the lowest we can set that

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.740 
and I think the lowest we can set that
is<00:02:10.179> 2500<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> GT<00:02:12.820> that's<00:02:13.120> probably

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
is 2500 so for a GT that's probably

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.770 
is 2500 so for a GT that's probably
plenty<00:02:15.390> alright<00:02:17.580> especially<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.640> you've<00:02:18.730> got

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
plenty alright especially if you've got

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.680 
plenty alright especially if you've got
a<00:02:19.980> tunes<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.220> already<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.090> probably

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
a tunes on already like it's probably

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.750 
a tunes on already like it's probably
going<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.900> burn<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.200> tires<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:23.799> we<00:02:24.610> should

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
going to burn the tires but we should

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
up so yours doesn't have it I'd

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.900 
up so yours doesn't have it I'd
recommend<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.310> updating<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.730> firmware

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
recommend just updating the firmware

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.570 
recommend just updating the firmware
with<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.050> SCT<00:03:37.470> programs<00:03:38.160> on<00:03:38.460> your<00:03:38.490> computer

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
with the SCT programs on your computer

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.900 
with the SCT programs on your computer
you<00:03:39.570> should<00:03:39.630> be<00:03:39.840> able<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.990> it<00:03:40.140> from<00:03:40.260> there<00:03:40.910> but

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
you should be able to it from there but

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.600 
you should be able to it from there but
this<00:03:42.240> works<00:03:42.480> with<00:03:42.720> any<00:03:43.110> model<00:03:43.590> Mustang<00:03:44.310> as<00:03:44.430> far

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
this works with any model Mustang as far

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.870 
this works with any model Mustang as far
as<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.850> know<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.690> probably<00:03:46.050> any<00:03:46.410> model<00:03:46.710> vehicle

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
as I know and probably any model vehicle

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.040 
as I know and probably any model vehicle
so<00:03:48.630> as<00:03:48.750> long<00:03:48.870> as<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.200> with<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.470> tuner

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.260 

alright<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.410> once<00:03:56.100> that's<00:03:56.250> complete<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.000> want

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
alright so once that's complete you want

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.620 
alright so once that's complete you want
to<00:03:57.360> check<00:03:57.480> your<00:03:57.540> key<00:03:57.810> off<00:03:58.070> you<00:03:59.070> continue<00:03:59.630> and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
to check your key off you continue and

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.300 
to check your key off you continue and
you<00:04:00.810> should<00:04:00.990> be<00:04:01.080> good<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.230> go<00:04:01.440> go<00:04:02.070> ahead<00:04:02.190> and

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
you should be good to go go ahead and

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:27.350 
you should be good to go go ahead and
unplug<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:05.630> side<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.700> should<00:04:11.730> work<00:04:26.360> there

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
unplug it side and it should work there

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:54.730 
unplug it side and it should work there
you<00:04:27.570> two<00:04:28.080> step

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.250 

while<00:04:55.740> you're<00:04:55.860> driving
