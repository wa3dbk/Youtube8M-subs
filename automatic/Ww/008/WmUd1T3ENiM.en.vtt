00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
gigahertz and even the 2.53 I don't

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.830 
gigahertz and even the 2.53 I don't
think<00:00:45.829> I<00:00:46.829> mean<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.910> course<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.719> be

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
think I mean of course it's gonna be

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
think I mean of course it's gonna be
higher<00:00:48.960> than<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.550> but<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.920> price<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
higher than this but but the price and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.410 
higher than this but but the price and
everything<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
everything and that is just really I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.540 
everything and that is just really I
think<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> good<00:00:58.440> bang<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:59.010> buck<00:00:59.070> but

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
think it's a good bang for your buck but

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
think it's a good bang for your buck but
some<00:01:00.510> people<00:01:01.410> beg<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.770> differ<00:01:03.320> they<00:01:04.320> think

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
some people beg to differ they think

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830
