00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello glad to present to you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.530
 attention 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.160
 stand it from this is a unique system 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:20.730
 which allows you to instantly perform 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.790
 design of any complexity is not and changing 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.000
 some special techniques for this need 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.800
 just have a special fixture 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.530
 which were developed by kun 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 from this is south korea in order to 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.359
 perform these 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 product design this is purchased at 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:42.449
 specialized stores either through 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.989
 Internet sites use this 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.359
 products are very easy when observed 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 some rules now we 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.010
 demonstrate some of the nuances 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.489
 that you need to use in your 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.940
 practice in case you perform your 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.609
 shtamping design based of gel polish 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.320
 then you must fully complete in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.580
 performing gel polish then wipe 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.130
 dispersion layer and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.040
 already on the skim on to the points put 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 your pruning carry your like 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.410
 says design 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 thing and cover such a design can 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.820
 under the code of the system that you are 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.710
 work that is ideal wholesale 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.650
 overlap gel polish if you 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.860
 used as a basis for gels that means 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.290
 you block the gel finish and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.600
 such designs of course rush much 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.360
 longer and pleases your leads on 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.570
 over a longer period 4 2 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.930
 and 3 and 4 weeks 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.450
 also you must understand that if you 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.620
 use the basis for your design 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 bright juicy stamping 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.190
 put on top you can basically 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.360
 any paint 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.390
 that is, it is in the room 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.310
 there are varied if you 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.280
 using a light base is better 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.650
 just in contrast to some use 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:18.920
 because colors are close in order they 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.790
 just lost on your basis and design 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 not so much will look spectacular 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.850
 In this case, I want to show you 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.140
 use white paint on 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:37.850
 standard red 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:42.610
 in order to fulfill your design you 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:47.810
 need a special paint disc and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.610
 stamped scraper I will 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.230
 now on my hands so i'm not very 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.980
 it will be convenient for you this ostentatious thought that 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.410
 you will understand 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.950
 my grandchildren prepared by him fulfilled 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.260
 and gel polish nails need to degrease 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.300
 before performing 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.769
 design it should be dry and pretty 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.950
 which you use it should be 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.600
 good consistency in case of thickening 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:19.030
 pumping and can be diluted with liquid 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:28.540
 to dilute the varnish remove excess 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:28.540
 We put ours there and transfer them to the finger 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.350
 after performing the imprint you should 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.060
 make sure you have all the sides 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.360
 carefully, faded happens to a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.990
 throw out prevents clear work so you 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.270
 You can take a brush and draw what 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.959
 then the lines then you design will have more 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.370
 artistic clearer after 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:57.700
 completing the drawing you take and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:01.950
 cover with a thin layer of firebox then either you 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:07.900
 can take your topcoat 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:13.239
 gel polish and give time to dry either 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:17.350
 put the ultraviolet llama after 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.200
 how did you finish covering if you 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.100
 this guerrilla just take a rub 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.810
 nail polish remover and you 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.460
 the side surface is all clear then 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.860
 there is right with your fingernail you do it 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.350
 if you have overlapped here the year he needs 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.750
 take a pen for a pencil in order 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.630
 so that there is a corrector so -called 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:40.260
 and process the side surfaces here 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:43.810
 surplus you can perform 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.760
 design by stepping on 2 legs 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.300
 points you can 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.620
 composite in place on all nails 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.810
 you can use a different stemping 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.540
 on different nails for example, I 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.700
 now showing options as possible 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:06.150
 combine the same colors and different 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:09.330
 disk options to perform 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.330
 diverse design
