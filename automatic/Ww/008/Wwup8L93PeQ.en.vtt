 hi george hi i most recently 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.320
 dyed my hair and know that with time 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.690
 color treated hair becomes dull 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.820
 what to do to avoid it 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.590
 everyone knows that during the staining 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.360
 hair exposed to negative 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.950
 chemical exposure and without 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.960
 special care hair color will be 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.700
 already washed away during washing it 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.770
 therefore extremely important 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.309
 cares for hair and strengthen them 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.680
 from the inside 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.809
 if the hair is healthy their surface 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.910
 smooth they can hold longer 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.160
 color pigments because hair

 advice on the use of these tools 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.450
 if you have dyed hair very much 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.210
 shampoo that you use is important 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.560
 as it does not allow color to wash out 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.270
 for this reason, the new shampoo 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.190
 syoss supreme selection revive 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.010

 color pigments are not washed out 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.850
 the main task of the balm to ease 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.380
 combing hair 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.480
 but it also seals the hair 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.300
 cuticle clipping color pigments 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.360
