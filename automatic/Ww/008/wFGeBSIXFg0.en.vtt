what<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:18.859> cool<00:00:19.189> place<00:00:19.490> yeah<00:00:20.180> this<00:00:20.420> is<00:00:20.600> a<00:00:20.630> really

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
what a cool place yeah this is a really

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.269 
what a cool place yeah this is a really
unique<00:00:21.080> spot<00:00:21.470> we<00:00:21.590> have<00:00:21.619> an<00:00:21.800> acre<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.189> a<00:00:22.250> half

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
unique spot we have an acre and a half

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.040 
unique spot we have an acre and a half
of<00:00:22.730> fruiting<00:00:23.119> plants<00:00:23.150> here<00:00:23.689> that's<00:00:23.930> been

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
of fruiting plants here that's been

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.740 
of fruiting plants here that's been
around<00:00:24.170> for<00:00:24.769> about<00:00:25.310> 30<00:00:25.670> years<00:00:25.760> Wow

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
around for about 30 years Wow

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.970 
around for about 30 years Wow
and<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:27.170> today<00:00:27.439> we're<00:00:27.590> going<00:00:27.679> to<00:00:27.800> talk<00:00:27.949> about

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
and so today we're going to talk about

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.880 
and so today we're going to talk about
grafting<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.060> really<00:00:30.050> explain<00:00:30.560> what<00:00:30.769> is

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
grafting and really explain what is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.589 
grafting and really explain what is
grafting<00:00:31.400> because<00:00:31.759> a<00:00:31.789> lot<00:00:32.060> of<00:00:32.090> people<00:00:32.420> really

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
grafting because a lot of people really

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.450 
grafting because a lot of people really
don't<00:00:32.810> understand<00:00:33.260> what<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:33.530> means<00:00:33.740> right

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
don't understand what that means right

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.610 
don't understand what that means right
well<00:00:34.670> so<00:00:34.850> grafting<00:00:35.390> is<00:00:35.660> essentially<00:00:36.350> taking

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
well so grafting is essentially taking

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.920 
well so grafting is essentially taking
two<00:00:36.980> different<00:00:37.370> kinds<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:38.000> fruit<00:00:38.540> trees<00:00:38.750> and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
two different kinds of fruit trees and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.330 
two different kinds of fruit trees and
putting<00:00:39.140> them<00:00:39.230> together<00:00:39.410> most<00:00:39.830> every<00:00:40.130> fruit

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
putting them together most every fruit

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.000 
putting them together most every fruit
tree<00:00:40.580> is<00:00:40.700> grafted<00:00:41.290> so<00:00:42.290> it's<00:00:42.560> something<00:00:42.860> that's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
tree is grafted so it's something that's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.110 
tree is grafted so it's something that's
happening<00:00:43.130> all<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.460> time<00:00:43.580> whether<00:00:43.910> we're

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
happening all the time whether we're

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.540 
happening all the time whether we're
aware<00:00:44.270> of<00:00:44.330> it<00:00:44.480> or<00:00:44.570> not<00:00:44.660> okay<00:00:45.470> so<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.220> what<00:00:46.460> are

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
aware of it or not okay so and what are

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.920 
aware of it or not okay so and what are
these<00:00:46.640> trees<00:00:46.970> right<00:00:47.180> here<00:00:47.390> because<00:00:47.750> they're

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
these trees right here because they're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.360 
these trees right here because they're
all<00:00:48.080> in<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.290> row<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.800> they're<00:00:48.890> kind<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.160> similar

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
all in a row and they're kind of similar

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.060 
all in a row and they're kind of similar
but<00:00:49.760> maybe<00:00:50.000> not<00:00:50.240> right<00:00:51.020> not<00:00:51.230> exactly<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.830> same

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
but maybe not right not exactly the same

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.010 
but maybe not right not exactly the same
what<00:00:52.460> we<00:00:52.580> have<00:00:52.760> here<00:00:53.060> is<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.180> demonstration<00:00:53.540> of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
what we have here is a demonstration of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.660 
what we have here is a demonstration of
how<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:54.200> can<00:00:54.410> have<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.620> same<00:00:54.980> type<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.280> fruit

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
how we can have the same type of fruit

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.220 
how we can have the same type of fruit
on<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.820> tree<00:00:55.910> but<00:00:56.300> they<00:00:56.480> can<00:00:56.630> be<00:00:56.750> very<00:00:56.930> different

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
on a tree but they can be very different

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.440 
on a tree but they can be very different
sizes<00:00:57.800> depending<00:00:58.250> on<00:00:58.610> what<00:00:58.820> rootstock<00:00:59.270> we've

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
sizes depending on what rootstock we've

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.120 
sizes depending on what rootstock we've
grafted<00:00:59.900> those<00:01:00.080> fruits<00:01:00.440> onto<00:01:00.830> Oh

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
grafted those fruits onto Oh

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.190 
grafted those fruits onto Oh
so<00:01:01.370> if<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:01.550> eat<00:01:01.880> a<00:01:01.910> Melrose<00:01:02.270> apple<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:02.900> plant

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
so if I eat a Melrose apple and I plant

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.650 
so if I eat a Melrose apple and I plant
that<00:01:03.380> seed<00:01:03.650> that's<00:01:04.280> not<00:01:04.430> gonna<00:01:04.549> work<00:01:04.670> no<00:01:05.299> no

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
that seed that's not gonna work no no

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.360 
that seed that's not gonna work no no
yeah<00:01:05.930> it's<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.470> could<00:01:06.620> plant<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.010> seed<00:01:07.220> but

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
yeah it's you could plant that seed but

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.770 
yeah it's you could plant that seed but
you<00:01:07.490> wouldn't<00:01:07.790> get<00:01:07.910> a<00:01:07.940> Melrose<00:01:08.330> apple<00:01:08.660> tree

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
you wouldn't get a Melrose apple tree

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.060 
you wouldn't get a Melrose apple tree
you'd<00:01:08.930> get<00:01:09.080> something<00:01:09.320> that's<00:01:09.590> genetically

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
you'd get something that's genetically

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.400 
you'd get something that's genetically
never<00:01:10.310> existed<00:01:10.790> before<00:01:10.910> so<00:01:11.870> if<00:01:11.990> you<00:01:12.110> want<00:01:12.290> to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
never existed before so if you want to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.110 
never existed before so if you want to
make<00:01:12.620> sure<00:01:12.800> that<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.100> have<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> Melrose<00:01:13.730> apple

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
make sure that you have a Melrose apple

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.720 
make sure that you have a Melrose apple
you<00:01:14.450> need<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.780> graft<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.440> Scion<00:01:15.920> on<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.370> a<00:01:16.400> root

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
you need to graft a Scion on to a root

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.370 
you need to graft a Scion on to a root
stock<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.450> we're<00:01:17.570> gonna<00:01:17.660> show<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.110> later

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
stock and we're gonna show that later

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.930 
stock and we're gonna show that later
but<00:01:18.680> we're<00:01:18.800> gonna<00:01:18.920> go<00:01:19.100> see<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> cherry<00:01:19.730> tree

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
but we're gonna go see a cherry tree

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.310 
but we're gonna go see a cherry tree
first<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.450> let's<00:01:20.600> go<00:01:20.720> see<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:20.870> line<00:01:21.140> all

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
first so let's go see that line all

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.740 
first so let's go see that line all
right<00:01:21.940> now<00:01:22.940> Monica<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.450> really

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
right now Monica this is really

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
right now Monica this is really
interesting<00:01:24.050> because<00:01:24.380> there's<00:01:24.650> actually

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
interesting because there's actually

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.650 
interesting because there's actually
four<00:01:25.160> different<00:01:25.190> flavors<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:26.180> this<00:01:26.330> cherry

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
four different flavors on this cherry

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.810 
four different flavors on this cherry
tree<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.170> why<00:01:27.410> would<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:27.650> want<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.920> do<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.160> well

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
tree so why would I want to do that well

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.730 
tree so why would I want to do that well
we<00:01:29.420> are<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.690> home<00:01:29.840> orchard<00:01:30.050> Society<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:30.650> we

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
we are the home orchard Society so we

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.560 
we are the home orchard Society so we
want<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.070> help<00:01:31.220> people<00:01:31.400> choose<00:01:32.330> what's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
want to help people choose what's

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.700 
want to help people choose what's
appropriate<00:01:32.750> for<00:01:32.960> them<00:01:33.170> at<00:01:33.260> home<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.650> lot

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
appropriate for them at home and a lot

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.740 
appropriate for them at home and a lot
of<00:01:33.800> people<00:01:33.980> don't<00:01:34.070> have<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.280> ton<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.490> space<00:01:34.790> so

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
of people don't have a ton of space so

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.260 
of people don't have a ton of space so
we<00:01:36.290> want<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.770> with<00:01:37.370> grafting<00:01:37.790> we<00:01:37.850> can<00:01:38.000> actually

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
we want to with grafting we can actually

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.600 
we want to with grafting we can actually
be<00:01:38.420> putting<00:01:38.690> more<00:01:39.260> than<00:01:39.320> one<00:01:39.650> type<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.159> cherry

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
be putting more than one type of cherry

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.220 
be putting more than one type of cherry
on<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.880> single<00:01:41.330> tree<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.990> get<00:01:42.110> that

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
on a single tree so that you get that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.780 
on a single tree so that you get that
variety<00:01:42.800> without<00:01:43.010> taking<00:01:43.340> up<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.640> much<00:01:43.700> space

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
variety without taking up so much space

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.680 
variety without taking up so much space
in<00:01:44.030> your<00:01:44.240> yard

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
in your yard

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.140 
in your yard
ah<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.320> let's<00:01:46.190> look<00:01:46.310> at<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.490> yeah<00:01:47.030> let's

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
ah and let's look at that yeah let's

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.330 
ah and let's look at that yeah let's
take<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.360> look<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:47.900> here<00:01:48.229> these<00:01:48.380> four<00:01:48.770> separate

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
take a look so here these four separate

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.730 
take a look so here these four separate
large<00:01:49.610> branches<00:01:50.270> are<00:01:50.540> each<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:51.050> different<00:01:51.260> kind

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
large branches are each a different kind

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.830 
large branches are each a different kind
of<00:01:51.890> cherry<00:01:52.190> but<00:01:52.729> they're<00:01:52.850> all<00:01:52.970> grafted<00:01:53.420> on<00:01:53.600> to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
of cherry but they're all grafted on to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.200 
of cherry but they're all grafted on to
the<00:01:53.960> same<00:01:54.260> tree<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.640> can<00:01:55.760> kind<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.030> see

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the same tree and you can kind of see

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.330 
the same tree and you can kind of see
the<00:01:56.360> change<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.900> bark<00:01:57.170> years<00:01:57.890> ago<00:01:58.190> when

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
the change in the bark years ago when

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.980 
the change in the bark years ago when
this<00:01:58.460> was<00:01:58.640> grafted<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.299> is<00:01:59.479> where<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> root

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
this was grafted this is where the root

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.260 
this was grafted this is where the root
stock<00:02:00.260> ended<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.760> where<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.030> grafts

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
stock ended and this is where the grafts

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.469 
stock ended and this is where the grafts
were<00:02:02.510> made<00:02:02.750> with<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.049> Scion<00:02:03.530> giving<00:02:04.280> us<00:02:04.479> four

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
were made with the Scion giving us four

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.910 
were made with the Scion giving us four
different<00:02:05.780> types<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.140> trees<00:02:06.350> or<00:02:06.650> four

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
different types of trees or four

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.380 
different types of trees or four
different<00:02:07.040> types<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.460> fruit<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.940> one<00:02:08.119> tree

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
different types of fruit on the one tree

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.330 
different types of fruit on the one tree
well<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.740> cool<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.190> we're

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
mónica we get to see exactly what

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.720 
mónica we get to see exactly what
grafting<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.010> these<00:02:19.100> are<00:02:19.310> little<00:02:19.550> baby

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
grafting is and these are little baby

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.690 
grafting is and these are little baby
plants<00:02:20.240> they<00:02:20.750> are<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.290> tree<00:02:21.620> over<00:02:22.130> here<00:02:22.520> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
plants they are this tree over here is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
plants they are this tree over here is
what's<00:02:23.090> grafted<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.690> time<00:02:23.900> last<00:02:24.140> year

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
what's grafted this time last year

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.200 
what's grafted this time last year
you<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.070> tell<00:02:25.280> where<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.520> graft<00:02:25.730> was<00:02:25.970> because

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
you can tell where the graft was because

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.330 
you can tell where the graft was because
it's<00:02:26.360> got<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.660> yellow<00:02:26.900> goop<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:27.830> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
it's got this yellow goop on it here and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.550 
it's got this yellow goop on it here and
last<00:02:28.640> year<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:28.970> grew<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.330> whole<00:02:29.660> length<00:02:30.260> in

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
last year it grew this whole length in

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.730 
last year it grew this whole length in
just<00:02:31.130> one<00:02:31.310> year<00:02:31.490> oh<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.450> good<00:02:32.720> draft<00:02:32.930> then

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
just one year oh really good draft then

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.980 
just one year oh really good draft then
this<00:02:33.950> one<00:02:34.130> here<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.480> tree<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.870> was

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
this one here is one a tree that was

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.170 
this one here is one a tree that was
grafted<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.500> yesterday<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.100> again<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.060> can

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
grafted just yesterday and again you can

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.690 
grafted just yesterday and again you can
see<00:02:38.390> where<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.780> graft<00:02:38.990> was<00:02:39.200> made<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.280> Scion

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
see where the graft was made the Scion

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.270 
see where the graft was made the Scion
this<00:02:40.910> top<00:02:41.150> part<00:02:41.420> was<00:02:41.840> cut<00:02:42.080> back<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.560> hopefully

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
this top part was cut back and hopefully

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.040 
this top part was cut back and hopefully
it<00:02:43.730> will<00:02:43.850> take<00:02:44.060> off<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:44.420> year<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.780> grow<00:02:44.870> just

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
it will take off this year and grow just

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.960 
it will take off this year and grow just
as<00:02:45.200> much<00:02:45.350> as<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.590> one<00:02:45.740> did<00:02:45.770> last<00:02:46.100> year<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.670> so

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
as much as that one did last year and so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.240 
as much as that one did last year and so
winter<00:02:47.210> is<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.600> key<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.990> sounds<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.440> winter

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
winter is the key it sounds like winter

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.670 
winter is the key it sounds like winter
is<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.370> time<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.850> graft<00:02:50.120> we<00:02:50.390> took<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:51.230> scions

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
is the time to graft we took the scions

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.350 
is the time to graft we took the scions
which<00:02:51.890> again<00:02:52.100> is<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.580> word<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.060> I'm<00:02:53.150> using

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
which again is the word that I'm using

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.390 
which again is the word that I'm using
to<00:02:53.600> describe<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.260> one<00:02:54.530> year<00:02:54.740> growth<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.310> we

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
to describe this one year growth that we

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.270 
to describe this one year growth that we
use<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.630> going<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.020> be<00:02:57.170> what<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.530> need<00:02:57.830> to

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
use this is going to be what you need to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.880 
use this is going to be what you need to
get<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:59.480> fruit<00:02:59.750> variety<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.350> have<00:03:00.680> so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
get the fruit variety that you have so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.320 
get the fruit variety that you have so
again<00:03:01.160> we<00:03:01.340> talked<00:03:01.670> about<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:02.090> at<00:03:02.210> the

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
again we talked about it at the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330 
again we talked about it at the
rootstock<00:03:02.630> demonstration<00:03:03.500> over<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.250> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
rootstock demonstration over in the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.020 
rootstock demonstration over in the
first<00:03:04.580> scene<00:03:05.390> but<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.650> Melrose<00:03:07.250> Scion

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
first scene but this is a Melrose Scion

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.730 
first scene but this is a Melrose Scion
that<00:03:08.270> we<00:03:08.360> took<00:03:08.510> one<00:03:08.780> year<00:03:08.990> growth<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.440> now

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
that we took one year growth and now

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.200 
that we took one year growth and now
we're<00:03:09.920> going<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.100> use<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.610> graft<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.030> make

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
we're going to use it to graft and make

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.910 
we're going to use it to graft and make
our<00:03:11.360> treat<00:03:11.690> okay<00:03:12.110> because<00:03:12.290> again<00:03:12.560> just<00:03:12.590> to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
our treat okay because again just to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.740 
our treat okay because again just to
remind<00:03:13.160> everybody<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.760> bottom<00:03:14.120> half<00:03:14.330> here<00:03:14.660> is

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
remind everybody the bottom half here is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.050 
remind everybody the bottom half here is
the<00:03:14.900> root<00:03:15.110> stock<00:03:15.410> below<00:03:15.950> that's<00:03:16.700> what's<00:03:16.910> going

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
the root stock below that's what's going

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.700 
the root stock below that's what's going
to<00:03:17.090> determine<00:03:17.210> what<00:03:17.660> kind<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:17.930> soil<00:03:18.230> our<00:03:18.500> tree

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
to determine what kind of soil our tree

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.160 
to determine what kind of soil our tree
can<00:03:18.920> grow<00:03:19.100> well<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.490> as<00:03:19.670> well<00:03:20.270> as<00:03:20.420> how<00:03:20.600> big<00:03:20.930> this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
can grow well in as well as how big this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.410 
can grow well in as well as how big this
trees<00:03:21.470> gonna<00:03:21.680> get<00:03:22.010> um<00:03:22.610> that's<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> cool<00:03:23.270> thing

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
trees gonna get um that's the cool thing

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.450 
trees gonna get um that's the cool thing
about<00:03:23.480> grafting<00:03:24.050> cuz<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.350> can<00:03:24.920> choose<00:03:25.190> both

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
about grafting cuz you can choose both

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.310 
about grafting cuz you can choose both
parts<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.060> make<00:03:26.270> one<00:03:26.450> tree<00:03:26.630> yes<00:03:26.990> you<00:03:27.140> get<00:03:27.230> to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
parts and make one tree yes you get to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.900 
parts and make one tree yes you get to
mix<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.680> match<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:28.190> again<00:03:28.460> if<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.670> want<00:03:28.850> a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
mix and match so again if you want a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.430 
mix and match so again if you want a
small<00:03:29.210> tree<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.600> want<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.870> get<00:03:29.990> a<00:03:30.020> smaller

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
small tree you want to get a smaller

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.050 
small tree you want to get a smaller
dwarfing<00:03:31.310> rootstocks

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
dwarfing rootstocks

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.520 
dwarfing rootstocks
if<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.330> okay<00:03:32.540> with<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.690> large<00:03:32.960> tree<00:03:33.290> then<00:03:33.500> you

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
if you okay with a large tree then you

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.590 
if you okay with a large tree then you
can<00:03:33.770> get<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:34.100> larger<00:03:34.670> root<00:03:34.850> stock<00:03:35.120> that'll<00:03:35.420> grow

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
can get a larger root stock that'll grow

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.320 
can get a larger root stock that'll grow
much<00:03:35.780> taller<00:03:35.860> um<00:03:36.860> but<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.610> home<00:03:37.790> scale<00:03:38.060> you

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
much taller um but on the home scale you

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.910 
much taller um but on the home scale you
might<00:03:38.510> really<00:03:38.780> want<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.200> choose<00:03:39.410> small<00:03:39.710> trees

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
might really want to choose small trees

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.670 
might really want to choose small trees
because<00:03:40.130> they're<00:03:40.280> much<00:03:40.490> easier<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:41.030> work<00:03:41.180> with

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
because they're much easier to work with

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.630 
because they're much easier to work with
you<00:03:42.680> don't<00:03:42.770> have<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:42.980> get<00:03:43.100> on<00:03:43.190> ladders<00:03:43.610> you

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
you don't have to get on ladders you

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.460 
you don't have to get on ladders you
don't<00:03:44.030> have<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.450> have<00:03:44.810> fruit<00:03:45.020> that's<00:03:45.230> out<00:03:45.350> of

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
don't have to have fruit that's out of

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.800 
don't have to have fruit that's out of
reach<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:46.459> we<00:03:46.760> really<00:03:47.120> do<00:03:47.300> try<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.570> promote

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
reach so we really do try to promote

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.449 
reach so we really do try to promote
people<00:03:48.110> using<00:03:48.560> more<00:03:48.740> of<00:03:48.770> these<00:03:48.980> dwarfing

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
people using more of these dwarfing

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.150 
people using more of these dwarfing
rootstocks<00:03:49.490> and<00:03:50.270> then<00:03:50.540> about<00:03:50.750> from<00:03:51.140> this<00:03:51.920> size

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
rootstocks and then about from this size

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.370 
rootstocks and then about from this size
to<00:03:52.610> fruiting<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.390> could<00:03:53.660> get<00:03:53.780> pick<00:03:54.140> an<00:03:54.260> apple

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
to fruiting I could get pick an apple

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.470 
to fruiting I could get pick an apple
how<00:03:54.800> many<00:03:54.950> years<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:55.880> it's<00:03:56.030> probably<00:03:56.330> gonna

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
how many years so it's probably gonna

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.900 
how many years so it's probably gonna
take<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:57.020> about<00:03:57.350> 3<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:58.010> 4<00:03:58.220> years<00:03:58.430> before

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
take you about 3 to 4 years before

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.580 
take you about 3 to 4 years before
you're<00:03:59.090> gonna<00:03:59.180> see<00:03:59.450> many<00:03:59.600> apples<00:04:00.080> off<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.500> a

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
you're gonna see many apples off of a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.990 
you're gonna see many apples off of a
tree<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.100> start<00:04:01.400> with<00:04:01.520> when<00:04:01.700> it's<00:04:01.820> this

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
tree that you start with when it's this

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.820 
tree that you start with when it's this
young<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.930> really<00:04:03.200> are<00:04:03.320> gonna<00:04:03.440> want<00:04:03.709> to

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
young and you really are gonna want to

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.830 
young and you really are gonna want to
strip<00:04:04.160> any<00:04:04.430> fruit<00:04:04.850> during<00:04:05.180> those<00:04:05.300> first<00:04:05.600> few

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
strip any fruit during those first few

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.900 
strip any fruit during those first few
years<00:04:06.080> because<00:04:06.770> that<00:04:06.920> allows<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.400> energy<00:04:07.820> to

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
years because that allows that energy to

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.480 
years because that allows that energy to
go<00:04:08.030> into<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.540> roots<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.440> branches

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
go into the roots and the branches

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.640 
go into the roots and the branches
before<00:04:10.490> you<00:04:10.880> get<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.150> fruit<00:04:11.420> so<00:04:12.320> it's<00:04:12.440> just<00:04:12.500> a

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
before you get the fruit so it's just a

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.590 
before you get the fruit so it's just a
good<00:04:12.800> investment<00:04:13.459> for<00:04:13.760> your<00:04:13.880> tree<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.360> wait<00:04:14.570> a

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
good investment for your tree to wait a

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.210 
good investment for your tree to wait a
little<00:04:14.840> bit<00:04:15.020> before<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.500> ask<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:15.950> do<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.070> lot

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
little bit before you ask it to do a lot

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.770 
little bit before you ask it to do a lot
of<00:04:16.250> fruiting<00:04:16.640> alright<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.239> now<00:04:17.450> we're<00:04:17.660> gonna

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
of fruiting alright and now we're gonna

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.510 
of fruiting alright and now we're gonna
actually<00:04:17.930> do<00:04:18.230> a<00:04:18.260> demonstration<00:04:18.500> on<00:04:19.040> how<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.250> do

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
actually do a demonstration on how to do

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.480 
actually do a demonstration on how to do
this<00:04:19.670> and<00:04:19.880> Melissa<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.480> a<00:04:20.780> expert<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:22.100> go<00:04:22.310> right

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
this and Melissa is a expert so go right

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.750 
this and Melissa is a expert so go right
ahead

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
ahead

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.480 
ahead
so<00:04:23.750> what<00:04:23.960> we<00:04:24.080> have<00:04:24.260> here<00:04:24.590> is<00:04:24.830> we've<00:04:25.250> made

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
so what we have here is we've made

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.580 
so what we have here is we've made
already<00:04:25.850> made<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.360> cut<00:04:26.600> on<00:04:26.780> our<00:04:27.080> root<00:04:27.320> stock

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
already made the cut on our root stock

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.780 
already made the cut on our root stock
it's<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:27.979> angled<00:04:28.430> cut

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
it's this angled cut

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.180 
it's this angled cut
and<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.270> reveals<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.870> us<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:30.230> cambium<00:04:30.830> here

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
and it reveals to us this cambium here

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.700 
and it reveals to us this cambium here
which<00:04:31.730> is<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.060> green<00:04:32.390> part<00:04:32.420> just<00:04:33.020> underneath

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
which is the green part just underneath

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.260 
which is the green part just underneath
the<00:04:33.890> bark<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.280> that's<00:04:34.520> what<00:04:34.730> we're<00:04:34.850> gonna<00:04:34.940> try

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
the bark and that's what we're gonna try

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.540 
the bark and that's what we're gonna try
to<00:04:35.300> line<00:04:35.630> up<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:36.530> then<00:04:36.710> we<00:04:36.860> take<00:04:37.040> some<00:04:37.280> signs

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
to line up so then we take some signs

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.840 
to line up so then we take some signs
right<00:04:38.200> okay<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.410> what<00:04:40.220> we<00:04:40.340> want<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.610> do<00:04:40.730> is

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
right okay and what we want to do is

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.760 
right okay and what we want to do is
you'll<00:04:41.030> notice<00:04:41.210> this<00:04:41.840> all<00:04:42.080> was<00:04:42.260> one-year

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
you'll notice this all was one-year

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.860 
you'll notice this all was one-year
growth<00:04:43.070> but<00:04:43.850> it's<00:04:43.970> thicker<00:04:44.210> down<00:04:44.420> here<00:04:44.720> and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
growth but it's thicker down here and

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.720 
growth but it's thicker down here and
thinner<00:04:45.110> up<00:04:45.200> here<00:04:45.400> so<00:04:46.400> what<00:04:46.550> we're<00:04:46.700> looking

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
thinner up here so what we're looking

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.190 
thinner up here so what we're looking
for<00:04:47.000> is<00:04:47.270> something<00:04:47.690> that's<00:04:47.870> going<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.080> be

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
for is something that's going to be

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.260 
for is something that's going to be
similar<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:49.190> where<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.460> root<00:04:49.610> stock<00:04:49.850> is<00:04:50.060> which

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
similar to where the root stock is which

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.240 
similar to where the root stock is which
is<00:04:50.390> kind<00:04:50.600> of<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:50.870> here<00:04:51.140> so<00:04:51.530> I'm<00:04:51.650> gonna<00:04:51.770> cut<00:04:52.100> this

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
is kind of in here so I'm gonna cut this

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.150 
is kind of in here so I'm gonna cut this
down<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:53.230> then<00:04:54.230> I'm<00:04:54.380> gonna<00:04:54.560> try<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.860> match

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
down and then I'm gonna try to match

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.820 
down and then I'm gonna try to match
this<00:04:55.580> cut<00:04:55.940> with<00:04:56.540> my<00:04:56.750> Scion<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.440> do<00:04:57.500> that

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
this cut with my Scion and I do that

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.130 
this cut with my Scion and I do that
with<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:58.070> really<00:04:58.340> specific<00:04:59.000> gesture<00:04:59.420> here<00:04:59.780> see

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
with a really specific gesture here see

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.400 
with a really specific gesture here see
if<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.350> can<00:05:00.530> do<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:01.240> because<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.780> better

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
if I can do it because the the better

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.990 
if I can do it because the the better
the<00:05:03.620> match<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:04.130> better<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.430> graft<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:04.880> then

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
the match the better the graft and then

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.330 
the match the better the graft and then
it'll<00:05:05.240> really<00:05:05.390> take<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:05.990> it'll<00:05:06.350> take<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:06.920> live

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
it'll really take it it'll take and live

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.280 
it'll really take it it'll take and live
and<00:05:07.730> live<00:05:08.030> much<00:05:08.240> better<00:05:08.450> so<00:05:08.750> what<00:05:08.870> we<00:05:09.020> want<00:05:09.200> to

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
and live much better so what we want to

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.990 
and live much better so what we want to
do<00:05:09.440> is<00:05:09.620> line<00:05:09.830> up<00:05:09.950> a<00:05:10.040> much<00:05:10.220> as<00:05:10.430> much<00:05:10.640> of<00:05:10.820> this

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
do is line up a much as much of this

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.970 
do is line up a much as much of this
cambium<00:05:11.510> on<00:05:11.630> our<00:05:11.780> Scion<00:05:12.200> with<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.560> cambium

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
cambium on our Scion with this cambium

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.160 
cambium on our Scion with this cambium
on<00:05:13.070> our<00:05:13.190> root<00:05:13.400> stock<00:05:13.670> I've<00:05:14.330> also<00:05:14.570> made<00:05:14.930> this

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
on our root stock I've also made this

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.750 
on our root stock I've also made this
secondary<00:05:15.650> cut<00:05:15.980> here<00:05:16.220> we're<00:05:16.340> gonna<00:05:16.460> do<00:05:16.610> what's

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
secondary cut here we're gonna do what's

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.080 
secondary cut here we're gonna do what's
called<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:17.030> whip<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.330> tung<00:05:17.570> graph<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:19.090> I'm

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
called a whip and tung graph so I'm

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.330 
called a whip and tung graph so I'm
gonna<00:05:20.360> turn<00:05:20.690> this<00:05:20.990> cut<00:05:21.590> this<00:05:21.770> little<00:05:22.100> groove

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
gonna turn this cut this little groove

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.430 
gonna turn this cut this little groove
here<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.540> it<00:05:23.660> just<00:05:23.840> helps<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.140> attach

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
here and it just helps it attach

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.230 
here and it just helps it attach
together<00:05:24.830> better<00:05:25.070> yeah<00:05:25.610> this<00:05:25.820> is<00:05:25.910> gonna<00:05:26.030> help

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
together better yeah this is gonna help

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.510 
together better yeah this is gonna help
it<00:05:26.450> anchor<00:05:26.780> together<00:05:27.140> much<00:05:27.530> better<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:28.280> now<00:05:28.460> we

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
it anchor together much better so now we

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.050 
it anchor together much better so now we
slide<00:05:28.940> these<00:05:29.180> two<00:05:29.240> together

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
slide these two together

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.700 
slide these two together
let's<00:05:32.060> see<00:05:32.330> if<00:05:32.450> I've<00:05:32.660> made<00:05:32.870> my<00:05:33.110> cuts<00:05:33.410> correctly

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
let's see if I've made my cuts correctly

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.140 
let's see if I've made my cuts correctly
you<00:05:36.710> know<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:36.860> think<00:05:37.160> it's<00:05:37.280> a<00:05:37.400> really<00:05:37.850> great

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
you know I think it's a really great

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.060 
you know I think it's a really great
process<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:39.560> takes<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:39.890> lot<00:05:40.040> of

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
process and it's it takes a lot of

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.130 
process and it's it takes a lot of
practice<00:05:40.580> but<00:05:40.610> you're<00:05:41.270> having<00:05:41.450> an<00:05:41.660> event<00:05:41.750> that

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
practice but you're having an event that

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.530 
practice but you're having an event that
would<00:05:42.320> really<00:05:42.500> help<00:05:42.740> newbies<00:05:43.330> be<00:05:44.330> very

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
would really help newbies be very

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.320 
would really help newbies be very
successful<00:05:44.780> with<00:05:45.260> this<00:05:45.410> yes<00:05:45.890> we<00:05:46.370> have<00:05:46.580> it's

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
successful with this yes we have it's

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.030 
successful with this yes we have it's
called<00:05:47.540> our<00:05:47.600> fruit<00:05:47.930> propagation<00:05:48.530> Fair<00:05:48.800> and

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
called our fruit propagation Fair and

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.070 
called our fruit propagation Fair and
we're<00:05:49.190> gonna<00:05:49.340> have<00:05:49.640> again<00:05:50.270> these<00:05:50.420> are<00:05:50.600> scions

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
we're gonna have again these are scions

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.660 
we're gonna have again these are scions
this<00:05:51.320> is<00:05:51.440> what<00:05:51.560> you<00:05:51.680> need<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:52.040> use<00:05:52.250> for<00:05:52.610> your

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
this is what you need to use for your

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.660 
this is what you need to use for your
grafting<00:05:53.180> we're<00:05:53.630> gonna<00:05:53.720> have<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.430> apple<00:05:55.430> alone

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
grafting we're gonna have a apple alone

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.950 
grafting we're gonna have a apple alone
we're<00:05:55.820> gonna<00:05:55.910> have<00:05:56.090> about<00:05:56.210> 500<00:05:56.750> different

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
we're gonna have about 500 different

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.720 
we're gonna have about 500 different
varieties<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:57.380> you<00:05:57.560> could<00:05:57.740> choose<00:05:57.920> from<00:05:58.190> so

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
varieties that you could choose from so

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.850 
varieties that you could choose from so
again<00:05:59.060> you<00:05:59.240> could<00:05:59.390> pick<00:05:59.630> that<00:05:59.660> variety<00:06:00.440> come

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
again you could pick that variety come

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.530 
again you could pick that variety come
get<00:06:01.160> a<00:06:01.190> root<00:06:01.430> stock<00:06:01.670> from<00:06:01.910> us<00:06:02.060> and<00:06:02.240> make<00:06:02.420> your

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
get a root stock from us and make your

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.570 
get a root stock from us and make your
own<00:06:02.660> tree<00:06:02.930> so<00:06:03.770> what's<00:06:03.950> important<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.400> just

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
own tree so what's important to just

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.010 
own tree so what's important to just
finish<00:06:04.940> this<00:06:05.120> graph<00:06:05.390> is<00:06:05.570> that<00:06:05.630> we<00:06:05.720> don't<00:06:05.900> need

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
finish this graph is that we don't need

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.840 
finish this graph is that we don't need
all<00:06:06.290> of<00:06:06.320> this<00:06:06.650> here<00:06:06.980> that's<00:06:07.160> way<00:06:07.430> too<00:06:07.490> many

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
all of this here that's way too many

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.240 
all of this here that's way too many
buds<00:06:08.180> we're<00:06:08.750> gonna<00:06:08.870> want<00:06:09.170> to<00:06:09.380> cut<00:06:09.800> back<00:06:09.830> to

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
buds we're gonna want to cut back to

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.400
