00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
in terms of Chelsea I suppose this is an

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.589 
in terms of Chelsea I suppose this is an
elusive<00:00:11.429> best<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.240> show<00:00:12.269> award<00:00:14.420> which<00:00:15.420> I've

elusive best in show award which I've

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.560 
elusive best in show award which I've
never<00:00:15.630> won<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:17.000> it's<00:00:18.000> interesting<00:00:18.359> because

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
never won and it's interesting because

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.120 
never won and it's interesting because
I've<00:00:18.720> never<00:00:18.750> gotten<00:00:19.199> into<00:00:19.410> chelsea<00:00:19.800> before

I've never gotten into chelsea before
setting<00:00:20.490> my<00:00:20.609> sights<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.420> there's<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
setting my sights on that there's a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109 
setting my sights on that there's a
certain<00:00:22.350> judging<00:00:22.920> process<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.850> bring

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
certain judging process that can bring

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.820 
certain judging process that can bring
you<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> bronze<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:24.869> silver<00:00:24.900> silver<00:00:25.500> gilt<00:00:25.680> or

you a bronze or silver silver gilt or

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.550 
you a bronze or silver silver gilt or
gold<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.050> large

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
gold and I think you can just a large

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.439 
gold and I think you can just a large
extent<00:00:29.010> once<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> system<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.269> can

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
extent once you know the system you can

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.280 
extent once you know the system you can
you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.380> hopefully<00:00:32.059> aim<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.960> gold

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

you can do it Best in Show not really
the<00:00:47.070> same<00:00:47.309> thing<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:48.320> decided<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.379> an

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the same thing it's decided on an

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
the same thing it's decided on an
entirely<00:00:49.920> different<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.520> I've<00:00:50.700> never<00:00:50.910> aimed

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
entirely different one I've never aimed

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.660 
entirely different one I've never aimed
for<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.770> lovely<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.460> I've<00:00:53.520> never

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
for it lovely to do it but I've never

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.770 
for it lovely to do it but I've never
owned<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.949> for<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.100> year<00:00:56.430> maybe<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.239> think

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
owned for it for this year maybe I think

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:10.630 
owned for it for this year maybe I think
I've<00:00:57.870> said<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> before

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.050 

it's<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.730> garden<00:01:11.940> which<00:01:12.950> really<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's a garden which really is to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's a garden which really is to
hopefully<00:01:15.780> engage<00:01:16.110> people<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:18.420> makes<00:01:18.630> them

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
hopefully engage people so it makes them

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
hopefully engage people so it makes them
think<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.410> that's<00:01:19.560> something<00:01:19.800> I<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> do

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
think and that's something I like to do

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.460 
think and that's something I like to do
in<00:01:20.340> many<00:01:20.520> gardens<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.300> I<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.660> in<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.960> idea

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
in many gardens so I put in this idea

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.570 
in many gardens so I put in this idea
that<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:24.480> garden<00:01:24.870> can<00:01:25.080> demonstrate<00:01:25.580> perhaps

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that the garden can demonstrate perhaps

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.040 
that the garden can demonstrate perhaps
different<00:01:26.970> rooms<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.660> could<00:01:27.810> take

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
different rooms that you could take

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.680 
different rooms that you could take
through<00:01:28.890> life<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:29.400> minutes<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:30.510> not

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
through life or minutes it's not

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.630 
through life or minutes it's not
something<00:01:31.170> I've<00:01:31.590> tried<00:01:31.830> to<00:01:31.950> major<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.550> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
something I've tried to major on in the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.100 
something I've tried to major on in the
design<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.300> something<00:01:33.570> I've<00:01:33.690> really<00:01:33.840> done

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
design it's something I've really done

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.650 
design it's something I've really done
in<00:01:34.410> almost<00:01:34.800> in<00:01:34.980> quite<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.160> personal<00:01:35.730> way<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.150> my

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
in almost in quite a personal way for my

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:51.410 
in almost in quite a personal way for my
own<00:01:36.810> satisfaction<00:01:49.760> what<00:01:50.760> I've<00:01:50.940> done<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.240> I've

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
own satisfaction what I've done is I've

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.930 
own satisfaction what I've done is I've
taken<00:01:51.480> aspects<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.590> things<00:01:53.280> I've<00:01:53.490> seen<00:01:53.700> from

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
taken aspects of things I've seen from

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.250 
taken aspects of things I've seen from
around<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> world<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.690> from<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.020> country

last<00:04:01.800> year<00:04:02.250> only<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.640> couple<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.420> most<00:04:03.780> people

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
last year only a couple so most people

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.210 
last year only a couple so most people
probably<00:04:04.080> didn't<00:04:04.380> even<00:04:04.410> notice<00:04:04.530> them<00:04:04.980> and

probably didn't even notice them and
that<00:04:06.209> made<00:04:06.390> me<00:04:06.510> think<00:04:06.660> well<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:06.840> perfectly

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
that made me think well it's perfectly

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.050 
that made me think well it's perfectly
possible<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:08.070> i<00:04:08.280> think<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:08.640> i<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:08.910> get

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
possible and i think if i can get

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.600 
possible and i think if i can get
hundreds<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.720> these<00:04:09.900> things<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.500> perform<00:04:10.920> then

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
hundreds of these things to perform then

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.000 
hundreds of these things to perform then
it's<00:04:11.640> going<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.180> be<00:04:12.270> really<00:04:12.480> show<00:04:12.959> stopping

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.500 
his work they're completely different
but<00:04:40.169> there<00:04:40.800> are<00:04:40.830> elements<00:04:41.460> which<00:04:41.940> I<00:04:42.210> suppose

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
but there are elements which I suppose

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.630 
but there are elements which I suppose
are<00:04:42.660> completely<00:04:43.140> reinvent<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.919> reinvented

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
are completely reinvent it reinvented

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.969 
are completely reinvent it reinvented
just<00:04:45.000> for<00:04:45.510> this<00:04:45.630> garden<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:46.260> it's<00:04:46.680> not<00:04:46.950> a

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
just for this garden it's it's not a

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.520 
just for this garden it's it's not a
sort<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.729> direct<00:04:48.540> take<00:04:48.810> but<00:04:49.169> it's<00:04:49.290> things

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
sort of a direct take but it's things

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.980 
sort of a direct take but it's things
floating<00:04:49.890> around<00:04:50.070> in<00:04:50.310> my<00:04:50.340> head<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.990> I've

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
floating around in my head that I've

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.590 
floating around in my head that I've
used

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.570 

I<00:04:58.570> think<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.660> crux<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.260> Chelsea<00:05:00.920> arm<00:05:01.130> is<00:05:01.400> that

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
I think the crux of Chelsea arm is that

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.640 
I think the crux of Chelsea arm is that
people<00:05:01.970> who<00:05:02.090> see<00:05:02.390> it<00:05:02.420> whether<00:05:03.230> it's<00:05:03.440> on

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
people who see it whether it's on

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.290 
people who see it whether it's on
television<00:05:04.280> or<00:05:04.430> whether<00:05:04.610> they're<00:05:04.880> standing

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
television or whether they're standing

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.920 
television or whether they're standing
there<00:05:06.220> looking<00:05:07.220> from<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.180> outside<00:05:08.270> into<00:05:08.810> the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
there looking from the outside into the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.380 
there looking from the outside into the
garden<00:05:09.410> they<00:05:09.890> have<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.310> want<00:05:10.550> to<00:05:10.820> be<00:05:10.970> in<00:05:11.240> the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
garden they have to want to be in the

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.450 
garden they have to want to be in the
garden<00:05:11.870> they<00:05:12.350> have<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.800> be<00:05:12.920> able<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.190> imagine

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
garden they have to be able to imagine

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
garden they have to be able to imagine
themselves<00:05:13.820> in<00:05:14.300> there<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:15.910> that<00:05:16.910> is<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.270> real

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
themselves in there and that is the real

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:26.070 
themselves in there and that is the real
key<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.900> it

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080
