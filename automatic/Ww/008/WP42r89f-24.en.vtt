00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 You're telling me you really know me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.300
 You're not afraid to show me what's in your eyes 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
 So tell me about the rumors. 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.000
 Are they just gossip? 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.800
 Just lies? 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 I'm falling into a dream 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 Sadness is emerging 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.000
 Is this true? &lt;u&gt; Is this correct? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.500
 Is it over? 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.800
 Did I do that? 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 Was that you? &lt;u&gt; Was that you? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Did you tell me? 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 That way you would never leave me 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 If I really knew 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300
 You couldn't do this to me. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000
 You would be my friend 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 If someone's lying 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.500
 Trying will not help 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.000
 No need to pretend 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.500
 I'm falling into a dream 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.000
 Sadness is emerging 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.100
 Is this true? &lt;u&gt; Is this correct? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.000
 Is it over? 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.000
 Did I do this? 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.500
 Was that you? &lt;u&gt; Was that you? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.000
 Did you tell me? 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 That way you would never leave me 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Is it real? 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.300
 Is this true? &lt;u&gt; Is this correct? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Is it over? 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 Did I do that? 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Was that you? &lt;u&gt; Was that you? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.000
 You told me? 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.900
 That way you would never leave me 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.600
 Is it real? &lt;u&gt; Did I imagine that? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.000
 Will I wake up from this pain? 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.500
 Is this true? &lt;u&gt; Is this correct? &lt;/ u&gt; 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Is it over? 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Baby, did I do this? 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.500
 Is this true? 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Thanks
