there's<00:02:43.090> something<00:02:43.420> special<00:02:43.660> about<00:02:43.900> high<00:02:44.380> it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
there's something special about high it

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.120 
there's something special about high it
was<00:02:45.490> so<00:02:45.700> obvious<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.690> some<00:02:47.410> kids<00:02:47.709> had<00:02:47.980> all

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
was so obvious that some kids had all

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.990 
was so obvious that some kids had all
the<00:02:48.750> services<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.140> programs<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.340> facilities

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the services the programs the facilities

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.040 
the services the programs the facilities
and<00:02:52.480> other<00:02:53.050> kids<00:02:54.150> had<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> lot<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.630> hopes<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
and other kids had a lot of hopes and

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.350 
and other kids had a lot of hopes and
dreams<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:58.090> need<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.450> close<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:59.080> gap<00:02:59.530> I<00:03:00.360> just

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
dreams we need to close that gap I just

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.060 
dreams we need to close that gap I just
think<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.920> school<00:03:02.920> districts<00:03:03.820> sometimes

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
think that school districts sometimes

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.699 
think that school districts sometimes
play<00:03:06.070> into<00:03:06.520> what<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.940> community<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.930> if

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
play into what the community is and if

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.340 
play into what the community is and if
it's<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:09.070> well<00:03:09.850> source<00:03:10.150> resource<00:03:10.810> community

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
it's a well source resource community

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.170 
it's a well source resource community
the<00:03:11.920> more<00:03:12.160> money<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.640> put<00:03:12.880> into<00:03:13.030> that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
the more money is put into that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.449 
the more money is put into that
community<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.870> if<00:03:13.959> it's<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.500> poor<00:03:14.950> community

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
community and if it's a poor community

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.490 
community and if it's a poor community
then<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:16.030> just<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.300> lack<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.540> funds<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.230> it

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
then it's just the lack of funds and it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.050 
then it's just the lack of funds and it
shouldn't<00:03:17.860> be<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.010> way<00:03:18.340> because<00:03:18.519> that's

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
shouldn't be that way because that's

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.699 
shouldn't be that way because that's
where<00:03:19.330> we<00:03:19.420> see<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.600> disparity<00:03:20.350> with<00:03:20.530> our

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
where we see the disparity with our

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.770 
where we see the disparity with our
children<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.670> National<00:03:22.120> Education

as good as the best public school you
can<00:03:30.970> find<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.510> means<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.980> we<00:03:33.220> need<00:03:33.430> to

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
can find and that means that we need to

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.330 
can find and that means that we need to
close<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.420> resource<00:03:34.870> gap<00:03:35.200> we<00:03:35.830> need<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.160> make
