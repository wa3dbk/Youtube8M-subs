00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
to die there but I managed to avoid it

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.870 
to die there but I managed to avoid it

low<00:01:51.680> on<00:01:51.710> health<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.310> was<00:01:52.759> going<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.000> use<00:01:53.149> that

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
low on health I was going to use that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.380 
low on health I was going to use that
opportunity<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:54.580> slag<00:01:55.580> some<00:01:55.820> enemies<00:01:56.119> but<00:01:56.270> it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
buzz axe to be dealing more damage than

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.419 
buzz axe to be dealing more damage than
it<00:02:03.500> was<00:02:03.679> but<00:02:04.429> I<00:02:04.550> didn't<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.429> didn't

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
it was but I didn't have it so didn't

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.830 
it was but I didn't have it so didn't
get<00:02:07.550> that<00:02:07.670> opportunity<00:02:10.360> try<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.450> group<00:02:11.630> all

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
get that opportunity try to group all

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.620 
get that opportunity try to group all
these<00:02:11.989> guys<00:02:12.200> up<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.590> guess

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
these guys up I guess

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.979 
these guys up I guess
get<00:02:14.630> them<00:02:14.810> all<00:02:14.959> slagged

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.449 

so<00:02:20.989> I'll<00:02:21.170> let<00:02:21.319> them<00:02:21.500> punch<00:02:21.739> me<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.250> to

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
so I'll let them punch me now and to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.210 
so I'll let them punch me now and to
release<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.239> beast<00:02:23.420> mode<00:02:23.659> or<00:02:23.930> range<00:02:24.319> now<00:02:25.129> I'll

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
release the beast mode or range now I'll

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.250 
release the beast mode or range now I'll
get<00:02:25.340> ready<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.760> fight<00:02:26.030> all<00:02:26.269> three<00:02:26.299> badasses<00:02:26.959> at

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
get ready to fight all three badasses at

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.410 
get ready to fight all three badasses at
once<00:02:27.439> I<00:02:27.560> guess<00:02:27.739> going<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.610> go<00:02:28.730> real<00:02:29.030> hard<00:02:29.269> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
once I guess going to go real hard to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.589 
once I guess going to go real hard to
try<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.629> kill<00:02:29.840> one<00:02:30.049> of<00:02:30.079> them<00:02:31.329> excellent<00:02:32.329> that

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
try to kill one of them excellent that

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.119 
try to kill one of them excellent that
should<00:02:32.780> help<00:02:32.930> deal<00:02:33.170> damage<00:02:33.379> on<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.769> other<00:02:33.920> two

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
should help deal damage on the other two

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.059 
should help deal damage on the other two
and<00:02:34.849> now<00:02:35.780> they're<00:02:35.930> all<00:02:36.049> dead<00:02:36.079> so<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.890> worked

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
and now they're all dead so that worked

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.119 
and now they're all dead so that worked
out<00:02:37.190> pretty<00:02:37.250> damn<00:02:37.849> well<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.480> reality

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
out pretty damn well in reality

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.770 
out pretty damn well in reality
definitely<00:02:40.129> like<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.489> little<00:02:40.730> addition<00:02:41.629> of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
definitely like the little addition of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.949 
definitely like the little addition of
not<00:02:41.959> having<00:02:42.349> blood<00:02:43.750> transcends

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
not having blood transcends

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.569 
not having blood transcends
was<00:02:45.409> planning<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.859> build<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.250> everything

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
was planning the build and everything

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.339 
was planning the build and everything
but<00:02:46.819> turns<00:02:47.420> out<00:02:47.629> I<00:02:47.659> actually<00:02:47.840> kind<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.260> like

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
but turns out I actually kind of like

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.869 
but turns out I actually kind of like
not<00:02:48.530> having<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.040> makes<00:02:49.310> them<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.519> little<00:02:49.760> bit

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
not having it makes them a little bit

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.910 
not having it makes them a little bit
more<00:02:49.909> dynamic<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.079> a<00:02:51.200> little<00:02:51.409> bit<00:02:51.530> more<00:02:51.709> fun

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
more dynamic and a little bit more fun

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.619 
more dynamic and a little bit more fun

that's the little revision I made to my

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.360 
that's the little revision I made to my
melee<00:03:28.609> Creek<00:03:28.910> build<00:03:29.180> um<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:30.620> know<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.949> don't

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
melee Creek build um you know I don't

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.009 
melee Creek build um you know I don't
know<00:03:31.489> if<00:03:31.639> I'm<00:03:31.730> going<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:31.940> end<00:03:32.090> up<00:03:32.269> going<00:03:32.720> with<00:03:32.870> a

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
know if I'm going to end up going with a

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.020 
know if I'm going to end up going with a
higher<00:03:33.379> level<00:03:33.709> singularity<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.489> don't<00:03:34.760> think

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
higher level singularity I don't think

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.000 
higher level singularity I don't think
that<00:03:35.720> singularities<00:03:36.410> do<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.799> much<00:03:36.980> damage

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
that singularities do that much damage

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.979 
that singularities do that much damage
unless<00:03:37.639> they're<00:03:37.879> quasar<00:03:38.389> obviously<00:03:38.870> this

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
unless they're quasar obviously this

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.140 
unless they're quasar obviously this
one's<00:03:39.199> just<00:03:39.260> level<00:03:39.650> 8<00:03:39.829> so<00:03:40.129> it's<00:03:40.730> not<00:03:40.970> going<00:03:41.090> to

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
one's just level 8 so it's not going to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.110 
one's just level 8 so it's not going to
do<00:03:41.299> almost<00:03:41.480> anything<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:43.639> might<00:03:43.849> go<00:03:44.000> ahead

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
do almost anything and I might go ahead

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.020 
do almost anything and I might go ahead
and<00:03:44.690> switch<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.739> higher<00:03:46.040> one<00:03:46.340> or<00:03:47.000> I

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
and switch that to a higher one or I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.640 
and switch that to a higher one or I
might<00:03:47.389> just<00:03:47.419> be<00:03:47.720> not<00:03:48.109> too<00:03:48.349> worried<00:03:48.620> about

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
might just be not too worried about

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.319 
might just be not too worried about
slagging<00:03:49.220> myself<00:03:49.669> and<00:03:49.910> go<00:03:50.000> with<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:50.299> a

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
slagging myself and go with like a

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.349 
slagging myself and go with like a
crossfire<00:03:50.900> or<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.230> Bonnie<00:03:51.650> but<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:52.819> don't<00:03:53.180> think

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
crossfire or a Bonnie but I don't think

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.300 
crossfire or a Bonnie but I don't think
I'll<00:03:53.480> do<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.199> we'll<00:03:54.980> see<00:03:55.129> what<00:03:55.280> happens

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
I'll do that so we'll see what happens

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.369 
I'll do that so we'll see what happens

love<00:04:06.290> thumper<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.370> I'll<00:04:07.489> go<00:04:07.609> over<00:04:07.639> why<00:04:07.970> don't

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
love thumper so I'll go over why don't

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.240 
love thumper so I'll go over why don't
use<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.480> love<00:04:08.599> thumper<00:04:08.930> real<00:04:09.139> quick<00:04:09.349> I<00:04:09.590> don't

use<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.609> love<00:04:10.760> thumper<00:04:11.120> because<00:04:11.389> it

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
use the love thumper because it

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.449 
use the love thumper because it
obviously<00:04:11.959> adds<00:04:12.199> that<00:04:12.470> roid<00:04:12.769> damage<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.340> when

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
obviously adds that roid damage and when

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.849 
obviously adds that roid damage and when
you<00:04:13.549> have<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:13.970> roid<00:04:14.239> damage<00:04:14.629> you<00:04:15.139> deal<00:04:15.349> a<00:04:15.530> lot

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
you have that roid damage you deal a lot

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.069 
you have that roid damage you deal a lot
more<00:04:16.250> damage<00:04:16.639> to<00:04:16.820> yourself<00:04:16.909> when<00:04:17.479> you<00:04:17.510> silence

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
more damage to yourself when you silence

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.830 
more damage to yourself when you silence
them<00:04:18.320> voices<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.099> so<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:20.000> don't<00:04:20.180> like<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:20.630> at

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
them voices and so I don't like that at

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.930 
them voices and so I don't like that at
all<00:04:21.079> he<00:04:21.769> definitely<00:04:22.010> has<00:04:22.370> enough<00:04:22.639> damage

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
all he definitely has enough damage

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.689 
all he definitely has enough damage
potential<00:04:23.449> without<00:04:23.659> it<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.860> not<00:04:25.010> be<00:04:25.190> using<00:04:25.580> it

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
potential without it to not be using it

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.600 
potential without it to not be using it
and<00:04:25.849> you<00:04:26.630> need<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:27.169> or<00:04:27.680> at<00:04:27.740> least<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.430> to

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
and you need that or at least I like to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.510 
and you need that or at least I like to
have<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.450> damage<00:04:29.840> reduction<00:04:30.169> from<00:04:30.770> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
have that damage reduction from the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.200 
have that damage reduction from the
um<00:04:32.830> Rough<00:04:33.830> Rider<00:04:34.069> and<00:04:34.310> definitely<00:04:34.759> the<00:04:34.940> extra

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
um Rough Rider and definitely the extra

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.270 
um Rough Rider and definitely the extra
health<00:04:35.449> because<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.349> makes<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.710> silence<00:04:37.160> the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
health because it makes the silence the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.790 
health because it makes the silence the
voices<00:04:37.460> penalty<00:04:38.000> hits<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.449> lot<00:04:38.780> less<00:04:39.199> damaging

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
voices penalty hits a lot less damaging

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.409 
voices penalty hits a lot less damaging
especially<00:04:40.400> since<00:04:40.669> you<00:04:40.849> don't<00:04:40.879> have<00:04:41.120> that

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
especially since you don't have that

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.059 
especially since you don't have that
extra<00:04:41.599> ROI<00:04:41.930> damage<00:04:42.319> to<00:04:42.470> kill<00:04:42.650> yourself

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
extra ROI damage to kill yourself

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.490 
extra ROI damage to kill yourself
Craig's<00:04:44.000> not<00:04:44.180> looking<00:04:44.599> to<00:04:44.810> hit<00:04:45.110> himself<00:04:45.229> in

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
Craig's not looking to hit himself in

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.730 
Craig's not looking to hit himself in
the<00:04:45.560> head<00:04:45.770> too<00:04:46.009> too<00:04:46.669> many<00:04:46.759> times<00:04:47.060> right<00:04:47.300> now

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
the head too too many times right now

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.770 
the head too too many times right now
because<00:04:48.740> that's<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.970> know<00:04:50.000> how<00:04:50.300> he<00:04:50.360> does<00:04:50.599> it

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
because that's you know how he does it

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.809 
because that's you know how he does it
sometimes<00:04:50.990> but<00:04:51.949> obviously<00:04:52.490> when<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.639> was

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
sometimes but obviously when I was

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.629 
sometimes but obviously when I was
fighting<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.240> bone<00:04:53.449> crusher<00:04:53.870> here<00:04:54.319> if<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:55.430> had

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
fighting this bone crusher here if I had

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.550 
fighting this bone crusher here if I had
Roy<00:04:55.849> damage<00:04:56.240> on<00:04:56.389> then<00:04:56.569> I<00:04:56.599> most<00:04:57.050> likely<00:04:57.259> would

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
Roy damage on then I most likely would

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.800 
Roy damage on then I most likely would
have<00:04:57.590> died<00:04:58.099> so<00:04:58.490> that's<00:04:58.639> why<00:04:58.879> I<00:04:58.909> do<00:04:59.120> not<00:04:59.210> use<00:04:59.569> a

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
have died so that's why I do not use a

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.350 
have died so that's why I do not use a
roid<00:05:00.169> shield<00:05:00.800> when<00:05:01.430> I'm<00:05:01.550> using<00:05:01.789> my<00:05:02.030> melee
