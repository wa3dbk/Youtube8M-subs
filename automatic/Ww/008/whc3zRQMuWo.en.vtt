you're obviously going to have a lot of
accessibility<00:02:59.709> here<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.400> let's<00:03:01.640> grab<00:03:01.849> my

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
accessibility here so let's grab my

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.840 
accessibility here so let's grab my
phone<00:03:02.299> five<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.720> pop<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:06.850> should

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
phone five and pop it in I should

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.920 
phone five and pop it in I should
probably<00:03:08.030> go<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.570> home<00:03:08.690> screen<00:03:10.930> don't

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
probably go to the home screen don't

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.490 
probably go to the home screen don't
need<00:03:12.109> you<00:03:12.320> people<00:03:12.680> read<00:03:12.890> my<00:03:13.130> texts<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.500> just

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
need you people read my texts so just

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.449 
need you people read my texts so just
pop<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.859> in<00:03:15.980> volume<00:03:16.549> buttons<00:03:16.820> first<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:18.459> let

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
pop it in volume buttons first and let

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.910 
pop it in volume buttons first and let
flex<00:03:20.150> around<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:22.450> you're<00:03:23.450> in<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.650> as<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.859> can

see the camera cut out it's very large

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.449 
see the camera cut out it's very large
so<00:03:26.690> obviously<00:03:27.109> this<00:03:27.380> is<00:03:27.590> why<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.769> said<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.340> would

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
so obviously this is why I said it would

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.319 
so obviously this is why I said it would
work<00:03:28.489> for<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.000> five<00:03:29.239> phone<00:03:29.540> 5<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.019> 5s

focus you do get nice lay on the table

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.330 
focus you do get nice lay on the table
design<00:04:30.169> with<00:04:31.169> this<00:04:31.320> case<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.800> can<00:04:31.919> see<00:04:32.100> right

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
design with this case you can see right

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.120 
design with this case you can see right
there<00:04:32.840> how<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:34.260> comes<00:04:34.470> up<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:34.889> over<00:04:34.979> the
