00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
to create a rock looking texture now I'm
just<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> repeat<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> same<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
just going to repeat the same with the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.340 
just going to repeat the same with the
white<00:01:11.150> okay<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.140> making

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
white okay now I'm going to be making

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.340 
white okay now I'm going to be making
four<00:01:13.890> bullet<00:01:14.250> holes<00:01:14.280> two<00:01:14.880> per<00:01:15.330> side<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.229> I've

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
four bullet holes two per side so I've

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.370 
four bullet holes two per side so I've
cut<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.590> four<00:01:17.310> pieces<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:18.060> mask<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.869> supposed

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cut out four pieces of mask it supposed

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.499 
cut out four pieces of mask it supposed
to<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> same<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.100> frisket<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.060> let's<00:01:21.270> find

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to be the same as frisket so let's find

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.149 
to be the same as frisket so let's find
out<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:24.470> now<00:01:25.470> there's<00:01:25.680> two<00:01:26.009> main

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
out if it is on it now there's two main

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
out if it is on it now there's two main
differences<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> bullet<00:01:27.479> holes<00:01:27.630> on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
differences with the bullet holes on

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
differences with the bullet holes on
each<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.350> panels<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.280> rock<00:01:29.549> it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
each of these panels in the rock it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
each of these panels in the rock it's
going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.720> chip<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> rocks<00:01:32.009> so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
going to take a chip out of the rocks so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
going to take a chip out of the rocks so
we<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> paint<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.840> will

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we have to paint that and we will

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
we have to paint that and we will
intersect<00:01:34.409> however<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.369> steel<00:01:35.729> it's

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
intersect however with the steel it's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
intersect however with the steel it's
going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> take<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> chip<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> top

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
going to take a chip out of the top

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
going to take a chip out of the top
layer<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.400> paint<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:39.000> whatever's<00:01:39.450> protecting

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
layer of paint or whatever's protecting

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.590 
layer of paint or whatever's protecting
it<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.350> our<00:01:41.100> shapes<00:01:41.490> need<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.570> more

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it so our shapes need to be a lot more

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
it so our shapes need to be a lot more
jagged<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.860> remember<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.369> once<00:01:44.820> you've

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
jagged just remember that once you've

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.999 
jagged just remember that once you've
cut<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.240> your<00:01:45.420> shapes<00:01:45.810> make<00:01:46.439> sure<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
cut out your shapes make sure that you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.950 
cut out your shapes make sure that you
hold<00:01:47.280> onto<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:48.090> shape<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.720> lose

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
hold onto that little shape if I lose

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.850 
hold onto that little shape if I lose
one<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.380> stuffed

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.520 

go<00:02:53.880> ahead<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.270> do<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> bullet<00:02:54.840> hole<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530

the<00:03:05.810> metal<00:03:06.140> side<00:03:06.349> on<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.830> rock<00:03:07.040> side

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.930 

now<00:03:21.599> just<00:03:21.870> doing<00:03:22.140> some<00:03:22.319> sharp<00:03:22.650> lines<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.849> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
now just doing some sharp lines just to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.420 
now just doing some sharp lines just to
give<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> sort<00:03:24.629> of<00:03:24.720> rough<00:03:25.440> texture<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.310> I'm

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
give a sort of rough texture and I'm

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.880 
give a sort of rough texture and I'm
going<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.819> add<00:03:26.970> one<00:03:27.629> shadow<00:03:28.049> along<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.739> bottom

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
going to add one shadow along the bottom

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.339 
going to add one shadow along the bottom
here<00:03:29.190> just<00:03:29.220> very<00:03:29.819> subtle<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.510> now<00:03:30.750> when<00:03:31.049> we<00:03:31.080> go

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
here just very subtle and now when we go

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.199 
here just very subtle and now when we go
with<00:03:31.500> black<00:03:31.799> we'll<00:03:32.250> create<00:03:32.519> some<00:03:32.610> textures

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
with black we'll create some textures

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.270 
with black we'll create some textures
coming<00:03:33.540> from<00:03:33.720> top<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.500> bullet<00:03:34.799> holes<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
coming from top of the bullet holes and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.610 
coming from top of the bullet holes and
the<00:03:35.549> bullet<00:03:35.849> hole<00:03:36.000> itself<00:03:36.450> let's<00:03:36.989> do<00:03:37.230> this

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.780 

we'll<00:03:43.620> just<00:03:43.650> add<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.890> couple<00:03:44.069> little<00:03:44.280> cracks

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
we'll just add a couple little cracks

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.360 
we'll just add a couple little cracks
don't<00:03:45.420> forget<00:03:45.690> with<00:03:45.840> your<00:03:45.959> cracks<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:47.190> add<00:03:47.340> a

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
don't forget with your cracks to add a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:55.690 
don't forget with your cracks to add a
highlight<00:03:47.819> afterwards

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.830 

just<00:03:56.700> remember<00:03:57.000> where<00:03:57.120> your<00:03:57.240> shadows<00:03:57.630> and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
just remember where your shadows and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.510 
just remember where your shadows and
highlights<00:03:57.900> are<00:03:58.470> coming<00:03:58.709> from<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.220> your<00:03:59.340> light

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
highlights are coming from so your light

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.130 
highlights are coming from so your light
source<00:03:59.819> is<00:04:00.150> going<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.510> be<00:04:00.600> coming<00:04:00.840> from<00:04:00.930> the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
source is going to be coming from the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.870 
source is going to be coming from the
top<00:04:01.410> generally<00:04:02.010> that's<00:04:02.250> why<00:04:02.459> we<00:04:02.610> have<00:04:02.730> our

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
top generally that's why we have our

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.370 
top generally that's why we have our
highlight<00:04:03.240> on<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.540> bottom<00:04:03.780> but<00:04:04.140> we're<00:04:04.260> also
