00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.760
 hello youtube people I'm a kid and 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.070
 welcome to a new gameplay of 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.680
 modern warfare 3 we will be playing 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.360
 tends to match on the arcade map and today 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.349
 I wanted to comment on 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.509
 this weapon pm 9 that many people criticize or 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.059
 he practically does not use because he thinks he is 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.460
 very bad if you do not remember it I do 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.989
 little take out a fashion with this weapon that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.079
 I will leave the link in the description if 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.780
 they did not see it in the community video 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.739
 united that I had commented and I think that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.829
 This weapon is very bad but very bad 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.499
 long distance but very good to short 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.059
 obviously having so many 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:01.870
 weapons of his machine gun like that of bp 45 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:05.350
 like pe 90 the pp 90 or the best in my 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.140
 opinion like the mp7 the pm 9 is in a 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.870
 very irrelevant place in this category 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.030
 and practically the people did not even touch it 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.070
 still in this game I the other day 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.930
 I was just practicing with my 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.310
 main account and I wanted to make a good 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 gameplay about this weapon because the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.380
 true that it's worth it is a weapon 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.350
 let's say if you like to play dynamic 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.420
 with all the possible movement that is 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.369
 move everywhere to surround all the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.680
 map as long as possible and not 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.020
 stay still for a second is a 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.820
 great option and I really like it 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.130
 play that way without changing in 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.170
 no place moving around all the time 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.250
 because it's the funniest way to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.710
 play this game the truth that the pm 9 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.049
 it's a pretty good option to kill 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.509
 people in short distance and I 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.140
 I recommend that you use, say, 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.849
 attachment muffler obviously if you go 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.039
 to play with a pair that is not easy 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:04.899
 of principal and if not put some 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.049
 peephole or something that can help you to 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.450
 aim because this weapon has a lot 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.319
 recall is very difficult to aim but 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.819
 I do not recommend that I try 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.440
 to use and the truth that did not work 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.590
 it's practically the rapid fire 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.320
 do not use is light eyelet in this class I'm 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.810
 using the perks string conditioning 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.470
 to run faster hard line for 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.480
 get assists and get them 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.800
 christine faster and be well to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.730
 keep your aim at close range 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.830
 from the waist I the truth that rapid 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.750
 fire I do not recommend them because the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.970
 cartridge is spent two to three 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.350
 society want to kill one maybe not 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.970
 You can kill him and you have to 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.190
 recharge and if you do not have the on light on 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.040
 jan to recharge faster you can 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.230
 it's very difficult to kill him so I do not 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.030
 I recommend you use the rapid fire going you 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.040
 to complicate the possibility much more 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.100
 of aiming you will go look at 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.560
 any part and well I recommend 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.480
 If you are bored or going to bored no no 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.730
 because I still enjoy it this way 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.650
 game but if you're already tired use the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.840
 same weapons and the game does not entertain you 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.090
 as much as in the beginning try to use 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.600
 other weapons first I recommend you 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.370
 9 pm 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.080
 that the truth is that it's good to try it or 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.090
 whether you do not like it you can change but 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.010
 I recommend you try them or if not 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.510
 some shotgun that you have not used as 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.820
 the model or you use it or some sniper that does not 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.740
 be the one we commonly use as the msb 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:38.530
 the 111th the el11 the truth that the 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.080
 ap-9 in my opinion is a great weapon to 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.800
 short distance we know it's not the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.710
 best option of sums without gans but for 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.990
 have fun and have a good time in this 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.730
 game does not come at all bad guys 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.920
