00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.580
 Yes 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.839
 life 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.450
 want 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.249
 Yes 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.710
 Due to bad weather, Cossack boys could watch TV 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.200
 in the second half none in name 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.430
 especially goalkeeper first may pass through 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.470
 it stood out in the second half at the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.390
 workers 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.120
 jesper a one against corner was this total 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.260
 where we are today here yes think so 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.610
 think so given the opportunity that we 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.870
 have created but also the opportunities 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.880
 said we created not so whole either 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.230
 much created to continue but this is 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.850
 really such a match people in one 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.000
 battlefield rain wind 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.590
 you you but I think you are that one 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.160
 test result is first you have yourself 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.020
 clearly 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.880
 bothered by the wind then you think the second 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.650
 Get rid of the benefits it needs 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.230
 go get it but yes but for me as the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.290
 wind again or you looked like 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.820
 it or because the leaves do not matter so 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.500
 and you get the second half yourself 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.310
 but a chances each other gallant chances 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.310
 they hold out well yes well nice 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.510
 that they take drugs out and you keep it that way 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.410
 still one point out here I think 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.850
 it does 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.170
 I think you advance angle is off 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.900
 always awkward match that you have for one 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.490
 point that it is just right and yes now 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.710
 let's see what spakenburg has 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.810
 done for me are two for clock but 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.950
 play all fires 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.330
 then next week 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.310
 IJsselmeer birds but expect from those 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.750
 competition becomes a tricky one again 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.370
 match imagine spakenburg wins 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.720
 there are now 4 points than if 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.120
 good is he is just another one 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.890
 contest you have to win and I think 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.239
 that they have the full go but he must 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.459
 we have to win every match 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.989
 are said to be such a golden one 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.830
 give a gift but that 's not how it works 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.000
 in top football 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.290
 no I think those players are just one 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.730
 so get the competition premium 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.739
 if they win they just get it too 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.060
 money and I think those players we 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.319
 choose what expected result 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.349
 think it's dangerous 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.180
 three points 0 5 drink 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.730
 harry you a one by corner and for you van 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.379
 the match and her eyes an a yes that 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.999
 I will be happy again 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.280
 I had waited we had land of oz 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.170
 would attract wind 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.090
 maya the event does not seem we are not 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.379
 although arrived 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.019
 bad field if you had a lot of long 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.879
 play ball yes and for actually continuous 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.079
 the head duels and well then it 's about the 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.209
 second ball 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.530
 marialoop also not well we are actually 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.689
 not been in the competition especially the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.310
 2nd half is a lot of ball loss a lot 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.590
 except lifo sloppy ball loss 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.019
 yes a bit nervous about the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.840
 little bit of tension 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.820
 yes a corner yes was round know better 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.490
 how is that jesper you still in the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.199
 match out on tight other than the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.810
 Easter weekend jobs have been for nothing 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.560
 yes no but 223 very good ones 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.960
 rescues 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.509
 so that was crucial because then exist 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.160
 okay that's just freezing 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.509
 but what was good was a glance 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.740
 and you just feel like your sitting 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.400
 no more in the point and then you have to 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.270
 to grab your point 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.789
 so in that sense it was already mature again 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.460
 3 more matches yes and I understand that 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.500
 spakenburg stands for so yes it stays 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.370
 exciting next week 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.530
 ijsselmeer birds 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.900
 what do you expect to race well 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.530
 this is yes count level also plays to 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.229
 leon 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.630
 so you just gotta be there in you 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.250
 just fall for the wind 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.259
 start playing with you can't afford it 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.430
 to lay back on a draw or whatever 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.659
 then 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.950
 I think this is again a moral 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:14.050
 so victory for spakenburg 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.050
 yes i can't say anything about it yet
