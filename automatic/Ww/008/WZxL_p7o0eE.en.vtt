enough<00:00:21.110> is<00:00:21.530> a<00:00:21.830> mod<00:00:22.430> or<00:00:22.790> a<00:00:22.820> conversion<00:00:23.360> for<00:00:23.930> a

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
enough is a mod or a conversion for a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.100 
enough is a mod or a conversion for a
Gravatar<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.640> I<00:00:25.730> had<00:00:26.030> to<00:00:26.120> grab<00:00:26.330> at<00:00:26.450> our<00:00:26.600> cabinet

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
Gravatar so I had to grab at our cabinet

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.910 
Gravatar so I had to grab at our cabinet
I<00:00:27.289> liked<00:00:28.190> Gravatar<00:00:28.730> is<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:28.910> good<00:00:29.420> game<00:00:29.930> but<00:00:30.260> you

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
I liked Gravatar is a good game but you

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.430 
I liked Gravatar is a good game but you
know<00:00:30.950> back<00:00:31.310> in<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:31.580> day<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.210> lot<00:00:33.020> of<00:00:33.110> people

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
know back in the day a lot of people

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.610 
know back in the day a lot of people
maybe<00:00:33.800> didn't<00:00:34.250> like<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:34.610> much<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:36.380> game

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
maybe didn't like it so much so the game

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.830 
maybe didn't like it so much so the game
wasn't<00:00:37.040> doing<00:00:37.220> well<00:00:37.430> in<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.640> arcade<00:00:38.060> so<00:00:38.090> Atari

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
wasn't doing well in the arcade so Atari

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.100 
wasn't doing well in the arcade so Atari
had<00:00:39.110> this<00:00:39.290> great<00:00:39.530> idea<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:40.010> make<00:00:40.280> a<00:00:40.340> conversion

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
had this great idea to make a conversion

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.200 
had this great idea to make a conversion
for<00:00:42.110> Gravatar<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:43.070> turn<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:43.460> into<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.730> new<00:00:43.970> game

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
for Gravatar to turn it into a new game

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.710 
for Gravatar to turn it into a new game
and<00:00:44.540> this<00:00:45.200> new<00:00:45.410> game<00:00:45.649> is<00:00:46.070> Black<00:00:46.730> Widow<00:00:47.060> so<00:00:47.690> I

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
and this new game is Black Widow so I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.020 
and this new game is Black Widow so I
got<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.170> conversion<00:00:48.770> kit<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.250> it's<00:00:49.520> a<00:00:49.700> pretty

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
got the conversion kit and it's a pretty

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.330 
got the conversion kit and it's a pretty
easy<00:00:50.300> install<00:00:50.960> basically<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:52.130> do<00:00:52.309> is

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
easy install basically what you do is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.760 
easy install basically what you do is
you<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.090> it's<00:00:53.270> a<00:00:53.360> PCB<00:00:53.899> swap<00:00:54.230> or<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:54.620> can

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
you it's a it's a PCB swap or you can

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.610 
you it's a it's a PCB swap or you can
actually<00:00:54.920> modify<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.820> Gravatar<00:00:56.750> PCB<00:00:57.290> which<00:00:57.469> we

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
actually modify a Gravatar PCB which we

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.160 
actually modify a Gravatar PCB which we
have<00:00:57.739> right<00:00:57.950> here<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:59.000> didn't<00:00:59.899> do<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.110> I

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
have right here I didn't do that I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.740 
have right here I didn't do that I
actually<00:01:00.380> got<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.860> black<00:01:01.370> widow<00:01:01.579> PCB<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.510> just

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
actually got a black widow PCB so I just

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.010 
actually got a black widow PCB so I just
pulled<00:01:03.020> out<00:01:03.170> my<00:01:03.200> Gravatt<00:01:03.770> r1<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.689> it's<00:01:05.689> a<00:01:05.810> very

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
pulled out my Gravatt r1 and it's a very

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.419 
pulled out my Gravatt r1 and it's a very
easy<00:01:06.259> swap<00:01:06.770> there's<00:01:07.039> just<00:01:07.189> two<00:01:07.310> edge

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429 
easy swap there's just two edge

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:08.980 
easy swap there's just two edge
connectors<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.179> slides<00:01:08.420> out<00:01:08.630> then<00:01:08.899> you

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
connectors and it slides out then you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.529 
connectors and it slides out then you
slide<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.350> new<00:01:09.469> one<00:01:09.649> in<00:01:09.859> and<00:01:10.479> there's<00:01:11.479> a

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
slide the new one in and there's a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.279 
slide the new one in and there's a
control<00:01:12.020> panel<00:01:12.350> swap<00:01:12.829> so<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:13.189> had<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:13.459> remove<00:01:13.850> my

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
control panel swap so I had to remove my

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.469 
control panel swap so I had to remove my
Gravatar<00:01:15.340> control<00:01:16.340> panel<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:16.850> now<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.119> have<00:01:17.450> a

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
Gravatar control panel and now I have a

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.099 
Gravatar control panel and now I have a
black<00:01:17.990> widow<00:01:18.499> control<00:01:19.249> panel<00:01:19.990> Gravatar<00:01:20.990> of

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
black widow control panel Gravatar of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.559 
black widow control panel Gravatar of
course<00:01:21.380> had<00:01:21.679> just<00:01:22.039> buttons<00:01:22.459> black<00:01:23.240> widow<00:01:23.479> has

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
course had just buttons black widow has

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.190 
course had just buttons black widow has
two<00:01:24.170> eight-way<00:01:24.679> joystick<00:01:24.709> s--<00:01:25.539> also<00:01:26.539> there<00:01:27.079> is

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
two eight-way joystick s-- also there is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.649 
two eight-way joystick s-- also there is
a<00:01:27.229> marquee<00:01:27.709> swap<00:01:28.009> obviously<00:01:28.639> so<00:01:28.939> I<00:01:28.969> yanked<00:01:29.539> out

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
a marquee swap obviously so I yanked out

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.769 
a marquee swap obviously so I yanked out
the<00:01:30.459> Gravatar<00:01:31.459> Marquis<00:01:32.179> and<00:01:32.329> put<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:32.630> in

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
the Gravatar Marquis and put that in

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:34.779 
the Gravatar Marquis and put that in
there<00:01:32.959> and<00:01:33.499> other<00:01:34.039> than<00:01:34.249> that<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.609> then<00:01:34.729> I

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
there and other than that and then I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.660 
there and other than that and then I
also<00:01:34.969> had<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.299> do<00:01:35.420> some<00:01:35.630> rewiring<00:01:36.079> because

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
also had to do some rewiring because

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.370 
also had to do some rewiring because
there<00:01:37.670> just<00:01:37.700> wasn't<00:01:38.149> enough<00:01:38.420> wires<00:01:38.869> on<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
there just wasn't enough wires on the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.999 
there just wasn't enough wires on the
harness<00:01:39.649> on<00:01:40.209> Gravatar<00:01:41.209> to<00:01:41.990> easily<00:01:42.469> convert<00:01:42.740> it

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
harness on Gravatar to easily convert it

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.969 
harness on Gravatar to easily convert it
to<00:01:43.039> this<00:01:43.219> so<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.399> have<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.639> add<00:01:43.849> four<00:01:44.270> wires<00:01:44.979> to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
to this so you have to add four wires to

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.949 
to this so you have to add four wires to
the<00:01:46.099> edge<00:01:46.219> connector<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.539> connector<00:01:47.569> that

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
the edge connector the connector that

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.949 
the edge connector the connector that
actually<00:01:48.289> connects<00:01:48.679> here<00:01:49.039> on<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.279> PCB

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
actually connects here on the PCB

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.709 
actually connects here on the PCB
there's<00:01:50.959> four<00:01:51.380> unused<00:01:51.950> wire<00:01:52.880> holes<00:01:53.209> I<00:01:53.539> guess

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
there's four unused wire holes I guess

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.999 
there's four unused wire holes I guess
we<00:01:53.929> want<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.319> call<00:01:54.529> them<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.889> edge

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
we want to call them on the edge

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.159 
we want to call them on the edge
connector<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:56.270> just<00:01:56.450> hook<00:01:56.749> those<00:01:56.929> in

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:57.169 
connector and you just hook those in

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:59.609 
connector and you just hook those in
there<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.560> then<00:01:57.919> you<00:01:58.039> run<00:01:58.279> the<00:01:58.399> wires<00:01:58.639> to<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
there and then you run the wires to the

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.429 
there and then you run the wires to the
the<00:02:00.619> fire<00:02:00.859> joystick<00:02:01.489> and<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.659> what<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.049> black

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
the fire joystick and so what is black

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.909 
the fire joystick and so what is black
widow<00:02:03.859> you<00:02:04.399> say<00:02:04.669> black<00:02:05.479> widow<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.139> kind<00:02:06.770> of

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:06.919 
widow you say black widow is kind of

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.639 
widow you say black widow is kind of
like<00:02:07.189> Robotron<00:02:07.909> it's<00:02:08.840> it's<00:02:09.410> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
like Robotron it's it's a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.619 
like Robotron it's it's a
vector<00:02:10.009> Robotron<00:02:10.970> type<00:02:11.329> game<00:02:11.599> with<00:02:12.049> bugs<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
vector Robotron type game with bugs and

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.569 
vector Robotron type game with bugs and
so<00:02:14.629> why<00:02:14.840> do<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.019> suck<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:15.590> tripod<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.189> I'll

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
so why do I suck the tripod and I'll

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.449 
so why do I suck the tripod and I'll
kind<00:02:16.909> of<00:02:16.939> show<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.209> how<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.480> works<00:02:17.629> okay<00:02:18.459> we

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
kind of show you how it works okay we

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.030 
kind of show you how it works okay we
are<00:02:19.730> back<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.360> lights<00:02:20.629> are<00:02:21.049> off<00:02:21.260> we<00:02:21.620> have<00:02:21.799> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
are back the lights are off we have the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.240 
are back the lights are off we have the
tripod<00:02:22.519> set<00:02:22.790> up<00:02:22.939> here<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.420> let's<00:02:23.680> set<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:24.950> up

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
tripod set up here so let's set this up

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.110 
tripod set up here so let's set this up
and<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.730> will<00:02:25.790> attempt<00:02:26.329> to<00:02:26.390> play<00:02:26.659> this<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:28.120> think

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and I will attempt to play this I think

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.270 
and I will attempt to play this I think
that'll<00:02:29.480> work<00:02:29.510> just<00:02:29.989> fine<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.010> I'm<00:02:31.099> going<00:02:31.220> to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
that'll work just fine so I'm going to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.069 
that'll work just fine so I'm going to
start<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.549> game<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.480> first<00:02:32.720> thing<00:02:32.930> it

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
start the game and the first thing it

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.899 
start the game and the first thing it
asks<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.739> what<00:02:34.010> level<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.609> want<00:02:34.819> to

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
asks you is what level do you want to

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.599 
asks you is what level do you want to
start<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.569> can<00:02:35.720> actually<00:02:35.900> choose<00:02:36.609> all

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
start on and you can actually choose all

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.610 
start on and you can actually choose all
the<00:02:37.730> way<00:02:37.760> up<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.000> level<00:02:38.150> 21<00:02:38.689> is<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.200> default

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the way up to level 21 is the default

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.860 
the way up to level 21 is the default
dip<00:02:40.250> switch<00:02:40.459> setting<00:02:40.819> so<00:02:41.269> we're<00:02:41.569> just<00:02:41.750> going

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
dip switch setting so we're just going

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.899 
dip switch setting so we're just going
to<00:02:41.900> start<00:02:42.139> on<00:02:42.230> level<00:02:42.379> 1<00:02:42.709> which<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.700> very

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
to start on level 1 which is the very

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.629 
to start on level 1 which is the very
basic<00:02:44.329> level<00:02:44.659> and<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:45.829> are<00:02:46.129> this<00:02:46.280> little

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
basic level and so you are this little

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.059 
basic level and so you are this little
bug<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:47.329> you<00:02:47.780> move<00:02:48.019> with<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.260> left<00:02:48.379> stick<00:02:48.889> and

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
bug and you move with the left stick and

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.309 
bug and you move with the left stick and
you<00:02:49.280> fire<00:02:49.609> with<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.000> right<00:02:50.150> stick<00:02:50.389> and<00:02:51.139> when

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
you fire with the right stick and when

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.710 
you fire with the right stick and when
you<00:02:51.409> kill<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.739> bugs<00:02:51.950> they<00:02:52.190> drop<00:02:52.489> dollar<00:02:53.150> signs

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.679 

and<00:03:00.129> then<00:03:01.129> see<00:03:01.760> this<00:03:01.909> bug<00:03:02.060> right<00:03:02.209> here<00:03:02.450> you

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
and then see this bug right here you

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.539 
and then see this bug right here you
actually<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.500> bug<00:03:03.709> will<00:03:03.859> not<00:03:03.980> actually<00:03:04.129> kill

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
actually that bug will not actually kill

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.940 
actually that bug will not actually kill
you<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.359> he's<00:03:05.480> trying<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.870> steal<00:03:06.139> your<00:03:06.500> food

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
you but he's trying to steal your food

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.360 
you but he's trying to steal your food
and<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.849> competing<00:03:08.629> bug<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.170> shows<00:03:09.409> up<00:03:09.650> so

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and a competing bug that shows up so

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.069 
and a competing bug that shows up so
basically<00:03:10.639> this<00:03:10.849> is<00:03:10.909> a<00:03:11.030> game<00:03:11.269> there's<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.930> lot

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
basically this is a game there's a lot

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.750 
basically this is a game there's a lot
like<00:03:12.200> Robotron<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.829> weight<00:03:12.980> controls<00:03:13.459> or

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
like Robotron the weight controls or

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.710 
like Robotron the weight controls or
geometry<00:03:14.000> wars<00:03:14.510> on

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
geometry wars on

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.520 
geometry wars on
and<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.880> gets<00:03:18.090> harder<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.780> harder<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.230> go

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
and it gets harder and harder as you go

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.400 
and it gets harder and harder as you go
along<00:03:19.650> bonus<00:03:20.610> levels<00:03:21.060> now<00:03:21.810> what<00:03:22.050> happened

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
along bonus levels now what happened

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.720 
along bonus levels now what happened
right<00:03:22.530> here<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.830> see<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.340> thing<00:03:23.550> right<00:03:23.670> here

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
right here is see this thing right here

right here is see this thing right here
that's<00:03:24.000> an<00:03:24.120> egg<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.660> dropped<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.230> need

that's an egg that got dropped so I need

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.170 
that's an egg that got dropped so I need
to<00:03:25.590> push<00:03:25.800> that<00:03:25.950> off<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.370> level<00:03:26.580> before

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
to push that off the level before

catches these red web lines short and I

can't can't pass through that and that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.220 
can't can't pass through that and that
becomes<00:03:42.450> actually<00:03:42.780> part<00:03:42.990> of<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.110> level

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
becomes actually part of the level

becomes actually part of the level
design<00:03:43.680> later<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> game<00:03:44.370> where<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.090> can

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
design later in the game where you can

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.380 
design later in the game where you can
only<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.780> certain<00:03:46.260> ways<00:03:47.030> which<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.150> kind<00:03:48.360> of

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
only go certain ways which is kind of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.830 
only go certain ways which is kind of
clever<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:49.560> green<00:03:49.800> ones<00:03:50.210> I'm<00:03:51.210> not<00:03:51.270> sure<00:03:51.660> what

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
clever the green ones I'm not sure what

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
clever the green ones I'm not sure what
the<00:03:51.930> green<00:03:52.110> ones<00:03:52.320> mean<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.800> be<00:03:52.890> honest<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the green ones mean to be honest this is

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.320 
the green ones mean to be honest this is
like<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> little<00:03:54.240> bonus<00:03:54.510> level<00:03:55.140> set<00:03:55.260> Galaga<00:03:56.330> I

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
like a little bonus level set Galaga I

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:07.270 
like a little bonus level set Galaga I
didn't<00:03:57.660> get<00:03:57.810> all<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.230> them<00:03:58.530> so<00:04:04.820> it's<00:04:05.820> probably

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
didn't get all of them so it's probably

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.190 
didn't get all of them so it's probably
more<00:04:08.280> fun<00:04:08.550> than<00:04:08.700> Gravatar<00:04:09.210> but<00:04:09.870> i<00:04:09.930> think<00:04:10.110> it

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
more fun than Gravatar but i think it

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.710 
more fun than Gravatar but i think it
has<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.410> broader<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.340> yield<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.880> Gravatar<00:04:12.360> so

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
has a broader of yield and Gravatar so

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
has a broader of yield and Gravatar so
I'm<00:04:13.590> talking<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.100> leaving<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.520> in<00:04:14.670> my
