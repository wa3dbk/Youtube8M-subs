first another time you would do
sequential<00:01:25.380> order<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.100> maybe<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.880> you're<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
sequential order is maybe if you're on a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
sequential order is maybe if you're on a
limited<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:27.990> schedule<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.040> to

towards<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> end<00:01:38.150> for<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.270> demo<00:01:39.570> let's<00:01:39.810> go

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
towards the end for this demo let's go

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.179 
towards the end for this demo let's go
ahead<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.350> random<00:01:40.740> order<00:01:42.619> okay<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.890> pulls

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
ahead and do random order okay it pulls

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.590 
ahead and do random order okay it pulls
up<00:01:44.399> 20<00:01:44.790> different<00:01:44.970> lights<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:47.390> they're<00:01:48.390> all

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
up 20 different lights and they're all

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.480 
up 20 different lights and they're all
lit<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.560> 20<00:01:50.280> questions

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
lit up so we know we have 20 questions

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.389 
lit up so we know we have 20 questions
here<00:01:51.320> let's<00:01:52.320> click<00:01:52.649> Next<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.860> randomly

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
here let's click Next so it randomly

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.990 
here let's click Next so it randomly
selected<00:02:00.030> question<00:02:00.509> number<00:02:00.780> six<00:02:02.000> who

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
selected question number six who

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.410 
selected question number six who
invented<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> motion<00:02:04.200> picture<00:02:04.590> camera<00:02:05.420> first

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
invented the motion picture camera first

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.609 
invented the motion picture camera first
step<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:09.360> thing<00:02:09.660> time<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.470> these

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
step is to have this thing time so these

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.610 
step is to have this thing time so these
are<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.979> steps<00:02:11.310> across<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> top<00:02:12.360> here

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
are the steps across the top here

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
are the steps across the top here
and<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.459> clue<00:02:14.760> or<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> use<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and this is a little clue or I use a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.059 
and this is a little clue or I use a
teacher<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.410> share<00:02:16.620> with<00:02:16.739> your<00:02:16.890> classroom

think<00:02:20.069> about<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.430> answer<00:02:20.610> no<00:02:21.269> talking<00:02:21.840> so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
think about your answer no talking so

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.160 
think about your answer no talking so
students<00:02:22.590> are<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.800> thinking<00:02:23.989> give<00:02:24.989> them

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
