00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.760
 Extremely small dimensions (body level Sony RX100) 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.980
 Folding lens, only a little more power is needed to release (no fuses) 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.960
 Very fast focus 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.560
 Widescreen touch screen (4: 3 thumbnail image on 16: 9 display) 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.620
 Manual focusing on a 12-32mm lens without manual focus ring can be done with the buttons or the display 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260
 Two different sharpening speeds 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
 Touch quick menu 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.800
 With a little carelessness, it is very easy to accidentally touch the screen and flip the AF point into the upper right corner 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.760
 Quick menu is fully configurable 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.040
 Full HD 1080p50 movies are supported, stabilization is decent, zooming is seamless 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.780
 In manual video shooting, the aperture and time can also be changed during the course 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.660
 The external flash has a somewhat strange shape, not very powerful. Watch for the synchronization time of 1/50 second. 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.880
 The dynamic range of the chip is decent, the lens suffers from glare 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.460
 Most of the time, autofocus is sharp and accurate, but the movement of the branches was very fast and did not manage 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.240
 Change aperture during shooting from F5.6 to F22 and back 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.980
 Night photos go Lumix GM5 very well (support for long exposures, -4EV AF system sensitivity), but be sure to turn on long exposure exposures 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.180
 However, night video is worse, showing more noise 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680
 1/80 s, F5.6, ISO 250, 32mm (64mm EQ) 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.285
 1/640 s, F5.6, ISO 640, 32mm (64mm EQ) 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320
 1/320 s, F5.6, ISO 200, 12mm (24mm EQ) 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.305
 1/800 s, F3.5, ISO 200, 12mm (24mm EQ)
