hello<00:00:01.740> everyone<00:00:02.159> its<00:00:02.399> Greg<00:00:02.610> just<00:00:03.449> want<00:00:03.780> to

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
hello everyone its Greg just want to

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.800 
hello everyone its Greg just want to
demonstrate<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.000> functionality<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.720> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
demonstrate the functionality of the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.240 
demonstrate the functionality of the
fans<00:00:09.080> send<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.200> code<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> Arduino<00:00:10.860> which

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
fans send this code to the Arduino which

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
fans send this code to the Arduino which
will<00:00:11.460> turn<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.910> very<00:00:12.450> slowly<00:00:12.860> top<00:00:13.860> left<00:00:14.130> fan<00:00:21.500> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
will turn on very slowly top left fan so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.910 
will turn on very slowly top left fan so
they<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.740> stop<00:00:22.980> speeding<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.460> stays<00:00:23.670> there

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
they get stop speeding and stays there

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.200 
they get stop speeding and stays there
and<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.279> code<00:00:26.490> will<00:00:26.760> stop<00:00:27.029> all<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> fans<00:00:27.650> and

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
and this code will stop all the fans and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.580 
and this code will stop all the fans and
let's<00:00:30.210> turn<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.720> top<00:00:31.170> right<00:00:31.410> thing<00:00:39.590> all

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
let's turn on the top right thing all

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.689 
let's turn on the top right thing all
right<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.950> stop<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:58.389 

and<00:00:47.489> autumn<00:00:48.489> left<00:00:48.699> fan

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.370 

stop

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.860 

and<00:01:17.660> stop<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.860> last<00:01:22.010> piece<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.250> code<00:01:22.870> turn

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
and stop and the last piece of code turn

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:36.710 
and stop and the last piece of code turn
all<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.110> fans<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.530> Sam<00:01:24.800> pace

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.950 

and<00:01:37.830> they<00:01:38.830> can<00:01:39.010> be<00:01:39.190> turned<00:01:39.430> on<00:01:39.550> immediately

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and they can be turned on immediately

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.020 
and they can be turned on immediately
just<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.140> wanted<00:01:41.410> to<00:01:41.500> show<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.680> we<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:42.310> the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
just I wanted to show that we have the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.310 
just I wanted to show that we have the
capability<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.570> control<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.930> speed<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.260> the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
capability to control the speed of the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.260 
capability to control the speed of the
fans<00:01:44.560> as<00:01:44.770> well<00:01:44.950> as<00:01:45.010> capabilities<00:01:45.550> turn<00:01:46.120> them

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
fans as well as capabilities turn them

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.650 
fans as well as capabilities turn them
on<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.890> see<00:01:48.070> we<00:01:48.310> have<00:01:48.670> enough<00:01:49.450> power

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
on and you can see we have enough power

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.780 
on and you can see we have enough power
from<00:01:50.080> our<00:01:50.200> power<00:01:50.350> supply<00:01:50.730> power<00:01:51.730> off<00:01:51.940> our<00:01:52.180> fans

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
from our power supply power off our fans

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.830 
from our power supply power off our fans
once<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:54.880> gets<00:01:55.000> up<00:01:55.090> tires<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.450> be<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.660> stops

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
once it gets up tires to be it stops

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.370 
once it gets up tires to be it stops
making<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.170> whining<00:01:56.380> sound<00:01:56.850> stop<00:01:58.380> okay

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
making that whining sound stop okay

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.250 
making that whining sound stop okay
that's<00:02:00.040> it
