00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.709 

what's<00:00:09.920> amazing<00:00:10.280> about<00:00:10.639> tooth<00:00:11.090> development

what's amazing about tooth development

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.820 
what's amazing about tooth development
is<00:00:11.870> how<00:00:12.349> early<00:00:12.889> it<00:00:13.100> starts<00:00:14.619> this<00:00:15.619> embryo<00:00:16.160> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
is how early it starts this embryo is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.340 
is how early it starts this embryo is
six<00:00:17.220> weeks<00:00:17.430> old<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.150> yet<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> epithelium

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
six weeks old and yet the epithelium

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.890 
six weeks old and yet the epithelium
over<00:00:19.740> its<00:00:19.860> mandible<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.550> already<00:00:21.360> thickening
