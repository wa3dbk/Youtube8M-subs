00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.400
 now you will learn how to perform the 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.400
 compressor test 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.949
 the electric motor is responsible for 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.470
 the compressors and in the case of 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.399
 drinkers in refrigerators and freezers 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:35.110
 domestic 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:37.270
 this motor is always single-phase that either 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.489
 say that it will be fed by a 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.760
 phase and one neutral or two phases and 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.660
 voltage will be 127 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.940
 volts or 220 volts 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.700
 power will depend on the capacity of the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.250
 equipment but in general is 1 12 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.380
 one- sixth of HP when it comes to 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.160
 refrigerator or water cooler compressor 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.829
 of water and from one-fifth to one-third of HP 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.320
 if it is a freezer or 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:14.439
 two-door refrigerator set 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.079
 motor or compressor is 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.299
 classified as he physician because 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.939
 both are installed inside a 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.549
 metal casing which can not be 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.039
 be open as you learned in the course 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.069
 the compressor can be of 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.940
 different types such as piston or 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:38.220
 rotary alternative 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.540
 the piston is the most common of all 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.910
 independent of the type of compressor 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.880
 the electric motor has two coils that 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.550
 are formed by these in bearings 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.710
 obtained by copper conductors 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.520
 they are covered by a layer of 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.230
 special varnish and keep them insulated 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.730
 preventing the occurrence of a short circuit 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.980
 when the two coils are energized 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.730
 can be represented schematically 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.910
 as a starting point where 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.690
 frog is only energized during 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.690
 engine start 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.940
 already another one of operation or of march also 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.600
 energized during engine start-up and 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.820
 so it stays the same on 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.940
 to the operating coil may also be 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.040
 called the principal and your terminal is 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.080
 conventionally represented by 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.020
 letter m or r 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.030
 already the starting coil which can also be 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.480
 be called an auxiliary has his 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.420
 terminal represented by the letter a of s 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.140
 besides the two coils there is a third 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 common driver that normally 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.920
 represented by the letter c 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.969
 This is why in the compressor housing 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.159
 there are three connection terminals 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.939
 which are used to make the 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.939
 power supply
