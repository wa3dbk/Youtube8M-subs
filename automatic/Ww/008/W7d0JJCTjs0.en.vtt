offering different kinds of coverage
obviously<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> look<00:00:16.980> will<00:00:17.130> be<00:00:17.250> slightly

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
obviously and the look will be slightly

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.279 
obviously and the look will be slightly
different<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> style<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.109> be

different but the style can be

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.010 
different but the style can be
replicated<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.920> any<00:00:20.310> other<00:00:20.609> jobs<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.539> job<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
replicated with any other jobs the job I

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.349 
replicated with any other jobs the job I
used<00:00:22.470> today<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.039> actually<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> redesigned<00:00:24.000> hood

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
used today is actually a redesigned hood

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.230 
used today is actually a redesigned hood
out<00:00:24.539> has<00:00:24.869> evolved<00:00:25.529> again<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.099> I've<00:00:26.939> now

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
out has evolved again and I've now

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
out has evolved again and I've now
changed<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.779> couple<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.050> things<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.890> I've

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
changed a couple of things so what I've

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.650 
changed a couple of things so what I've
done<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.670> wanted<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> get<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> size

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
done was I wanted to get the size

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.290 
done was I wanted to get the size
perfect<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:32.009> create<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.579> style<00:00:33.030> because

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
perfect to create this style because

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.299 
perfect to create this style because
whilst<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.410> creating<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> old

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
whilst I was creating it with the old

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.490 
whilst I was creating it with the old
hood<00:00:35.550> job<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.239> slightly<00:00:36.540> complicated<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
hood job it was slightly complicated and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.450 
hood job it was slightly complicated and
there<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.710> quite<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> bit<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.219> tucking

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
there was quite a bit of tucking

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280 
there was quite a bit of tucking
involved<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.300> create<00:00:39.629> other<00:00:39.780> styles<00:00:40.200> as

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
involved you can create other styles as

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.530 
involved you can create other styles as
well<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.620> course<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:42.360> very

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
well of course but this is just very

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.330 
well of course but this is just very
much<00:00:42.780> suited<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.440> style<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.250> I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
much suited to this style just because I

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.450 
much suited to this style just because I
love<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.670> style<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.000> much<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.829> changed

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
love this style so much and so I changed

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850 
love this style so much and so I changed
the<00:00:47.700> length<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.750> wings<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> two<00:00:49.590> side

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the length of the wings the two side

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
the length of the wings the two side
bits<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.370> no<00:00:50.489> jobs<00:00:50.789> maybe<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.390> our

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
bits in no jobs maybe I know what our

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.630 
bits in no jobs maybe I know what our
job<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.230> something<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> created<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
job is it's something that I created a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
job is it's something that I created a
couple<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> years<00:00:54.059> ago<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.170> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
couple of years ago and what it is is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.319 
couple of years ago and what it is is
it's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.860> hedgehog<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.640> hood<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it's a hedgehog with a hood on it so the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's a hedgehog with a hood on it so the
whole<00:00:57.449> remains<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.770> two<00:00:58.949> side<00:00:59.340> bits<00:00:59.730> are

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
whole remains and the two side bits are

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
whole remains and the two side bits are
what<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.449> altered<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.410> slightly<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.460> is

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
what I altered very slightly so one is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 
what I altered very slightly so one is
slightly<00:01:03.660> shorter<00:01:03.960> than<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> other<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.739> it's

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
slightly shorter than the other but it's

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
slightly shorter than the other but it's
a<00:01:04.979> very<00:01:05.129> precise<00:01:05.900> measurement<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.530> can

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
a very precise measurement you can

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.980 
a very precise measurement you can
adjust<00:01:08.310> your<00:01:08.460> old<00:01:08.760> hood<00:01:08.970> job<00:01:09.180> as<00:01:09.420> well<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
adjust your old hood job as well if you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
adjust your old hood job as well if you
like<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> style<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> slightly

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
like the style just make it slightly

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
like the style just make it slightly
shorter<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.750> side<00:01:12.990> compared<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
shorter on one side compared to the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
shorter on one side compared to the
other<00:01:13.619> also<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> style<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.939> adjust

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
other also to this style you can adjust

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.910 
other also to this style you can adjust
it<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.689> easily<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.200> you're<00:01:16.380> somebody

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it really easily so if you're somebody

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830 
it really easily so if you're somebody
who<00:01:17.130> doesn't<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> look<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> feel<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
who doesn't like the look or the feel of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
who doesn't like the look or the feel of
pinning<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> hood<00:01:20.009> job<00:01:20.189> behind<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.759> ears

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pinning the hood job behind the ears

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
pinning the hood job behind the ears
you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.540> also<00:01:21.720> very<00:01:22.110> easily<00:01:22.200> pin<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> from<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you can also very easily pin it from the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.830 
you can also very easily pin it from the
front<00:01:23.369> whilst<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.880> doesn't<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.450> strings

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
front whilst this doesn't have strings

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.670 
front whilst this doesn't have strings
you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.040> normal<00:01:27.049> most<00:01:28.049> manager

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you can just use a normal most manager

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.670 
you can just use a normal most manager
pin<00:01:28.979> or<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.280> safety<00:01:30.270> pin<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> use<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> safety

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pin or a safety pin so to use a safety

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.010 
pin or a safety pin so to use a safety
pin<00:01:31.799> make<00:01:32.070> sure<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:34.130> put<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.880> bead<00:01:36.689> or

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
pin make sure that you put in a bead or

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.980 
pin make sure that you put in a bead or
a<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> paper<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.430> something<00:01:38.720> through<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

this part here although there is always

this part here although there is always
a<00:01:47.490> chance<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> use<00:01:48.360> these<00:01:48.570> pins<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.110> the

a chance if you use these pins for the

a chance if you use these pins for the

scarf to snag on the other side of the
pin<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.540> well<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:52.140> why<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.350> always

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
pin as well that's why I always

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.730 
pin as well that's why I always
recommend<00:01:53.149> nose<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> jab<00:01:54.720> pins<00:01:54.990> these<00:01:55.439> are

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
recommend nose like a jab pins these are

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.859 
recommend nose like a jab pins these are
of<00:01:56.159> course<00:01:56.520> bigger<00:01:56.909> considerably<00:01:57.689> bigger

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
of course bigger considerably bigger

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.550 
of course bigger considerably bigger
than<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> safety<00:02:00.329> pin<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.960> don't

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
than this kind of safety pin so I don't

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
than this kind of safety pin so I don't
know<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.040> weigh<00:02:02.189> up<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.430> chance<00:02:02.880> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
know you have to weigh up the chance of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.990 
know you have to weigh up the chance of
snagging<00:02:03.540> around<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.409> versus<00:02:05.399> how<00:02:05.670> big<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
snagging around here versus how big of a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.240 
snagging around here versus how big of a
pin<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.270> want<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.719> use<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.069> up

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
pin you want to use so that's really up

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.660 
pin you want to use so that's really up
to<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
to you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so let me a start it and I start off by

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.010 
so let me a start it and I start off by
rolling<00:02:11.520> off<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.700> verge<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.120> because<00:02:12.569> my

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
rolling off the verge on because my

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
rolling off the verge on because my
chair<00:02:13.290> happens<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.709> be<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.520> going

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
