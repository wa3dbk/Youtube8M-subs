can bring it out the back for maybe a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.400 
can bring it out the back for maybe a
bad<00:02:39.870> connection<00:02:40.670> points<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.819> side<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.450> so

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
bad connection points on the side so so

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.110 
bad connection points on the side so so
point<00:02:43.650> down<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:44.970> if
