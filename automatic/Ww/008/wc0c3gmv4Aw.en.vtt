00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.280 
to make thick and creamy frosting I
first<00:00:11.730> condition<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> clay<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:13.049> warm

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
first condition the clay so it's warm

I'm using promote plate but you could

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.000 
I'm using promote plate but you could
use<00:00:53.239> even<00:00:53.449> softer<00:00:53.930> claims<00:00:54.199> like<00:00:54.410> female<00:00:54.769> soft

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
use even softer claims like female soft

and scar p3 although in real time it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.689 
and scar p3 although in real time it
only<00:00:57.649> took<00:00:57.800> me<00:00:57.949> 1<00:00:58.309> minute<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:58.879> 50<00:00:59.210> seconds<00:00:59.660> to

only took me 1 minute and 50 seconds to

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
store it I use glass jars this one in

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.620 
store it I use glass jars this one in
particular<00:01:04.070> used<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.850> be<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> foundation

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630

container

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.149 

now<00:01:31.960> let's<00:01:32.259> move<00:01:32.469> on<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.799> making<00:01:32.950> thin<00:01:33.369> icing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
now let's move on to making thin icing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.529 
now let's move on to making thin icing
you<00:01:36.159> could<00:01:36.340> clean<00:01:36.579> your<00:01:36.729> existing<00:01:37.240> creamy

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
you could clean your existing creamy

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.810 
you could clean your existing creamy
frosting<00:01:37.840> by<00:01:38.289> adding<00:01:38.619> fimo<00:01:38.890> liquid<00:01:38.920> until<00:01:39.670> you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
frosting by adding fimo liquid until you

00:01:39.820 --> 00:02:03.050 
frosting by adding fimo liquid until you
get<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.210> consistency<00:01:40.570> typical<00:01:41.500> sugar<00:01:41.920> glazes

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.700 

another<00:02:04.060> option<00:02:04.570> would<00:02:04.750> be<00:02:04.810> mixing<00:02:05.380> fimo

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
another option would be mixing fimo

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.710 
another option would be mixing fimo
liquid<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:06.430> soft<00:02:06.700> pastels<00:02:06.910> or<00:02:07.480> matte

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
liquid with soft pastels or matte

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.109 
liquid with soft pastels or matte
eyeshadows<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:09.130> same<00:02:09.340> techniques<00:02:09.759> can<00:02:10.090> be

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
eyeshadows the same techniques can be

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.780 
eyeshadows the same techniques can be
applied<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.570> make<00:02:11.020> butter<00:02:11.380> jams<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.280> sauces

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
applied to make butter jams and sauces

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.180 
applied to make butter jams and sauces
by<00:02:13.360> adjusting<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.050> quantity<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.590> color<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
by adjusting the quantity of color to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:25.180 
by adjusting the quantity of color to
make<00:02:15.340> them<00:02:15.490> either<00:02:15.640> translucent<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.630> opaque

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.520 

oil<00:02:26.190> paints<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:27.000> good<00:02:27.180> too<00:02:27.420> when<00:02:28.140> mixing

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
oil paints can be good too when mixing

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.470 
oil paints can be good too when mixing
products<00:02:28.860> other<00:02:29.310> than<00:02:29.550> clay<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.120> fimo

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
products other than clay with fimo

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.750 
products other than clay with fimo
liquid<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:31.080> think<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.860> good<00:02:32.010> idea<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.580> make

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
liquid I think it's a good idea to make

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.790 
liquid I think it's a good idea to make
sure<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.120> amount<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.570> fimo<00:02:33.840> liquid<00:02:33.870> exceeds

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
sure the amount of fimo liquid exceeds

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.190 
sure the amount of fimo liquid exceeds
the<00:02:35.070> amount<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.670> second<00:02:36.030> product<00:02:36.300> as<00:02:37.020> you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
the amount of the second product as you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:54.720 
the amount of the second product as you
wouldn't<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.770> alter<00:02:38.310> its<00:02:38.460> chemistry

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.059 

and<00:02:55.150> now<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.930> may<00:02:56.170> have<00:02:56.349> been<00:02:56.530> wondering

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
and now as it may have been wondering

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.710 
and now as it may have been wondering
when<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.550> she<00:02:57.640> going<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:58.030> show<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> acrylic

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
when is she going to show the acrylic

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.979 
when is she going to show the acrylic
paints<00:02:59.230> well<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.980> left<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.909> to<00:03:01.000> last<00:03:01.239> because<00:03:01.629> it

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
paints well I left it to last because it

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.530 
paints well I left it to last because it
is<00:03:02.019> my<00:03:02.260> least<00:03:02.590> favorite<00:03:03.549> out<00:03:03.879> of<00:03:03.940> all<00:03:04.299> these

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
is my least favorite out of all these

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.119 
is my least favorite out of all these
methods<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.260> I'll<00:03:05.530> show<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:05.890> why<00:03:10.799> all<00:03:11.799> good

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
methods and I'll show you why all good

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.339 
methods and I'll show you why all good
so<00:03:12.340> far<00:03:12.640> but<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.180> soon<00:03:13.390> as<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.660> starts<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.110> mix

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
so far but as soon as it starts to mix

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.770 
so far but as soon as it starts to mix
evenly<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.160> becomes<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.670> sort<00:03:15.849> of<00:03:15.970> plasma<00:03:16.330> out

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
evenly it becomes a sort of plasma out

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.809 
evenly it becomes a sort of plasma out
of<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.049> Ghostbuster<00:03:17.739> movies<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.760> don't

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
of the Ghostbuster movies and I don't

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.240 
of the Ghostbuster movies and I don't
know<00:03:19.060> about<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.569> but<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.900> just<00:03:20.349> don't<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.890> it

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
know about you but I just don't like it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.339 
know about you but I just don't like it
I<00:03:21.519> don't<00:03:22.120> know<00:03:22.209> if<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.360> can<00:03:22.540> see<00:03:22.720> how<00:03:22.870> sticky

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
I don't know if you can see how sticky

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:40.130 
I don't know if you can see how sticky
and<00:03:23.860> gooey<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.730> possibly<00:03:25.390> disgusting<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.290> is

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.890
