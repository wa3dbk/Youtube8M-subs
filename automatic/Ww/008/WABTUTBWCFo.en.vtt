seamless motor body design where you

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.650 
seamless motor body design where you
actually<00:00:10.080> just<00:00:10.320> have<00:00:10.769> clean<00:00:11.670> just<00:00:12.389> three

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
actually just have clean just three

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.110 
actually just have clean just three
buttons<00:00:13.049> over<00:00:13.259> here<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.950> one<00:00:14.519> button<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
buttons over here and one button for the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.939 
buttons over here and one button for the
face<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.839> device<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.920> now<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.180> is

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
face of the device so now that is

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.160 
face of the device so now that is
something<00:00:19.949> which<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.730> device<00:00:21.170> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
something which is on the device the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.920 
something which is on the device the
design<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.740> actually<00:00:26.420> attention<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> details

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
design is actually attention to details

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.440 
design is actually attention to details
what<00:00:28.140> nokia<00:00:28.529> has<00:00:28.710> given<00:00:33.620> its<00:00:34.620> inside<00:00:35.130> out

what nokia has given its inside out
where<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.809> battery<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> same

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
where you see the battery is the same

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
where you see the battery is the same
color<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.850> device<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.170> two

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
color as the device and here the two

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
color as the device and here the two
slots<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.510> memory<00:00:42.510> card<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> dual

slots of the memory card and the dual

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
slots of the memory card and the dual
sim<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.640> user<00:00:44.820> does<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
sim where the user does not have to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.260 
sim where the user does not have to
actually<00:00:45.629> switch<00:00:46.079> off<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.530> device<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
actually switch off the device to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.639 
actually switch off the device to
connect<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.620> ship<00:00:49.950> broker<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
connect the the other ship broker and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.939 
connect the the other ship broker and
you<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> detailing<00:00:54.930> around<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.559> where

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you see the detailing around this where

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.400 
you see the detailing around this where
people<00:00:56.309> who<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:56.969> no<00:00:57.570> nails<00:00:57.809> also<00:00:58.260> can

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
people who have no nails also can

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.310 
people who have no nails also can
actually<00:00:58.829> bring<00:00:59.699> them<00:00:59.910> out<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> control<00:01:00.690> how's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
actually bring them out of control how's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680 
actually bring them out of control how's
this<00:01:01.590> been<00:01:01.859> achieved<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> CCO

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this been achieved like you have a CCO

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
this been achieved like you have a CCO
economics<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> whole<00:01:04.890> design<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
economics of the whole design and the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.450 
economics of the whole design and the
attention<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.420> detail<00:01:06.590> which<00:01:07.590> goes<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
attention to detail which goes all the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.700 
attention to detail which goes all the
way<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> high<00:01:09.240> end<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.720> also<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
way to the high end and also in this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.399 
way to the high end and also in this
segment<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.549> even<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> Lumias<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
segment it was even with the Lumias you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
segment it was even with the Lumias you
need<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.460> nails<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> bring

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
need to actually use your nails to bring

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.670 
need to actually use your nails to bring
it<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.689> that's<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> east

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it out so that's the that's the east

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.090 
it out so that's the that's the east

what makes the whole device so unique
proper<00:03:21.620> well<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.190> actually<00:03:22.459> optimizing

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
proper well it is actually optimizing

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.140 
proper well it is actually optimizing
