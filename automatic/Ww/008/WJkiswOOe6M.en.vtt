00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and our companion a moment ago 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.790
 Alberto Friar told us that he had 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.859
 stayed with a very interesting person 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.599
 because I had double vision of what 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.370
 is running a confinement on foot and on horseback and 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 you have managed to get it to your point 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.190
 Alberto has cost his but he arrives 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.890
 until sets is so good garcía that 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.119
 who has been running for more than 20 years 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.470
 Sanfermines but also runs a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.880
 very special very special party in 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.439
 castellón tell us about the differences 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.349
 tell us about that party also 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.199
 runs there yes the party is done in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 segorbe province of castellón and the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.559
 differences then that there is with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.870
 horses there are no barriers is for the helmet 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.879
 urban 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.770
 and protection the barrier is made by the 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.810
 people the rows of people that you put in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.540
 what 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.180
 that prevent the animals between them 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.610
 and the horses, we are not seeing 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.490
 those images right now because there 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.890
 you expect the double work that is 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.760
 as shepherds and halter say 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.340
 that is a little the work that you do 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.970
 you if our work is to group 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.790
 the Bulls 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.950
 as much as possible so they do not leave 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.110
 against people but clear with animals 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.270
 it can happen at any time 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.590
 anything can be the greatest risk 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.330
 that you can run there because in fact 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.670
 I answered with him be here this one 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.190
 well there in the neighborhood the greatest risk 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.320
 it's a horse's whistle because you're going to 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.750
 quite speed and clear then one 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.600
 fall the truth is that then I suffered a 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.430
 that I was watching stars and the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.290
 horse that made the horse continued 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.420
 he raised and continued as if he did not 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.700
 rider was next to the group of the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.770
 herd and when the end came 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.570
 horses that was going to Carlos the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.830
 riders who were ahead because they 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.380
 they reached for the rein and then what 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.170
 they caught then here you see the bulls more 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.180
 close from much below are many 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.240
 years already running besides here yes 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.740
 I'm going more than 20 years running and the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.780
 true that here is different here you 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.120
 you have to worry about the bulls more to 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.000
 level of them is not like there people 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.880
 the falls that is the worst thing that has 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.090
 passed here here as falls knocked 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 strong the antlers very close very close 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.220
 has come to have yes yes yes that yes 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.420
 that they have happened quite close to me 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.950
 you commented before I had 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.869
 happened once in the alley good 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.770
 well the first year since I got like this 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.870
 more seriously to run 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.240
 It turns out that between the plaça 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.340
 arrived a bull is left behind everything 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.640
 in those years there were so many people and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.950
 I go back to the street to see and nothing question 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.620
 that I see the bull there were people 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.030
 in front of which I start shooting for 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.280
 inside for the square and reaching the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.590
 The place I was fired to had it here 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.240
 on the shoulder of the bull but good because 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.640
 to finish how do you stay with that 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.070
 statistics of these torrestrella 11 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.120
 days is an encaste that usually gives 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.040
 quite a problem here on the street and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.980
 to be invited to a wasp like that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.930
 says and of course with nothing 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.230
 good luck today come many thanks to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.230
