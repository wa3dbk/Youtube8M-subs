the<00:03:21.290> fryer<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.670> we<00:03:25.670> don't<00:03:25.849> like<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.239> crowd<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
the fryer and we don't like to crowd the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.879 
the fryer and we don't like to crowd the
fryer<00:03:27.969> because<00:03:28.969> the<00:03:29.480> temperature<00:03:29.959> drops<00:03:30.319> and

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
fryer because the temperature drops and

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.429 
fryer because the temperature drops and
you<00:03:31.849> know<00:03:31.970> they<00:03:32.090> don't<00:03:32.150> crisp<00:03:32.810> up<00:03:33.049> on<00:03:33.260> both

you know they don't crisp up on both
sides<00:03:33.470> evenly<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:35.540> we<00:03:35.750> probably<00:03:35.959> put<00:03:36.260> about

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
sides evenly so we probably put about

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.369
