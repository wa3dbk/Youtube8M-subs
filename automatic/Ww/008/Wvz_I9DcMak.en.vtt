you're not limited to the use of just

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.760 
you're not limited to the use of just
muscles<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.760> could<00:00:17.940> use<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.300> hair<00:00:18.810> wings

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
muscles you could use it for hair wings

grass<00:00:20.699> any<00:00:21.480> kind<00:00:21.870> of<00:00:21.990> object<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.710> would<00:00:22.860> look

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
grass any kind of object that would look

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.190 
grass any kind of object that would look
similar<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.910> those<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.020> mentioned

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
similar to those that I just mentioned

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.560 
similar to those that I just mentioned
now<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> number<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.730> parameters<00:00:27.000> here

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
now you have a number of parameters here

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.790 
now you have a number of parameters here
so<00:00:27.750> let's<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.050> ahead<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.290> take<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.440> look<00:00:28.650> at

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
so let's go ahead and take a look at

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.290 
so let's go ahead and take a look at
them<00:00:28.980> first<00:00:29.460> off<00:00:29.700> there<00:00:29.940> are<00:00:29.970> three<00:00:30.180> different

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
them first off there are three different

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.959 
them first off there are three different
muscle<00:00:30.690> types<00:00:30.900> muscle<00:00:31.410> 1<00:00:31.620> 2<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
muscle types muscle 1 2 and then the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.510 
muscle types muscle 1 2 and then the
tendon<00:00:33.329> let's<00:00:34.050> look<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.620> muscle<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.160> first

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
tendon let's look at muscle one first

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.820 
tendon let's look at muscle one first
we're<00:00:37.240> going<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:37.570> stroke<00:00:37.870> outside<00:00:38.560> of<00:00:38.710> the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
we're going to stroke outside of the

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.060 
we're going to stroke outside of the
object<00:00:39.250> here<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:40.420> I'll<00:00:40.630> create<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.470> number<00:00:41.920> of

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
object here and I'll create a number of

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.770 
object here and I'll create a number of
strokes<00:00:42.430> with<00:00:42.670> different<00:00:42.940> brush<00:00:43.120> sizes<00:00:43.390> and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
strokes with different brush sizes and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.970 
strokes with different brush sizes and
intensities

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
intensities

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
intensities
okay<00:00:47.239> as<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.930> different

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
okay as you can see the different

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.680 
okay as you can see the different
variations<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:50.130> with<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.060> same<00:00:51.300> muscle

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
variations here with the same muscle

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.920 
variations here with the same muscle
this<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.040> small<00:00:53.790> size<00:00:54.120> brush<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.780> low

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this was a small size brush with low

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.470 
this was a small size brush with low
intensity<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.400> larger<00:00:56.910> size<00:00:57.150> brush

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
intensity this was a larger size brush

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
intensity this was a larger size brush
with<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.900> same<00:00:58.110> low<00:00:58.290> intensity<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.040> this<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
with the same low intensity and this is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
with the same low intensity and this is
the<00:00:59.820> same<00:01:00.030> larger<00:01:00.390> brush<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> higher

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the same larger brush with a higher

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
the same larger brush with a higher
intensity<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.210> tell<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> difference<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
intensity you can tell the difference is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.060 
intensity you can tell the difference is
there<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:05.040> looking<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.489> them<00:01:07.070> alright

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
there just by looking at them alright

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.570 
there just by looking at them alright
let's<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.850> ahead<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.860> demonstrate<00:01:10.860> muscle

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
let's go ahead and demonstrate muscle

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.320 
let's go ahead and demonstrate muscle
number<00:01:11.790> two<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:12.330> let's<00:01:13.700> turn<00:01:14.700> down<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:15.000> brush

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
number two now let's turn down the brush

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
number two now let's turn down the brush
size<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> intensity<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:17.700> one's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> little

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
size and intensity this one's a little

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
size and intensity this one's a little
thinner<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> pointer<00:01:19.500> than<00:01:19.740> muscle<00:01:20.100> number

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
thinner and pointer than muscle number

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.460 
thinner and pointer than muscle number
one

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
one

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:31.120 
one
and<00:01:22.910> it<00:01:23.910> has<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> wider<00:01:24.360> base

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.590 

same<00:01:32.130> basic<00:01:32.490> principles<00:01:32.940> with<00:01:33.210> these<00:01:33.360> three

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
same basic principles with these three

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.140 
same basic principles with these three
strokes<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.070> low<00:01:35.430> intensity<00:01:35.909> with

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
strokes here we have low intensity with

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.500 
strokes here we have low intensity with
a<00:01:36.180> small<00:01:36.510> brush

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
a small brush

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.810 
a small brush
we<00:01:38.630> have<00:01:38.810> larger<00:01:39.560> brush<00:01:39.770> with<00:01:40.070> low<00:01:40.400> intensity

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
we have larger brush with low intensity

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.400 
we have larger brush with low intensity
and<00:01:41.150> then<00:01:41.360> larger<00:01:41.660> brush<00:01:41.870> with<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> higher

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
and then larger brush with a higher

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.580 
and then larger brush with a higher
intensity<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:44.420> can<00:01:44.570> see<00:01:44.720> they<00:01:44.840> look<00:01:45.050> somewhat

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
intensity you can see they look somewhat

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.610 
intensity you can see they look somewhat
like<00:01:45.650> feathers<00:01:46.900> now<00:01:47.900> let's<00:01:48.140> take<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.320> look<00:01:48.560> at

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
like feathers now let's take a look at

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.130 
like feathers now let's take a look at
the<00:01:48.710> tendon

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.910 

you<00:01:54.979> can<00:01:55.159> see<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:55.520> one<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:56.680> small<00:01:57.680> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
you can see this one is small and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.510 
you can see this one is small and
stringy

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.209 

and<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:02.049> more<00:02:02.289> let's<00:02:02.679> turn<00:02:02.890> up<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.189> intensity

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
and one more let's turn up the intensity

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.180 
and one more let's turn up the intensity
on<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:04.000> one

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
on this one

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.100 
on this one
you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.910> see<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.480> thicker<00:02:06.750> same

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you can see that's a little thicker same

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
you can see that's a little thicker same
basic<00:02:07.440> principle<00:02:07.830> they<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.520> thicker<00:02:08.820> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
basic principle they get thicker and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 
basic principle they get thicker and
bigger<00:02:09.180> depending<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> size<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.070> your

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
bigger depending on the size of your

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.990 
bigger depending on the size of your
brush<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.820> depth<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.450> brush<00:02:14.000> okay

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
brush and the depth of your brush okay

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.640 
brush and the depth of your brush okay
now<00:02:15.270> let's<00:02:15.480> go<00:02:15.630> ahead<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> hide<00:02:16.140> those<00:02:16.380> I've

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
now let's go ahead and hide those I've

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.090 
now let's go ahead and hide those I've
created<00:02:17.040> those<00:02:17.160> on<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> different<00:02:17.670> layer<00:02:17.910> I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
created those on a different layer I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.440 
created those on a different layer I
want<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.220> demonstrate<00:02:20.370> these<00:02:20.880> stick<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
want to demonstrate these stick the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780 
want to demonstrate these stick the
ground<00:02:21.720> option<00:02:22.170> let's<00:02:23.040> go<00:02:23.160> back<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.460> muscle

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
ground option let's go back to muscle

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.490 
ground option let's go back to muscle
number<00:02:24.030> one

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
number one

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.980 
number one
basically<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:25.710> stick<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> ground<00:02:26.340> does<00:02:26.520> it

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
basically what stick the ground does it

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.050 
basically what stick the ground does it
conforms<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.080> stroke<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.310> surface<00:02:29.820> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
conforms the stroke to the surface of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.370 
conforms the stroke to the surface of
your<00:02:30.690> voxel<00:02:31.170> object<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.550> let's<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.820> ahead<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
your voxel object so let's go ahead and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.620 
your voxel object so let's go ahead and
demonstrate<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:36.000> it's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
demonstrate that here you can see it's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.750 
demonstrate that here you can see it's
not<00:02:36.900> popping<00:02:37.320> outside<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> volume<00:02:38.550> it's

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
not popping outside of the volume it's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940 
not popping outside of the volume it's
sticking<00:02:39.210> right<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> surface<00:02:39.960> now<00:02:40.800> if<00:02:40.890> we

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
sticking right to the surface now if we

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.730 
sticking right to the surface now if we
did<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.220> same<00:02:41.400> stroke<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.970> left<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.290> voxel

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
did the same stroke and left the voxel

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.030 
did the same stroke and left the voxel
surface<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:45.690> will<00:02:45.900> actually<00:02:46.350> detach<00:02:46.650> from<00:02:46.710> the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
surface it will actually detach from the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.450 
surface it will actually detach from the
surface<00:02:47.160> there<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:52.250> let's<00:02:53.250> demonstrate

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
surface there like so let's demonstrate

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.050 
surface there like so let's demonstrate
one<00:02:54.180> other<00:02:54.450> option<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.830> smoothing<00:02:56.340> speed<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
one other option the smoothing speed the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
one other option the smoothing speed the
higher<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.480> intensity<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.290> parameter

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
higher the intensity of this parameter

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.340 
higher the intensity of this parameter
the<00:02:59.940> more<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.240> will<00:03:00.390> smooth<00:03:00.660> out<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.080> let's<00:03:01.230> go

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the more it will smooth out so let's go

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.680 
the more it will smooth out so let's go
ahead<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.560> create<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.980> stroke<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:03.270> stick<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
ahead and create a stroke with stick the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.660 
ahead and create a stroke with stick the
ground<00:03:03.900> turned<00:03:04.140> off<00:03:04.290> outside<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.550> you'll

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
ground turned off outside and you'll

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.950 
ground turned off outside and you'll
notice<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.420> smoothing

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
notice that the smoothing

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.890 
notice that the smoothing
is<00:03:08.020> quite<00:03:08.950> high<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.850> movement<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.570> this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
is quite high that the movement of this

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.430 
is quite high that the movement of this
stroke<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.890> smoothing<00:03:12.670> quite<00:03:13.210> a<00:03:13.240> bit<00:03:13.420> let's<00:03:14.260> do

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
stroke is smoothing quite a bit let's do

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.160 
stroke is smoothing quite a bit let's do
another<00:03:14.560> stroke<00:03:15.070> with<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.310> intensity<00:03:16.170> back

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
another stroke with the intensity back

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.640 
another stroke with the intensity back
at<00:03:17.530> zero<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:19.390> will<00:03:19.450> move<00:03:19.750> much<00:03:20.050> less<00:03:20.410> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
at zero and it will move much less and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.720 
at zero and it will move much less and
smooth<00:03:20.920> much<00:03:21.190> less

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.300 

and<00:03:27.020> there<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.170> have<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.379> that's<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.220> new

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
and there you have it that's the new

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.309 
and there you have it that's the new
muscle<00:03:29.640> tool<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:30.060> highly<00:03:30.840> recommend<00:03:31.230> checking

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
muscle tool I highly recommend checking

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.930 
muscle tool I highly recommend checking
it<00:03:31.709> out<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:31.980> trying<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.640> different

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
it out and trying the different

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.630 
it out and trying the different
parameters

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.700
