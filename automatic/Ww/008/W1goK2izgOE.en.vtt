00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
now in a garden center the same guard

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.960 
now in a garden center the same guard
garden<00:02:40.810> center<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.410> just<00:02:41.980> found<00:02:42.160> some<00:02:42.580> wire

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
garden center I just found some wire

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.050 
garden center I just found some wire
that's<00:02:43.630> really<00:02:44.380> rigid<00:02:44.820> destined<00:02:45.820> for

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
that's really rigid destined for

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.480 
that's really rigid destined for
gardening<00:02:46.630> businesses<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.920> think<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.310> is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
gardening businesses and I think this is

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.120 
gardening businesses and I think this is
easy<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.150> obtain<00:02:49.300> what<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.320> want<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.860> wire

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
easy to obtain what you want is a wire

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.900 
easy to obtain what you want is a wire
that<00:02:51.160> will<00:02:51.580> not<00:02:51.850> start<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.740> oxidizers<00:02:53.740> or<00:02:54.400> rust

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
that will not start to oxidizers or rust

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.330 
that will not start to oxidizers or rust
actually<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:56.050> don't<00:02:56.230> want<00:02:56.470> metal<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.130> will

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
actually you don't want metal that will

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.460 
actually you don't want metal that will
rust<00:02:57.730> because<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.360> almost<00:02:58.540> probably<00:02:59.020> spray

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
rust because you almost probably spray

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.560 
rust because you almost probably spray
the<00:02:59.650> circuit<00:02:59.980> every<00:03:00.310> day<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:01.090> no<00:03:01.300> time

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
the circuit every day and in no time

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.050 
the circuit every day and in no time
you'll<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:02.110> some<00:03:02.320> rust<00:03:02.590> going<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.100> okay<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you'll have some rust going on okay the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.090 
you'll have some rust going on okay the
next<00:03:04.300> thing<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.170> actual<00:03:05.470> tie<00:03:05.770> you're

plants<00:03:16.030> but<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.240> can<00:03:16.390> find<00:03:16.660> raffia<00:03:17.140> at

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
plants but you can find raffia at

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.729 
plants but you can find raffia at
grocery<00:03:17.830> shop<00:03:18.190> as<00:03:18.400> well<00:03:18.640> shops<00:03:19.180> sorry<00:03:19.739> there

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
are those bowls of raffia I think you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.310 
are those bowls of raffia I think you
can<00:03:24.040> find<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.760> easily<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.300> just<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.170> look

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
can find it easily you just have to look

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.350 
can find it easily you just have to look
for<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.860> didn't<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.519> existed<00:03:28.090> until

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
for it I didn't know this existed until

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.690 
for it I didn't know this existed until
recently<00:03:28.600> when<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.560> actually<00:03:29.739> searched<00:03:30.160> for<00:03:30.550> it

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
recently when I actually searched for it

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.880 
recently when I actually searched for it
now<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.180> use<00:03:31.420> raffia<00:03:31.870> because<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.290> time<00:03:32.530> it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
now I use raffia because in time it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.000 
now I use raffia because in time it
degrades<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.570> think<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.410> will<00:03:35.530> hold<00:03:35.739> my

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
degrades and I think it will hold my

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.699 
degrades and I think it will hold my
orchid<00:03:36.459> enough<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:37.300> get<00:03:38.290> some<00:03:38.470> roots

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
orchid enough to get some roots

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.470 
orchid enough to get some roots
established<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.519> actually<00:03:39.820> for<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.030> orchid

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
established and actually for the orchid

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.620 
established and actually for the orchid
to<00:03:40.660> hold<00:03:41.260> on<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.739> cork<00:03:42.040> by<00:03:42.670> itself<00:03:43.120> but

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
to hold on to the cork by itself but

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.910 
to hold on to the cork by itself but
other<00:03:44.140> people<00:03:44.680> use<00:03:44.950> fish<00:03:45.400> wire<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:47.530> not<00:03:47.709> sure

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
other people use fish wire I'm not sure

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.350 
other people use fish wire I'm not sure
how<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.160> call<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.580> think<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:48.910> fish<00:03:49.120> wire

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
how to call it I think it's fish wire

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.330 
how to call it I think it's fish wire
but<00:03:49.840> what<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.050> don't<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:50.560> about<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:50.890> it's

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
but what I don't like about that it's

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.720 
but what I don't like about that it's
that<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.790> just<00:03:52.060> very<00:03:52.120> very<00:03:52.540> thin<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.730> I'm

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
that it's just very very thin and I'm

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.060 
that it's just very very thin and I'm
afraid<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.540> wrap<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.019> too<00:03:56.200> tight<00:03:56.500> because<00:03:56.800> it

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
afraid to wrap it too tight because it

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.490 
afraid to wrap it too tight because it
might<00:03:57.250> actually<00:03:57.430> get<00:03:57.850> into<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.360> roots<00:03:58.690> anyway

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
might actually get into the roots anyway

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.770 
might actually get into the roots anyway
I<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.980> wanted<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.000> go<00:04:01.150> for<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.390> raffia

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
I just wanted to go for the raffia

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.020 
I just wanted to go for the raffia
because<00:04:02.140> as<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.620> see<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:03.280> has<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:03.610> wide

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
because as you can see it has a wide

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.750 
because as you can see it has a wide
threat<00:04:04.570> thread<00:04:05.350> now<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:06.220> will<00:04:06.400> make<00:04:06.610> my

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
threat thread now this will make my

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.670 
threat thread now this will make my
orchid<00:04:07.150> more<00:04:07.330> stable<00:04:07.780> or<00:04:07.959> at<00:04:08.019> least<00:04:08.260> this<00:04:08.500> is

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
orchid more stable or at least this is

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.830 
orchid more stable or at least this is
what<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:08.890> think<00:04:09.010> it's<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.580> personal<00:04:10.000> option<00:04:10.420> you

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
what I think it's a personal option you

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.130 
what I think it's a personal option you
can<00:04:11.049> use<00:04:11.230> something<00:04:12.130> else<00:04:12.580> I<00:04:13.330> would<00:04:13.930> not

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
can use something else I would not

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.570 
can use something else I would not
really<00:04:14.830> go<00:04:15.040> for<00:04:15.370> very<00:04:15.850> thin<00:04:16.390> wires<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.769> also

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
really go for very thin wires and also

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.589 
really go for very thin wires and also
never<00:04:18.790> go<00:04:19.060> for<00:04:19.359> metal<00:04:19.989> wires<00:04:20.229> that<00:04:20.620> will

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
never go for metal wires that will

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.860 
never go for metal wires that will
and<00:04:21.690> yeah<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.860> think<00:04:23.069> a<00:04:23.580> sort<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.240> plastic

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
and yeah I think a sort of a plastic

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.080 
and yeah I think a sort of a plastic
that<00:04:25.110> will<00:04:25.289> not<00:04:25.500> decompose<00:04:26.099> or<00:04:26.370> raffia<00:04:26.879> will

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
that will not decompose or raffia will

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.150 
that will not decompose or raffia will
work<00:04:27.300> good<00:04:27.720> but<00:04:27.930> again<00:04:28.349> it's<00:04:28.800> just<00:04:28.889> your

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
work good but again it's just your

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.820 
work good but again it's just your
preference<00:04:29.840> now<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.900> don't<00:04:31.199> have<00:04:31.349> to<00:04:31.409> use

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
preference now you don't have to use

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.249 
preference now you don't have to use
this<00:04:32.069> but<00:04:32.129> I<00:04:32.370> like<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:32.909> use<00:04:33.120> some<00:04:33.690> sphagnum

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
this but I like to use some sphagnum

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.260 
this but I like to use some sphagnum
Moss<00:04:34.680> because<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.580> don't<00:04:35.789> have<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.000> high

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
Moss because I don't have a high

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.719 
Moss because I don't have a high
humidity<00:04:36.479> in<00:04:36.900> my<00:04:37.050> balcony<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.860> also<00:04:38.340> summer

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
humidity in my balcony and also summer

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.719 
humidity in my balcony and also summer
for<00:04:39.240> me<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.509> very<00:04:39.599> very<00:04:40.050> hot<00:04:40.349> and<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:41.520> sphagnum

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
for me is very very hot and the sphagnum

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.600 
for me is very very hot and the sphagnum
Moss<00:04:42.150> will<00:04:42.419> just<00:04:42.690> provide<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.169> little<00:04:43.710> extra

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
Moss will just provide that little extra

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.450 
Moss will just provide that little extra
humidity<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.449> I<00:04:45.509> need<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:47.069> will<00:04:47.190> keep

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
humidity that I need and that will keep

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.080 
humidity that I need and that will keep
my<00:04:47.610> plant

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
my plant

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.450 
my plant
more<00:04:48.419> hydrated<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:49.259> it's<00:04:49.409> not<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.620> must<00:04:50.009> if

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
more hydrated but it's not a must if

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.670 
more hydrated but it's not a must if
your<00:04:50.699> conditions<00:04:51.210> are<00:04:51.479> better<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.440> cooler

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
your conditions are better and cooler

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.950 
your conditions are better and cooler
than<00:04:53.039> mine<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.490> may<00:04:53.639> be<00:04:53.699> more<00:04:53.970> humid<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.750> can

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
than mine and may be more humid you can

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.830 
than mine and may be more humid you can
just<00:04:55.340> mount<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.610> orchid<00:04:57.000> without<00:04:57.270> any<00:04:57.479> sorts

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
just mount the orchid without any sorts

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.080 
just mount the orchid without any sorts
of<00:04:57.900> moss<00:04:58.259> or<00:04:58.530> media<00:04:58.919> attached<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.669> so<00:04:59.849> yeah

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
of moss or media attached to it so yeah

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.820 
of moss or media attached to it so yeah
you<00:05:00.150> don't<00:05:00.389> have<00:05:00.509> to<00:05:00.599> use<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.110> but<00:05:01.259> if<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.620> want

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
you don't have to use it but if you want

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.290 
you don't have to use it but if you want
to<00:05:01.919> use<00:05:02.069> it<00:05:02.190> if<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.400> feel<00:05:02.580> your<00:05:02.819> environment

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
to use it if you feel your environment

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.210 
to use it if you feel your environment
is<00:05:03.419> very<00:05:03.479> warm<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.139> very<00:05:04.259> dry<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.800> think<00:05:05.099> you
