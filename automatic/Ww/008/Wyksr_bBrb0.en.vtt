00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
check out vector gaming Network we are

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.870 
check out vector gaming Network we are
basically<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.090> same<00:01:16.450> thing<00:01:16.510> as<00:01:16.750> rgx<00:01:17.350> it's

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
basically the same thing as rgx it's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.789 
basically the same thing as rgx it's
it's<00:01:18.880> me<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.420> they<00:01:19.900> call<00:01:20.140> me<00:01:20.260> Rob<00:01:20.440> it<00:01:20.590> again

it's me and they call me Rob it again
and<00:01:21.040> basically<00:01:21.640> we're<00:01:22.600> switching<00:01:23.350> views<00:01:23.799> from

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
and basically we're switching views from

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.810 
and basically we're switching views from
RG<00:01:24.700> x<00:01:24.850> 2<00:01:25.180> vector<00:01:26.049> gaming<00:01:26.500> network<00:01:26.860> it's<00:01:27.670> always

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
RG x 2 vector gaming network it's always

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.969 
RG x 2 vector gaming network it's always
going<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.060> be<00:01:28.150> exactly<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.990> same<00:01:29.020> we're<00:01:29.890> going

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
going to be exactly the same we're going

going to be exactly the same we're going
to<00:01:30.070> have<00:01:30.220> vector<00:01:31.210> gaming<00:01:31.570> Network<00:01:31.840> which<00:01:31.990> is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
to have vector gaming Network which is

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.200 
to have vector gaming Network which is
going<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.290> be<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.619> central<00:01:32.950> channel<00:01:33.040> if<00:01:34.000> you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
going to be the central channel if you

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.250 
going to be the central channel if you
want<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.420> go<00:01:34.479> check<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.810> I'll<00:01:34.960> leave<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.170> link

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.790 
vtg Fame which is going to be like
another<00:01:56.050> rgx<00:01:56.980> Idol<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:59.410> reason<00:01:59.560> we're

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
another rgx Idol so the reason we're

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.860 
another rgx Idol so the reason we're
doing<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.010> is<00:02:00.190> because<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.510> had<00:02:01.690> some

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
doing this is because we we had some

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.520 
doing this is because we we had some
issues<00:02:02.410> with<00:02:02.440> our<00:02:03.340> GX<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.300> we<00:02:05.110> had<00:02:05.260> to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
issues with our GX and we had to

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.730 
issues with our GX and we had to
basically<00:02:06.280> start<00:02:06.880> over<00:02:07.300> with<00:02:07.540> new<00:02:08.110> look<00:02:08.380> new

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
basically start over with new look new

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.469 
basically start over with new look new
everything<00:02:09.280> get<00:02:09.790> out<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:09.970> where<00:02:10.180> we<00:02:10.360> were

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479

where<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.570> are<00:02:13.600> today<00:02:13.960> vector<00:02:14.950> gaming<00:02:15.310> Network

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
where we are today vector gaming Network

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.070 
where we are today vector gaming Network
I<00:02:15.970> hope<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.110> guys<00:02:17.550> come<00:02:18.550> check<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.240> leave
