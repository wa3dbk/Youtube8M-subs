Cardiff<00:00:39.450> three<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.750> making<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:41.090> circuit<00:00:42.090> but

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
Cardiff three are making a circuit but

Cardiff three are making a circuit but
has<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> tunable<00:00:44.579> buzzer<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.110> change

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
has a tunable buzzer so we can change

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.160 
has a tunable buzzer so we can change
the<00:00:46.559> frequency<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> change<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the frequency on to change and it's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.709 
the frequency on to change and it's
supposed<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> mimic<00:00:50.129> allowing<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
supposed to mimic allowing this so the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
supposed to mimic allowing this so the

fundamental thing pretty much everything

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.539 
fundamental thing pretty much everything
nowadays<00:01:09.260> going<00:01:10.260> from<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.950> sending<00:01:11.400> off

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
nowadays going from well sending off

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.510 
nowadays going from well sending off
into<00:01:11.790> space<00:01:11.909> cause<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:13.680> mobile<00:01:14.010> phone<00:01:14.040> you

can't go anywhere without touching some

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.410 
can't go anywhere without touching some
kind<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.259> engineering<00:01:16.710> allows<00:01:17.340> industry<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
kind of engineering allows industry to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300 
kind of engineering allows industry to
actually<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:18.869> into<00:01:19.020> contact<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.799> encourage

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
actually get into contact and encourage

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
actually get into contact and encourage
young<00:01:20.549> people<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> electronics<00:01:21.990> sector

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
young people into the electronics sector

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.219

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
industry which is obviously great

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.570 
industry which is obviously great
because

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
because

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.860 
because
you<00:01:40.850> don't<00:01:41.030> really<00:01:41.120> get<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.390> chance<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.750> do

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
you don't really get the chance to do

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.960 
you don't really get the chance to do
that<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.230> plan<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.010> when<00:01:43.520> they've<00:01:43.730> built

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
that the plan is that when they've built

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.000 
that the plan is that when they've built
the<00:01:44.060> boards<00:01:44.420> we<00:01:44.870> can<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:45.170> get<00:01:45.350> 40<00:01:45.800> of<00:01:45.920> them

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
the boards we can then get 40 of them

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.580 
the boards we can then get 40 of them
together<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.610> create<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.510> sort<00:01:47.870> of<00:01:48.020> ethereal
