 Feelings are also, but something like that 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.190
 I think that it is a strange part 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.069

 There is a wheel spin and you hit me, but I 've hit a san-in , but in the fight I had 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:55.590
 I immediately pulled the sixth Ogawa and rose to my brother

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.890
 But 5 lap Takahashi does not come back to the straight 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.760
