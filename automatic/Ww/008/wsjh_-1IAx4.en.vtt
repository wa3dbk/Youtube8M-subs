see<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.410> result<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.750> Newton's<00:00:03.750> first

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
see the result of this Newton's first

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.579 
see the result of this Newton's first
Newton<00:00:04.500> second<00:00:04.799> law<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:05.310> if<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:06.569> we<00:00:07.020> have<00:00:07.290> F

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
Newton second law is if this we have F

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.570 
Newton second law is if this we have F
goes<00:00:07.799> M<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:10.230> actually<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.889> minus<00:00:11.340> u

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
goes M a and a is actually we minus u

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.730 
goes M a and a is actually we minus u
over<00:00:11.849> T<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.549> case<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> MV<00:00:15.750> minus<00:00:16.170> mu

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
over T so we have a case of MV minus mu

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.140 
over T so we have a case of MV minus mu
over<00:00:17.000> T<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.359> most<00:00:18.480> important<00:00:18.960> thing<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.350> this

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
over T the most important thing in this

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.109 
over T the most important thing in this
equation<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:22.080> T<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:24.119> short<00:00:24.779> time

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
equation is this if T is very short time

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
equation is this if T is very short time
it<00:00:27.119> happens<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.019> very<00:00:28.199> short<00:00:28.470> time<00:00:28.740> for

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
it happens in a very short time for

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.970 
it happens in a very short time for

okay<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.640> ball<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.300> hitting<00:00:34.399> here<00:00:35.399> at

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
okay the ball is hitting here at

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
okay the ball is hitting here at
extremely<00:00:36.960> short<00:00:37.380> times<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.250> use<00:00:38.280> your

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
extremely short times you can use your

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.990 
extremely short times you can use your
one<00:00:38.969> second<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.260> impact<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.219> high

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
one second the impact is really high

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.520 
one second the impact is really high
when<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.690> goes<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.489> this<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.700> goes<00:00:44.879> up

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
when this one goes down this one goes up

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.729 
when this one goes down this one goes up
how<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> hockey<00:00:47.460> player<00:00:48.110> okay<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
how about the hockey player okay the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.850 
how about the hockey player okay the
hockey<00:00:49.980> player<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.789> wear<00:00:51.120> some<00:00:51.510> protective

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
hockey player they wear some protective

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.850 
hockey player they wear some protective
cover<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.789> me<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.809> say<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.199> near<00:00:55.530> me

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
cover or get me they say this is near me

okay<00:00:56.780> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.870> me<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> outside<00:01:00.809> they<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
okay this is me so outside they have a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.580 
okay this is me so outside they have a
very<00:01:01.890> huge<00:01:02.399> protective<00:01:04.610> pants<00:01:05.610> okay<00:01:06.439> made<00:01:07.439> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
very huge protective pants okay made of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.219 
very huge protective pants okay made of
hot<00:01:07.830> material<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.299> hot<00:01:09.540> material<00:01:09.720> if

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
hot material and this hot material if

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.520 
hot material and this hot material if
the<00:01:10.409> ball<00:01:10.710> starts<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.820> hit<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.290> takes

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the ball starts to hit on it it takes

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.550 
the ball starts to hit on it it takes
longer<00:01:14.100> time<00:01:14.750> let's<00:01:15.750> say<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> ball<00:01:16.259> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
longer time let's say the ball is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.249 
longer time let's say the ball is
hitting<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.490> takes<00:01:17.729> longer<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> hit<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
hitting it takes longer time to hit the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.370 
hitting it takes longer time to hit the
knee<00:01:19.490> okay<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.850> cushion<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:22.200> some

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
knee okay this is a cushion it's some

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.679 
knee okay this is a cushion it's some
kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> hot<00:01:22.979> cushion<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> ball

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
kind of hot cushion but if the ball

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.440 
kind of hot cushion but if the ball
coming<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.259> fast<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.070> actually

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
coming really fast it can actually

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
coming really fast it can actually
compress<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.780> cushion<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:29.310> when<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
compress the cushion but when you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.069 
compress the cushion but when you
compress<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> cushion<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.840> take<00:01:31.140> long<00:01:31.759> time

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
compress the cushion you take long time

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.380 
compress the cushion you take long time
really<00:01:34.079> longer<00:01:34.680> times<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.700> forces<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
really longer times the forces of the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.390 
really longer times the forces of the
impact<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.810> less<00:01:37.700> okay<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.479> also<00:01:39.689> imagine

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
impact is less okay you can also imagine

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.030 
impact is less okay you can also imagine
when<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.329> cars<00:01:44.090> when<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.270> make<00:01:45.479> house

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
when they make cars when they make house

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.190 
when they make cars when they make house
let's<00:01:47.040> say<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.850> car<00:01:48.090> okay<00:01:48.540> my<00:01:48.720> drawing

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
let's say this is a car okay my drawing

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.240 
let's say this is a car okay my drawing
is<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.460> really<00:01:50.460> good<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.500> make<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> car

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
is not really good if they make a car

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
is not really good if they make a car
let's<00:01:54.060> say<00:01:54.380> here<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.520> walk<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.689> hits<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
let's say here is a walk it hits the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.960 
let's say here is a walk it hits the
wall<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:59.299> it<00:02:00.299> takes

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.679 

very<00:02:04.320> short<00:02:05.320> time<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:07.000> example<00:02:07.360> if<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:07.630> is

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
very short time for example if this is

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.780 
very short time for example if this is
made<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.080> hot<00:02:08.440> material<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.800> color<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.430> hit

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
made of hot material the color just hit

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.199 
made of hot material the color just hit
and<00:02:13.060> bounced<00:02:13.390> back<00:02:13.690> really<00:02:13.870> fast<00:02:15.000> okay<00:02:16.000> and

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
and bounced back really fast okay and

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.410 
and bounced back really fast okay and
inspectors<00:02:17.080> what<00:02:18.069> if<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.489> one<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.030> made

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
inspectors what if this one is not made

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.570 
inspectors what if this one is not made
of<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.630> material<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.220> made<00:02:21.400> of

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
of a material and this is made of

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.460 
of a material and this is made of
slightly<00:02:22.680> softer<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.010> here<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.350> are

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
slightly softer but here if you are

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.890 
slightly softer but here if you are
slightly<00:02:26.770> softer<00:02:27.519> material

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
slightly softer material

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.660 
slightly softer material
it<00:02:29.230> actually<00:02:29.500> takes<00:02:29.830> time<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:30.310> cukoo<00:02:30.640> cukoo

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
it actually takes time so cukoo cukoo

cukoo cukoo student to actually damage
it<00:02:34.120> slowly<00:02:34.590> takes<00:02:35.590> longer<00:02:36.190> time<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.519> damage<00:02:37.090> it

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it slowly takes longer time to damage it

it slowly takes longer time to damage it
you<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:37.810> imagine<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.650> sound<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.400> damage

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
you can imagine the sound of the damage

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.570 
you can imagine the sound of the damage

of<00:02:48.040> time<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.940> based<00:02:49.269> on<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.630> F<00:02:49.950> because<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.190> MV

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
of time so based on this F because of MV

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.289 
of time so based on this F because of MV
minus<00:02:52.239> mu<00:02:52.720> over<00:02:52.989> T<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.519> take<00:02:54.549> longer<00:02:54.910> time

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
minus mu over T if you take longer time

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.890 
minus mu over T if you take longer time
the<00:02:55.600> focus<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.110> interest<00:02:56.440> less<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:58.269> most<00:02:58.720> of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the focus of interest less so most of

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.289 
the focus of interest less so most of
the<00:02:58.989> cars<00:02:59.290> they've<00:02:59.650> been<00:02:59.830> used<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.940> front
