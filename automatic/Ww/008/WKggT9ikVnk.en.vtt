now to continue soloing in this style

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.570 
now to continue soloing in this style
there's<00:00:09.470> a<00:00:09.559> few<00:00:09.770> different<00:00:09.830> things<00:00:10.010> to<00:00:10.370> think

there's a few different things to think
about<00:00:11.110> one<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.290> you<00:00:12.320> could<00:00:12.530> certainly<00:00:13.120> play

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
about one is you could certainly play

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.650 
about one is you could certainly play
just<00:00:14.570> in<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.809> open<00:00:15.110> position<00:00:15.250> just<00:00:16.250> using<00:00:16.660> the

just in the open position just using the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.609 
just in the open position just using the
a<00:00:17.690> minor<00:00:17.990> pentatonic<00:00:18.350> scale<00:00:22.810> or<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:24.410> blues

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
scale if you want to think of it that

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.120 
scale if you want to think of it that
way<00:00:25.849> with<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.210> flat<00:00:26.449> five<00:00:26.689> thrown<00:00:27.019> in<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:31.070> you

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
way with the flat five thrown in and you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.950 
way with the flat five thrown in and you
can<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:31.429> that<00:00:31.460> way<00:00:31.820> throughout<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.750> whole

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
can so that way throughout a whole

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.650 
can so that way throughout a whole
chorus<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:34.340> next<00:00:34.610> step<00:00:34.760> would<00:00:34.880> be<00:00:34.940> to<00:00:35.300> do<00:00:35.480> some

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
chorus the next step would be to do some

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.479 
chorus the next step would be to do some
callin<00:00:35.960> response<00:00:36.320> combining<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.250> closed

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
callin response combining the closed

callin response combining the closed
position<00:00:40.239> with<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.570> open<00:00:42.020> position<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:46.120> then

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
position with the open position and then

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.979 
position with the open position and then
after<00:00:47.420> that<00:00:47.660> there's<00:00:49.870> spelling<00:00:50.870> out<00:00:50.960> the

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
after that there's spelling out the

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.170 
after that there's spelling out the
courts<00:00:51.379> like<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:52.399> talked<00:00:52.579> about<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.820> bit<00:00:53.030> during

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
courts like we talked about a bit during

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.099 
courts like we talked about a bit during
the<00:00:53.329> main<00:00:53.510> solo<00:00:55.480> things<00:00:56.480> like<00:00:56.660> just<00:00:56.840> grabbing

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
the main solo things like just grabbing

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.680 
the main solo things like just grabbing
the<00:00:57.199> major<00:00:57.410> third<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.859> each<00:00:57.980> chord<00:00:58.690> there's

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
the major third of each chord there's

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.149 
the major third of each chord there's
the<00:00:59.840> C<00:01:00.050> sharp

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.100 

the<00:01:06.549> Rudy

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.830 

there's<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.890> third<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.280> root<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.640> G<00:01:11.060> about

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
there's the third in the root of G about

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.080 
there's the third in the root of G about
sorry<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.260> E<00:01:12.620> which<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.490> G<00:01:13.670> sharp<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:14.120> E<00:01:16.090> and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
sorry of E which is G sharp and E and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.570 
sorry of E which is G sharp and E and
then<00:01:17.840> some<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.320> those<00:01:18.530> hybrid<00:01:19.190> grip<00:01:19.310> things

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
then some of those hybrid grip things

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.580 
then some of those hybrid grip things
could<00:01:20.450> also<00:01:20.630> help<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.230> fill<00:01:21.680> things<00:01:21.920> up<00:01:26.590> for

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
could also help to fill things up for

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.050 
could also help to fill things up for
that<00:01:27.740> I'm<00:01:27.920> grabbing<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.400> root<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.510> then

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
that I'm grabbing the root of a and then

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.690 
that I'm grabbing the root of a and then
hammer-on<00:01:32.060> pull-off<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.870> D<00:01:33.020> string<00:01:38.620> and

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
hammer-on pull-off on the D string and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.310 
hammer-on pull-off on the D string and
then<00:01:40.700> there<00:01:40.940> are<00:01:40.970> also<00:01:41.119> things<00:01:41.450> say<00:01:42.050> on<00:01:42.290> that

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
then there are also things say on that

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.570 
then there are also things say on that
ecord<00:01:45.850> there's<00:01:46.850> another<00:01:47.000> hybrid<00:01:47.300> grip<00:01:48.580> the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
ecord there's another hybrid grip the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.490 
ecord there's another hybrid grip the
root<00:01:49.790> fifth<00:01:50.390> from<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.570> seventh<00:01:53.410> hammering<00:01:54.410> on

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
root fifth from the seventh hammering on

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.780 
root fifth from the seventh hammering on
pulling<00:01:54.860> off<00:01:55.960> two<00:01:56.960> notes<00:01:57.170> at<00:01:57.350> once<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:58.640> can

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
pulling off two notes at once you can

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.270 
pulling off two notes at once you can
also<00:01:58.940> do<00:01:59.180> things<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.619> there's<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.800> d7<00:02:01.250> chord

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
also do things like there's the d7 chord

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.680 
also do things like there's the d7 chord
that<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.149> did<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.330> lick<00:02:02.720> on<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:05.509> can

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
that we did this lick on that can

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.419 
that we did this lick on that can
transpose<00:02:06.170> up<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.590> e<00:02:08.860> gotta<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:10.009> your<00:02:10.070> index

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
fret on the B string that matter that we

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:25.630 
fret on the B string that matter that we
can<00:02:16.970> also<00:02:17.090> transpose<00:02:17.630> all<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.930> way<00:02:18.019> up<00:02:19.180> today

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.870 

so<00:02:26.600> now<00:02:27.230> I'll<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> solo<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.069> combines<00:02:28.430> a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
so now I'll do a solo that combines a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.780 
so now I'll do a solo that combines a
bunch<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.990> those<00:02:30.110> things<00:02:30.410> starting<00:02:30.980> off<00:02:31.130> just

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
bunch of those things starting off just

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.240 
bunch of those things starting off just
in<00:02:31.970> open<00:02:32.270> position<00:02:32.500> with<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> blue<00:02:33.920> scale

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
in open position with a blue scale

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.670 
in open position with a blue scale
moving<00:02:35.240> into<00:02:35.420> some<00:02:35.540> Colin<00:02:35.810> response<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.500> then

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
moving into some Colin response and then

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.090 
moving into some Colin response and then
getting<00:02:36.920> into<00:02:37.040> playing<00:02:37.370> through<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.730> changes
