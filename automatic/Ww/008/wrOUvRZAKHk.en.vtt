00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.490
 mix of two wise games trouble 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.490
 if we o'brien here and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.110
 that's why the first to that now 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.809
 something else is even more important to that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.360
 jappy with it but still can 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.040
 on this lobby where you then enter 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.239
 Game can choose that these trees 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.739
 Games still completely different 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.289
 so yeah so much to her first what 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.910
 especially also wanted is actually I 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.559
 have my background that is from knock 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.719
 Out doctor of things banner linked 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.829
 Many thanks for that to you and me 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.570
 I think in any case is super cool 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.520
 20 become perhaps some of you 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 need so because in another 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.339
 Part no longer in minecraft stop in the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.760
 officially he is up to date or call 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.409
 of duty so in the ego-shooter style and 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.439
 explain a little bit now 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:22.170
 why damn I entered case 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.549
 I'll be right up. I need you 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.549
 in short a name 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.340
 valve 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 So that's exactly why I mean mine now 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.740
 background let have first 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.770
 I really do not want to anymore 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.600
 specializing in minecraft is the name 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.860
 maybe my here but that was me 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.720
 the name was under the name 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.580
 youtube wanted to be known or 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.580
 try to make me known 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:03.220
 live in more lascivious than beside the 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:11.560
 Sporty chic and that's why I have 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:13.390
 first so calm and such a 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.170
 make backup because I am in the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.290
 In future time different games on each 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.519
 I would not like to 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.319
 just make minecraft 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.269
 microns will come but I want me 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.959
 just make microsoft i want others 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.630
 make games 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.010
 I do not exactly know which ones 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.500
 but a bit the direction 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.090
 me and definitely something 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.530
 Come on now maybe I have 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.079
 maybe also call of duty in planning 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.700
 black ops 2 and mw2 because I do not 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.470
 the brother in it am have for this 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.000
 maybe a suggestion if you mega 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.720
 construction time then please write in the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.250
 Comments 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.709
 maybe there can be one or the other 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.140
 to earn a good gameplay 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:56.440
 and he did not make a run kÃ¤lin one 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 heavy so that first time oh yes with me 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.950
 the probability rises to everyone 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.109
 if there is a good gameplay to me 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.739
 what do I then comment on 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.650
 or so who else is good let's play so 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.459
 live commentary so as a play i know 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.739
 Not exactly if I do that 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.190
 should 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.190
 but well 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.160
 it may be but i am not that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.160
 upper pro for that 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.069
 ok it probably very smart trader 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.639
 if you have a spokesman colleague 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.639
 connect 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.580
 short was a bit clearer though 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.360
 I am always so distracted if yours 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.310
 Never talk differently to post rica 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.940
 others we are in the plan for one 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.040
 six in front 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.050
 but I have that and I play it 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.660
 but I thought so for neuro system can 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.890
 you buy it yourself so that's it 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.990
 game is in planning when i look for 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.820
 otherwise I should still recover 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.380
 of spades maybe as an offer like that 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.570
 that's a mix of around 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.030
 kropf and cod or not really too 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.370
 team fortress or so the photos can 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.970
 By the way, also do with mine 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.160
 download 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.140
 but i could do other games 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.390
 Even gary smith has and you right 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.950
 but I played once 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.430
 open is not small comdirect 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.500
 closed 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.630
 otherwise I may let's play me 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.500
 could several things explained mw2 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.610
 black ops 2 and otherwise you play 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.270
 would like to see on the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.760
 Write comments 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.600
 they are planning to cost around the 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.370
 50 Euros 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.320
 and I do not have that much money right now 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.270
 on steam and I also have no paypal 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.120
 and to drive the gas station is not 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.919
 so nice otherwise you have an expensive one 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:05:02.550
 play stage in green party all traders 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:05:02.550
 no detective know-how shit 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:12.160
 So much for the game in planning 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.389
 that is why this background is and good 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.030
 gameplay because we play just ever 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.710
 Beautiful is best very bold positive 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.990
 That would be best 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:27.789
 and it can never be more beautiful 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.850
 Neat take in the park is tear 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.350
 get a bit of praise 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.669
 Hundestaffel So no idea what good 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.630
 Of course, here is a description 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.699

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.289

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.169
 And I can not do more than that 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.729
 I actually say to the topic 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.199
 only not if the questions come 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.820
 why I have such a Beck and now if 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.800
 I do not do something at all it's just in 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.550
 planning a bit I want to change something 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.710
 on the canal 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:01.060
 I want to stop even if I think michi 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.889

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.270
