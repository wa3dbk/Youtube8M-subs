00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.940
 We talked to your colleague Jordan Clasie about being over crowded at home 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.570
 he is always at this club 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.209
 but indeed more busy because you perform less here in competitions 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.209
 in the football vintage play off was not the rooster 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.660
 yes speaking from multiple sources as boys are is always that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.820
 terror pressure to perform and h 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.869
 and it has to win so anp yes little changes in that regard 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.619
 Expect years for years and certainly in that own cockpit against low-ranked teams 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.319
 people rightly six points from two years the two duels come 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.269
 yes well we will go for that 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.720
 and 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.300
 I'm playing home games there 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.580
 yes you should always win against such clubs 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.580
 two come his name 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.150
 some lesser clubs on paper and yes than the last two weeks 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.520
 he says it right that just have to be 6 points to be your trainer koeman 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.410
 of the week I might have to do with quality on the round 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.420
 against teams like psv and twente 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.329
 he is that 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.129
 do you know for you the flu come short top pieces of that kind 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.390
 opponents 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390
 yes well i have not actually worked so hard and checked 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.630
 and if you look that we play against ajax there you still had one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320
 possible that you should score that does not make and in return it is clear in it 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.780
 top competitions choker must make chances 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.780
 and I think we can close the best in then losing weight 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.210
 year with twente 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.390
 if you do well soccer balls Marian is more dirty points at the moment 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.790
 or the quality that violence does not say, but yes, it is clear that it is 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.360
 less support in the top matches than last season, but what do you have for 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.320
 yourself also feel fifth place so fantastic 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.410
 with this group in this competition 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.650
 fifties places as I say in the first five 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.760
 no you must always have ambitions 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.100
 you must have an objective that you can achieve that you can do 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.760
 Must be champions and the only thing that matters but I think they say that at the 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.590
 the first five finish that we set charity names that we also realistic 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.870
 saw your unfortunate football player as important with an assist 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.560
 the trainer is enthusiastic about you even in that period what you eat this is the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 counted more on playing minutes last week 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.229
 the hague did not seem to be just 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.859
 always loved that you play orange but well I now also notice that I do 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.619
 yes that's not why 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.899
 and is not obvious and that you play one well and that you immediately 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.729
 play more and how 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.749
 explanation of the offense one of the trainers clearly what was already there then 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.139
 Ajax said and 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.029
 actually acres yes it itself as a bit for twente so good huh 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.269
 so nothing wrong we just go naked with hard training and naked 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.609
 to the moments that I get that and that will grab but what is that explaining 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:39.049
 then 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:39.980
 from koeman 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.920
 all songs do you not well now well after a patch now to a luxury 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.539
 position that you meet 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.759
 years before in terms of players we can see where the 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.520
 shocked from the opponent and that was right now 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.900
 against ajax and twente yes that you typed players on the outside with 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.480
 speed with an action and for that matter the competitors are farther 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.949
 in that I am and I am a completely different person to play outside 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.419
 yes for me 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.179
 yes of course we just play 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:11.049
 with that explanation you can play outside when playing polem 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.409
 then midfielder 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.219
 heineken 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.749
 no I think so but often enough that I think I am the best 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.649
 my right come in midfield 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:23.399
 but good as I often say yes I play where team needs and yes that 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.729
 was his tunis that is currently on the outside 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.839
 then go the other way around but good midfielder that was also what you found in Oahu 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:33.869
 since you have the most capabilities that occupy position 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.379
 jada towards the alps 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.639
 even some win 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.559
 for those people that weapons nice for them 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.689
 Edwin has never done any win and there are say on and on 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:44.639
 must own an ice rink
