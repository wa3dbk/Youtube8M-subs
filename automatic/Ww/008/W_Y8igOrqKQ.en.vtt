because I thought that's where white
tigers<00:03:25.319> come<00:03:25.530> from<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.400> research<00:03:26.879> I<00:03:27.060> found

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
tigers come from and in research I found

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.520 
tigers come from and in research I found
that<00:03:27.450> that's<00:03:27.540> not<00:03:27.750> true<00:03:27.900> at<00:03:28.049> all<00:03:28.110> they<00:03:28.409> come

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
that that's not true at all they come

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.009 
that that's not true at all they come
from<00:03:28.680> India<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.790> wanted<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.629> be<00:03:30.780> as

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
from India and so I wanted it to be as

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.920 
from India and so I wanted it to be as
realistic<00:03:31.560> as<00:03:31.890> possible<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.030> stuck<00:03:33.480> India

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
realistic as possible so I stuck India

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.899 
realistic as possible so I stuck India
in<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.890> started<00:03:35.220> researching<00:03:35.370> and

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
in there and I started researching and

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.220 
in there and I started researching and
just<00:03:36.150> became<00:03:36.390> fascinated<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
just became fascinated with the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.080 
just became fascinated with the
mythology<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.849> unique<00:03:39.180> colour<00:03:39.540> and

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
mythology and the the unique colour and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.399 
mythology and the the unique colour and
visuals<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.180> India<00:03:42.659> would<00:03:42.780> add<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.230> book

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
visuals that India would add to the book

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.100 
visuals that India would add to the book
and<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.250> really<00:03:44.489> does<00:03:44.760> mesh<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.330> perfectly<00:03:45.810> I

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
and it really does mesh so perfectly I

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.449
