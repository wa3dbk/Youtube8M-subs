00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
frame so you've got better visibility

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.660

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
a full silicon skirt the inside is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.849 
a full silicon skirt the inside is
really<00:00:59.609> was<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> secondary<00:01:00.930> skirt<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
really was a secondary skirt so that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.490 
really was a secondary skirt so that
increases<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> surface<00:01:03.149> area<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.260> still

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
increases the surface area it can still

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
increases the surface area it can still
against<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> skin<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.729> helping<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> vent

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
against on the skin just helping to vent

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.250 
against on the skin just helping to vent
any<00:01:06.479> leaks<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.330> fully<00:01:09.810> flexible

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
any leaks and it's so fully flexible

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
any leaks and it's so fully flexible
from<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> frame<00:01:11.580> itself<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.330> does<00:01:12.510> have

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
from the frame itself as it does have

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.450 
from the frame itself as it does have
lots<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.200> movement<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.770> terms<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> fit<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.820> well

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
lots of movement in terms of fit as well

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.370 
lots of movement in terms of fit as well
the<00:01:17.460> buckles<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.150> fitted<00:01:18.630> directly<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
skirt so you again you've got more

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
skirt so you again you've got more
movement<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:21.930> better<00:01:22.320> flexibility<00:01:23.100> for

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
movement on here better flexibility for

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.140 
movement on here better flexibility for
fitting<00:01:24.350> adjustment<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.740> easy<00:01:26.150> come

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
fitting adjustment is really easy come

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.630 
fitting adjustment is really easy come
on<00:01:27.270> tighten<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> pull<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> tab<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
on tighten it to pull on the tab and you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.069

can<00:01:32.790> sort<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> tighten<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.720> quickly

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
can sort of tighten up very quickly

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.469 
can sort of tighten up very quickly
and<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:35.220> loosen<00:01:35.579> you've<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.090> gives<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.299> nice

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

start<00:02:14.099> at<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> bottom

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
start at the bottom

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.690 
start at the bottom
you<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.659> more<00:02:17.000> rigid<00:02:18.799> silicon<00:02:19.799> on<00:02:19.980> this

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you got a more rigid silicon on this

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.880 
you got a more rigid silicon on this
piece<00:02:20.939> this<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.049> just<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> hold<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.709> place

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
piece this is just to hold it in place

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.559 
piece this is just to hold it in place
you<00:02:23.159> don't<00:02:23.340> want<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.610> flopping<00:02:24.000> about<00:02:24.120> too

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
you don't want it flopping about too

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.789 
you don't want it flopping about too
much<00:02:24.780> obviously<00:02:25.019> when<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.379> let<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> go<00:02:25.739> you

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
much obviously when you let it go you

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.559 
much obviously when you let it go you
want<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.159> stay<00:02:26.400> relatively<00:02:26.879> near<00:02:27.269> your<00:02:27.450> mouth

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
want to stay relatively near your mouth

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.170 
want to stay relatively near your mouth
so<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.409> pick<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:28.860> very<00:02:29.040> quickly<00:02:29.340> so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
so you can pick it up very quickly so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.330 
so you can pick it up very quickly so
that's<00:02:30.299> molded<00:02:30.900> into<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.319> shape<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.860> keep

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
that's molded into that shape to keep

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.210 
that's molded into that shape to keep
that<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:32.700> place<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.620> bottom<00:02:34.890> we've<00:02:35.010> got<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
that in place the bottom we've got a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.849 
that in place the bottom we've got a
purse<00:02:35.790> chamber<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.840> catches<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.500> water<00:02:37.680> at

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
purse chamber so catches the water at

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.349 
purse chamber so catches the water at
the<00:02:37.920> bottom<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.489> still<00:02:38.970> allowing<00:02:39.180> me<00:02:39.329> to

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
the bottom here still allowing me to

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.520 
the bottom here still allowing me to
breathe<00:02:39.720> if<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.019> have<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.349> bit<00:02:40.500> of

breathe if you have a little bit of
water<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.980> bottom<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.819> would<00:02:41.939> just

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
water in the bottom and it would just

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.940 
water in the bottom and it would just
drain<00:02:42.390> out<00:02:42.599> or<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.049> purged<00:02:43.379> out<00:02:43.620> through

it<00:03:40.680> sort<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:40.889> divert<00:03:41.190> away<00:03:41.430> from<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:42.169> actual

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
it sort of divert away from the actual

smoke Wow opening brings it rounds up

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.089 
smoke Wow opening brings it rounds up
and<00:03:45.989> then<00:03:46.079> just<00:03:46.169> dumps<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.709> other<00:03:46.829> side

and then just dumps it on the other side

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.099 
and then just dumps it on the other side
so<00:03:47.639> water<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.030> diverted<00:03:48.239> away<00:03:48.660> from<00:03:48.810> the
