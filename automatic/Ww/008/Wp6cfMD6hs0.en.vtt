00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.220
 one on which the future faces many satisfied faces today and that also applied 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.730
 other boy curiously his colleague defender oleguer 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.730
 lay the foundation for the victory 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.470
 yes i think we and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.220
 and still a bit of a difficult start think that in the end a good result 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.409
 to put down 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.899
 we have kept the zero 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.639
 people know the top five with such a man driving life goes on in absence 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.660
 for that matter I think there 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.460
 the entire team deserves a big compliment 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 that is charity last night 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.330
 it does a bit like another year was to run the satellites 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.310
 of course it does better 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.660
 rita verstraeten sea grew up here as a boy that is it 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.100
 ultimate goal and and and a certain dream to then take in the first of 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.850
 ajax to come and play 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.220
 You are now ready for the customer to wear that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.990
 yes that does return the locals specially 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.079
 the children say it seems a bit busier it is delicious 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 with five league games to go in the cup final, stay here for that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 rules read a happy ending 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.260
 that has the municipality still has all the chances to go ahead 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.240
 that in the final was the match says 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 what an amazing happening I think I know 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.160
 and there you have to go for the full bin to get that prize 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.990
 in the championship year that is just a few points behind and you get 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.400
 twente at home anyway 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.850
 so we have to start to win all the matches ourselves 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.360
 and if you win all the matches and yes then I think we will before we go 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.650
 playing twente at home 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.030
 yes that would be nice if you still 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.799
 how many places can rise with you maybe even catching something wrong 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.500
 and if that is the case, think about giving it a bit away
