Hi, I'm Rob Wygant, this is Prairie
Kitchen. Contemporary Restaurant

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.029
Principles here at College of Lake
County. We have 11 students in the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.450
student managed restaurant, and we're
just getting ready for the final

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.430
preparations of service for this
afternoon.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.719
The students create the menus, they write
them weekly. They change weekly.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.940
They've done everything from developing the menu items, to prepping the menu items and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.739
producing them a la carte for every
single order that goes out of this kitchen.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
They've done a fantastic job as far as compliments are concerned.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.129
We've received great compliments from
staff, faculty, administration and the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.616
public, and again, this is all student
managed.

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:04.619
The level of quality that's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.060
being served here at the restaurant is
is fantastic. You're basically getting a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.580
fine-dining lunch at the cost of a quick
service restaurant. You know what the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.320
entree price is ranging from six to
eight dollars can't be beat, especially

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.600
as far as the quality of the product is
concerned.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.990
This is the back of the house

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.590
in Prairie kitchen. This is the
restaurant line where all the orders are prepared.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.909
We're plating right now, our
first round of tickets for lunch service

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.350
today is the Crispy Calamari going out
as an appetizer, first course.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.290
Here in the dining room of Prairie, our
students are operating service.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.330
They're learning all of the aspects of
upper scale catering service as well as

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.830
multi course offerings. They are
attempting to create a relaxed but

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.680
upscale feel to today's live service.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.400
Hi, I'm Emily, I'm a culinary student here at CLC.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm making the wedge
salad and I absolutely love that we have Prairie.
