00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.700
And on the first day of unleavened bread,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.460
when they killed the Passover lamb,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.000
His disciples said to Him,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.500
“Where do You want us to go and prepare, 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.740
that You may eat the Passover?”

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.739
And He sent forth two of His disciples, 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.920
and said to them, "Go into the city, 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.720
and there a man shall meet you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.600
 bearing a pitcher of water;

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.100
 follow him.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.020
And wherever he goes in, 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.920
say to the householder, 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.260
"The Teacher says, 'Where is the guest room,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.700
where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?'”

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.060
And he will show you a large upper room 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.080
furnished and prepared;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.820
there prepare for us.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.500
And His disciples went forth, 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.440
and came into the city, 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.480
and found it as He had told them;

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.920
and they prepared the Passover.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.780
And when it was evening, 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.080
He came with the twelve.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.680
And as they sat and ate, 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.640
Jesus said, “Truly I say to you 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.340
that one of you who eats with Me

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.460
shall betray Me.”

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.740
And they began to be sorrowful, 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.140
and to say to Him one by one, “Is it I?” 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.460
And another, “Is it I?”

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.000
But He answering, said to them, 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.160
“It is one of the twelve who dips with Me in the dish.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.000
The Son of Man goes indeed, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.160
as it is written of Him;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.600
but woe to that man 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.220
by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.460
It would have been good for that man

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.100
if he had not been born.”

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.030
And as they were eating, Jesus, took bread

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.740
and having blessed it, broke it, 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.260
and gave to them, and said,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.320
“Take, eat; this is My body.”

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.820
And taking the cup, when He had given thanks,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.760
He gave it to them; and they all drank of it.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.490
And He said to them, 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.910
“This is My blood of the New Covenant, which is shed. 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.970
Truly I say to you,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.000
I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.860
until that day 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.140
when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.210
And when they had sung a hymn, 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.840
they went out to the Mount of Olives.
