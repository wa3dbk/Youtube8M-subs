the braids that you do so because my

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.349

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
to use on my ends goes all the way to my

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.510 
to use on my ends goes all the way to my
roots<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> bad<00:00:37.230> thing<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:38.219> good
