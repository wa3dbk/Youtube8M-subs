supplements you know invest the
nose-first<00:02:14.950> creatine<00:02:15.959> beta-alanine<00:02:16.959> and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
nose-first creatine beta-alanine and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.650 
nose-first creatine beta-alanine and
stimulants<00:02:18.100> Yeah<00:02:18.340> right<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.330> ain't

every day so you need a beta alanine and
a<00:02:25.480> creatine<00:02:25.959> product<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> side<00:02:26.830> yeah

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
a creatine product on the side yeah

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.250 
a creatine product on the side yeah
alone<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.360> take<00:02:28.540> those<00:02:28.720> each<00:02:28.990> and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
creatine and beta-alanine you have to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.910 
creatine and beta-alanine you have to
supplement<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.959> every<00:02:34.959> day<00:02:35.170> not<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.800> the

Bob<00:02:51.610> grams<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.120> creatine<00:02:52.330> we<00:02:52.750> like<00:02:52.930> protein

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
Bob grams of creatine we like protein

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.590 
Bob grams of creatine we like protein
supplements<00:02:53.950> too<00:02:54.100> right<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.940> need<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.330> be

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
supplements too right but you need to be

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.930 
supplements too right but you need to be
getting<00:02:55.810> 90%<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.860> yeah<00:02:57.250> from<00:02:57.520> your<00:02:57.670> food

yeah at least 90% you just want to maybe
have<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.690> take<00:03:01.900> one<00:03:02.470> scoop<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.040> protein<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.519> day

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
have to take one scoop of protein a day

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.910 
have to take one scoop of protein a day
to<00:03:03.820> tie<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:05.080> know<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.380> gaps<00:03:05.650> you

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
to tie in you know the gaps you

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.110 
to tie in you know the gaps you
shouldn't<00:03:06.190> be<00:03:06.250> getting<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.549> majority<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.000> your

homeboy pink yeah now it's going to be a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.050 
homeboy pink yeah now it's going to be a
lot<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.799> scientific<00:03:12.400> motherfuckers<00:03:13.000> out

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
lot of scientific motherfuckers out

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.710 
lot of scientific motherfuckers out
there's<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.480> saying<00:03:13.959> hey<00:03:15.209> Wayne<00:03:16.209> prevent

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
there's a saying hey Wayne prevent

protein has been shown to be absorbed

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.350 
protein has been shown to be absorbed
the<00:03:19.630> highly<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.500> most<00:03:20.530> absorbable

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
the highly the most absorbable

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.789 
the highly the most absorbable
absorbable<00:03:22.360> protein<00:03:22.420> out<00:03:23.080> there<00:03:23.230> behave<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
absorbable protein out there behave of

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.720 
absorbable protein out there behave of
what<00:03:24.610> absorbable<00:03:25.480> yeah<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.620> there's<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.489> lot

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
what absorbable yeah but there's a lot

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.699 
what absorbable yeah but there's a lot
of<00:03:27.760> protein<00:03:28.060> comes<00:03:28.540> out<00:03:28.780> there<00:03:28.989> DSA<00:03:29.410> has<00:03:29.560> got

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
of protein comes out there DSA has got

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.729 
of protein comes out there DSA has got
25<00:03:30.190> grams<00:03:30.489> protein<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.989> don't<00:03:32.230> yeah

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
25 grams protein but it don't yeah

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.800 
25 grams protein but it don't yeah
that's<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.130> thing<00:03:33.160> that's<00:03:33.519> why<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.760> say<00:03:34.120> that's

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
that's the thing that's why I say that's

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.920 
that's the thing that's why I say that's
why<00:03:35.049> we<00:03:35.290> preach<00:03:35.650> get<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.670> get<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.420> get<00:03:37.720> your

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
why we preach get you get you get your

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.410 
why we preach get you get you get your
protein<00:03:38.140> come<00:03:38.830> food<00:03:39.190> yeah<00:03:39.790> that's<00:03:39.970> why<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> say

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
protein come food yeah that's why I say

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.810 
protein come food yeah that's why I say
that<00:03:40.630> yeah<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.260> may<00:03:41.440> be<00:03:41.500> true<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:41.829> protein

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
that yeah it may be true that protein

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.460 
that yeah it may be true that protein
supplements<00:03:43.329> is<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.840> be<00:03:43.959> absorbed<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.350> lot

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
supplements is to be absorbed a lot

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.229 
supplements is to be absorbed a lot
better<00:03:44.709> than<00:03:44.890> food<00:03:45.100> but<00:03:45.340> hey<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.970> don't<00:03:46.060> know

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
better than food but hey you don't know

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.120 
better than food but hey you don't know
if<00:03:46.360> you're<00:03:46.510> getting<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.810> protein<00:03:47.620> for<00:03:47.799> myself

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
if you're getting it protein for myself

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.780 
if you're getting it protein for myself
all<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.269> advice<00:03:50.370> do<00:03:51.370> ever<00:03:51.579> the
