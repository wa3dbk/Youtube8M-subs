00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
to run it slower or faster so you have

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.139

add mode manual mode and you can change

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
add mode manual mode and you can change
the<00:01:48.420> speed<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:49.680> other<00:01:49.829> thing<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.700> if

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the speed one other thing you can do if

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
the speed one other thing you can do if
you<00:01:50.970> want<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.600> put<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> batch<00:01:52.049> count<00:01:52.500> in

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
you want is you can put a batch count in

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.340 
you want is you can put a batch count in
so<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.520> put<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.149> account<00:01:54.420> five<00:01:54.750> bills<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so we put it on account five bills to a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.459 
so we put it on account five bills to a
bundle<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.880> hit<00:01:57.030> five<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.780> batch<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
bundle I just hit five into the batch I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.090 
bundle I just hit five into the batch I
drop<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> bills<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.210> Fed<00:02:01.140> five<00:02:01.439> bills<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
drop the bills in the Fed five bills and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.030 
drop the bills in the Fed five bills and
stopped<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.090> take<00:02:03.299> those<00:02:03.479> off<00:02:03.689> feeds<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> next

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
stopped I take those off feeds the next

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.930 
stopped I take those off feeds the next
five<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.579> stop

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
five and stop

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.480 
five and stop
and<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.870> keeps<00:02:08.110> doing<00:02:08.350> that<00:02:08.440> until<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.340> runs

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
and it keeps doing that until it runs

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.440 
and it keeps doing that until it runs
out<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.729> bill<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.160> can<00:02:12.640> also<00:02:12.790> run<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.240> batch

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
out of bill so you can also run in batch

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.500
