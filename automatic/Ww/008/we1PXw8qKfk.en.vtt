00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.260
 We waited a long time until the finished here 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.910

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.060
 I want you online that I want our opponents 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 now have about five to eight here 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.699
 is minutes waited until the door loaded 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.380
 and how it seems now finally 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 finished euro playstation 4 times again 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 folder graphic play is even 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.620
 reasonably acceptable or what else 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.360
 let's see, oh alright, finally it starts 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.230
 finally it starts again then 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.230
 agreed by 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 do you know how to film that did not even work 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.410
 nice or again with four frames online 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 to play is not great 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 I do not know how good he is because of that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 Rankings usually say mostly 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.199
 nothing out because the pool people play games 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.239
 and Private are, and therefore 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.590
 Let's hope for the best current here 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.359
 look around the 90 to watch or 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.549
 Too cheap that you can take it 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.380
 it live 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.119
 that you take you can just the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.799
 Keep your eyes open and video 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.970
 when I'm announcing the video for 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.439
 the streams and then you have if you 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810
 luck have the possibility against me 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.189
 play 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.369
 on the platform of your choice pcb is 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.520
 already 44 38 in just there, 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.750
 what works because its sun 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.920
 Stable online connection is natural 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:39.900
 not always given, especially not when 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 ps end up working until now completely 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.399
 good as I have at last episode too 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.060
 thought and then came jan delay me 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.470
 opposite 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 and then I came out of that very simple and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.680
 not always out there story of my life 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.799
 I am also the story of my life 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.070
 could 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.020
 we are in indian umbrellas 2013 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.090
 arena 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.780
 so you can jump action why 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 also do not land directly in the daily 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.229
 just stand up to the losail or catch 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.300
 We have been direct decline since 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.250
 Unfortunately, it is here is the us 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.350
 completely complete with coriso I do 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.690
 normal that the action can be your vote 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.540
 then yes yes I have a bit 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.819
 fear for the action like him 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.050
 content may or not i had so in 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.280
 Remember that hard to be able to 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.130
 But it is just as difficult 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.650
 fact optics content is real to the very 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.549
 Nice challenge issue from Ford for 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.299

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.140
 underway 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.690
 the action i do my waist action 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.400
 just to test 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.069
 Here we come to you, fully fresh 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 start accusing him is okay i have that 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.239
 Feel that ours is not 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.220
 just go through our luck 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.680
 helped out of the cantate variation would have 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.750
 the abt highest level because it is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.220
 yes of course the ellis version was 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.239
 want to have the shine 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:13.049
 94 so do not see any say 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.370
 torben Höltje air belongs francs steiner 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.630
 and has not all come to us because 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.820
 contrary to very common with the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.160
 again he says where everyone is sleeping or 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.450
 we were full faster Mörscher brings 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.000
 that's not the reason why everything works 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.760
 even then autumn session we have it in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.650
 Hof can not run better 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.690

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.500
 get through some trick by 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.010
 problems directly but stank star of the boom 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.010
 do not be the one now 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.300
 I just hope in the best way to 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:01.340
 imposed position 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.900
 he can not do it now 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.300

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.550

 I have now I keep trying to 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.240
 get hold of 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.640
 because of our clear agreements and 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.910
 adobe unlock a cinematic could 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:40.820

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.580
 The value over under pressure 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.440
