00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.980
 we imagine that there is disappointment this 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.290
 afternoon you wanted to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.610
 have it continue on this series for the 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.200
 maintenance but unfortunately there is a 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.200
 big team also in front is a 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.660
 very big bafé gomis here is the return of 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.939
 kevin gomis did them good when we 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.829
 direct way 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.060
 this goal hurts us at the beginning after we have 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.649
 wanted to push we wanted to push ourselves 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 fact we got to have met him 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.160
 alone 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.690
 they manage to make the difference so 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.790
 we were made and unfortunately 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.220
 we take three goals and in the bowl of 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.840
 redemptions I hope we will have the points 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.329
 it takes because it was good 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 negative after that so that's it 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 a failure but hey there are still three matches 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.359
 and racial 9 points so it takes 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.160
 continue to fight and see the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.600
 points needed for at the end of the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.600
 38th day be saved in league 1 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.869
 yes the slogan it was bafé gomis 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 now bafé a team had a match 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.960
 seriously from your team and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.260
 a shattering entrance one obliged to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.119
 speak 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.470
 we saw you early in the game a little 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.790
 little frustrated not to play but it's 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 that the yonnais collective you did 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.300
 the difference we come back we will listen 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.880
 you know it's true we do not play 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.070
 is not necessarily happy but hey 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.440
 knew we had a goal in 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.090
 common which was to end up in the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.800
 podium so I felt concerned 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.860
 and then good I think I start to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.330
 have a little bottle I know that 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 sometimes the difference comes from the bench 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.490
 so I put myself at the disposal of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.340
 of the group and well I am happy 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.800
 defends well we have trouble getting in like 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 last week but sometimes it works 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.660
 the main thing is to feel concerned 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.640
 and that's to bring the most to 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.720
 the team beaten is that if you come back 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.340
 every time you want to put some 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.530
 goals like that to play incumbent it's 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.900
 complicated after I prefer to start I 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.840
 think that gg I aspire to a 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.880
 selected in France team and 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.800
 for that you have to have play time and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.630
 also be performant within 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.910
 the Olympique Lyonnais who has a club that has 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.620
 a lot of ambition of the times the coach 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.240
 make choices you have to 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.500
 accept even if sometimes it's not it's 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.160
 not easy but it's like that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.320
 must bring it back and then after 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.440
 in the end we will do the balance sheet thank you not 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440
 made
