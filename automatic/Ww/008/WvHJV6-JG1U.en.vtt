00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.910
 the one that such facebook and youtube people 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.860
 here is a male canache with a new 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.230
 stable good video I bring a battle 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.020
 twice in the pokemon x and the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.640
 pokemon come as you can see in the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.160
 screen there is a charme in the chain and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.279
 perfect competitive to make a mega 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.950
 cariz area and will be raffling off those who 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.380
 comment in this video have to give a 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.290
 comment saying anything and 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.510
 he will also be giving away this pokemon 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.270
 It is also shiny but it is not competitive 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.789
 the collection solo and they should do what 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.620
 they should comment on the video and on 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.570
 the next video I will be announcing to the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.339
 winners so let's start this 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.170
 good video this time the team that I've 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.230
 chosen for battles has been great 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.600
 illa carrizal and come the first with 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.940
 who decided to start is with greg ninja 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.890
 since it has great special attack great 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.659
 speed and a variety of attacks that 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.519
 can be very useful to start a 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.989
 battle the first thing he does is take out 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.850
 his gray cult and he withdraws it because 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.740
 obviously he knows that I can throw a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.110
 ice beam that can leave it up 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.570
 otherness 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.600
 I did not predict that I would change it like that 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.060
 to use the beam and the same and not 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.640
 It was very effective against jacques type 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.340
 steel 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.770
 so he used the scald to treat 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.330
 to burn it try to leave it in a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.540
 been since it's a bit pretty 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.729
 hard to beat for his good defense 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 special defense and we know that in your 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.259
 phylum is quite dangerous what 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 does is use a shadow ball and 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.630
 weaken my great and there a single 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 hit was quite impressive and it's the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.640
 moment to take michel to raise one of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.619
 the figures of my teams always what 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.800
 I carry with me is quite strong a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.229
 very good physical attack and its evolution 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.119
 it makes it much more powerful but 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.119
 obviously it changes the form for its 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.640
 skill and use them share also for 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.470
 protect yourself obviously I predicted this and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.509
 what I do is use the dance of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.670
 dragon to be able to look for me in this turn 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.310
 and can not lose the turn attacking what 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.370
 that while he uses the shield so 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.380
 used an igneous stake to weaken 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.570
 what since he is steel type I fire type 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.370
 so it was a big blow that can 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.100
 hit in that moment and kill him 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.110
 It is a bit quite dangerous 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.150
 next that what you take out is a green 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.030
 obviously I'm at a disadvantage 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.970
 for being aguayo type be fire type and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.269
 dragon so he decided to take my come 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.159
 and in a single attack we see the damage 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.959
 that caused him today with a current 10 what 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.659
 totally weakens my revenge could not 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.629
 do absolutely nothing and only I have left 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.180
 in these moments perform and he all the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.030
 full election add the and the dragon 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.970
 that he retired in the first battle as well 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.769
 that with a 'triplet' we managed to make a 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.450
 critical blow and leave it in trouble 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.659
 but his coca cola fails and it's my 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.150
 opportunity to attack and be able to take me 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.790
 the victory against the summers that was 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.440
 quite hard to beat them since I have 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.090
 all skills not all 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.859
 odds against me but let's say 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.510
 that luck helped me quotes 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.030
 this time but we know that pokemon is a 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.260
 odds game and these things 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.819
 pass 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.920
 The next thing I did was a claw of 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.530
 Aragon that ended his and diego my 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.120
 pretty good speed so with that 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.739
 I won the battle first something pretty 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.180
 complicated 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.799
 good as you will see that I am repeating the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.410
 formula of my three pokemon graining 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.030
 lÃ¡zzari xavi arrives so let's start 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.830
 this battle once and for all 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.959
 see how this battle if it becomes a 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.209
 little more complicated than the previous one but 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.470
 he managed to get ahead he was pretty 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 interesting this is going to have because it's from 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.890
 the most difficult I've had 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.890
 good as you can see I started to get along 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.470
 he started around here harding a bit with 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.680
 very good defenses pretty hard to 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.390
 get off and have good special attack 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.959
 and good speed tries to make it a 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.459
 pump it to leave it poisoned which is 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.730
 what I really wanted because it is 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.739
 quite difficult to lower his feet 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.989
 this pokemon and even use the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.640
 rare space and everything for your 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.230
 next pokemon that's going to be that 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.930
 it's really going to complicate my 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.940
 existence like this is spam so wait no 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.670
 it's just a stick is common and current 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.250
 you will see that it will be what will turn it into mega 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.250
 fierce because an electric type of aragon 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.370
 It is not widely used in the competitive but 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.500
 under this strategy with space and 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.390
 weird is a bit very very very dangerous already 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.460
 that his special attack is high his 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.979
 special defense is high your problem is 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.380
 with the speed through the rare space you 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.870
 It gives a very good help 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.390
 and how can you see of two dragon courses 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.080
 I finish with my genius that good is good 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.330
 It does not have very good defenses but it does not 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.120
 managed to lower than I expected against 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.530
 the lightning one ends with my great and 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.090
 there and everything is getting more 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.310
 difficult since he has his three 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.770
 pokemon and I only have my exit 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.670
 and what was given in favor is that 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.130
 restore the dimensions the wheat no longer 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.560
 has effect in the battle and is the 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.150
 moment of not attacking can not give this 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.880
 that way, so I start with a 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.280
 earthquake 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.620
 I wanted to go for the dragon claw but it's 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.810
 better the earthquake if it changed it to 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.940
 I had to hit him with a garden 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.580
 good time now it's the turn of the garden 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.530
 a bit like a pretty rock type 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.300
 dangerous also did not know very well that 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.940
 do it so I decided to make a playlist 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.960
 that in case he did not take anything away for his type 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.690
 rock and makes a reflection to increase 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.520
 the defense and that 's what they do a great 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.340
 problem for me to char it since he is 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.230
 non-special physical attacker and we know 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.020
 that he still has a little more than 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.820
 I have not been able to even know 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.980
 and what it does at this moment is a 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.590
 explosion I thought that just fought 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.630
 really an explosion but did not succeed 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.790
 hurt me as much as the one that really 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.560
 expected me to do so I'm still in 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.990
 foot still in my charisse area fell 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.120
 two of yours and here's the minci no 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.730
 a bit a difficult one because it's a 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.220
 physical attack and its speed is very very 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.620
 good but of a flat breads managed 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.930
 download it and thus perform be throw to the 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.480
 three pokemon he only one battle 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.480
 quite difficult quite surprising 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.500
 well that was the video today I hope 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.290
 I liked them there expect the share of 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.600
 like comment you already know where you always 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.720
 they will be asking who is this girl 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.210
 that comes out in the image because I put a 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.090
 photo of her good it turns out that it was 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.710
 a Mexican friend who knew that 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.380
 time by means of my signature che you 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.730
 we love a lot we talk about many things 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:47.030
 we were annoying we laughed more than good 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.780
 today they told me that yesterday Antier had a 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.490
 accident and unfortunately she died 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.500
 this video and send greetings to 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.690
 many people who asked me in my 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.310
 firm but I really want to dedicate this 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:03.680
 video entirely to her in her memory 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.390
 this morning was his funeral 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.480
 I was told this news by a friend of hers 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.980
 so I hope you rest in peace and thank you 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.980
 for watching this video until later
