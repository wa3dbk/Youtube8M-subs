00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the hood when we started thinking about

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.770

our kitchen redesign and new appliances
we<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.440> wanted<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.859> professional<00:00:59.039> look<00:00:59.730> but

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
we really wanted a professional look but

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720 
we really wanted a professional look but
also<00:01:00.120> quality<00:01:00.780> appliances<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
also quality appliances that we know are

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.030 
also quality appliances that we know are
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> last<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.750> long<00:01:03.899> time<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
going to last a long time one of the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.469 
going to last a long time one of the
design<00:01:05.339> challenges<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
design challenges that we have of the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
design challenges that we have of the
current<00:01:06.810> space<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
current space is that we have the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460 
current space is that we have the
suspended<00:01:08.790> cupboard<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.810> definitely

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
suspended cupboard so it definitely

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
suspended cupboard so it definitely
blocks<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> view<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.670> doesn't<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.060> this

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
blocks the view it doesn't make this

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.780 
blocks the view it doesn't make this
room<00:01:12.479> quite<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.020> open<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:14.130> we're<00:01:14.490> looking

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
room quite as open so we're looking

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
room quite as open so we're looking
forward<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> replacing<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.830> hood

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
forward to replacing that with a hood

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.340 
forward to replacing that with a hood
which<00:01:17.430> provides<00:01:17.790> better<00:01:18.030> ventilation<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
which provides better ventilation I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
which provides better ventilation I
think<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> kitchen<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> should<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.210> designed

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
think the kitchen you should be designed

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.039 
think the kitchen you should be designed
to<00:01:22.020> serve<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.220> people<00:01:23.400> using<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.299> they

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to serve the people using them they

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.289 
to serve the people using them they
should<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.530> attractive<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.060> should

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
should look attractive but they should

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.039 
should look attractive but they should
be<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.080> sturdy<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.970> serviceable<00:01:30.049> what

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
be very very sturdy and serviceable what

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.260 
be very very sturdy and serviceable what
