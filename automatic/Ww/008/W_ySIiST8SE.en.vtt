00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone, welcome you to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.359
 channel game revizor with you pathos 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.130
 prepare today's review me not 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.559
 left feeling deja vu 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.969
 almost exactly a year ago I was preparing a review on 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 assassin's creed 3 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.680
 and then I did not want to do it 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 as a review since the game came out on the console 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.140
 a month before coming to the pitch and basically 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.840
 everyone who wanted to play it now 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 The situation is absolutely identical . 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.310
 assassin's creed 4 again he came out 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.800
 first on the console and again I don't have 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.020
 the desire to make video on it exactly how 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 review so i want to just talk about 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.820
 the game to express my opinion that I 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.100
 I liked that there was no why something was 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.500
 bad that was good very simple 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.329
 talk about the game on this note immediately 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.460
 that I liked the game and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.360
 I liked it much more than it was 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.039
 with the third part 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 in fact over time 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.649
 I understand that the third part of the game was 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.940
 very mediocre 4 same caused 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.010
 I have a really nice 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.079
 impression I liked the plot though 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 Perhaps this is due to the fact that the topic 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.309
 pirates are not interesting and closer than those and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.320
 ideas cypher I liked the implementation 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.510
 many gameplay moments even 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 liked the sea battles give in 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.400
 all in order, perhaps I'll start the plot 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.439
 I think everyone knows that in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.590
 the fourth part we play for 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.990
 edward ateva and father kate mckenna who 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.790
 turn is conor's father to but 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.790
 and the main character of the third part of the game 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.000
 grandfather conor right pirate this general 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.370
 it was known literally the very beginning 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.950
 add something else to turn out 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.080
 This spoiler is very difficult for us 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.300
 literally dipped in the thick of it 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.010
 events from the first moment that the very 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.170
 happy and the third part 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.870
 very long rocking on the storyline 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.500
 lines and that's what happens outside of news 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.550
 grieves the plot as such and no we 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.040
 we get a job in Abstergo 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.110
 Abstergo company by the way together with 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.120
 company ubisoft publishes computer 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.280
 game assassins creed 3 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.890
 as evidenced by the box with the game on 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.960
 the entire office of abstergo we just 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.700
 on the wrong explorer of the past 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.890
 to get used to the role of Edward 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.600
 kenuei in fact at the office of abstergo not 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.420
 nothing happens we periodically 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.370
 hanging around the office and through two 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.140
 unpretentious mini-games break open 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.210
 colleagues computers where we find the most 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.410
 diverse information as you know 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.450
 desmond miles 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.400
 died but his work lives about what and 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.000
 testifies most extracted 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.790
 records 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.230
 All I will not touch more plot so 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.870
 how everything else will be with swill 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.959
 conclusion I will say run in the image of Edward 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.970
 fun crawling around the office abstergo no but 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.010
 why play for the meal so much fun in 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.830
 basis all missions are dynamic driving 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.840
 although often comes across and stealth mid 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.940
 games are true missions begin to repeat 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.130
 but for me personally this impression is not 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.520
 spoil but the main chip of course the sea 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.680
 here again everything is like with verse three verses 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.360
 quite 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.610
 mixed impression rather mixed 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.350
 feelings on the one hand it's very cool 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.910
 when there is a ship the sea and you can 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.410
 piracy how much you fit 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.600
 on the other hand there are many 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.090
 problems the first problem is 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.950
 there is no seamless sti in the game 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.690
 no matter how developers assure us 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.640
 in all teasers they emphasized how 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.010
 importantly seamlessly but what really is 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.470
 in fact there are roughly two zones 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.890
 actions let's call them city and sea so here 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.600
 coming in 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.360
 loading from town to sea 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.820
 cities leaving such a city are also 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.050
 sea loading takes place while at sea 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.600
 we see schematic images 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.430
 coming closer the game invites us to go 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.110
 to the city but it only happens 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.940
 cases when we talk about big 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.320
 cities if we talk about small 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.670
 villages then they really 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.010
 are on the same level 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.840
 where the sea and all we need to go 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.520
 in such a village just swim up it 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.590
 lower the steering wheel and get to the shore 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.050
 not that the downloads were so 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.420
 big problem but the words yubisoft about 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.760
 that the world will be seamless but clearly and 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.470
 slyness is another unpleasant moment 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.130
 navigation is the scale of everything 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.660
 actions 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.850
 if you recall the game corsairs there 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.520
 quite a realistic scale to 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.709
 swim to that island to his nearest 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.390
 your neighbor in simulation mode will take you away 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.459
 several game days a ship 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.510
 far away from you really 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.640
 far away 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.860
 what is the enemy ship here 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.169
 in the cannon shot I can 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.540
 give a volley but the enemy ship does not 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.150
 sees the feeling of distance as if 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.850
 he is right next to him 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.490
 it really can be seconds 10 20 and 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.639
 only if I give a volley then they will understand that 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.250
 I am an enemy and that I should be attacked 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.530
 but before during the voyages clearly 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.840
 it is felt that the developers tried 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.090
 make mid large sea but to 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.870
 save resources all already pray how 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.700
 only could 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.100
 in the end, with all the beauty of graffiti 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.970
 spectacular this action is difficult to call 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.460
 basically the same game really 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.200
 interesting costing i think this is the one 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.630
 game you need to buy for 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.070
 collections nice graphics interesting 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.080
 good dynamic gameplay 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.270
 innovations and pirate lovers 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.520
 subjects it is generally Moscow in fact series 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.500
 games corsair arched and see them 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.300
 return we do not seem destined to a 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.400
 nothing new is essentially similar to 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.960
 corsairs except assassin's creed 4 more 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.080
 long will not be all
