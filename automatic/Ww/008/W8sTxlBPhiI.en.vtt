definitely<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.600> feel<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.840> you're

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
definitely don't feel like you're

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
definitely don't feel like you're
wearing<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.320> normal<00:01:25.409> lipstick<00:01:25.920> still<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
wearing a normal lipstick still but I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
wearing a normal lipstick still but I
thought<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.409> usually<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.950> red

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
thought you know I don't usually do red

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
thought you know I don't usually do red
lips<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.909> too<00:01:30.060> messy<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
lips because it's too messy and I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
lips because it's too messy and I
thought<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.439> was<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.860> something

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
thought if I was going to get something

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.380 
thought if I was going to get something
like<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.640> probably<00:01:32.820> should<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.270> like

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
like this I probably should get in like

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
like this I probably should get in like
red<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:33.869> maybe<00:01:34.079> I'll<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.890> some

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
red that way maybe I'll like have some

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.370 
red that way maybe I'll like have some
kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.509> more<00:01:36.509> incentive<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.960> wear<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
kind of more incentive to wear it and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
kind of more incentive to wear it and
then<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> also<00:01:37.979> pick<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.520> Revlon<00:01:38.759> crazy

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
then I also pick up this Revlon crazy

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
then I also pick up this Revlon crazy
shine<00:01:39.630> nail<00:01:39.930> buffer<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.860> says<00:01:41.100> four<00:01:41.460> hundred

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
shine nail buffer it says four hundred

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
shine nail buffer it says four hundred
percent<00:01:42.299> shinier<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.110> don't<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> seems

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
percent shinier I don't know it seems

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
percent shinier I don't know it seems
interesting<00:01:44.610> although<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.780> i<00:01:45.840> have

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
interesting although i know that i have

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.990 
interesting although i know that i have
one<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.619> sally<00:01:46.950> beauty<00:01:47.310> supply<00:01:47.490> before

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
one from like sally beauty supply before

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.080 
one from like sally beauty supply before
and<00:01:48.920> they<00:01:49.920> also<00:01:50.070> sell<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> thing<00:01:51.000> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and they also sell this kind of thing in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
and they also sell this kind of thing in
the<00:01:51.180> mall<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.079> i'm<00:01:52.170> guessing<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the mall and so i'm guessing if it's it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.740 
the mall and so i'm guessing if it's it
if<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.430> anything<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:54.030> those<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:54.509> tues

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
if it's anything like those other tues

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
if it's anything like those other tues
your<00:01:55.290> nails<00:01:55.680> will<00:01:55.950> feel<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.219> plastic<00:01:56.610> when

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
I probably would have preferred it not

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.510 
I probably would have preferred it not

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.340 
me a flower but that's okay maybe I
could<00:02:29.760> even<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:30.120> break<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.630> part<00:02:30.930> off<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
could even like break this part off the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.860 
could even like break this part off the
top<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.520> wasn't<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:32.910> noticeable<00:02:33.420> flower

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
trip I felt like I got a lot of stuff

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.200 
trip I felt like I got a lot of stuff
that<00:03:06.630> I'm<00:03:06.810> going<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.050> wear<00:03:07.460> for<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.730> long<00:03:09.000> time

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
that I'm going to wear for a long time

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.120 
that I'm going to wear for a long time
to<00:03:09.360> come<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> lot<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.080> staples<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
to come like a lot of staples so the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.800 
to come like a lot of staples so the
first<00:03:11.310> thing<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.640> got<00:03:11.880> was<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.390> dress

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
first thing that I got was this dress

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.530 
first thing that I got was this dress
and<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.950> was<00:03:14.100> two<00:03:14.250> dollars<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.820> it's<00:03:15.060> by<00:03:15.240> go

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
and this was two dollars and it's by go

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.120 
and this was two dollars and it's by go
international<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.380> think<00:03:16.470> that's<00:03:16.740> target

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
international so I think that's target

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.670 
international so I think that's target
when<00:03:17.280> they<00:03:17.370> had<00:03:17.490> like<00:03:17.640> their<00:03:17.820> designer

and this was by Express and this is an

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.870 
and this was by Express and this is an
extra<00:03:49.320> small<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.010> when<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.190> saw<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.610> really

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
extra small and when I saw it I really

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.190 
extra small and when I saw it I really
loved<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.270> but<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.480> didn't<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.990> was<00:03:52.080> going

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
loved it but I didn't think it was going

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.560 
loved it but I didn't think it was going
to<00:03:52.290> fit<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:53.340> told<00:03:53.490> myself<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:54.000> won't<00:03:54.240> be

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
to fit so I just told myself I won't be

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.330 
to fit so I just told myself I won't be
upset<00:03:54.750> if<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.230> done<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.530> I'll<00:03:55.770> just<00:03:55.950> try<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.130> on

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
upset if it done it I'll just try it on

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.980 
upset if it done it I'll just try it on
and<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.670> actually<00:03:56.850> does<00:03:57.180> fit<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.660> think<00:03:57.750> it

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
and it actually does fit so I think it

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.480 
and it actually does fit so I think it
must<00:03:58.110> have<00:03:58.290> been<00:03:58.440> supposed<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.950> be<00:03:59.070> oversized

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
must have been supposed to be oversized

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.710 
must have been supposed to be oversized
because<00:03:59.760> there's<00:03:59.880> no<00:04:00.060> way<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.209> wear<00:04:00.450> an<00:04:00.540> extra

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
because there's no way I wear an extra

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.930 
because there's no way I wear an extra
small<00:04:01.020> but<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.070> got<00:04:02.100> french<00:04:02.430> at<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.610> bottom

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
small but it's got french at the bottom

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.430 
small but it's got french at the bottom
here<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.450> then<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:03.840> has<00:04:03.959> fringe<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
here and then it has fringe on the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.140 
here and then it has fringe on the
sleeves<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.920> which<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.340> don't<00:04:05.400> really<00:04:05.640> care<00:04:05.880> for

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
sleeves to which I don't really care for

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.240 
sleeves to which I don't really care for
so<00:04:06.690> when<00:04:07.020> I<00:04:07.050> tried<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.530> rolled<00:04:07.920> them<00:04:08.130> up

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
so when I tried it on I rolled them up

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.640 
so when I tried it on I rolled them up
so<00:04:08.520> you<00:04:08.580> can't<00:04:08.790> even<00:04:08.910> tell<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.570> this<00:04:10.320> is<00:04:10.440> just

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
so you can't even tell and this is just

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.310 
so you can't even tell and this is just

I<00:06:36.370> I<00:06:36.670> don't<00:06:37.450> even<00:06:37.540> know<00:06:37.720> what<00:06:37.900> I<00:06:38.110> think<00:06:38.230> I<00:06:38.470> tried

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
I I don't even know what I think I tried

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
because if i would have thought i

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.870 
because if i would have thought i
wouldn't<00:06:41.020> you<00:06:41.140> even<00:06:41.230> try<00:06:41.560> them<00:06:41.830> but<00:06:42.580> anyway

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.690 
wouldn't you even try them but anyway
that<00:06:42.910> like<00:06:43.210> a<00:06:43.240> dressy<00:06:43.660> pant<00:06:43.960> and<00:06:44.380> it<00:06:45.190> has<00:06:45.370> cuffs

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.550 
that like a dressy pant and it has cuffs
there<00:06:46.000> hopefully<00:06:46.270> those<00:06:46.570> are<00:06:46.750> staying<00:06:47.110> like

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
there hopefully those are staying like

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.530 
there hopefully those are staying like
they're<00:06:47.710> supposed<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:48.130> and<00:06:48.340> has<00:06:48.940> this<00:06:49.090> belt

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
they're supposed to and has this belt

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.730 
they're supposed to and has this belt
that<00:06:49.660> comes<00:06:49.870> with<00:06:50.020> it<00:06:50.050> but<00:06:50.230> you<00:06:50.320> don't<00:06:50.530> have<00:06:50.680> to

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
that comes with it but you don't have to

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.830 
that comes with it but you don't have to
wear<00:06:51.100> that<00:06:51.310> and<00:06:51.700> it's<00:06:52.090> like<00:06:52.180> a<00:06:52.210> high-waisted

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
wear that and it's like a high-waisted

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.410 
wear that and it's like a high-waisted
short<00:06:53.110> so<00:06:53.500> it's<00:06:54.220> good<00:06:54.400> to<00:06:54.430> talk<00:06:54.760> stuff<00:06:55.030> into

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
short so it's good to talk stuff into

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.290 
short so it's good to talk stuff into
because<00:06:55.960> it<00:06:56.080> does<00:06:56.200> right<00:06:56.530> up<00:06:56.710> way<00:06:56.890> higher<00:06:57.160> than

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
because it does right up way higher than

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.760 
because it does right up way higher than
probably<00:06:58.300> most<00:06:58.390> of<00:06:58.780> most<00:06:59.200> of<00:06:59.290> you<00:06:59.410> are<00:06:59.470> used<00:06:59.650> to

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
probably most of most of you are used to

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.650 
probably most of most of you are used to
and<00:07:00.490> because<00:07:00.730> it<00:07:00.970> is<00:07:01.090> so<00:07:01.240> hot<00:07:01.420> I've<00:07:01.570> been
