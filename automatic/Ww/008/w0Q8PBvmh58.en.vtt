00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello today I want to tell you how we can 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.449
 do in an easy way this kind of 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.750
 doll that kids can do 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:16.270
 so I can not put them as a brooch or 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.390
 place it anywhere in the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.330
 materials that we are going to use are pasta 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.330
 of modeling that stays dry in the air a 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.460
 stick or a piece of aluminum wire 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.680
 an accessory of safety pins and 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.989
 silicone glue the first thing we're going to 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.150
 to do is take the modeling paste from 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.510
 white color and let's make a noodle 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.540
 the macaroni and two balls of this 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.110
 way with the blue heat let's do 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.890
 a triangle for the body a spaghetti 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.079
 the macaroni and two balls with the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.530
 light orange we've made a 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.140
 little head with the strongest orange 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.020
 to do this time is like cut now 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.329
 let's take the triangle and let's 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.090
 give it a little more shape so that 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.560
 have the body shape plus pump given 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.020
 in this area here 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.270
 being the finger and doing so and once 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.090
 that we already have it like that we are going to put 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.079
 the little arms for that we're going to take the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.140
 two macaroni we are going to shape it in the 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.450
 part of here below we are going to take a 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.000
 small ball of the white and we are going to 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.390
 Put your little hand on, let's give it a 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.210
 way so crushed this area here 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.210
 and we're going to put it in this area here 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.880
 let's take another little arm and we will 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.100
 do the same operation and once 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.100
 we already have it like that and we're going to go 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.740
 placing in the back 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.830
 fidel landmarks of orange color for 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.709
 make it look like you have a 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.990
 pigtail once we have already covered the 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.630
 head with the orange hair of this 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.240

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.189
 Well, in this way, we are going to gather 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.280
 and we're going to make it into a pigtail 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.590
 and we're going to put it in the zone of 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.079
 here back once we have already 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.190

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.210
 shape of the buttons and let's go 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.580
 placing we are going to do the 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.370

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.439
 white macaroni let's take one of the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.799
 little balls we are going to give it the shape of a 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:12.310
 We put an area down here 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.910
 We down here apachurra 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.730
 and we give the elongated shape of a shoe 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.970
 from the front we are going to 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.190
 make a kind of tie so that it 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.530
 we stay like this so we're going to do what 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.440
 same with the other leg once already 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.569
 we have the adornments to the shoes what 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.300
 what we are going to do is put it on 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.860
 area down here with the marker 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.890
 White 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.470
 we make small dots in a way that 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.700
 we stay like this now what we're going to 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.000
 to do is to crush the noodle we have 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.910
 here and let's also draw 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.150
 before placing it on the hair we have done 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.350
 the drawings we are going to put it in the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.350
 Pigtail area 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.080
 Now what we are going to do is draw him 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.750
 the eyes to the doll for that we're going to 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.270
 take a marker that has a tip 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.200
 very finite and we are going to do it with a 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.080
 kind of hairline like that and another here the 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.750
 same strip and we're going to give it a way to 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.880
 tab for the part of here once that 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.320
 we have it this way we're going to catch 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.140
 the white marker and let's give it the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.620
 little white dot here in the middle of the 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.590
 stripe 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.070
 now let's take the black colander and 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.250
 let's make a small dot for 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.100
 that stays like this now in the zone of 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.130
 the mouth we are going to give it also a form 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.860
 round to what we are going to do is 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.320
 put a little bit of silicone glue on 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.080
 the lower part of the head and in the 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.880
 neck area and now I'm going to catch 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.410
 a piece of aluminum thread but 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.680
 You can also do it with a piece 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.640
 I'll stick insert it into the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.700
 head and then in the neck area of 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:11.500
 the doll once we have it already 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:14.920
 then we will stick the safety pin in the area 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:19.450
 from here back and we would have our 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.480
 doll performed I hope you have 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.830
