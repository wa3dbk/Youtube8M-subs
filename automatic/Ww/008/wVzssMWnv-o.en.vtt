silver the next thing to do is allow
this<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.580> completely<00:01:21.000> dry<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.840> we've

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
this to completely dry so now that we've

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.929 
this to completely dry so now that we've
done<00:01:22.409> our<00:01:22.710> silver<00:01:23.220> background<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
completely dry we're going to begin

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.410 
completely dry we're going to begin
working<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> random<00:01:26.520> hearts<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.180> see

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
working on the random hearts you see

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.510 
working on the random hearts you see
there<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:28.170> much<00:01:28.320> once<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> apply<00:01:29.340> your

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
there pretty much once you apply your

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
there pretty much once you apply your
silver<00:01:29.880> wherever<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.659> it

silver wherever you want it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
silver wherever you want it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
want them so they're all in different

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.940 
want them so they're all in different
areas<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.909> said<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> thumb<00:01:37.770> they

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
areas like I said but on the thumb they

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 
areas like I said but on the thumb they
have<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.369> different<00:01:38.790> too<00:01:38.970> unless<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.900> want

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
have to be different too unless you want

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.390 
have to be different too unless you want
them<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> same<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.220> look

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
them all to be the same that will look

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
them all to be the same that will look
pretty<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> first<00:01:42.720> thing<00:01:43.079> I'm

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
going to do I'm going to be using a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
going to do I'm going to be using a
brush<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.390> tiny<00:01:45.630> little<00:01:45.840> brush<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.799> I'm

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
brush just a tiny little brush so I'm

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.530 
brush just a tiny little brush so I'm
going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.670> piece<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.000> paper<00:01:48.270> with

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
going to go out my piece of paper with

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.170 
going to go out my piece of paper with
red<00:01:48.930> polish<00:01:49.500> any<00:01:49.829> red<00:01:50.310> polish<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.790> your<00:01:50.939> choice

glitter<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> would<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.869> easier

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
glitter in it just so it would be easier

and I'm going to do a piece of the heart
on<00:02:10.230> the<00:02:10.260> silver<00:02:10.830> half<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.620> then<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
on the silver half of it and then the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
on the silver half of it and then the
other<00:02:13.800> half<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.270> do<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
other half I'm going to do it on the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.990 

so<00:02:22.320> we're<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.470> doing<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.950> very<00:02:23.250> easy<00:02:23.520> shaped

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
so we're just doing a very easy shaped

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.270 
so we're just doing a very easy shaped
heart<00:02:24.330> whatever<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.350> find<00:02:25.530> easier<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.100> use

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
heart whatever you find easier to use

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.760

the<00:02:26.460> hook<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.480> hearts<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.020> can<00:02:28.410> use

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the hook to do the hearts you can use

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.420 
the hook to do the hearts you can use
that<00:02:29.010> method<00:02:29.250> maybe<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.210> think<00:02:30.450> I'm<00:02:30.720> using<00:02:31.020> a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
that method maybe you think I'm using a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.090 
that method maybe you think I'm using a
dotting<00:02:32.430> tools<00:02:32.970> easier<00:02:33.630> whatever<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.860> want

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
dotting tools easier whatever you want

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.640 
dotting tools easier whatever you want

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
backward one here over on this area so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.270 
backward one here over on this area so
I'm<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.520> gonna<00:02:46.220> do<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> shape<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> heart

glitter<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.580> would<00:04:37.790> work<00:04:38.000> great<00:04:38.210> I'm

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
glitter and that would work great I'm

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.870 
glitter and that would work great I'm
going<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.050> be<00:04:39.169> using<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.710> glitter<00:04:40.070> polish<00:04:40.490> just

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
so all I'm going to start doing is just

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.490 
so all I'm going to start doing is just
placing<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.070> glitters<00:04:46.840> wherever<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:48.110> want

placing the glitters wherever I want
them<00:04:48.650> which<00:04:48.770> is<00:04:48.919> going<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.220> be<00:04:49.430> in<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:50.210> entire

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
them which is going to be in the entire

them which is going to be in the entire
silver<00:04:52.490> background<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:54.740> is<00:04:54.890> a<00:04:54.919> step

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
silver background and this is a step

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.820 
silver background and this is a step
that<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.580> can<00:04:55.610> skip<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.300> course<00:04:56.630> but<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.290> wanted

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
that you can skip of course but I wanted

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.870 
that you can skip of course but I wanted
to<00:04:57.890> add<00:04:58.190> on<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:59.290> little<00:05:00.290> bit<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.860> more<00:05:01.070> glitter

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
to add on a little bit of more glitter

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.200 
to add on a little bit of more glitter
to<00:05:02.090> my<00:05:02.240> design<00:05:03.130> just<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.310> make<00:05:04.460> it<00:05:04.490> stand<00:05:04.910> out

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
to my design just to make it stand out

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.750 
to my design just to make it stand out
and<00:05:05.480> make<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.780> hearts<00:05:06.220> stand<00:05:07.220> out<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.490> little

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
and make the hearts stand out a little

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.610 
and make the hearts stand out a little
more<00:05:07.910> so<00:05:08.510> I'm<00:05:08.600> just<00:05:08.870> doing<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.260> glittered

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
more so I'm just doing the glittered

here<00:05:50.720> so<00:05:51.140> I'm<00:05:51.289> going<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.530> place<00:05:52.130> one<00:05:53.979> stripe

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
here so I'm going to place one stripe

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:55.910 
here so I'm going to place one stripe
here

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
here

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.240 
here
like<00:05:56.920> that<00:05:57.310> just<00:05:57.850> going<00:05:58.390> around<00:05:58.510> the<00:05:58.840> heart

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
like that just going around the heart

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.920 
like that just going around the heart
when<00:06:00.250> I<00:06:00.280> dip<00:06:00.550> again<00:06:00.700> then<00:06:01.330> out<00:06:01.540> my<00:06:01.660> brush<00:06:02.520> I'm

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
when I dip again then out my brush I'm

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.170 
when I dip again then out my brush I'm
going<00:06:04.930> to<00:06:05.080> go<00:06:05.470> a<00:06:05.860> little<00:06:06.250> bit<00:06:06.490> higher<00:06:06.670> start<00:06:07.090> a

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
going to go a little bit higher start a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.120 
going to go a little bit higher start a
separate<00:06:07.570> stripe<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.080> then<00:06:08.200> connect<00:06:08.710> it<00:06:08.890> so

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
separate stripe and then connect it so

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.890 
separate stripe and then connect it so
we<00:06:10.000> have<00:06:10.180> one<00:06:10.420> stripe<00:06:10.840> going<00:06:11.200> on<00:06:11.380> there<00:06:12.900> now

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
we have one stripe going on there now

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.700 
we have one stripe going on there now
I'm<00:06:14.230> going<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:15.600> then<00:06:16.600> out<00:06:16.780> my<00:06:16.900> brush<00:06:17.140> again<00:06:17.170> and

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
I'm going to then out my brush again and

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.010 
I'm going to then out my brush again and
we're<00:06:17.920> going<00:06:18.070> to<00:06:18.130> probably<00:06:18.880> will<00:06:19.420> start<00:06:19.780> one

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
we're going to probably will start one

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.180 
we're going to probably will start one
over<00:06:20.620> on<00:06:20.740> this<00:06:20.920> area<00:06:22.740> so<00:06:23.740> we're<00:06:23.830> going<00:06:23.950> to<00:06:24.040> go

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
over on this area so we're going to go

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.100 
over on this area so we're going to go
around<00:06:24.310> like<00:06:24.670> that<00:06:24.910> and<00:06:25.210> then<00:06:25.780> I'm<00:06:25.900> going<00:06:26.020> to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
around like that and then I'm going to

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.540 
around like that and then I'm going to
do<00:06:26.230> the<00:06:26.350> same<00:06:26.530> thing<00:06:26.740> I<00:06:26.830> did<00:06:26.890> to<00:06:27.040> the<00:06:27.220> bottom

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
do the same thing I did to the bottom

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.660 
do the same thing I did to the bottom
one<00:06:27.700> and<00:06:27.880> then<00:06:28.030> I'm<00:06:28.150> going<00:06:28.360> to<00:06:28.920> connect<00:06:29.920> so<00:06:30.520> we

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
one and then I'm going to connect so we

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.880 
one and then I'm going to connect so we
have<00:06:30.820> another<00:06:31.120> one<00:06:31.420> there<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:32.200> next<00:06:32.560> one<00:06:32.770> I'm

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
have another one there the next one I'm

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.140 
have another one there the next one I'm
going<00:06:32.980> to<00:06:33.070> thin<00:06:33.250> out<00:06:33.370> my<00:06:33.490> brush<00:06:33.730> again<00:06:33.760> and<00:06:36.150> we

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
going to thin out my brush again and we

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.940 
going to thin out my brush again and we
can<00:06:37.270> place<00:06:37.480> little<00:06:37.780> small<00:06:38.200> ones<00:06:38.440> now<00:06:38.650> so<00:06:38.860> I'm

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
can place little small ones now so I'm

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.490 
can place little small ones now so I'm
going<00:06:39.160> to<00:06:39.220> place<00:06:39.460> one<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.970> little<00:06:40.840> rounded<00:06:41.290> one

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
going this way and over on this side we

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.000 
going this way and over on this side we
can<00:06:44.560> probably<00:06:44.950> place<00:06:45.640> one<00:06:46.030> one<00:06:47.020> starting<00:06:47.560> here

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
can probably place one one starting here

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.170 
can probably place one one starting here
and<00:06:48.160> going<00:06:49.650> around<00:06:50.650> that<00:06:50.890> way<00:06:51.130> so<00:06:51.640> we<00:06:51.820> have<00:06:51.850> our

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
and going around that way so we have our

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.420 
and going around that way so we have our
stripes<00:06:52.600> we've<00:06:52.960> done<00:06:53.260> they're<00:06:53.560> going<00:06:54.160> around

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
stripes we've done they're going around

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.270 
stripes we've done they're going around
our<00:06:54.940> hearts<00:06:55.390> and<00:06:55.660> pretty<00:06:56.470> much<00:06:56.680> that's<00:06:56.980> it

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
our hearts and pretty much that's it

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.190 
our hearts and pretty much that's it
that's<00:06:57.610> how<00:06:57.880> you<00:06:57.910> get<00:06:58.180> this<00:06:58.330> nail<00:06:58.600> design<00:06:58.630> done

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
that's how you get this nail design done

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.310 
that's how you get this nail design done
it's<00:06:59.740> not<00:07:00.130> time-consuming<00:07:01.120> it's<00:07:01.510> simple<00:07:02.140> to

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
it's not time-consuming it's simple to

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.380 
it's not time-consuming it's simple to
do<00:07:02.470> just<00:07:02.920> pretty<00:07:03.580> much<00:07:03.790> the<00:07:04.000> steps<00:07:04.240> you<00:07:04.360> have

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
do just pretty much the steps you have

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.450 
do just pretty much the steps you have
to<00:07:04.570> keep<00:07:04.720> in<00:07:04.840> mind<00:07:04.870> is<00:07:05.170> to<00:07:05.350> allow<00:07:05.650> your<00:07:06.220> in

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
to keep in mind is to allow your in

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.580 
to keep in mind is to allow your in
between<00:07:06.880> steps<00:07:07.210> to<00:07:07.420> dry<00:07:07.600> before<00:07:07.900> you<00:07:08.020> continue

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
between steps to dry before you continue

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.410 
between steps to dry before you continue
on<00:07:08.620> that<00:07:09.280> way<00:07:09.400> they<00:07:09.550> won't<00:07:09.670> smear<00:07:10.060> into<00:07:10.330> each

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
on that way they won't smear into each

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.630 
on that way they won't smear into each
other<00:07:10.660> but<00:07:10.870> that's<00:07:10.990> pretty<00:07:11.260> much<00:07:11.410> it<00:07:11.770> I<00:07:11.950> hope

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
other but that's pretty much it I hope
