towards your cleansing routine I found
this<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.500> when<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:24.090> using<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.720> towards<00:02:25.380> my

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
this out when I was using it towards my

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.680 
this out when I was using it towards my
moisturizer<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.760> think<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.540> mean

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
moisturizer and I think you can I mean

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.930 
moisturizer and I think you can I mean
you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.990> see<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.800> video<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.580> talked

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
you can see the video that I talked

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.130 
you can see the video that I talked
about<00:02:30.740> I'll<00:02:31.740> just<00:02:31.920> put<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.190> up<00:02:32.250> here<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.140> i

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
about I'll just put it up here and i

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.320 
about I'll just put it up here and i
found<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.040> why<00:02:35.250> not<00:02:35.310> use<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> cleanser

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
found that why not use it in a cleanser

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.380 
found that why not use it in a cleanser
so<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.500> add<00:02:37.620> few<00:02:37.950> drops<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.550> much<00:02:39.240> as
