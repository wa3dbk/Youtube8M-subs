00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.590
 not sophisticated girl in love is ready 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.269
 believe what more you want 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.040
 man in love is ready to believe 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.480
 what is not really 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.939
 and the magic music of adolf adana dozens 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 beautiful ballerinas traditionally live 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.720
 this everlasting plot of shilele 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.519
 referring to the literature exactly 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.590
 as much as it relates to life 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 the only difference is that this evening on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.899
 the scene in our case remains only 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.620
 add this is svetlana's favorite party 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.989
 clown 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.160
 and this evening she danced with 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.160
 by David Goldberg 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.810
 on 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.700
 just closed the curtain in big 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.160
 and after a few hours at svetlana and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.470
 David fly to Hong Kong where they too 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.110
 come out together in gigs but already on 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.900
 touring la rock and this will be different 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.580
 the editors of the same life before here 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.260
 first time us and now we will land the plane 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.140
 open the video will be watching order but 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.600
 it's all in the future and today the audience is not 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.300
 made it possible to close the curtain 20 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.430
 minutes and called artists like this 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.399
 was the premiere 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.100
 the explanation is simple it is inexplicable it 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.619
 that energy is magic that makes 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.750
 adults people forget where they are 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.910
 and beat your hands as a sign 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.090
 thanks for donated moments 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.210
 stage miracle because they are spectators 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.270
 do not understand how it is created they 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.830
 able to only sympathize of course from 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.930
 each performance of each 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.020
 prices grow something find some 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.140
 new paints new emotions and that's good 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.690
 what 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.119

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.409
 always interesting always know what 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.940
 only you will feel it already 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.290
 limit all 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.590
 stupino therefore 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.260
 I love when I think all the time 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.420
 doom 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.579
 we imagine something new yet 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.299
 some new paint some new 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.280
 emotions fomich took the horse thawed for me 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.470
 giselle is such a ballet which is always 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.689
 born again you find something 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.739
 new after all this is genuine human 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:40.319
 natural emotions every time in the first 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.590
 act giselles I see love and about 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.170
 tragedy death in the second act i'm off in 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.689
 yourself where there is no public Ivan only me and mine 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.690
 feelings of guilt are my tragedy and mine 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:56.390
 remorse do you know for every life 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.390
 there is something new human 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.629
 Now imagine that this is an ordinary 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.950
 performance of the current repertoire 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:13.049
 ordinary if so can be say 1218 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.849
 performance from the day of the first performance 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.060
 ballet in the big theater 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.819
 which premiered in 1843 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.310
 just two years after birth 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:28.129
 jack on the stage of the grand opera theater 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.650
 Paris and 931 performances from the day of production 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.319
 1944 from that time life 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.269
 practically did not leave the historical 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.959
 big scene however in 1987 yuri 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.780
 Grigorovich 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.260
 made a new edition and it is this 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.170
 editorial presented zakharov and holberg 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.930
 I think this is a big life especially 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.720
 the second act is my favorite version of 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.060
 of all the versions that I danced because 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.280
 that these walls are floor-ceiling it all 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.200
 creates a very intimate atmosphere 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.629
 despite being a big scene 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.360
 awesome but in this version it is created 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.879
 almost a small room where all the action 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.799
 going on and I think that's perfect 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.739
 a piece for a big theater scene 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.739
 on this gigantic scene you're natural 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.229
 way you feel lost but if 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.660
 there is a sense of intimacy she creates 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.060
 perfect balance 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.280
 giselle classic dance pattern and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.979
 of course this ballet is in 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.010
 the repertoire of many ballerinas and in the repertoire 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:35.250
 many musical theaters but everywhere 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.620
 different editions and not every dancer on 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.190
 actually admits that giselle 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.100
 it is her relationship material 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.860
 with the world of emotion and motivation of this heroine 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.350
 deeply individual for svetlana 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.060
 clown story of deceived love in 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.360
 which love still turns out 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.849
 taller and deceit and betrayal and hear 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.599
 only herself and also saves 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.790
 the abuser is the source and and the inspiration and 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.320
 search on stage 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.250
 the goal is one of my first performances 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.750
 when I was a very young ballerina 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.270
 I was a beginner when I was 17 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.880
 first danced this performance or on 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.370
 for many years a and creative 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.040
 life or career can say so 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.770
 I always dance with me 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.440
 its in many editions of the brand pen i 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.849
 danced the potions version of the patrice bar 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.350
 caressed this catcher 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:37.960
 she wears the same bar and 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:44.280
 prince kaial opera this popped version 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.280
 Bar Mariinsky Theater and the Bolshoi Theater 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.110
 in many theaters they are different versions 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.000
 In general, they are similar to each other, but 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.000
 some nuances are different 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.790
 borders in different countries are always different 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.790
 but with david svetlana loves to dance 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.790
 this ballet especially and it is mutual 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.360
 Svetlana Zakharova 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.790
 perfect ballerinas i think we are with 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.650
 Svetlana increasingly find each other 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.360
 when we danced the first time this 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.550
 so looked bye bye 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.190
 but the more we dance giselle and 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.620
 swan lake the more we are bound 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.840
 partnerships and we no longer just dance 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.870
 together but we start playing each with 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.920
 friend that's great she trusts me and i 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.890
 trust her 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.230
 and I do different things every time she 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.840
 reacts to it without thinking like me to it 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.290
 will respond she is not afraid to do something 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.200
 not that we have already learned how to catch and ira 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.830
 new reactions to the stage and so we play 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.170
 each other is very cute and svetlana 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.270
 david said the same one of 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.670
 favorite partners because it allows 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.130
 improvise and thanks to this they 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.800
 both live on stage this plot and 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.890
 they often do not understand how and why 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.620
 exactly these nuances and accents are born 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:15.080
 today with david was completely different 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.600
 gizel rather than shuffling with others 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.130
 partners are always always interested 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.460
 any new this new feelings this as 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:27.990
 like some invisible 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.910
 thread do not see my magic 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.620
 between partners sometimes today me 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.290
 it seemed that there really were some 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.730
 improvisation moments on such a good 

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.820
 improvisation is simple at this moment 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:41.340
 I felt that I should lower it with 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.200
 it does not just take it so I 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.330
 did so today at rehearsals I 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.610
 did something different but in this and 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.800
 there is 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.919
 this is real art when you 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.590
 you can improvise along the way 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:55.969
 don't do what you have already clearly memorized 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.310
 love and death 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:08:00.800
 and between them is what makes us 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:04.039
 viewers carefully consider 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.229
 a segment of life which is always between if 

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:09.020
 This gap shows Svetlana 

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:09.740
 zakharov even on the ordinary private 

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.189
 performance 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.699
 it is always more than ordinary 

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:15.699
 spectacle
