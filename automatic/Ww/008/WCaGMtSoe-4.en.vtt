back on rushing so I mean a lot of
rushing<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.889> going<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.130> come<00:02:02.310> from<00:02:02.340> just

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
rushing is going to come from just

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.270 
rushing is going to come from just
learning<00:02:03.270> routes<00:02:03.509> sonus<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.770> scenario

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
learning routes sonus in this scenario

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.309 
learning routes sonus in this scenario
the<00:02:05.609> first<00:02:06.060> route<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.479> took<00:02:06.569> is<00:02:06.929> a<00:02:06.959> really

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
the first route that I took is a really

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.400 
the first route that I took is a really
good<00:02:07.499> one<00:02:07.709> um<00:02:08.479> it's<00:02:09.479> kind<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.720> around<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> back

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
good one um it's kind of around the back

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620 
good one um it's kind of around the back
way<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.370> lot<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> people<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:12.270> lot<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
way I know a lot of people a lot of

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.330 
way I know a lot of people a lot of
people<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:13.020> I've<00:02:13.319> noticed<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.100> people

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
people I I've noticed that lot people

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.040 
people I I've noticed that lot people
don't<00:02:14.370> take<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.910> way<00:02:15.120> there's<00:02:15.540> two<00:02:15.780> paths

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
don't take that way there's two paths

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.780 
don't take that way there's two paths
you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.380> go<00:02:16.560> through<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.890> way<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.400> most

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
you can go through that way and most

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.660 
you can go through that way and most
people<00:02:17.880> cut<00:02:18.240> through<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.740> closer<00:02:19.740> path

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
people cut through the closer path

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.130 
people cut through the closer path
as<00:02:20.760> opposed<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.360> around<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.780> far<00:02:21.990> away

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
as opposed to going around a far away

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.330 
as opposed to going around a far away
but<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.319> find<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.620> gonna<00:02:22.800> run<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.980> far<00:02:23.160> aways<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
but I find I gonna run the far aways a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.750 
but I find I gonna run the far aways a
lot<00:02:23.610> more<00:02:23.849> effective<00:02:25.340> usually<00:02:26.340> catch<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.640> lot

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
lot more effective usually catch a lot

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.309 
lot more effective usually catch a lot
of<00:02:26.819> people<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.270> some<00:02:27.450> easy<00:02:27.599> kills<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
of people get some easy kills so you

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.229 
of people get some easy kills so you
know<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:29.459> way<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.760> I'm<00:02:29.819> going<00:02:29.970> right<00:02:30.120> now

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
know this way that I'm going right now

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.910 
know this way that I'm going right now
so<00:02:30.420> give<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.690> try<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:31.020> XM<00:02:31.470> around<00:02:31.680> quarry

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
so give that a try on XM around quarry

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.910 
so give that a try on XM around quarry
and<00:02:32.069> yeah<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.930> once<00:02:34.080> again<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.319> get<00:02:34.500> owned<00:02:34.680> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
think it's a really good gun it might be

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.900 
think it's a really good gun it might be
one<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.440> my<00:03:40.650> favorite<00:03:41.190> guns<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.609> no<00:03:41.760> it's

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
one of my favorite guns I think no it's

thinking but it might be my favorite gun
in<00:03:45.959> terms<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.290> SMGs<00:03:46.950> i<00:03:47.250> think<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.150> it's<00:03:48.390> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
in terms of SMGs i think it's it's I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.069 
in terms of SMGs i think it's it's I
think<00:03:48.989> none<00:03:49.380> other<00:03:49.560> really<00:03:49.890> compare<00:03:50.340> um<00:03:51.079> you

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
think none other really compare um you

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.900 
think none other really compare um you
know<00:03:52.109> I<00:03:52.440> was<00:03:52.560> using<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.829> mp5k<00:03:53.310> for<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> while

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
know I was using the mp5k for a while

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.360 
know I was using the mp5k for a while
and<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.150> like<00:03:54.359> that<00:03:54.540> gut<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.079> good<00:03:55.290> gun<00:03:55.500> but

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
and I like that gut it is a good gun but

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.509 
and I like that gut it is a good gun but
I<00:03:56.549> gotta<00:03:56.820> say<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:58.440> my<00:03:58.620> preference<00:03:59.280> I

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
I gotta say that for my preference I

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.120 
I gotta say that for my preference I
have<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.150> go<00:04:00.359> with<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> up<00:04:00.959> especially<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
have to go with the up especially the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.640 
have to go with the up especially the
silencer<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.910> think<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.660> deadly<00:04:04.079> accurate

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
silencer I think it's deadly accurate

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.150 
silencer I think it's deadly accurate
from<00:04:05.130> like<00:04:05.310> mid-range<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.120> close<00:04:06.329> range<00:04:06.660> um

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
from like mid-range the close range um

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.430 
from like mid-range the close range um
the<00:04:08.160> fire<00:04:08.430> rate<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:08.880> just<00:04:09.090> perfect<00:04:09.510> for<00:04:09.660> me<00:04:09.870> you

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
the fire rate is just perfect for me you

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.220 
the fire rate is just perfect for me you
know<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:11.730> really<00:04:11.940> kills<00:04:12.299> people<00:04:12.630> quickly<00:04:12.840> I

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
know it really kills people quickly I

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.500 
know it really kills people quickly I
think<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.220> worth<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:15.150> only<00:04:15.329> downfall

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
think it's worth it the only downfall

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.719 
think it's worth it the only downfall
that<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.229> find<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.100> bullets<00:04:17.430> really

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
that I I find is that the bullets really

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.379 
that I I find is that the bullets really
run<00:04:17.940> out<00:04:18.060> quickly<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.880> might<00:04:21.090> want<00:04:21.299> to

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
run out quickly and you might want to

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.969 
run out quickly and you might want to
use<00:04:21.479> stopping<00:04:21.870> power<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.620> be<00:04:22.800> weak

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
use stopping power that it can be weak

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.469 
use stopping power that it can be weak
at<00:04:23.190> times<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.700> mean<00:04:23.880> sometimes<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.389> think

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
at times I mean sometimes you think

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.690 
at times I mean sometimes you think
you've<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.500> know<00:04:25.620> loaded<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.190> lot<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.490> bullets

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
you've you know loaded a lot of bullets

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.180 
you've you know loaded a lot of bullets
into<00:04:26.910> somebody<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.860> they're<00:04:28.860> not<00:04:28.979> dead

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
into somebody and they're not dead

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.680 
into somebody and they're not dead
because<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.760> know<00:04:30.030> what<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.330> bullets<00:04:30.599> just

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
because you know what the bullets just

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.480 
because you know what the bullets just
aren't<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.110> strong<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:31.950> not<00:04:32.099> that<00:04:32.159> strong

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
aren't that strong it's not that strong

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.140 
aren't that strong it's not that strong
of<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.729> gun<00:04:32.880> it

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
of a gun it

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.220 
of a gun it
is<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.270> submachine<00:04:33.900> gun<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:35.420> um<00:04:36.420> so<00:04:36.510> in<00:04:37.110> this

I wouldn't say that either is really a
lot<00:04:51.690> better<00:04:51.870> than<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.110> other<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.470> just<00:04:52.800> want
