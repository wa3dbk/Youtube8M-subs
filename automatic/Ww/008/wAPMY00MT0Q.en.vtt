00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.889 
so it's Nancy today today we're in a in
a<00:00:04.110> conservation<00:00:04.859> area<00:00:05.190> in<00:00:05.400> Ontario<00:00:06.000> where

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
a conservation area in Ontario where

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.730 
a conservation area in Ontario where
there<00:00:07.109> are<00:00:07.290> pink<00:00:08.160> lady<00:00:08.370> slipper<00:00:08.730> orchids<00:00:09.740> now

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
there are pink lady slipper orchids now

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.490 
there are pink lady slipper orchids now
these<00:00:11.490> orchids<00:00:12.150> are<00:00:12.389> are<00:00:13.190> very<00:00:14.190> rare<00:00:15.500> they

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
these orchids are are very rare they

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.620 
these orchids are are very rare they
need<00:00:16.680> certain<00:00:17.100> specific<00:00:17.789> conditions<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
need certain specific conditions to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.650 
need certain specific conditions to
bloom<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.470> need<00:00:19.770> strong<00:00:20.189> sunlight<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:21.510> they

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
bloom they need strong sunlight but they

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
bloom they need strong sunlight but they
need<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:22.050> bit<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.289> shade<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.760> this

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
need a little bit of shade so in this

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.060 
need a little bit of shade so in this
conservation<00:00:24.330> area<00:00:24.930> they<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.439> removed<00:00:25.800> some

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
conservation area they have removed some

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.689 
conservation area they have removed some
of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> trees<00:00:26.689> while<00:00:27.689> leaving<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.369> order

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
of the trees while leaving some in order

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.920 
of the trees while leaving some in order
to<00:00:29.880> give<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:31.369> amount<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:35.390> variation<00:00:36.390> in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to give it that amount of variation in

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.540 
to give it that amount of variation in
the<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.340> conditions<00:00:39.649> where<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.920> Orcas

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the in the conditions where the Orcas

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.080 
the in the conditions where the Orcas
will<00:00:41.760> grow<00:00:41.969> well<00:00:42.530> now<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:44.489> Father's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
will grow well now it's it's Father's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
will grow well now it's it's Father's
Day<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.870> usually<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:47.100> orchids<00:00:47.550> bloom

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
Day now and usually these orchids bloom

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
Day now and usually these orchids bloom
at<00:00:48.090> father's<00:00:48.600> day<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.140> there's<00:00:49.410> think

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
at father's day and so there's think

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.500 
at father's day and so there's think
there's<00:00:50.629> 16,000<00:00:52.640> orchids<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.300> not

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there's 16,000 orchids in here I'm not

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
there's 16,000 orchids in here I'm not
sure<00:00:54.750> exactly<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.500> maybe<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.520> totally

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
sure exactly that maybe I'm totally

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.139 
sure exactly that maybe I'm totally
mixed<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.870> number<00:00:58.850> these<00:00:59.850> are

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
mixed up with that number these are

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.840 
mixed up with that number these are
complains<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> orchids<00:01:03.170> now<00:01:04.549> it's<00:01:05.549> very

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
complains that the orchids now it's very

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.560 
complains that the orchids now it's very
hard<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.869> them<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> grow<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:08.570> bees

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
hard to get them to grow because bees

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
hard to get them to grow because bees
usually<00:01:10.049> pollinate<00:01:10.530> things<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
usually pollinate things like this the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
usually pollinate things like this the
view<00:01:11.549> will<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:12.090> their<00:01:12.590> find<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
view will go into their find out that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.590 
view will go into their find out that
there's<00:01:14.220> no<00:01:14.400> honey<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.970> come<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.390> those

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there's no honey and come out those

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.590 
there's no honey and come out those
little<00:01:15.900> holes<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> top<00:01:17.330> because<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
little holes at the top because you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.350 
little holes at the top because you
can't<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> big<00:01:19.560> hole<00:01:19.770> he<00:01:19.890> went<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
can't get out that big hole he went in

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.010 
can't get out that big hole he went in
it<00:01:21.360> looks<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> slipper<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:27.240> takes<00:01:27.540> 16

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it looks like a slipper so it takes 16

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.319 
it looks like a slipper so it takes 16
years<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.979> these<00:01:31.100> Street<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:32.610> seed<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
years for these Street go from seed to a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.440 
years for these Street go from seed to a
flower<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.680> CH<00:01:35.310> York<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.790> only<00:01:35.939> has<00:01:36.180> one

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
flower and CH York it only has one

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.960 
flower and CH York it only has one
flower<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.470> since<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> doesn't<00:01:38.369> necessarily

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
flower and since it doesn't necessarily

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.020 
flower and since it doesn't necessarily
get<00:01:39.600> pollinated<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.710> takes<00:01:41.369> quite<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> while<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
get pollinated it takes quite a while to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
get pollinated it takes quite a while to
get<00:01:42.540> more<00:01:42.780> orchids<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.280> not

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
get more orchids you see they're not

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
get more orchids you see they're not
just<00:01:44.640> everywhere<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.610> sometimes<00:01:48.409> like<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
just everywhere so sometimes like the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.109 
just everywhere so sometimes like the
conservation<00:01:50.159> area<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:50.610> take<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> toothpick

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
conservation area will take a toothpick

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.749 
conservation area will take a toothpick
and<00:01:51.360> put<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.320> touch<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and put in there and touch it to the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.730 
and put in there and touch it to the
other<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.360> pollinate<00:01:54.869> them<00:01:55.079> because<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
other one to pollinate them because the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.139 
other one to pollinate them because the
bees<00:01:55.920> wants<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.579> figure<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.909> there's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.150 
orchids and there's green orchids those
are<00:02:26.120> much<00:02:26.269> more<00:02:26.480> common<00:02:26.750> but<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> pink<00:02:27.920> lady

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160

slipper<00:02:28.280> orchid<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.120> very<00:02:29.390> difficult<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:32.680> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
slipper orchid is very difficult to you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.650 
slipper orchid is very difficult to you
know<00:02:33.739> for<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.190> seed<00:02:34.430> itself<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:35.269> you

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
know for it to seed itself so it's you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660 
know for it to seed itself so it's you
don't<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.049> them<00:02:36.200> very<00:02:36.260> often<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.519> think

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
don't see them very often so I think

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.780 
don't see them very often so I think
this<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.150> about<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.599> largest<00:02:39.250> selection<00:02:40.250> in

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
water that's why we're up on the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.020 
water that's why we're up on the
boardwalk<00:03:11.120> here<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:12.799> keep<00:03:13.010> us<00:03:13.160> off<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.760> out

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
of the blue bumpy in the ball in the Fen

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.270 
of the blue bumpy in the ball in the Fen
to<00:03:19.760> see<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.239> will<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:21.410> trees<00:03:21.709> are<00:03:21.739> up<00:03:22.010> higher

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
to see this will the trees are up higher

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.430 
to see this will the trees are up higher
and<00:03:22.310> then<00:03:22.790> there's<00:03:23.030> dips<00:03:23.450> below<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.260> come

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
and then there's dips below and come

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.020 
and then there's dips below and come
back<00:03:24.560> up<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.950> tree<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.850> pretty

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
back up to a tree so it's pretty

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.720 
back up to a tree so it's pretty
difficult<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.660> walk<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.859> a<00:03:28.010> sin<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.549> you

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
little tubes here that they've stuck in

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.740 
little tubes here that they've stuck in
the<00:03:33.170> ground<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.650> don't<00:03:33.829> see<00:03:34.040> one<00:03:34.190> right<00:03:34.340> now

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
the ground I don't see one right now

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.750 
the ground I don't see one right now
have<00:03:35.750> little<00:03:36.049> tubes<00:03:36.319> that<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.370> look<00:03:37.549> in

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
have little tubes that they can look in

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.660 
have little tubes that they can look in
to<00:03:37.880> see<00:03:38.060> how<00:03:38.239> high<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.480> water<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:39.160> down<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.519> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
to see how high the water is down in the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.610 
to see how high the water is down in the
soil<00:03:41.500> there's<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.590> dam<00:03:42.920> up<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:44.440> beyond<00:03:45.440> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
soil there's a dam up there beyond the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.460 
soil there's a dam up there beyond the
woods<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.970> an<00:03:47.120> open<00:03:47.389> area<00:03:47.569> there's<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.930> beaver

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
woods it's an open area there's a beaver

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.740 
woods it's an open area there's a beaver
dam<00:03:48.590> up<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.160> there<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.579> so<00:03:49.730> they<00:03:49.880> regulate<00:03:50.510> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
dam up in there and so they regulate the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.259 
dam up in there and so they regulate the
level<00:03:51.109> of<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.410> beaver<00:03:51.590> dam<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:52.670> keep<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
level of the beaver dam to keep the

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.140 
level of the beaver dam to keep the
moisture<00:03:53.510> level<00:03:54.230> just<00:03:54.440> right<00:03:55.060> for<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
moisture level just right for the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.670 
moisture level just right for the
orchids<00:03:56.569> these<00:03:57.079> have<00:03:57.319> an<00:03:57.470> open<00:03:57.769> yet
