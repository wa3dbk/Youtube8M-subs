 Hello everyone, today we have December 17th 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.859

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.429

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.089
 here in salt lake city and in general I bought 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.330
 different Russian products left me to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.560
 all this 41 dollar 74 cents along with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 taxed here are three percent tax now i'm 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.400
 I will show you what I took and why it is all 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.570
 It was in general, I bought here cod liver 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.329
 In general, I must say that there is in America 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 it is very difficult to find practically well in 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.050
 America just in American stores 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.140
 no one knows about it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.480
 the internet is also quite small 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.809
 smearing can be bought but it is not there 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.829
 very large selection and long enough 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.800
 where there is 67 dollars a bank is worth this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.289
 i bought cod liver but in english 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.690
 called to ebb and she's here for food 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.690
 now would find 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.860
 I do not see but it was in my worth 4 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.860
 we have the most expensive here is whether that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.340
 strange that no november on cell scientific 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.979
 cost 55 dollars that's such a bank it's in 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.570
 Generally not expensive because 300 grams 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.060
 this jar but the saleswoman told me 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.479
 what a good pecker I see her 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 I love very much try the case of course 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.869
 wire and sprats were for $ 3 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.630
 here we look cottage cheese was good for them 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.240
 the choice of cottage cheese I took such cottage cheese it 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:50.080
 all of course here is made simply 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.050
 in Russian it is written here cottage cheese, too, he 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.600
 cost about 3 dollars basically they are 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.920
 everything in the store is 34 dollars so worth it 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.560
 took sunflower seeds 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.560
 where without them did I miss the seeds 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.539
 also 2 3 dollars worth our experience 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.030
 the seeds were washable and 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.410
 circus is also such a delicacy here 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.880

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.090

 then I found black jam 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.310
 currants because here it is very 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.220
 rarely found in this 4 dollars almost 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.840

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.320
 and they had an o'nil told me that it 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.799
 because they try to 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.750
 produce well so that in general interests not 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.640
 faced with the producers Alyonka 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.579

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.030
 also can not and therefore took two 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.569
