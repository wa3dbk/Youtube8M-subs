00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.410 
started life as an unremarkable man from
Brooklyn<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:27.520> don't<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.120> Peter

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
Brooklyn and I don't think this is Peter

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.030 
Brooklyn and I don't think this is Peter
Parker<00:02:28.690> all<00:02:29.020> right<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.290> it's<00:02:29.440> definitely<00:02:29.800> not

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
Parker all right so it's definitely not

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.340 
Parker all right so it's definitely not
it's<00:02:30.940> not<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.209> one<00:02:32.050> where<00:02:32.380> he<00:02:33.190> had<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
it's not the one where he had the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.170 
it's not the one where he had the
communication<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.590> know<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.520> mutation

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
communication you know the mutation

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.840 
communication you know the mutation
where<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.740> don't<00:02:38.740> know<00:02:38.980> what<00:02:39.160> what<00:02:39.430> happened<00:02:39.820> I

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
where I don't know what what happened I

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.550 
where I don't know what what happened I
don't<00:02:39.970> quite<00:02:40.420> remember<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.990> think<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.440> was

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
don't quite remember I think it was

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.980 
don't quite remember I think it was
because<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:42.370> don't<00:02:43.240> know<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.450> randomly

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
because I don't know it just randomly

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.050 
because I don't know it just randomly
happened<00:02:44.080> if<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.680> remember<00:02:45.130> from<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.430> show<00:02:45.670> he

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
happened if I remember from the show he

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.480 
happened if I remember from the show he
started<00:02:46.420> having<00:02:46.600> these<00:02:46.870> things<00:02:47.530> cramps<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
started having these things cramps and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.430 
started having these things cramps and
then<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.940> arm<00:02:49.270> started<00:02:49.720> coming<00:02:49.990> out<00:02:50.080> first

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
then this arm started coming out first

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.120 
then this arm started coming out first
it<00:02:50.650> was<00:02:50.770> like<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:52.120> extra<00:02:52.600> arms<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.320> then<00:02:53.740> he

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
it was like just extra arms and then he

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.830 
it was like just extra arms and then he
started<00:02:54.459> turning<00:02:54.760> into<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.180> crazy<00:02:55.540> spider

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
started turning into this crazy spider

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.810 
started turning into this crazy spider
stuff<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:56.769> don't<00:02:57.040> think<00:02:57.160> this<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.640> one

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
stuff but I don't think this is the one

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.600 
stuff but I don't think this is the one
that<00:02:58.269> we're<00:02:58.480> talking<00:02:58.690> about<00:02:58.989> definitely<00:02:59.860> not

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
that we're talking about definitely not

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.750 
that we're talking about definitely not
probably<00:03:01.800> somebody<00:03:02.800> else<00:03:02.860> but<00:03:03.400> there<00:03:03.580> it<00:03:03.670> is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
probably somebody else but there it is

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.000 
probably somebody else but there it is
actually<00:03:04.209> yeah<00:03:04.360> definitely<00:03:05.110> not<00:03:05.290> there's<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
actually yeah definitely not there's the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.970 
actually yeah definitely not there's the
X<00:03:06.220> on<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.670> back<00:03:06.940> those<00:03:07.840> are<00:03:08.019> not<00:03:08.170> arms<00:03:08.680> alright

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
X on the back those are not arms alright

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.460 
X on the back those are not arms alright
so<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.160> was<00:03:09.340> wrong<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.019> what<00:03:11.200> one

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
so I was wrong this is this is what one

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.030 
so I was wrong this is this is what one
was<00:03:11.680> us<00:03:12.269> midnight<00:03:13.269> sons<00:03:13.720> unlimited<00:03:14.620> number

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
was us midnight sons unlimited number

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.500 
was us midnight sons unlimited number
three<00:03:15.400> first<00:03:15.640> appearance

alright so definitely not the one I was
talking<00:03:19.090> about<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.269> guess<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.709> spider

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040
