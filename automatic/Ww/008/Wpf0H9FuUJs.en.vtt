to<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.370> point<00:00:40.700> of<00:00:40.850> comedic<00:00:41.719> levels<00:00:42.140> of

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
to the to the point of comedic levels of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.510 
to the to the point of comedic levels of
violence<00:00:42.440> pretty<00:00:42.829> much<00:00:43.010> ah<00:00:44.290> but<00:00:45.290> but

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
violence pretty much ah but but

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.420 
violence pretty much ah but but
relatively<00:00:46.520> bare-bones<00:00:48.160> you've<00:00:49.160> got

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
relatively bare-bones you've got

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.850 
relatively bare-bones you've got
basically<00:00:50.059> three<00:00:50.600> different<00:00:50.629> weapons

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.580 

but<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:55.180> sequel<00:00:55.660> builds<00:00:56.140> on<00:00:56.290> what<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
but the the sequel builds on what the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.340 
but the the sequel builds on what the
first<00:00:56.740> one<00:00:56.980> did<00:00:57.190> with<00:00:58.140> somewhat<00:00:59.140> tighter

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
first one did with somewhat tighter

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.780 
first one did with somewhat tighter
controls<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:02.590> overall<00:01:02.920> I'd<00:01:03.220> say<00:01:03.250> the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
controls I think overall I'd say the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.760 
controls I think overall I'd say the
that<00:01:04.449> shank<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.960> sort<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.350> feels<00:01:05.530> like<00:01:05.710> a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
that shank to sort of feels like a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.010 
that shank to sort of feels like a
remastered<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.790> polished<00:01:07.270> version<00:01:07.570> of<00:01:07.900> the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
remastered and polished version of the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.840 
remastered and polished version of the
first<00:01:08.230> shank<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:09.160> completely<00:01:09.580> different

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
first shank is a completely different

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.190 
first shank is a completely different
story<00:01:09.940> in<00:01:10.270> different<00:01:10.540> levels<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:10.870> everything

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
story in different levels and everything

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.410 
story in different levels and everything
but<00:01:11.380> just<00:01:12.130> mechanically<00:01:12.700> speaking<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.210> feels

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
but just mechanically speaking it feels

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.900 
but just mechanically speaking it feels
like<00:01:13.660> they<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:15.040> went<00:01:15.370> in<00:01:15.460> there<00:01:15.610> with<00:01:15.850> a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
like they just went in there with a

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.190 
like they just went in there with a
little<00:01:16.180> socket<00:01:16.390> wrench<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:16.870> kind<00:01:17.110> of

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
little socket wrench and kind of

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.840 
little socket wrench and kind of
tightened<00:01:17.530> everything<00:01:17.650> up<00:01:18.040> in<00:01:18.550> every<00:01:18.820> aspect

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
tightened everything up in every aspect

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.640 
tightened everything up in every aspect
of<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.360> game<00:01:19.390> that's<00:01:20.350> nice<00:01:20.530> um<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:22.080> am<00:01:23.080> my

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
of the game that's nice um I am my

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.530 
of the game that's nice um I am my
complaint<00:01:24.040> with<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.670> first<00:01:25.090> shank<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.450> the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
complaint with the first shank and the

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.270 
complaint with the first shank and the
reason<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.810> didn't<00:01:26.080> finish<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.619> game<00:01:26.770> was<00:01:27.040> that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
reason I didn't finish the game was that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.550 
reason I didn't finish the game was that
I<00:01:27.430> felt<00:01:27.750> doctor<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:29.050> know<00:01:29.140> maybe<00:01:29.290> two<00:01:29.530> hours

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
I felt doctor you know maybe two hours

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.290 
I felt doctor you know maybe two hours
of<00:01:29.890> their<00:01:30.040> three<00:01:30.280> hours<00:01:30.550> I<00:01:30.580> felt<00:01:30.940> like<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.150> had

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
of their three hours I felt like I had

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.930 
of their three hours I felt like I had
sort<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.509> done<00:01:31.720> all<00:01:31.750> there<00:01:32.140> was<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.350> do<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.700> kept

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
sort of done all there was to do it kept

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.240 
sort of done all there was to do it kept
sending<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.440> more<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.830> same<00:01:35.979> types

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
sending more and more of the same types

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.830 
sending more and more of the same types
of<00:01:36.369> enemies<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.820> me<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:37.030> had<00:01:37.420> captured<00:01:37.600> of

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
of enemies to me I had captured of

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.210 
of enemies to me I had captured of
giving<00:01:38.050> me<00:01:38.140> access<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.680> same<00:01:38.860> types<00:01:39.130> of

giving me access to the same types of

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.400 
giving me access to the same types of
weapons<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:40.390> was<00:01:40.509> essentially<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:40.990> same<00:01:41.110> kind

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
weapons it was essentially the same kind

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.930 
weapons it was essentially the same kind
of<00:01:41.530> game<00:01:41.710> play<00:01:41.950> over<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.220> over<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:42.580> I<00:01:42.670> really

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
of game play over and over and I really

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.480 
of game play over and over and I really
didn't<00:01:43.899> feel<00:01:44.080> like<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.259> sort<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.560> clicked<00:01:45.340> with

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
didn't feel like it sort of clicked with

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.770 
didn't feel like it sort of clicked with
me<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.820> make<00:01:45.940> me<00:01:46.090> want<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.300> play<00:01:46.420> through<00:01:46.630> to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
me and make me want to play through to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.540 
me and make me want to play through to
the<00:01:46.869> end<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.229> wasn't<00:01:47.410> enticing<00:01:48.100> enough<00:01:48.190> just

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
the end it wasn't enticing enough just

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.240 
the end it wasn't enticing enough just
the<00:01:48.670> gameplay<00:01:49.030> no<00:01:49.810> no<00:01:50.140> that's<00:01:50.770> actually<00:01:51.009> a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
the gameplay no no that's actually a

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.280 
the gameplay no no that's actually a
fairly<00:01:51.640> accurate<00:01:52.030> assessment<00:01:52.869> but<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.140> good

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
fairly accurate assessment but the good

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.719 
fairly accurate assessment but the good
news<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:53.860> were<00:01:53.979> probably<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.369> half<00:01:54.550> way

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
news is you were probably a half way

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.990 
news is you were probably a half way
through<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.000> game<00:01:55.210> at<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.479> point<00:01:56.640> okay<00:01:57.640> so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
through the game at that point okay so

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.490 
through the game at that point okay so
that's<00:01:58.210> kind<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.690> little<00:01:58.930> brief<00:01:59.110> um<00:01:59.290> yeah<00:01:59.470> I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
that's kind of a little brief um yeah I
