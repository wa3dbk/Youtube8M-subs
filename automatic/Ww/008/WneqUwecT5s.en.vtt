shorter ones like that I use when you're
fixing<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.340> single<00:00:31.939> board<00:00:32.449> to<00:00:32.930> or<00:00:33.140> position<00:00:33.739> the

longer ones are used when you are over
boarding<00:00:37.040> if<00:00:37.879> you<00:00:38.030> look<00:00:38.150> at<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.300> actual

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
boarding if you look at the actual

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.689 
boarding if you look at the actual
screws<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.320> compare<00:00:39.920> them<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.250> normal

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
screws and compare them to a normal

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.579 
screws and compare them to a normal
screw<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.510> same<00:00:41.839> line<00:00:42.050> if<00:00:42.199> you'll<00:00:42.320> notice

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
screw of the same line if you'll notice

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.530 
screw of the same line if you'll notice
that<00:00:42.680> they<00:00:42.800> are<00:00:42.949> very<00:00:43.220> thin<00:00:43.519> that<00:00:44.300> doesn't

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
that they are very thin that doesn't

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.149 
that they are very thin that doesn't
mean<00:00:44.629> they<00:00:44.750> are<00:00:44.870> weak<00:00:45.080> these<00:00:45.470> screws<00:00:45.799> are<00:00:46.010> in

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
mean they are weak these screws are in

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.250 
mean they are weak these screws are in
fact<00:00:46.370> very<00:00:46.729> strong<00:00:47.150> I've<00:00:47.900> actually<00:00:48.019> got<00:00:48.229> one

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
fact very strong I've actually got one

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.320 
fact very strong I've actually got one
of<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.500> longer<00:00:48.769> ones<00:00:48.890> there<00:00:49.159> for<00:00:49.190> boiling<00:00:49.879> and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
of the longer ones there for boiling and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.240 
of the longer ones there for boiling and
you<00:00:50.360> can<00:00:50.510> see<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.619> black<00:00:51.830> one<00:00:52.010> is

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
you can see that the black one is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.460 
you can see that the black one is
considerably<00:00:52.820> thinner<00:00:53.089> than<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.900> normal

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
considerably thinner than the normal

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.680 
considerably thinner than the normal
will<00:00:54.769> screw<00:00:55.040> but<00:00:55.909> these<00:00:56.239> are<00:00:56.420> still

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
will screw but these are still

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.200 
will screw but these are still
incredibly<00:00:57.290> strong<00:00:57.940> when<00:00:58.940> you're<00:00:59.030> driving

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
incredibly strong when you're driving

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.939 
incredibly strong when you're driving
the<00:00:59.420> screws<00:00:59.659> in<00:00:59.869> you<00:01:00.110> don't<00:01:00.320> want<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.559> go<00:01:00.680> too

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
the screws in you don't want to go too

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.829 
the screws in you don't want to go too
far<00:01:01.220> through<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.909> plasterboard<00:01:02.239> if<00:01:02.570> else<00:01:02.750> you

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
far through the plasterboard if else you

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:09.240 
far through the plasterboard if else you
were<00:01:02.930> weak<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.290> it<00:01:07.299> so<00:01:08.299> like<00:01:08.479> it's<00:01:08.630> just<00:01:08.750> fine

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
were weak in it so like it's just fine

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.359 
were weak in it so like it's just fine
if<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.430> got<00:01:10.850> two<00:01:11.180> firings<00:01:11.799> lime<00:01:12.799> saw<00:01:13.070> you've

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
if you got two firings lime saw you've

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.590 
if you got two firings lime saw you've
actually<00:01:13.490> pulled<00:01:13.820> up<00:01:13.970> through<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.270> plaster

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
actually pulled up through the plaster

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.660 
actually pulled up through the plaster
boy<00:01:14.750> does<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:15.140> for<00:01:15.320> me<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:15.619> weaker<00:01:16.040> so

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
boy does that for me and it weaker so

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.249 
boy does that for me and it weaker so
you<00:01:16.820> do<00:01:16.939> have<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.119> be<00:01:17.240> aware<00:01:17.270> when<00:01:17.810> you're

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
you do have to be aware when you're

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.840 
you do have to be aware when you're
driving<00:01:18.469> these<00:01:18.740> screws<00:01:19.039> in<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.579> do<00:01:19.700> just

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
driving these screws in that you do just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.520 
driving these screws in that you do just
get<00:01:20.030> them<00:01:20.179> so<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.780> they<00:01:20.869> are<00:01:20.990> just<00:01:21.170> below<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
get them so that they are just below the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.609 
get them so that they are just below the
surface<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.399> paper<00:01:22.929> often<00:01:23.929> in<00:01:24.320> the

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
surface of the paper often in the

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.130 
surface of the paper often in the
furbish<00:01:25.009> moment<00:01:25.219> work<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:26.119> will<00:01:26.270> avoid<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
furbish moment work you will avoid the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.749 
furbish moment work you will avoid the
existing<00:01:27.619> ceiling<00:01:27.859> so<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.460> means<00:01:28.640> that

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
existing ceiling so that means that

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.459 
existing ceiling so that means that
you've<00:01:28.880> got<00:01:28.909> one<00:01:29.359> sheet<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.600> plus<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.020> void<00:01:30.170> on

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
you've got one sheet of plus the void on

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.279 
you've got one sheet of plus the void on
top<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.009> existing<00:01:31.210> ceiling<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.109> if<00:01:33.200> you

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
top of the existing ceiling so if you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.380 
top of the existing ceiling so if you
use<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:33.469> normal<00:01:33.890> sized<00:01:34.070> Cruiser<00:01:34.609> there<00:01:35.119> are<00:01:35.240> not

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
use a normal sized Cruiser there are not

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.620 
use a normal sized Cruiser there are not
long<00:01:35.570> enough<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.590> would<00:01:36.740> be<00:01:36.920> very<00:01:37.249> weak<00:01:37.630> that

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
long enough that would be very weak that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.870 
long enough that would be very weak that
is<00:01:38.810> where<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.170> extended<00:01:39.859> length<00:01:40.039> screws<00:01:40.670> come

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
is where the extended length screws come

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.059 
is where the extended length screws come
in<00:01:41.030> they<00:01:41.840> will<00:01:41.899> go<00:01:42.140> straight<00:01:42.350> through<00:01:42.619> both

in they will go straight through both

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.010 
in they will go straight through both
pieces<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.490> plaster<00:01:43.909> board<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.329> fix<00:01:44.659> firmly
