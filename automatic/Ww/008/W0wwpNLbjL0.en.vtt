00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.360
 the people love houses with 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.610
 history and stylish living his 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.580
 Dreaming is often difficult 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.100
 We give you tips in our series 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.039
 for a nicer home for 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.189
 individual building and living with 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.189
 style 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
 we do not all have the problem that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.900
 just the entrance area in a house 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.910
 the smallest room is the largest 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 set needs to 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 instead of having to deal with everything 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.570
 we discovered a small niche 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.460
 Here you can do your entire everyday life 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 wardrobe stash pockets coats 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.220
 jackets and the touran all over 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.510
 we have that with a classic one 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.000
 Zimmer closed 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.790
 a closet would make the room smaller 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.590
 make a door of a closet 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.769
 Smoke became more restless 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.239
 so does the whole attractive and she 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.220
 Can the size of this room is 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.150
 Of course, the size of your family 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.290
 to adjust 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.490
 and now we go to the second example 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.440
 Admittedly, the room at the top of the room 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659
 Entrance area must already be considered 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.370
 in the floorplans find something but find 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.320
 is present in every house and never 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.200
 that is the space under the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.540
 stairs we have this room with 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.080
 Swedish panels disguise this 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.430
 matching the steps of the stairs and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.859
 Of course we have one again 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 Classic room door used around it 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.090
 close 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.659
 behind it hides enough 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.939
 storage space 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.369
 we already used it as 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.000
 wardrobe as a storage room or on 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.000
 pantry 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.230
 these were two suggestions for you 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.110
 living with style 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.770
 I say thanks for seeing and thank you 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.770
 Until next time
