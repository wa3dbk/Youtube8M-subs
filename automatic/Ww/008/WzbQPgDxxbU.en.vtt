00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.969
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.379
 well have especially today for 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.020
 realize these three inspirational jewels 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.849
 military is so here it is a whole 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.410
 new concept of paris if I hope that 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.410
 you will like it and so 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.930
 yeah 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.420
 so for the first measure that is 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.970
 so a necklace as you saw it there 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.860
 would have had a place in 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.840
 the white polymer clay without forgetting 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.850
 to make a hole with a client or 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.040
 any object with one end between 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.830
 them in the convoy is what I mean 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.650
 and after that we can cook so this little 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.970
 forms half an hour at 110 degrees after 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.559
 cooking and once the form has 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.230
 well chilled you will tell me put 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.750
 warm water or at room temperature 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.000
 so much that's a drink and then with 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.710
 polish we will drop a drop 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.350
 so that's the picture is much more 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.210
 explicit i think so that's exactly 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.090
 as if you wanted to make a mark the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.040
 night nayla I think and once that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.140
 you're happy and 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.580
 come dive our form 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.750
 so I advise you to use 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.880
 gloves because send attaches 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.759
 a lot helped and that this sec 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.009
 you can decorate the edge with some 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.780
 slope following brass tea 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.759
 for gray in triangle so that's it 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.869
 very simple and once everything is dry 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.060
 on my pendant 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.580
 we will be able to assemblies so everything 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.259
 simply by passing a ring in the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.000
 hole that we made beforehand on the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.330
 tale tiff and hangs up at night 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.330
 one leg 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 then we will take nylon thread 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 is twice the size of your 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.220
 wrist pass a ring in the middle and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.050
 folded the wire at the turn of France still 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.640
 once his double then that in pictures 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.310
 and finally in his two sons you go 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:20.970
 place your beads up to the length 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:22.140
 wish he can have you placed 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.390
 enough pearls we will come 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.500
 put a ring on the other side 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.970
 and place the thread creating a loop 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.920
 around this ring by ironing the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.180
 film in the pearls so here it is 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.650
 always it's easier in pictures 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.800
 but do not worry it's very 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.800
 easy 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.340
 and finally to finish we will come and 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.560
 so we can take enough 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.720
 of movies and you surround him around your 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.700
 two fingers can apply everything in 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.769
 two passes and a lamb and finally 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.440
 close by creating a loop with 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.230
 still a kids piece and to finish 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.680
 come cut the ends so with 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.680
 a pair of scissors 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.409
 then you just have to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.940
 hang on hell month and confuses him to 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.940
 your bracelet for her to be soul 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 1 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.670
 then for the last brewer will have 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.170
 once again used bad fiber 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.730
 so as you see at home 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.280
 make small stone species 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.360
 it not at all clear would never again 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.250
 can be completely random it's 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.540
 a big name of the prettiest but do not forget 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.790
 not before the crisis in making a hole 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.230
 with a moment and then after we can 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.230
 cook more remains at 112 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.670
 and finally after cooking you go 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.260
 come and take a little stone again and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.520
 to paint them simply logistics 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.709
 from Libya who did not hesitate to do 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.200
 mixtures with several colors 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.300
 to make it even more beautiful and 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.190
 all and that is we are going to stack up some 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.350
 stones simply on a job 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.459
 she could in and close this law in 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.760
 creating a loop to be able to 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.760
 hang 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.009
 and finally will add a sean back from 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.539
 each side of the bracelet 110 you from the 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.539
 make me and it will be served 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.370

 favorite do not hesitate to if we wanted 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.070
 see the original photos between a

 human the one from which I am inspired and 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.860
 will get in dam taxes and I find 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.860
 very quickly this job
