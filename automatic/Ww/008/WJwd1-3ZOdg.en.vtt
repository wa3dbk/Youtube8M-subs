nutshell I have infinite super breaker

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.679 
nutshell I have infinite super breaker
and<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:19.439> will<00:00:19.590> never<00:00:19.830> end<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.570> a

some dirt and then after that I
activated<00:00:43.410> super<00:00:43.950> breaker<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:44.700> broke

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
activated super breaker and then broke

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.400 
activated super breaker and then broke
open<00:00:45.329> some<00:00:45.750> diamonds<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.960> after<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.260> just

got<00:00:49.710> infinite<00:00:50.129> super<00:00:50.520> breaker<00:00:50.730> forever<00:00:52.100> feel

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
got infinite super breaker forever feel

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this a major glitch of course it only

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.530 
this a major glitch of course it only
activates<00:01:37.860> super<00:01:38.460> breaker<00:01:38.670> forever<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
activates super breaker forever on the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.620 
activates super breaker forever on the
pic<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.700> still<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.509> go

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
her how it happened how to trigger it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.310 
her how it happened how to trigger it
but<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.610> repeat<00:02:26.970> exactly<00:02:27.180> what<00:02:27.900> happened<00:02:28.290> to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
but to repeat exactly what happened to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.840 
but to repeat exactly what happened to
me<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:31.020> know<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.440> was<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:32.130> down<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.730> ravine

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
me you know I was going down in a ravine

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.710 
me you know I was going down in a ravine
I<00:02:33.440> dug<00:02:34.440> up<00:02:34.620> some<00:02:34.860> dirt<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:36.150> directly

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
I dug up some dirt and then directly

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.450 
I dug up some dirt and then directly
after<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.350> switched<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.070> my<00:02:38.220> pickaxe

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
after that I switched to my pickaxe

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.130 
after that I switched to my pickaxe
because<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.300> saw<00:02:39.600> diamond<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:41.960> placed<00:02:42.960> some

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
because I saw diamond I placed some

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.350 
because I saw diamond I placed some
water<00:02:43.410> buckets<00:02:43.830> down<00:02:44.070> over<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.640> lava<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.210> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
water buckets down over the lava in the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.000 
water buckets down over the lava in the
ravine<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.760> then<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:48.180> um<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.860> know<00:02:49.980> I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
ravine and then I um you know I

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.520 
ravine and then I um you know I
activated<00:02:50.640> super<00:02:50.970> breaker<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.540> broke<00:02:52.320> open

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
activated super breaker and broke open

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.430 
activated super breaker and broke open
some<00:02:52.920> diamond<00:02:53.280> door<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.810> ever<00:02:54.810> since<00:02:55.170> then

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
some diamond door and ever since then

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.240 
some diamond door and ever since then
I've<00:02:55.740> had<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.310> infinite<00:02:56.880> super<00:02:57.150> breaker<00:02:57.390> and

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
I've had this infinite super breaker and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.050 
I've had this infinite super breaker and
I've<00:02:59.250> tried<00:02:59.580> disconnecting<00:03:01.730> they've<00:03:02.730> tried

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
I've tried disconnecting they've tried

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.990 
I've tried disconnecting they've tried
kicking<00:03:03.570> me<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:05.990> even<00:03:06.990> if<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.800> did<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.490> did

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
kicking me and even if I did what I did

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.640 
kicking me and even if I did what I did
repaired<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> pickaxe<00:03:10.050> lost<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
repaired the pickaxe lost the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.910 
repaired the pickaxe lost the
enchantment<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:12.090> still<00:03:12.660> kept<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.110> made<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> fresh

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
enchantment I still kept it made a fresh

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.010 
enchantment I still kept it made a fresh
pickaxe<00:03:14.340> tried<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.760> with<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.060> still<00:03:15.780> kept

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
pickaxe tried it with that still kept

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.000 
pickaxe tried it with that still kept
the<00:03:16.110> infinite<00:03:16.440> super<00:03:16.710> breaker<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.959> before

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
the infinite super breaker and before

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.550 
the infinite super breaker and before
the<00:03:20.010> server<00:03:20.670> owner<00:03:21.000> when<00:03:21.270> he<00:03:21.420> was<00:03:21.570> on<00:03:21.750> he<00:03:22.410> was

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
the server owner when he was on he was

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.780 
the server owner when he was on he was
trying<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.920> figure<00:03:23.100> out<00:03:23.190> how<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.370> get<00:03:23.550> rid<00:03:23.700> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
trying to figure out how to get rid of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.420 
trying to figure out how to get rid of
it<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.440> discovered<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.739> only<00:03:25.950> way

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it and we discovered that the only way

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.880 
it and we discovered that the only way
to<00:03:26.489> get<00:03:26.700> rid<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.300> glitch<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.709> actually

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
to get rid of this glitch is to actually

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.430 
to get rid of this glitch is to actually
reboot<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.940> server<00:03:30.180> entirely<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:32.150> therefore

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
reboot the server entirely and therefore

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.660 
reboot the server entirely and therefore
restart<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.820> MC<00:03:35.820> MMO<00:03:36.180> plugin<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:38.010> guess

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
restart the MC MMO plugin so I guess

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.060 
restart the MC MMO plugin so I guess
there's<00:03:39.209> some<00:03:39.570> major<00:03:39.870> glitch<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.590> should<00:03:40.920> be

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
there's some major glitch that should be

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.060 
there's some major glitch that should be
looked<00:03:41.310> into<00:03:41.660> because<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:43.140> know<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:44.010> said

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
looked into because you know like I said

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.070 
looked into because you know like I said
already<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.970> should<00:03:45.300> not<00:03:45.600> be<00:03:45.840> possible

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
already this should not be possible

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.610 
already this should not be possible
under<00:03:46.620> any<00:03:46.940> circumstances<00:03:48.260> because<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
under any circumstances because this

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.590 
under any circumstances because this
makes<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.130> way<00:03:50.310> too<00:03:50.370> easy<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:51.420> do

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
makes it way too easy to just do

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.720 
makes it way too easy to just do
everything<00:03:54.140> yep<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:55.709> ho<00:03:55.920> that's<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.489> master

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
everything yep so ho that's the master

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.860 
everything yep so ho that's the master
glitch<00:03:57.660> reporting<00:03:58.290> like<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.470> pro<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.840> yeah<00:04:00.840> I

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
glitch reporting like a pro and yeah I

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.900 
glitch reporting like a pro and yeah I
mean<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.350> could<00:04:01.890> have<00:04:02.040> kept<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.730> myself

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
mean I could have kept this to myself

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
mean I could have kept this to myself
but<00:04:03.800> I'd<00:04:04.800> rather<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.700> get<00:04:05.970> patched<00:04:06.209> because

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
but I'd rather this get patched because

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.229 
but I'd rather this get patched because
I<00:04:07.050> don't<00:04:07.230> want<00:04:07.410> other<00:04:07.560> people<00:04:07.650> knowing<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.400> no

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
I don't want other people knowing but no

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.330 
I don't want other people knowing but no
no<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:09.989> don't<00:04:10.260> really<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.620> any<00:04:10.800> reason<00:04:11.070> I'm

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
no I don't really have any reason I'm

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.070 
no I don't really have any reason I'm
just<00:04:11.550> trying<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:11.970> be<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.090> good<00:04:12.300> person<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.840> I

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
just trying to be a good person that I

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.860 
just trying to be a good person that I
guess<00:04:13.640> feel<00:04:14.640> kind<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:14.970> bad<00:04:15.120> because<00:04:15.480> someone

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
guess feel kind of bad because someone

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.390 
guess feel kind of bad because someone
else<00:04:15.900> probably<00:04:16.320> discovered<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.950> first<00:04:17.160> and

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
else probably discovered it first and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.490 
else probably discovered it first and
kept<00:04:17.580> their<00:04:17.730> mouth<00:04:17.880> shut

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500
