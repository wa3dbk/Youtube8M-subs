eyes<00:00:48.300> I've<00:00:48.809> seen<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.350> work<00:00:49.500> pretty<00:00:49.710> well

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
eyes I've seen they work pretty well

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
eyes I've seen they work pretty well
just<00:00:50.190> make<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> arc<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.940> couple<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.449> eyebrows

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
just make a arc and a couple of eyebrows

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.000 
just make a arc and a couple of eyebrows
or<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.710> couple<00:00:55.949> eyelashes<00:00:57.590> match<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
or a couple eyelashes match it on the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
or a couple eyelashes match it on the
other<00:00:59.160> side<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.620> make<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:04.250> little<00:01:05.250> circle<00:01:06.229> like

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
other side and make a little circle like

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.429 
other side and make a little circle like
that<00:01:07.500> nose<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> suggestion<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.110> probably

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that nose just a suggestion is probably

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.359 
that nose just a suggestion is probably
good<00:01:10.710> enough<00:01:11.270> because<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.290> girls<00:01:14.010> don't

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
good enough because you know girls don't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.200 
good enough because you know girls don't
like<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.180> big<00:01:15.420> noses<00:01:15.740> okay

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
like to think they have big noses okay

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.840 
like to think they have big noses okay
then<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.600> simple

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.030 

miles<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.120> fill<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.680> basically<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.860> can

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
miles and fill it in basically you can

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.420 
miles and fill it in basically you can
also<00:01:27.190> do<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:31.410> heart<00:01:32.410> shape<00:01:32.680> mouth<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.250> want

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.370 
also do a heart shape mouth if you want
to<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:33.820> that's<00:01:33.970> there's<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.230> can

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
to so that's there's that you can

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380 
to so that's there's that you can
outline<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.950> with<00:01:36.160> black<00:01:36.820> or<00:01:37.060> whatever<00:01:37.300> you
