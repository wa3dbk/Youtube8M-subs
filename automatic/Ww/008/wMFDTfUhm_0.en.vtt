00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
eight and a half by eleven divider that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.109 
eight and a half by eleven divider that
I've<00:01:08.490> cut<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.330> turned<00:01:09.960> sideways<00:01:11.119> so

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
I've cut down and turned sideways so

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
I've cut down and turned sideways so
that<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> tabs<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> top<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:14.400> other

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that the tabs on the top my all my other

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.969 
that the tabs on the top my all my other
tabs<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.360> down<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> side<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.830> I'd<00:01:16.920> like

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
tabs are going down the side so I'd like

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.179 
tabs are going down the side so I'd like
having<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> top<00:01:17.580> tabs<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.060> also<00:01:18.570> find<00:01:19.159> now<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
having the top tabs I also find now I

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
having the top tabs I also find now I
tried<00:01:20.580> zooming<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.000> before<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.689> ended<00:01:21.869> up

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
tried zooming in before and I ended up

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.210 
tried zooming in before and I ended up
shutting<00:01:22.110> off<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> video<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.770> let's<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.130> try

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
shutting off the video so let's just try

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.100 
shutting off the video so let's just try
doing<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:24.869> notice<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
doing it this way you notice that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.929 
doing it this way you notice that
they're<00:01:25.290> round<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> top<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.790> that's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
they're round at the top I think that's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.249 
they're round at the top I think that's
helpful<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.630> you'll<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.110> there's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
helpful because you'll know if there's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.850 
helpful because you'll know if there's
not<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> lot<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> space<00:01:30.170> between<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.290> tabs<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
not a lot of space between my tabs and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.960 
not a lot of space between my tabs and
the<00:01:32.009> zipper<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> fact<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the zipper and I think the fact that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.340 
the zipper and I think the fact that
they're<00:01:33.180> round<00:01:33.450> keeps<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.200> getting

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
they're round keeps them from getting

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.830 
they're round keeps them from getting
caught<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.909> add<00:01:36.060> big<00:01:36.390> square

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
caught I think if they add big square

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
caught I think if they add big square
tabs<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.560> might<00:01:37.590> catch<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
tabs up here they might catch on the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
tabs up here they might catch on the
edges<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.570> anyway<00:01:39.780> love<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
edges a bit more but anyway love the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.090 
edges a bit more but anyway love the
love<00:01:40.740> lovelies<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:43.100> almost

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
love lovelies there are they are almost

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.950 
love lovelies there are they are almost
have<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> frost<00:01:44.700> look<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:45.840> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
have a frost look but as you can see you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
have a frost look but as you can see you
can<00:01:45.990> totally<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.979> them<00:01:47.159> which<00:01:47.790> was

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
can totally see through them which was

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
can totally see through them which was
crucial<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> want<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> use<00:01:49.740> before

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
crucial for what I want to use before

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.830 
crucial for what I want to use before
they<00:01:50.189> had<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:51.020> see-through<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.229> also<00:01:53.840> rarely

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
they had to be see-through I also rarely

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
they had to be see-through I also rarely
and<00:01:55.619> only<00:01:56.240> temporarily<00:01:57.590> would<00:01:58.790> stick

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
and only temporarily would stick

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.450 
and only temporarily would stick
anything<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:01.280> part<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
anything on them because part of the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
anything on them because part of the
whole<00:02:03.259> purpose<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.009> are

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
whole purpose of them is that they are

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580 
whole purpose of them is that they are
see-through<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> thicker

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
see-through so this one is a thicker

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
see-through so this one is a thicker
plastic<00:02:07.950> than<00:02:08.429> my<00:02:08.670> actual<00:02:08.849> dividers<00:02:09.720> these

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
plastic than my actual dividers these

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.660 
plastic than my actual dividers these
ones<00:02:10.319> were<00:02:10.379> also<00:02:10.709> made<00:02:10.830> from<00:02:11.069> see-through

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
ones were also made from see-through

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.320 
ones were also made from see-through
plastic<00:02:11.790> dividers<00:02:12.390> but<00:02:12.569> much<00:02:13.140> much<00:02:13.410> than

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
plastic dividers but much much than

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.100 
plastic dividers but much much than
these<00:02:15.330> ones<00:02:15.450> are<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.630> bit<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.900> substantial

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
these ones are a bit more substantial

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
these ones are a bit more substantial
which<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.710> great<00:02:17.870> because<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.680> these<00:02:20.070> are

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
which is great because they these are

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.890 
which is great because they these are
designed<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> move<00:02:20.910> around<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.300> lot<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.630> think

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
designed to move around a lot I think

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.180 
designed to move around a lot I think
that<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> fact<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.620> they're<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.010> bit

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that the fact that they're a little bit

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.520 
that the fact that they're a little bit
thicker<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:24.570> just<00:02:24.840> helps<00:02:24.930> them<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.230> hold<00:02:25.350> up<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
thicker it just helps them to hold up a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.810 
thicker it just helps them to hold up a
little<00:02:25.740> better<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.010> also<00:02:26.190> makes<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.430> easier<00:02:26.550> to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
little better it also makes it easier to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.700 
little better it also makes it easier to
flip<00:02:27.120> anyway<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:28.200> you're<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> do

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
flip anyway if you're going to do

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.870 
flip anyway if you're going to do
something<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.340> would<00:02:29.550> recommend

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
something this I would recommend

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.960 
something this I would recommend
something<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.660> little<00:02:30.810> bit<00:02:30.990> heavier<00:02:31.310> okay<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.940> i

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
something a little bit heavier okay so i

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.250 
something a little bit heavier okay so i
have<00:02:33.030> three<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.510> them<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.900> you'll<00:02:34.080> notice

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
have three of them and you'll notice

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.160 
have three of them and you'll notice
again<00:02:34.860> let<00:02:35.100> me<00:02:35.160> bring<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:36.300> my<00:02:36.420> backwards<00:02:36.930> with

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
again let me bring do my backwards with

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.830 
again let me bring do my backwards with
my<00:02:37.260> reverse<00:02:37.650> zooming<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:39.420> when<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.570> made

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
my reverse zooming here that when I made

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.300 
my reverse zooming here that when I made
them<00:02:40.050> let's<00:02:40.470> see<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.740> can<00:02:40.770> see<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.160> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
them let's see if you can see here I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.770 
them let's see if you can see here I
just<00:02:41.640> sort<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.390> over<00:02:43.190> offset<00:02:44.540> someone<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.570> was

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
just sort of over offset someone I was

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.430 
just sort of over offset someone I was
setting<00:02:45.990> up<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.530> i<00:02:46.560> can<00:02:46.650> quickly<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.730> of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
setting up so that i can quickly kind of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.330 
setting up so that i can quickly kind of
without<00:02:49.440> looking<00:02:49.830> because<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.100> mean<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> think

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
without looking because I mean I think

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.710 
without looking because I mean I think
about<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> whole<00:02:50.850> point<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.390> be<00:02:51.510> able<00:02:51.570> to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
about the whole point is to be able to

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.660 
about the whole point is to be able to
reach<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.410> when<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.070> reach<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.489> kind<00:02:53.640> of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
reach in and when I reach I can kind of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.190 
reach in and when I reach I can kind of
grab<00:02:53.880> all<00:02:54.030> three<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.450> know<00:02:54.510> which<00:02:54.900> one<00:02:55.080> I'm

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
grab all three and I know which one I'm

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.070 
grab all three and I know which one I'm
going<00:02:55.380> for<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.730> let<00:02:57.480> me<00:02:57.510> feel<00:02:57.720> even<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:57.989> what

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
going for so let me feel even on what

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.710 
going for so let me feel even on what
they<00:02:58.170> all<00:02:58.260> are<00:02:58.410> for<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:59.520> green<00:02:59.730> one<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.570> first

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
they all are for the green one the first

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.540 
they all are for the green one the first
one<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.170> my<00:03:02.010> current<00:03:02.420> monthly<00:03:03.420> layout<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.400> it

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
one is my current monthly layout so it

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.010 
one is my current monthly layout so it
has<00:03:05.700> basically<00:03:06.030> been<00:03:06.239> on<00:03:06.300> january<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.810> entire

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
has basically been on january the entire

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.400 
has basically been on january the entire
time<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.600> i<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.870> easily<00:03:10.080> flip

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
time but this is so i can easily flip

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.550 
time but this is so i can easily flip
back<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.980> my<00:03:11.190> monthly<00:03:12.050> from<00:03:13.050> wherever<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.530> am

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
back to my monthly from wherever I am

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160 
back to my monthly from wherever I am
and<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.730> think<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.300> will<00:03:15.540> probably<00:03:15.570> be

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
and I think that this will probably be

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.910 
and I think that this will probably be
more<00:03:17.130> useful<00:03:17.430> as<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.570> go<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.200> mean<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.739> still

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
more useful as we go on I mean I still

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.710 
more useful as we go on I mean I still
obviously<00:03:20.250> have<00:03:20.519> them<00:03:20.790> all<00:03:20.910> tabbed<00:03:21.299> and

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
obviously have them all tabbed and

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.600 
obviously have them all tabbed and
January<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.530> obviously<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.890> super<00:03:23.190> easy<00:03:23.340> one<00:03:23.519> to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
January is obviously a super easy one to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.370 
January is obviously a super easy one to
find<00:03:23.820> too<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.750> think<00:03:24.930> once<00:03:25.080> we<00:03:25.140> get<00:03:25.320> going

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
find too but I think once we get going

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.800 
find too but I think once we get going
and<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.030> I'm<00:03:27.180> somewhere<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and and you know I'm somewhere in the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.180 
and and you know I'm somewhere in the
middle<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.590> think<00:03:28.680> it'll<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:29.040> even

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
middle of here I think it'll be even

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.610 
middle of here I think it'll be even
more<00:03:29.340> useful<00:03:29.400> having<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.870> still

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
more useful having this I still

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.780 
more useful having this I still
obviously<00:03:31.920> use<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> quite<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> bit<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.580> go<00:03:32.670> back

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
obviously use a quite a bit to go back

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.150 
obviously use a quite a bit to go back
to<00:03:32.910> january<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.390> i<00:03:33.630> think<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:34.530> i<00:03:34.620> said<00:03:34.830> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
to january but i think like i said the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.640 
to january but i think like i said the
more<00:03:35.820> mixed<00:03:36.299> into<00:03:36.630> everything<00:03:36.810> we<00:03:37.080> get<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
more mixed into everything we get the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.750 
more mixed into everything we get the
more<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:38.130> one<00:03:38.310> becomes<00:03:38.700> useful<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:41.370> next

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
more this one becomes useful the next

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.690 
more this one becomes useful the next
one<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.209> my<00:03:42.570> current<00:03:42.930> day<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.860> goes<00:03:44.160> on<00:03:44.190> my

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
one is my current day so this goes on my

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.400 
one is my current day so this goes on my
actual<00:03:45.630> day<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.799> clear<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:49.140> complete

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
actual day it is clear like complete

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.250 
actual day it is clear like complete
like<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.769> know<00:03:49.860> white<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.700> clear<00:03:51.140> which<00:03:52.140> is

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
like you know white and clear which is

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.930 
like you know white and clear which is
perfect<00:03:52.590> because<00:03:52.620> i<00:03:53.040> wanted<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.400> be<00:03:53.459> here<00:03:53.820> but

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
perfect because i wanted to be here but

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.320 
perfect because i wanted to be here but
i<00:03:54.420> didn't<00:03:54.780> want<00:03:55.019> anything<00:03:55.410> i<00:03:56.150> want<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.209> be<00:03:57.269> able

i didn't want anything i want to be able
to<00:03:57.450> see<00:03:57.690> both<00:03:57.840> pages<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.530> i<00:03:58.830> can<00:03:59.250> leave<00:03:59.459> this

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
to see both pages so i can leave this

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.920 
to see both pages so i can leave this
here<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.000> don't<00:04:00.239> worry<00:04:00.420> about<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.630> being<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
here I don't worry about it being in the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.850 
here I don't worry about it being in the
way<00:04:01.080> as<00:04:01.470> long<00:04:01.799> as<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:01.980> don't<00:04:02.040> want<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.310> write<00:04:02.810> I

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
way as long as I don't want to write I

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.350 
way as long as I don't want to write I
can<00:04:04.860> see<00:04:05.040> everything<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.459> then<00:04:05.640> even<00:04:06.239> if<00:04:06.299> I

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
can see everything and then even if I

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.729 
can see everything and then even if I
need<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.570> write<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.810> pages<00:04:07.140> flip<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.530> can

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
need to write on this pages flip I can

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.250 
need to write on this pages flip I can
still<00:04:07.890> see<00:04:08.040> everything<00:04:08.310> on<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.519> page<00:04:09.260> it's

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
still see everything on this page it's

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.500 
still see everything on this page it's
absolutely<00:04:10.500> perfect<00:04:10.860> but<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:12.239> is<00:04:12.390> probably

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
absolutely perfect but this is probably

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.090 
absolutely perfect but this is probably
the<00:04:12.690> one<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.840> use<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.019> most<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.680> obviously

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
the one I use the most is obviously

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.400 
the one I use the most is obviously
going<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.459> today<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.329> then<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.320> very

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
going to today and then at the very

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.110 
going to today and then at the very
think<00:04:16.950> we<00:04:17.040> started<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.340> last<00:04:17.519> thing<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:17.790> do<00:04:17.910> for

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
think we started the last thing I do for

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.640 
think we started the last thing I do for
go<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.299> bed<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.720> double<00:04:19.079> check<00:04:19.229> my<00:04:19.380> to-do

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
go to bed is I double check my to-do

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.580 
go to bed is I double check my to-do
list<00:04:20.180> move<00:04:21.180> anything<00:04:21.419> over<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.959> tomorrow<00:04:22.320> that

list move anything over to tomorrow that
I<00:04:22.620> need<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.400> didn't<00:04:23.700> get<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.849> that<00:04:24.120> needs

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
I need that I didn't get to that needs

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.029 
I need that I didn't get to that needs

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
to be done tomorrow and then I flip my

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.040 
to be done tomorrow and then I flip my
ruler

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
ruler

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.900 
ruler
over<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.290> next<00:04:28.410> day<00:04:28.650> super<00:04:29.490> super<00:04:29.640> easy

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
over to the next day super super easy

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.620 
over to the next day super super easy
just<00:04:30.530> plop<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.770> over<00:04:31.920> there<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:34.170> third<00:04:34.500> one

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
just plop it in over there the third one

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.000 
just plop it in over there the third one
see<00:04:36.630> look<00:04:36.870> how<00:04:36.930> quickly<00:04:37.290> you<00:04:37.500> see<00:04:37.620> this<00:04:37.740> one<00:04:37.860> is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
see look how quickly you see this one is

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.100 
see look how quickly you see this one is
way<00:04:38.370> better<00:04:38.640> for<00:04:39.030> my<00:04:39.240> head<00:04:39.390> is<00:04:39.510> today<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.810> guess

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
way better for my head is today I guess

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.140 
way better for my head is today I guess
maybe<00:04:40.770> I'll<00:04:40.920> break<00:04:41.160> down<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.850> weekly

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
maybe I'll break down the weekly

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.580 
maybe I'll break down the weekly
planning<00:04:42.390> maybe<00:04:42.660> was<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:42.960> too<00:04:43.200> big<00:04:43.230> of<00:04:43.530> a

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
planning maybe was just too big of a

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.560 
planning maybe was just too big of a
project<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.070> don't<00:04:44.310> know<00:04:44.370> anyway<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:44.940> still<00:04:45.420> want

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
project I don't know anyway I still want

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.510 
project I don't know anyway I still want
to<00:04:45.630> tackle<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:46.080> think<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.530> um<00:04:46.740> it's<00:04:47.280> a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
to tackle it I think that um it's a

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.930 
to tackle it I think that um it's a
useful<00:04:47.790> thing<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.240> talk<00:04:48.450> about<00:04:48.510> perhaps<00:04:49.940> but

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
useful thing to talk about perhaps but

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.670 
useful thing to talk about perhaps but
yeah<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.360> not<00:04:51.570> in<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.810> place<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.050> do<00:04:52.380> tackle

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
yeah just not in a place to do tackle

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.280 
yeah just not in a place to do tackle
something<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.490> in<00:04:53.760> depth<00:04:54.000> okay<00:04:54.360> so<00:04:55.050> if

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
something that that in depth okay so if

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.130 
something that that in depth okay so if
you<00:04:55.530> have<00:04:56.250> not<00:04:56.460> seen<00:04:56.760> or<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:57.120> forgotten<00:04:57.480> my

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
you have not seen or you forgotten my

inserts a week makes a little bundle
let's<00:05:01.590> see<00:05:01.680> if<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:01.800> can<00:05:01.950> find<00:05:02.100> an<00:05:02.280> easy<00:05:02.430> one<00:05:02.610> to

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
let's see if I can find an easy one to

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.760 
let's see if I can find an easy one to
show<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.880> here<00:05:03.260> okay<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:04.320> it's<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.650> little

is one little bundle and I found what

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.770 
is one little bundle and I found what
ends<00:05:14.370> up<00:05:14.400> happening<00:05:14.460> so<00:05:14.940> like<00:05:15.090> for<00:05:15.210> example<00:05:15.270> if

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
ends up happening so like for example if

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.920 
ends up happening so like for example if
you<00:05:16.170> are<00:05:17.990> here<00:05:18.990> you've<00:05:19.800> got<00:05:20.330> several<00:05:21.330> pages<00:05:21.630> in

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
especially when we're changing months

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.210 
especially when we're changing months
but<00:05:27.180> even<00:05:27.450> just<00:05:27.630> in<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:28.050> regular<00:05:28.200> week<00:05:28.590> going

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.780 
from Sunday over to Monday requires
flipping<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.740> few<00:05:34.920> pages<00:05:35.100> because<00:05:35.460> there's<00:05:35.670> all

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
flipping a few pages because there's all

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.310 
flipping a few pages because there's all
these<00:05:35.910> things<00:05:36.120> in<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.450> middle<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.870> each<00:05:37.020> week

more<00:05:40.140> difficult<00:05:40.260> to<00:05:40.710> flip<00:05:41.010> through<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.310> next

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460

i've<00:06:14.310> been<00:06:14.460> using<00:06:14.640> this<00:06:15.000> system<00:06:16.040> actually<00:06:17.040> i

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
i've been using this system actually i

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.490 
i've been using this system actually i
might<00:06:17.280> have<00:06:17.430> even<00:06:17.550> started<00:06:17.880> it<00:06:18.180> a<00:06:18.480> little<00:06:19.320> bit

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
might have even started it a little bit

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.890 
might have even started it a little bit
in<00:06:19.590> december<00:06:20.070> maybe<00:06:20.360> so<00:06:21.360> i've<00:06:21.450> been<00:06:21.570> using<00:06:21.690> it

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
in december maybe so i've been using it

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.840 
in december maybe so i've been using it
for<00:06:21.930> four<00:06:22.200> or<00:06:22.230> five<00:06:22.290> weeks<00:06:22.380> now<00:06:22.670> it's<00:06:23.670> working

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
for four or five weeks now it's working

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.710 
for four or five weeks now it's working
super<00:06:24.240> well<00:06:24.390> and<00:06:24.690> i<00:06:25.650> could<00:06:26.460> see<00:06:26.490> you<00:06:27.390> know<00:06:27.510> that

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
super well and i could see you know that

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.570 
super well and i could see you know that
maybe<00:06:27.980> the<00:06:28.980> third<00:06:29.130> one<00:06:29.310> wouldn't<00:06:29.520> be

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
maybe the third one wouldn't be

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.640 
maybe the third one wouldn't be
necessary<00:06:30.030> for<00:06:30.090> all<00:06:30.240> calendar<00:06:31.080> types<00:06:31.290> this

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
necessary for all calendar types this

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.070 
necessary for all calendar types this
one<00:06:31.890> I<00:06:31.920> find<00:06:32.220> you<00:06:32.400> do<00:06:32.520> really<00:06:32.730> need<00:06:32.790> it<00:06:33.030> but<00:06:36.080> you

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
one I find you do really need it but you

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.330 
one I find you do really need it but you
know<00:06:37.110> maybe<00:06:37.320> it<00:06:37.530> would<00:06:37.680> be<00:06:37.830> maybe<00:06:38.160> there's

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
know maybe it would be maybe there's

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.620 
know maybe it would be maybe there's
some<00:06:38.520> apart<00:06:38.940> in<00:06:39.090> your<00:06:39.210> notes

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
some apart in your notes

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.150 
some apart in your notes
that<00:06:39.750> you<00:06:39.840> go<00:06:39.990> too<00:06:40.050> often<00:06:40.470> that<00:06:40.530> you're<00:06:40.830> always

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
that you go too often that you're always

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.470 
that you go too often that you're always
you<00:06:41.310> know<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:41.430> one<00:06:41.700> section<00:06:42.120> you<00:06:42.240> tend<00:06:42.420> to

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
you know that one section you tend to

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.000 
you know that one section you tend to
refer<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:42.780> and<00:06:43.140> have<00:06:43.260> to<00:06:43.350> kind<00:06:43.530> of<00:06:43.590> dig<00:06:43.800> through

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
refer to and have to kind of dig through

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.390 
refer to and have to kind of dig through
to<00:06:44.100> find<00:06:45.680> maybe<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:46.950> would<00:06:47.070> be<00:06:47.100> a<00:06:47.190> good<00:06:47.340> place

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
to find maybe that would be a good place

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.680 
to find maybe that would be a good place
for<00:06:47.580> this<00:06:47.820> I<00:06:47.850> really<00:06:48.090> could<00:06:48.240> go<00:06:48.330> anywhere<00:06:48.540> and

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
for this I really could go anywhere and

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.210 
for this I really could go anywhere and
you<00:06:48.870> can<00:06:49.020> have<00:06:49.200> any<00:06:49.440> number<00:06:49.530> of<00:06:49.800> them<00:06:50.040> across

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
you can have any number of them across

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.950 
you can have any number of them across
the<00:06:50.430> top<00:06:51.860> to<00:06:52.860> keep<00:06:53.010> them<00:06:53.190> offset<00:06:53.760> I<00:06:53.790> could<00:06:54.090> you

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960
