you

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.870 

so<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.440> is<00:05:59.650> basically<00:05:59.700> everything<00:06:00.700> i<00:06:00.820> do

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
so that is basically everything i do

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.280 
so that is basically everything i do
before<00:06:01.150> bet<00:06:01.510> there<00:06:01.690> are<00:06:01.780> a<00:06:01.840> couple<00:06:01.990> other

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
before bet there are a couple other

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.840 
before bet there are a couple other
little<00:06:02.470> things<00:06:02.830> that<00:06:02.950> i<00:06:03.070> didn't<00:06:03.340> add<00:06:03.430> in<00:06:03.670> there

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
little things that i didn't add in there

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.640 
little things that i didn't add in there
because<00:06:04.030> it<00:06:04.630> would<00:06:04.750> just<00:06:04.900> kind<00:06:05.080> of<00:06:05.200> take<00:06:05.350> a<00:06:05.380> lot

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
because it would just kind of take a lot

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.470 
because it would just kind of take a lot
longer<00:06:05.890> in<00:06:06.250> it<00:06:06.340> they're<00:06:06.610> not<00:06:06.760> very<00:06:06.940> important

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
longer in it they're not very important

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.200 
longer in it they're not very important
um<00:06:07.770> but<00:06:08.770> yeah<00:06:09.100> so<00:06:09.370> i<00:06:09.430> hope<00:06:09.610> you<00:06:09.760> guys<00:06:09.880> liked
