00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
installed and there's a couple things

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.190 
installed and there's a couple things
I'll<00:00:09.599> let<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.139> know<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.469> came<00:00:10.590> across

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
I'll let you know that I came across

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.470 
I'll let you know that I came across
first<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.380> all<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> old<00:00:13.799> radiator<00:00:14.370> go<00:00:15.120> over<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
first of all the old radiator go over to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.830 
first of all the old radiator go over to
it<00:00:15.509> over<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.250> stock<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.880> believe<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> was

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
it over here the stock I believe it was

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.470 
it over here the stock I believe it was
stock<00:00:20.539> appears<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.810> very<00:00:22.140> straight<00:00:23.480> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
stock appears to be very straight the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.800 
stock appears to be very straight the
boxes<00:00:24.990> bandits<00:00:25.470> been<00:00:25.650> rained<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.599> you<00:00:27.599> can

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
boxes bandits been rained on but you can

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.960 
boxes bandits been rained on but you can
see<00:00:28.050> going<00:00:28.470> across<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:29.189> maybe<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.580> can't<00:00:29.849> see

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
see going across or maybe you can't see

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.069 
see going across or maybe you can't see
I<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.810> definitely<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.030> that<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
I can definitely see it that that the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
I can definitely see it that that the
original<00:00:34.500> radiator<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.160> supposed<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> be

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
original radiator is supposed to be

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.260 
original radiator is supposed to be
straight<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.579> go<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> pick<00:00:39.000> up<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
straight so when you go to pick up a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
straight so when you go to pick up a
radiator<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.850> bowed<00:00:42.710> you<00:00:43.710> may<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
radiator if it's bowed you may want to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.479 
radiator if it's bowed you may want to
try<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> look<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.870> least<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.320> other<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.190> make

try to look at least one other and make

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
try to look at least one other and make
a<00:00:47.520> decision<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.590> was<00:00:52.590> able<00:00:52.739> to

a decision from there the I was able to
get<00:00:52.980> our<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.270> radiator<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.230> work<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
get our get this radiator to work but I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.130 
get our get this radiator to work but I
don't<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> quite<00:00:57.899> see<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> but

had trouble with these electrical

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.880 
had trouble with these electrical
harnesses<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.650> show

doesn't if it's not able to create
suction<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:48.000> will<00:02:48.090> happen<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.600> if<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.990> runs

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
suction what will happen is if it runs

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.870 
suction what will happen is if it runs
low<00:02:49.560> or<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.580> low<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.150> your<00:02:51.750> radiator<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:53.610> not

low or is low and your radiator it's not

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.340

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
so you want to make absolutely certain

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
would seem to me a good indication that

would seem to me a good indication that
it's<00:03:51.030> creating<00:03:51.510> suction<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.080> working

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
it's creating suction and working

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.610 
it's creating suction and working
properly

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
properly

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.100 
properly
another<00:03:55.620> thing<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:56.010> did<00:03:56.220> run<00:03:56.370> across<00:03:57.080> when<00:03:58.080> I

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
another thing I did run across when I

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.870 
another thing I did run across when I
put<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.440> together<00:04:00.290> inside<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:02.360> air<00:04:03.360> box<00:04:04.880> the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
put this together inside the air box the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.740 
put this together inside the air box the
computer<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:08.459> seemed<00:04:08.940> very<00:04:09.000> difficult<00:04:09.209> for<00:04:09.630> me

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
computer it seemed very difficult for me

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.190 
computer it seemed very difficult for me
to<00:04:09.840> put<00:04:10.019> together<00:04:10.400> first<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.550> all<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:12.200> just

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
to put together first of all I just

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.530 
to put together first of all I just
didn't<00:04:13.739> pay<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.340> close<00:04:14.519> attention<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.360> so

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
didn't pay that close attention to it so

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.849 
didn't pay that close attention to it so
make<00:04:15.810> sure<00:04:15.840> when<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.290> put<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> back<00:04:16.590> together

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
make sure when you put it back together

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.830 
make sure when you put it back together
or<00:04:17.340> take<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.910> apart<00:04:18.060> in<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.209> first<00:04:18.330> place<00:04:18.630> you

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
or take it apart in the first place you

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.310 
or take it apart in the first place you
put

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
put

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.979 
put
pay<00:04:19.530> close<00:04:20.010> attention<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.640> how<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.570> goes<00:04:21.750> back

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
pay close attention to how it goes back

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.630 
pay close attention to how it goes back
in<00:04:22.200> there<00:04:22.350> it'll<00:04:22.530> make<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.800> easier<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:23.220> you

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
in there it'll make it easier for you

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.680 
in there it'll make it easier for you
and<00:04:24.300> again<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:25.500> box

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
and again this box

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.779 
and again this box
once<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.840> get<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.259> point<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.919> just<00:04:29.310> pops

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
once you get to this point it just pops

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.670 
once you get to this point it just pops
right<00:04:30.120> up<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.870> pops<00:04:31.080> loose

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
right up and it pops loose

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.710 
right up and it pops loose
it<00:04:32.190> looks<00:04:32.490> like<00:04:32.610> it's<00:04:32.789> plastic<00:04:33.300> inserts

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
it looks like it's plastic inserts

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.200 
it looks like it's plastic inserts
inside<00:04:34.080> rubber<00:04:34.379> fittings<00:04:34.889> so<00:04:35.729> you<00:04:35.789> but<00:04:36.120> you

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
inside rubber fittings so you but you

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.420 
inside rubber fittings so you but you
got<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.479> push<00:04:36.629> it<00:04:36.659> straight<00:04:37.080> up<00:04:37.259> in<00:04:37.680> order<00:04:38.340> to

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
got to push it straight up in order to

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.930 
got to push it straight up in order to
get<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.699> out

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.430 

also<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.090> seal<00:04:42.360> there's<00:04:42.690> rubber<00:04:43.050> seals

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
also the seal there's rubber seals

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.189 
also the seal there's rubber seals
around<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.889> computer<00:04:44.720> now<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:45.930> car<00:04:46.169> is

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
around the computer now this car is

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.070 
around the computer now this car is
about<00:04:46.470> 11<00:04:46.889> years<00:04:47.009> old<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:48.300> seals<00:04:48.599> on<00:04:48.870> it

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
about 11 years old and the seals on it

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.430 
about 11 years old and the seals on it
have<00:04:50.039> shrunk<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.780> just<00:04:51.780> don't<00:04:51.960> fit<00:04:52.139> on<00:04:52.289> there

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
have shrunk and just don't fit on there

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.460 
have shrunk and just don't fit on there
ideally<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:54.449> so<00:04:55.139> what<00:04:55.319> I<00:04:55.349> did<00:04:57.020> in<00:04:58.020> order<00:04:58.289> to

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
ideally and so what I did in order to

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.219 
ideally and so what I did in order to
fit<00:04:58.620> on<00:04:58.770> an<00:04:58.889> ideally<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.520> way<00:04:59.669> it's<00:04:59.940> set<00:05:00.210> up<00:05:00.240> it

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
fit on an ideally the way it's set up it

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.159 
fit on an ideally the way it's set up it
actually<00:05:01.349> goes<00:05:01.800> around<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:03.449> female<00:05:03.840> portion

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
actually goes around the female portion

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.180 
actually goes around the female portion
of<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.560> insert<00:05:04.949> on<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.220> computer<00:05:06.349> but<00:05:07.349> it

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
of the insert on the computer but it

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.020 
of the insert on the computer but it
just<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:09.150> wouldn't<00:05:09.840> work<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.289> way<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.610> what<00:05:11.970> I

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
just it wouldn't work that way so what I

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.129 
just it wouldn't work that way so what I
ended<00:05:12.330> up<00:05:12.449> doing<00:05:12.509> in<00:05:13.229> it<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:14.330> it's<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.690> don't

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
ended up doing in it and it's I don't

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.450 
ended up doing in it and it's I don't
know<00:05:16.319> hopefully<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.919> will<00:05:17.009> keep<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.340> from

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
know hopefully it will keep it from

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.670 
know hopefully it will keep it from
getting<00:05:18.240> wet<00:05:18.599> prevent<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.110> from<00:05:19.139> getting<00:05:19.349> wet

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
getting wet prevent it from getting wet

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.939 
getting wet prevent it from getting wet
that's<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.130> whole<00:05:20.250> function<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.849> it<00:05:21.000> is<00:05:21.949> I

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
that's the whole function of it is I

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.520 
that's the whole function of it is I
just<00:05:23.009> took<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.849> rubber<00:05:24.389> seals<00:05:24.840> around<00:05:25.139> the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
just took the rubber seals around the

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.360 
just took the rubber seals around the
computer<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.569> instead<00:05:27.569> of<00:05:27.629> going<00:05:27.990> where<00:05:28.590> it's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
computer and instead of going where it's

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.059 
computer and instead of going where it's
seated<00:05:30.000> you<00:05:30.180> can<00:05:30.360> see<00:05:30.539> on<00:05:30.719> the<00:05:30.840> female<00:05:31.229> side<00:05:31.830> of

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
seated you can see on the female side of

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.180 
seated you can see on the female side of
it<00:05:32.219> I<00:05:32.419> just<00:05:33.419> wrapped<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.229> around<00:05:34.349> the<00:05:34.979> male

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
it I just wrapped it around the male

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.659 
it I just wrapped it around the male
portion<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.880> then<00:05:36.000> inserted<00:05:37.190> or<00:05:38.190> made<00:05:38.550> the

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
portion and then inserted or made the

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.640 
portion and then inserted or made the
connection<00:05:39.120> between<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.780> two<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:39.990> hopefully

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
connection between the two and hopefully

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.450 
connection between the two and hopefully
that<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:41.819> will<00:05:42.000> work<00:05:42.210> too<00:05:42.539> to<00:05:43.469> seal<00:05:44.099> it<00:05:44.250> good

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
that that will work too to seal it good

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.709 
that that will work too to seal it good
enough<00:05:44.759> where<00:05:45.539> it<00:05:45.630> doesn't<00:05:45.779> get<00:05:45.990> wet<00:05:47.719> and

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
enough where it doesn't get wet and

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.249 
enough where it doesn't get wet and
that's<00:05:49.169> all<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.409> can<00:05:49.560> think<00:05:49.800> of<00:05:50.539> just<00:05:51.539> try<00:05:52.199> to

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
that's all I can think of just try to

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.730 
that's all I can think of just try to
get<00:05:52.409> a<00:05:52.469> straight<00:05:52.770> radiator<00:05:53.279> if<00:05:53.460> you<00:05:53.580> can<00:05:54.740> if

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
get a straight radiator if you can if

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.140 
get a straight radiator if you can if
not<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:56.789> it<00:05:57.630> could<00:05:58.259> very<00:05:58.830> well<00:05:58.919> work<00:05:59.279> mine<00:05:59.969> was

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
not it it could very well work mine was

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.140 
not it it could very well work mine was
about<00:06:00.389> a<00:06:00.419> quarter-inch<00:06:00.930> off<00:06:01.639> so<00:06:02.639> as<00:06:02.909> long<00:06:03.090> as

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
about a quarter-inch off so as long as

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.930 
about a quarter-inch off so as long as
it's<00:06:03.449> within<00:06:04.169> a<00:06:04.289> quarter<00:06:04.620> inch<00:06:04.800> range<00:06:05.130> it'll

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
it's within a quarter inch range it'll

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.999 
it's within a quarter inch range it'll
work<00:06:06.180> or<00:06:06.830> should<00:06:07.830> work<00:06:08.360> and<00:06:09.360> that's<00:06:09.569> it<00:06:10.009> good

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009 
work or should work and that's it good

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.190 
work or should work and that's it good
luck
