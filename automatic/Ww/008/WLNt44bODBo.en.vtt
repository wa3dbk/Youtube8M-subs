00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:18.980
 company thule founded in 1942 market leader 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.770
 for roof girder tailgate systems and 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.390
 I think in times of subway mobility 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.890
 you will not do without it 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.439
 we can be betrayed every now and then 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.910
 Car transport 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.669
 advice times what interested the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.550
 Today's technology can and we look 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:40.100
 now the model school euro 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.530
 classic g6 led led because here in 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.239
 the lights corresponding led flex 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.969
 are integrated are much brighter 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.089
 as the normal lighting but also 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.469
 design technology should look very good 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.449
 beautiful carrier in the moment in the 3er 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.219
 version of the can be but by a 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.749
 Construction set on a four version 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.059
 expand very easily via a central 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:05.720
 Removable handle can be very comfortable 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.430
 back on it also interesting what 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.650
 for me in the practice always one 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.690
 real problem was there is one here 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.310
 central key that is this one 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.320
 key is for both 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 trailer hitch thought but also for 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.439
 all corresponding cling here to the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.439
 the frame comes from the system 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.539
 so it works so I just 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.369
 Three wheels in full or accordingly 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.909
 put four wheels in a row 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.039
 can be very simple there is a brace 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.899
 I can solve the bike here 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.340
 at the bottom of the corresponding buckles 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.020
 go and then lose weight 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.270
 in practice it is natural that way 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.030
 many people just larger families 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.189
 nowadays also with for example vw t5 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.079
 drive through the area and there always 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.960
 have the problem how do I then the 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.789
 tailgate of the car is also that 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.219
 at thule very nice solved there 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.320
 just a mechanism with me here 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.969
 You can fold the bike once 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.500
 also do not need to worry that the 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.490
 wheels come somehow on the ground 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.439
 or similar 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.840
 that is accordingly dimensioned 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.869
 that there are no problems 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.549
 practically 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.769
 other practical detail is one 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.420
 small system so who ever 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.819
 such a bearer had the will this 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.980
 I know when I cling to the back 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.640
 have and now the second bike on it 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.140
 wants to make 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.879
 there you can already quite the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.159
 finger at break around then the braces 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.060
 to get by at toulouse 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.430
 That's easy 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.260
 I put the handle on it and can 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.379
 now put the second bike on it 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 and accordingly fix times a tip 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.500
 to this fixation about this bracket 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.500
 is really just for that purpose 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.239
 bike does not necessarily fluctuate that is 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.230
 actually only a rough fixation 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.000
 actual fixation comes over this 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.379
 Strap on the bottom of the rim 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.840
 This is also very nice at school 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.519
 made here there is on the one hand it 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.079
 normal bracket system i can 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.790
 now also open and close 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.040
 I have here but similar to one 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.690
 snowboard fast the possibilities 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.310
 ratcheting mechanism and here 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.190
 really a real tension on the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.230
 Bringing a rim is the essential 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.669
 fasten the bracket only very loosely 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.560
 then that's enough for the real one 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.859
 fixation takes place here via this 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.900
 burden about this fast further 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.239
 very cool detail is of course the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.980
 fact with such a carrier one wants 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.660
 transport an e bike today 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.720
 This can also work with wheels 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.660
 up to 25 kilos and who ever 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.430
 and not necessarily to the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.680
 arnold schwarzenegger in this world 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.560
 he knows that 25 kilos is right 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.389
 hard are very experienced and there 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.269
 already has a nice detail here 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.489
 it's a ramp up the rake here 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.400
 just in and then have the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.620
 possibility to start my e bike 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.599
 in the optimal case of course then with 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.549
 a small traction help like some 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.349
 offer vendor-book range in e 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.709
 then the whole thing becomes real 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.569
 child play and why a roof rack like 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.599
 such a tailgate naturally designed 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.280
 It is always clear most of the time 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.269
 Of the year he will probably be in the 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.720
 garage stand 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.949
 this system here you can complete 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.790
 collapse and then just click 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.350
 fasten a strap accordingly 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.750
 I also find a very nice detail 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.540
 and a thing that I personally like 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.250
 really like it 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.160
 that's that here now sees something 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.300
 martial but that is actually 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.650
 very simple technology but extremely stable 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.170
 I'd say where's the has 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.390
 School evolves around at some point 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.280
 ladies maybe they are now 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.130
 up here in the superstructure no possibility 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.370
 have the fixation there was always the 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.930
 problematic where is the claws on 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.580
 and there was great thought okay there 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.350
 make such a system that needs to be slim 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.270
 it has to be fast that will be here 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.830
 between set is tight and tight 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.230
 then i can fix the clip up here 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.570
 what i attached a lot though 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.150
 more interesting finder is at 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.620
 my wheel, for example, just below 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.510
 lying floor trains or above 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.920
 I wanted to add lying floor 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.470
 personally not a damn thing 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.180
 that's the one point, too 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.820
 interesting at the aluminum frame though 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.890
 everyone driving their carbon frames will 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.220
 the problem is that carbon 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.600
 Of course you must not be crushed 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.370
 and it is not cheap 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.220
 That's why you should have such a framework too 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.960
 definitely already and with such a 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.820
 of course this is also suitable 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.160
 he simply intervenes as 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.070
 quasi already a claw here because 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.110
 fix 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.910
 priced, of course, are those 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.830
 equipment that is the top class of 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.050
 tula is now on the market 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.120
 quite a faithful high 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.980
 investment costs quite clear but for 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.530
 my terms synonymous in the system with the 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.330
 I long just to 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.470
 appropriate comfort can enjoy 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.750
 very well thought out in all details and 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.750
 from my point of view optimal device
