00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.640
 Isn't it easy to use? It is a race to make bea's indicator 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.650
 Ah 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.129
 yuma 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.550
 tbs system 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.159
 Confidence in half 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:12.849
 Book 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.650
 When in defcon 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.659
 I took a wine bottle 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:20.710
 There is time 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.150
 However, he still said the campaign's authenticity 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.199
 Managing dietitian I am at number 12 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 I understood 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.499
 And you are asked to clarify 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:40.370
 All British horses get up at the time of Amblane only in winter in rba 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 It looks like you've solidified the x 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.319
 The lawyer is a body even though his body is stable 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.570
 Because it is rice, it is the fourth place 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.600
 Indeed, the issue amount to deal with reductions etc. is increasing 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 You can see that you follow the basics of the investigation 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.000
 It is me who eap, but it is Japan and Korea 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.190
 I used regularly 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.310
 The prefectural police looks like Filipino Suzuki 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.140
 So 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.360
 yha 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.640
 this house 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.540
 I understood 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.810
 Yorii 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.090
 Then it is next 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.770
 This is a new policy I made 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.590
 That lasts 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.660
 To a new article 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.509
 The peg system was a line 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.390
 The wine started with a difference of 1 bottle 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.930
 Next time I try to cool the confusion, such as Nippon Steel Corp. 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 Maeba 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 Order of papers 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.550
 Match 3 before 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.750
 Came out in red and white 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.360
 Oh, it's like a series of 3pars, and there's no one- 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.060
 ing 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.210
 I am in charge of the appraisal 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.999
 It's just x 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.999
 It is Chile when entering uniform 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.209
 Indoor 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.329
 Come on from the helicopter 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.909
 It is stable 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.109
 Gray to Enix will be doubled 1/2 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.849
 One-third price in the 30s 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.809
 But still a little more important 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.809
 If you are watching a British actor 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.799
 Three look at x and y 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.349
 The same number 2 hits 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.439
 Once in Niigata 11 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.080
 30th at 4 am 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.200
 Third time 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.410
 10 people 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.410
 But there is no way this guy gets in too much 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.239
 Prefecture 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.859
 Keywords are youth 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.829
 The agreement of the teacher also became loose 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.229
 In the case of Nippon Keidanren, the Asian region 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.619
 Activation-Analog d-sub determined 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:10.889
 To the net 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.969
 You can get sick and drink during 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.909
 If you go further and talk about becoming a gem of 6701 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.199
 I do not 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:28.489
 1-13 was 2220 yen in my heart 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.839
 Around -3 degrees 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.839
 Then -s7 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.479
 The same 12.5 will be new 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.939
 Then from xx 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.729
 I said that so many aides are getting better 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:47.779
 In front 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.959
 I walked Arao for a moment-from 4:30 to 3:30 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.120
 Not yet 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.399
 It is scenery outside the articles of incorporation 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.679
 that 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:00.889
 Not only those who received the booth here but also neat 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.919
 I'm covered by the police 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.010
 Department Nex Constitution when entering Federal law 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.329
 Because it is difficult to stop and there is a consultation 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.180
 Voice asking for capasa thought is strongly parallelized 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:21.799
 I do not know game center cx, but I am -sun now 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.100
 Pellet Stove-Free to spend on budget 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.100
 You need to be passionate about it 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.530
 asked for ax 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.050
 I understand that this is good 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.050
 But the rate is not negative 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.220
 The theme is not free 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.220
 But I put a battle -1257 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.740
 Find US nex with official statistics 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.539
 exmachina- is coming out 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.629
 Ikawa 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.990
 Bogey at 3rd 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.660
 Securitization when buying at e-mobile 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.449
 It is hard to move by doing 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.360
 Although there are negative factors like this, the number of shares is significantly delayed 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.330
 That's why 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.660
 Ask to establish this day 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.849
 Use enforcement rate 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.379
 Indicates user charging and attitude to become rcd release 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:19.889
 did 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.069
 It is easy to show the swing of this time 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:23.969
 Disagreeable 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.069
