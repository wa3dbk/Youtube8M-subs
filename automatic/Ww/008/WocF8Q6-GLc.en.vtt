 dutch bnn the cameramans including a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.410

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.090
 Why 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.450

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.130
 more expensive in fruits especially but it has 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.920

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.170
 but we will start with a little bit 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.370
 cultural news if the 12 news 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.960

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.880
 especially and we just learned 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.110
 that a gallery in England exhibits in 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.670
 this moment a painting representing 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.980
 madonna and her old husband guy ritchie 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.500

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.110

 snap as much money for this thing to 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.979
 and especially or hang it because there 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.130
 that it stings the eyes I may have a 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.509

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.470
 mud house for the little we 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.890
 scary years 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.300
 we go on with the dumpling of the day 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.130
 it's a British MP who 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.540
 gave a speech about a 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.250
 removal of an allowance for 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.800
 students a thing that makes dream what 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.930
 except that they had a small problem 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 and to come home and three bronze 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.810
 beit you here he has managed to 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.190
 any credibility in a few moments 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.570
 it is balÃ¨ze 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.160
 I hope they sometimes remove his 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.160
 tie one if not otherwise it's boring 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.430
 machine I wanted us to talk tonight 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.709

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.700
 cyprian just puts in fact I think 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:05.320
 they want but it stops 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:05.320
 between us I ask for a divorce 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.060
 [Music] 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.440
 and to finish the unusual skin of the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.940
 day direction germany where a 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.100
 retired expectations and hang in there 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.120
 because it's pretty conceptual 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.760
 to cash with his bank a 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.989
 million dollar bill for this 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.459
 that they are worthless in the biggest bills 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.230
 American notes it's 100 bucks 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.880
 so the million we believe means our 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.500
 German has been sentenced to six months in prison 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.040

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.650
 euros 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.840
 but let's imagine let's imagine ok that there is a 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.140
 the one million biases you imagine the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.390
