00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.439 
it's a good price so if you were going
to<00:04:03.799> try<00:04:03.980> this<00:04:04.040> I'd<00:04:04.370> recommend<00:04:04.790> trying<00:04:05.060> a

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
to try this I'd recommend trying a

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.949 
to try this I'd recommend trying a
different<00:04:05.840> flavor<00:04:06.049> though<00:04:06.319> and<00:04:07.750> I'd<00:04:08.750> say

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
different flavor though and I'd say

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.710 
different flavor though and I'd say
combining<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:09.709> with<00:04:09.739> milk<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.579> water<00:04:10.879> would

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
combining it with milk and water would

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.009 
combining it with milk and water would
be<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.019> best<00:04:12.409> combination<00:04:13.099> because<00:04:13.870> then<00:04:14.870> it

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
be the best combination because then it

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.310 
be the best combination because then it
thins<00:04:15.260> out<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.590> bit<00:04:15.919> but<00:04:16.130> still<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.930> still<00:04:18.139> got

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
thins out a bit but still you still got

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.820 
thins out a bit but still you still got
the<00:04:18.440> flavor<00:04:18.680> that<00:04:21.370> you're<00:04:22.370> looking<00:04:22.700> for

the flavor that you're looking for

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.960
