00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.379
 the nfl has no commercial broadcaster 9 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.379
 half of all members of his pupils are mt 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.109
 the f'jes they form the largest age groups among the young 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.390
 soccer players nearly 150,000 boys and girls are f pupil 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.540
 the future are boys and girls of 6 7 8 and 9 years that is at this age 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.030
 a big difference 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.280
 children of 6 years do not yet have any sense of playing together they are bad 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.140
 focused on itself 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.820
 she wanted to have and love 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.210
 it's iq and the ball 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
 but keeping the ball is often difficult 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.820
 they can't work together yet 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 often they do the same things independently of each other 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.010
 elderly f'jes can already do things together 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 there you can already see the beginning and interaction who 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.330
 qatar 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.910
 qatar 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.050
 At this age, children like to move around and many of these children are among the 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.040
 club come 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.750
 because they like the game 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570
 like it very much 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.820
 and we must keep it that way 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.939
 they are introduced to the football game with everything that comes with it 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.860
 f pupils mainly want to play alan wake in the back seat baquba ff is must 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.560
 you always challenging they like to score and goals from the opposing team 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.620
 appearance 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.230
 if it ad 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.660
 always creates challenging situations in which it might just run out 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.840
 just failed 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.630
 yes then a child is challenged and that is also 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.009
 what that question asks that smooth pill asks and then you will also have a lot of fun 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.009
 experience 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.740
 the bikes have little patience they want the roads 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 and listening is difficult 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.969
 they are easily distracted and can only focus on the same for a shorter time 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.499
 activities 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.670
 for some ten to fifteen minutes doing the same type of exercise is f 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.349
 pupils for too long 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.780
 the attention is weakened and they start to deal with other matters 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.290
 giving directions without a good example often has little effect to seem 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.439
 points 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.279
 they receive attention and therefore effies like to use it as an example 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.279
 used to be what i am wondering what i am going that way 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.819
 the that i do this whatever 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.819
 del potro 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.909
 we try to score 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.809
 yes it is functioning the best in a clear structure needs changes 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.939
 you therefore gradually implemented 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.540
 if you use a new type of training so it is always a short training before 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.540
 they are used to it 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.609
 they are not yet very independent and we need help with all kinds of things 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.609
 to become 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.239
 but I am a different type 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.489
 if they do not feel comfortable and then they often react very violently 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.859
 but that is usually over quickly 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:29.439
 achieved
