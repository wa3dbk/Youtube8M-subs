in<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.820> second<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.750> pull<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.140> trigger

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
in just a second if we pull this trigger

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.220 
in just a second if we pull this trigger
very<00:00:31.740> fast<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.489> you'll<00:00:33.420> notice<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.809> no

dart came out and in fact I'm my fingers
still<00:00:36.930> holding<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> trigger<00:00:37.440> you'll<00:00:38.100> see

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
still holding the trigger you'll see

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
still holding the trigger you'll see
that<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.670> dart<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.149> still<00:00:39.390> well<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.230> there

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that that dart is still well in there

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.049 
that that dart is still well in there
I'm<00:00:40.829> gonna<00:00:40.980> push<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> back<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.910> don't

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I'm gonna push it back in so we don't

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
I'm gonna push it back in so we don't
get<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> jam<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.660> time<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.739> try<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:43.980> do

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
get a jam this time but if we try and do

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600 
get a jam this time but if we try and do
that<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:45.300> quickly<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:47.010> dart<00:00:47.280> went<00:00:47.489> out

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that very quickly that dart went out

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.910 
that very quickly that dart went out
about<00:00:48.500> five<00:00:49.500> eight<00:00:50.160> maybe<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.379> has<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
about five eight maybe so it has to do a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
about five eight maybe so it has to do a
lot<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> trigger<00:00:53.760> pull<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> let<00:00:54.510> me

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
lot with the trigger pull and let me

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
lot with the trigger pull and let me
show<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> mean<00:00:55.289> by<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:56.340> going

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
to pry the blaster and now I'm going to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
to pry the blaster and now I'm going to
slowly<00:00:59.640> pull<00:00:59.969> back<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> trigger<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> at

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
slowly pull back the trigger and at

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
slowly pull back the trigger and at
about<00:01:01.620> halfway<00:01:01.890> you'll<00:01:02.820> notice<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
about halfway you'll notice that it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.700 
about halfway you'll notice that it
rotates<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> dart<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:05.850> loaded<00:01:06.390> into<00:01:06.710> in

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
rotates the dart is now loaded into in

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
rotates the dart is now loaded into in
line<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> plunger<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> look

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
line with a plunger and if you look

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850 
line with a plunger and if you look
directly<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.020> you'll<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> this

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
directly at it you'll see that this

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
directly at it you'll see that this
should<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.460> its<00:01:11.580> firing<00:01:12.000> position<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
should be in its firing position now and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.670 
should be in its firing position now and
so<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.740> pull<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.040> last<00:01:14.460> quarter<00:01:15.450> inch<00:01:15.780> I'm

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
so if I pull that last quarter inch I'm

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.789 
so if I pull that last quarter inch I'm
gonna<00:01:16.830> fight<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> ground<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> nice

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
gonna fight the ground now we had a nice

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
gonna fight the ground now we had a nice
Dart<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.369> would<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.640> went<00:01:20.759> pretty<00:01:21.119> far<00:01:24.110> do

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
Dart that would have went pretty far do

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.570 
Dart that would have went pretty far do
it<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> bounced<00:01:26.250> farther

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it one more time that bounced farther

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.929 
it one more time that bounced farther
than<00:01:27.049> your<00:01:28.049> last<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.320> went<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:29.640> let's<00:01:29.790> go

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
than your last one went but let's go

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.810 
than your last one went but let's go
okay<00:01:30.650> I'll<00:01:31.650> try<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.130> more<00:01:32.159> time<00:01:32.460> notice

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
okay I'll try it one more time notice

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.140 
okay I'll try it one more time notice
that<00:01:32.939> once<00:01:33.150> again<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:34.200> half<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:35.150> I'm

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that once again it's at a half way I'm

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
that once again it's at a half way I'm
gonna<00:01:36.329> fire<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.909> can

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
gonna fire it all the way now so we can

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
gonna fire it all the way now so we can
get<00:01:39.180> better<00:01:39.450> ranges<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.710> are

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
get better ranges out of it if we are

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.399 
get better ranges out of it if we are
just<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.520> cautious<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.899> I'll<00:01:43.200> show

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
just very cautious with it and I'll show

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
just very cautious with it and I'll show
you<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.100> typically<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.420> I'm

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you how I do it typically if I know I'm

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.359 
you how I do it typically if I know I'm
going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.590> area<00:01:46.920> where<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> think

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
going to be in an area where I think

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.280 
going to be in an area where I think
that<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.060> might<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.659> attacked<00:01:49.049> it's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that I might get you know attacked it's

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
that I might get you know attacked it's
a<00:01:49.350> nerf<00:01:49.500> war<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:49.799> whatever<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.610> prime<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
a nerf war or whatever you prime it and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.810 
a nerf war or whatever you prime it and
then<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.380> half<00:01:52.590> pull<00:01:52.950> whoops<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
then do the half pull whoops and I just

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.120 
then do the half pull whoops and I just
shot<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:55.320> prime<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
shot that you prime it and then do a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.819 
shot that you prime it and then do a
half<00:01:56.369> pull<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:58.079> had<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> dart<00:01:58.619> lined

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
half pull so now you had that dart lined

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
half pull so now you had that dart lined
up<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.460> need<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.170> be

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
up so if I need to I can now just be

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.100 
up so if I need to I can now just be
ready

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.640 

and<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.380> never<00:02:04.530> jam<00:02:04.800> up<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and it will never jam up on so that is I

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.100 
and it will never jam up on so that is I
suppose<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.429> proper<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.390> better<00:02:09.630> way<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> use

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
suppose the proper the better way to use

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.590 
suppose the proper the better way to use
a<00:02:10.140> maverick<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.550> any<00:02:11.700> case<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.240> just<00:02:12.510> a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
a maverick but in any case it's just a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.390 
a maverick but in any case it's just a
way<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.780> solve<00:02:13.080> jams<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.740> clear<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
way to solve jams and clear up the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.100 
way to solve jams and clear up the
Mavericks<00:02:14.730> reputation<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.690> hope<00:02:15.990> you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Mavericks reputation of it I hope you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.650 
Mavericks reputation of it I hope you
