you go to intermediate you go fit
meteors<00:04:17.459> then<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:19.360> go<00:04:19.540> right<00:04:19.570> here

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
meteors then you go right here

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.870 
meteors then you go right here
you<00:04:20.950> gotta<00:04:21.100> say<00:04:21.870> say<00:04:22.870> sampling<00:04:23.410> better<00:04:23.880> all

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
you gotta say say sampling better all

you gotta say say sampling better all
samples<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.660> multi<00:04:26.110> sample<00:04:26.320> what<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.340> just

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
samples of multi sample what you just

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.080 
samples of multi sample what you just
want<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.670> say<00:04:27.820> one<00:04:28.060> sample<00:04:28.620> or<00:04:29.620> whatever<00:04:30.090> you
