00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
skull

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.600 
skull
or<00:02:18.820> just<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.540> basic<00:02:20.080> antler<00:02:20.530> mount<00:02:20.770> you'll<00:02:21.370> want

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
or just a basic antler mount you'll want

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.690 
or just a basic antler mount you'll want
to<00:02:21.700> remove<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.210> much<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.720> hair<00:02:23.080> hide<00:02:23.700> meat

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
to remove as much of the hair hide meat

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.210 
to remove as much of the hair hide meat
and<00:02:25.060> inner<00:02:25.300> matter<00:02:25.660> as<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:25.960> can<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:27.040> don't

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
and inner matter as you can you don't

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.010 
and inner matter as you can you don't
have<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> will<00:02:28.240> save<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> ton<00:02:28.960> of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
have to but it will save you a ton of

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.630 
have to but it will save you a ton of
time<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.190> boiling<00:02:30.430> process<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.460> my

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
time in the boiling process this is my

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.800 
time in the boiling process this is my
boiling<00:02:34.120> set<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.960> fire<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.540> pot

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
boiling set up just the fire and the pot

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.220 
boiling set up just the fire and the pot
propped<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.590> two<00:02:38.980> cinder<00:02:39.370> blocks<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:41.050> I've

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
propped up on two cinder blocks and I've

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.780 
propped up on two cinder blocks and I've
received<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.590> lot<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.770> questions<00:02:42.010> about<00:02:42.460> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
received a lot of questions about the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.080 
received a lot of questions about the
antlers<00:02:43.180> will<00:02:43.420> burn<00:02:43.810> or<00:02:44.340> discolor<00:02:45.340> now<00:02:45.670> as<00:02:45.880> you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
antlers will burn or discolor now as you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.340 
antlers will burn or discolor now as you
can<00:02:46.300> see<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.570> have<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.400> rag<00:02:48.960> place<00:02:49.960> in<00:02:50.230> between

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
can see I have a rag place in between

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.470 
can see I have a rag place in between
the<00:02:50.680> antlers<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.310> pot<00:02:51.520> because<00:02:51.760> they

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
the antlers and the pot because they

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.930 
the antlers and the pot because they
will<00:02:52.750> discolor<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:54.040> they<00:02:54.190> will<00:02:54.400> burn<00:02:54.670> if<00:02:54.820> they

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
will discolor and they will burn if they

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.030 
will discolor and they will burn if they
get<00:02:55.090> too<00:02:55.240> hot<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.780> that's<00:02:56.470> something<00:02:56.920> you're

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
get too hot so that's something you're

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.620 
get too hot so that's something you're
definitely<00:02:57.370> gonna<00:02:57.700> want<00:02:57.940> pay<00:02:58.090> attention<00:02:58.450> to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
definitely gonna want pay attention to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.800 
definitely gonna want pay attention to
right<00:02:59.850> after<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> boiling<00:03:01.270> process<00:03:01.450> I

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
right after the boiling process I

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.070 
right after the boiling process I
usually<00:03:02.110> give<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.500> warm<00:03:02.800> water<00:03:03.130> soap<00:03:03.760> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
usually give it a warm water soap and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.440 
usually give it a warm water soap and
bleach<00:03:05.080> baths<00:03:05.640> take<00:03:06.640> some<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:06.970> stains<00:03:07.210> off

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
bleach baths take some of the stains off

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.290 
bleach baths take some of the stains off
the<00:03:07.600> antlers<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.560> skull<00:03:08.890> itself<00:03:09.310> after

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
the antlers and the skull itself after

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.660 
the antlers and the skull itself after
this<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.870> will<00:03:11.110> be<00:03:11.470> soaking<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.040> an<00:03:12.130> peroxide

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
this I will be soaking in an peroxide

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.810 
this I will be soaking in an peroxide
for<00:03:13.000> about<00:03:13.210> 24<00:03:13.720> hours<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.860> here<00:03:15.100> we<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.280> on<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
for about 24 hours so here we are on the

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.240 
for about 24 hours so here we are on the
hydrogen<00:03:16.240> peroxide<00:03:16.630> soaking<00:03:17.620> now<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
hydrogen peroxide soaking now the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.140 
hydrogen peroxide soaking now the
solution<00:03:18.820> aloe<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.330> used<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.900> about<00:03:20.260> 60%<00:03:21.150> water

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
solution aloe is used is about 60% water

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.130 
solution aloe is used is about 60% water
to<00:03:22.870> 40%<00:03:23.740> hydrogen<00:03:24.400> peroxide<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.210> that's<00:03:25.870> the

to 40% hydrogen peroxide and that's the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.390 
to 40% hydrogen peroxide and that's the
3%<00:03:26.920> variety<00:03:27.870> for<00:03:28.870> about<00:03:29.200> 24<00:03:29.650> hours<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.220> has

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
3% variety for about 24 hours that has

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.490 
3% variety for about 24 hours that has
always<00:03:30.580> yielded<00:03:31.090> pretty<00:03:31.780> good<00:03:31.930> results<00:03:32.320> for

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
always yielded pretty good results for

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.160 
always yielded pretty good results for
me<00:03:32.620> now<00:03:33.160> if<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.430> want<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:34.510> skull<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> little

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
me now if you want the skull a little

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.080 
me now if you want the skull a little
bit<00:03:35.320> wider<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.160> can<00:03:36.370> leave<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> little

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
bit wider then you can leave it a little

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.650 
bit wider then you can leave it a little
bit<00:03:37.270> longer<00:03:37.560> another<00:03:38.560> tip<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.390> soaking

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
bit longer another tip is in the soaking

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.440 
bit longer another tip is in the soaking
container<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.760> want<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.000> make<00:03:43.090> sure<00:03:43.300> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
container you want to make sure the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.440 
container you want to make sure the
water<00:03:43.690> level<00:03:44.050> is<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:44.590> above<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:46.060> skull

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
water level is just above the skull

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.770 
water level is just above the skull
itself<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.980> just<00:03:48.040> below<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.300> antlers

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
itself but just below the antlers

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.840 
itself but just below the antlers
because<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.560> will<00:03:50.770> bleach<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.370> antlers<00:03:51.700> as

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
because it will bleach the antlers as

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:05.800 
because it will bleach the antlers as
well

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.330 

so<00:04:06.810> there<00:04:06.990> we<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:07.500> two<00:04:07.770> different<00:04:08.190> ways

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
so there we have it two different ways

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.850 
so there we have it two different ways
that<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.940> can<00:04:09.300> now<00:04:09.420> preserve<00:04:09.870> your<00:04:10.530> hunting

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
that you can now preserve your hunting

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.500 
that you can now preserve your hunting
memories<00:04:11.220> if<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:11.910> little<00:04:12.060> bit<00:04:12.210> better

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
memories if you have a little bit better

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.420 
memories if you have a little bit better
trophy<00:04:12.960> maybe<00:04:13.710> you<00:04:13.860> want<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.100> go<00:04:14.190> with<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
trophy maybe you want to go with the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.190 
trophy maybe you want to go with the
European<00:04:14.910> skull<00:04:15.180> mount<00:04:15.390> if<00:04:15.960> you<00:04:16.050> have<00:04:16.170> a

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
European skull mount if you have a

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.729 
European skull mount if you have a
smaller<00:04:16.620> trophy<00:04:17.390> maybe<00:04:18.390> just<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.780> basic<00:04:19.380> antler

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
smaller trophy maybe just a basic antler

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.870 
smaller trophy maybe just a basic antler
mount<00:04:20.010> will<00:04:20.190> work<00:04:20.370> for<00:04:20.580> you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
mount will work for you
