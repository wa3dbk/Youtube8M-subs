00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.019
 20 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.279
 it goes 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.079
 Go 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.039
 romano moretti finally 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.699
 Your editorial editor also tried to stay in the shoulder for motors 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.570
 move 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.020
 maurizio indeed the proves as much in portugal though from the product to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.330
 pistol that the track gives you the real thing is the true heart of this old Frenchman 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.730
 it also applies because this is actually the extreme version 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.950
 sport of the clio that the enthusiasts know I know well when the engine is aspirated 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.390
 since 2000 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 it looked like 203 horses 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.520
 to fully enjoy insecurity, as Marco rightly said, because 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.370
 however driving passion does not mean 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.320
 drive without safety you need to take this product to tracks 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.050
 for the track and I have to say we tried it both me and marconi among other things 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.000
 had been the subject of a challenge to why we paraded it with a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.620
 this is the terrestrial follow focus on the next issue 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.680
 challenge that come out and very interesting because 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.800
 let's say on the same launch plate two possibilities to have fun at low 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.860
 cost 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 wii 2 two specks if tour looks under the scirocco non category 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.259
 they still have to do with it 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.459
 i have an average is a little smaller you actually for us center with the spirit from 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.180
 of the full magazine and not for nothing we have. bring to monza 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.300
 and I must say that 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.590
 the test will be reserved for the skin because the client will 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.820
 however he started por vantage ata because it is the small one 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.820
 in short, he knew how to entertain us, he knew how to entertain even though it is a small sum 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.759
 self-locking difference in front 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.100
 is. a person 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.110
 front is a naturally aspirated 91 monza aspirato so visit the anyway 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.420
 power was born to cover all the more reason the track and its habitat 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:17.209
 but it is an agile and fast machine that with a price of just over 20,000 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.769
 new euro you can take home 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.579
 and in my opinion then marco 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.909
 in the media because I also did a few laps 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.299
 at his side 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.989
 and not just from not just yourself eg a wrought island bracelet 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:34.379
 no fees night I wanted to tell you this time but now he missed him at 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.359
 seriously different from my call to the neck and on the mac and it restarts me I would be surprised 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.999
 instantly going to live abroad 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.569
 and we both enjoyed ourselves. com also two wall driving positions 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.279
 different 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.799
 beautiful his 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.349
 his rents quemque he is the cam to ride the curbs i'm away 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.620
 this is where the course takes place 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.390
 I respect the ropes of monza 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.100
 no, but apart from jokes eh eh is a machine that runs smoothly goes 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.359
 very fast you get in the ass of curiosity 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.569
 for fishing 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.569
 and it is stable 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:16.279
 it goes 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.689
 Go
