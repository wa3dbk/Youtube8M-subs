or plucking a ukulele things that we can

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.640 
or plucking a ukulele things that we can
do<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.280> chimps<00:01:38.280> can't

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
do and chimps can't

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.280 
do and chimps can't
so<00:01:40.650> chimps<00:01:41.130> who<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.850> less<00:01:42.060> gray<00:01:42.299> matter<00:01:42.329> have

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so chimps who have less gray matter have

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.399 
so chimps who have less gray matter have
fewer<00:01:43.590> motor<00:01:43.860> neurons<00:01:44.810> therefore<00:01:45.810> their

fewer motor neurons therefore their

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.230 
fewer motor neurons therefore their
motor<00:01:46.649> neurons<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:47.610> likely<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.119> be

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
motor neurons are more likely to be

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600 
motor neurons are more likely to be

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
means when they do engage their muscles

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.160 
means when they do engage their muscles
it's<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.280> all-or-nothing<00:01:53.490> response<00:01:54.299> which<00:01:54.990> we

it's an all-or-nothing response which we

control<00:01:58.740> smaller<00:01:59.159> bundles<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.390> more
