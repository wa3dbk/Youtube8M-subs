you<00:00:13.080> have<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.259> called<00:00:13.500> drill<00:00:13.740> cap<00:00:13.950> too<00:00:14.160> so

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
you have this called drill cap too so

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.220 
you have this called drill cap too so
let<00:00:14.669> me<00:00:14.730> share<00:00:14.879> how<00:00:15.000> they<00:00:15.150> work<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
let me share how they work for a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.250 
let me share how they work for a
screenshot<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> like<00:00:17.760> lease

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
screenshot this is the one I like lease

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.689 
screenshot this is the one I like lease
the<00:00:19.260> reason<00:00:19.470> why<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.070> least<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.490> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the reason why I like at least is that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
the reason why I like at least is that
it<00:00:21.060> does<00:00:21.599> some<00:00:21.750> really<00:00:21.869> funky<00:00:22.140> things<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.740> is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it does some really funky things one is

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.050 
it does some really funky things one is
they've<00:00:23.099> got<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.400> option<00:00:23.789> where<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:23.970> can

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
they've got this option where you can

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.910 
they've got this option where you can
invert<00:00:24.480> red<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.960> blue<00:00:25.230> colors<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.740> don't<00:00:25.859> know

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
invert red and blue colors I don't know

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
invert red and blue colors I don't know
why<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> don't

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
why you want that but if you don't

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.240 
why you want that but if you don't
select<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.529> does<00:00:28.890> invert<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
select that it actually does invert it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
select that it actually does invert it
so<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.820> i'll<00:00:29.939> show<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.150> how<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.390> works<00:00:30.570> so

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
so and i'll show you how that works so

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.200 
so and i'll show you how that works so
first<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:31.769> we'll<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.040> we'll<00:00:32.340> test<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
first thing we'll do is we'll test the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
first thing we'll do is we'll test the
shake<00:00:33.540> feature<00:00:33.810> so<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> shake<00:00:34.410> means<00:00:34.620> that

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
shake feature so the shake means that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.910 
shake feature so the shake means that
when<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> notices<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> shake<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.960> computer

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
when it notices a shake on your computer

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
when it notices a shake on your computer
you<00:00:37.950> don't<00:00:38.010> snap<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> screenshot<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.450> let's<00:00:39.690> set

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you don't snap a screenshot so let's set

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.920 
you don't snap a screenshot so let's set
that<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.590> shake<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.270> website<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that to shake and go to a website and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.220 
that to shake and go to a website and
we'll<00:00:43.469> shake<00:00:43.770> away<00:00:45.620> yeah<00:00:46.620> okay<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.230> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
we'll shake away yeah okay so it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.500 
we'll shake away yeah okay so it's
taking<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.739> screenshot<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.760> let's<00:00:51.390> look

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
taking a screenshot there and let's look

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.689 
taking a screenshot there and let's look
at<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.809> screenshot<00:00:52.760> okay<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> screenshots

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
at that screenshot okay I screenshots

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
at that screenshot okay I screenshots
you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> colors<00:00:57.390> are<00:00:57.539> off<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you can see the colors are off so it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.979 
you can see the colors are off so it
actually<00:00:58.559> inverted<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.280> colors<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> get

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
actually inverted the colors so to get

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.319 
actually inverted the colors so to get
that<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.430> correct<00:01:02.760> color<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that to be the correct color so you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.320 
that to be the correct color so you
actually<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> select<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.940> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
actually have to go and select that to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330 
actually have to go and select that to
not<00:01:06.570> invert<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> colors<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
not invert the colors and it's kind of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980 
not invert the colors and it's kind of
weird<00:01:08.550> now<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.300> second<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.660> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.870> take

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
weird now the second way you can take

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.470 
weird now the second way you can take
pictures<00:01:10.320> by<00:01:10.530> taking<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.130> delayed<00:01:11.700> screenshots

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
pictures by taking a delayed screenshots

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.450 
pictures by taking a delayed screenshots
on<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.870> case<00:01:13.050> five<00:01:13.320> seconds<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.920> trigger

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
on this case five seconds so trigger

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.960 
on this case five seconds so trigger
that<00:01:14.960> go<00:01:15.960> back<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.410> website<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.760> then<00:01:20.760> we'll

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that go back to website and then we'll

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.860 
that go back to website and then we'll
go<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> gallery<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.300> that<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> one

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
go to gallery and so that was the one

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.240 
go to gallery and so that was the one
that<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.050> took<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> shake<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.040> it's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that I took with the shake so it's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.090 
that I took with the shake so it's
inverted<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.730> colors<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.740> here's<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> one

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
inverted the colors and here's the one

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.140 
inverted the colors and here's the one
that<00:01:29.310> looks<00:01:29.460> fine<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.120> that<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:30.870> taken<00:01:31.230> by

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
that looks fine and that was taken by

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.010 
that looks fine and that was taken by
the<00:01:33.150> timer<00:01:34.190> alright<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> few<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.900> options

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the timer alright so few more options

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.570 
the timer alright so few more options
here<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.100> select<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:39.210> bitmap<00:01:39.950> PNG<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:40.980> JPEG

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
here you can select a bitmap PNG or JPEG

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.450 
here you can select a bitmap PNG or JPEG
for<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.420> file<00:01:42.690> type<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> checked<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
for the file type and I checked on the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.370 
for the file type and I checked on the
one<00:01:44.790> side<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.210> loaded<00:01:45.480> all<00:01:45.600> three<00:01:45.810> types<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
one side on loaded all three types and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.240 
one side on loaded all three types and
the<00:01:46.710> bitmaps<00:01:47.280> are<00:01:47.430> about<00:01:47.640> 1500<00:01:48.450> k<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.860> PNG's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the bitmaps are about 1500 k the PNG's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.840 
the bitmaps are about 1500 k the PNG's
are<00:01:50.370> about<00:01:50.520> 250<00:01:50.970> k<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.480> the<00:01:51.570> JPEGs<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.850> 120

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
are about 250 k and the JPEGs about 120

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.370 
are about 250 k and the JPEGs about 120
case<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.300> gives<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> an<00:01:54.660> idea<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.080> size

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
case that gives you an idea of the size

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
case that gives you an idea of the size
of<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.800> screen<00:01:56.280> shots<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.790> come<00:01:56.910> up<00:01:57.060> from

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of the screen shots that come up from

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.590 
of the screen shots that come up from
this<00:01:57.360> application<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.150> that's<00:02:00.390> about

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
this application so I think that's about

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.480 
this application so I think that's about
it<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.050> it's<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.290> pretty<00:02:01.500> straightforward<00:02:01.680> app

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it so it's a pretty straightforward app

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.470 
it so it's a pretty straightforward app
and<00:02:03.380> one<00:02:04.380> problem<00:02:04.590> i<00:02:04.710> did<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.280> like

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
and one problem i did have is like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.479 
and one problem i did have is like
whatever<00:02:06.480> I<00:02:06.570> set<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.230> shake<00:02:07.650> or<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.220> shake

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
whatever I set here shake or not shake

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.820 
whatever I set here shake or not shake
it<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.350> responded<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> shake

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it actually just responded to the shake

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.350 
it actually just responded to the shake
so<00:02:11.790> I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
so I

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.850 
so I
going<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.810> kill<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.590> doesn't

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
going to have to kill that so it doesn't

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.100 
going to have to kill that so it doesn't
interfere<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> next<00:02:15.820> program<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.930> i'm

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
interfere with the next program that i'm

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.750 
interfere with the next program that i'm
going<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.650> show<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.810> screenshot<00:02:20.560> kill<00:02:21.490> so

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
going to show you so screenshot kill so

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.890 
going to show you so screenshot kill so
we<00:02:21.850> know<00:02:21.970> that's<00:02:22.210> not<00:02:22.300> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.660> triggered

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
we know that's not going to be triggered

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.560 
we know that's not going to be triggered
at<00:02:23.140> all<00:02:23.260> when<00:02:23.470> we<00:02:23.500> shake<00:02:23.830> okay<00:02:24.390> second<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.420> is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
at all when we shake okay second one is

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.090 
at all when we shake okay second one is
drilled<00:02:25.810> cap<00:02:26.050> too<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.410> i<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.770> after<00:02:27.040> a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
drilled cap too and i like this after a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.720 
drilled cap too and i like this after a
little<00:02:27.190> better<00:02:28.050> okay<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.350> got<00:02:29.730> three

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
little better okay so it's got three

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.200 
little better okay so it's got three
capture<00:02:31.090> modes<00:02:31.330> shake<00:02:31.990> trick<00:02:32.470> timer<00:02:32.740> and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
capture modes shake trick timer and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.700 
capture modes shake trick timer and
notification<00:02:34.210> trigger<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.290> shake<00:02:35.470> works

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
notification trigger so the shake works

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.640 
notification trigger so the shake works
the<00:02:35.800> same<00:02:35.830> way<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.690> just<00:02:37.900> see<00:02:38.290> how

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
the same way and you can just see how

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.020 
the same way and you can just see how
that<00:02:38.860> works<00:02:39.040> by<00:02:39.930> clicking<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.050> web<00:02:41.260> but

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
that works by clicking on the web but

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.980 
that works by clicking on the web but
probably<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.180> one<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.480> i<00:02:43.540> couldn't<00:02:43.870> actually

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
probably this one is i couldn't actually

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.530 
probably this one is i couldn't actually
get<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.470> shake<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.980> register<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.180> no<00:02:46.420> matter

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
get this shake to register so no matter

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.050 
get this shake to register so no matter
how<00:02:46.720> much<00:02:46.900> i<00:02:47.050> shook<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.440> device<00:02:47.790> time<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.820> shake

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
how much i shook the device time I shake

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.490 
how much i shook the device time I shake
it<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.330> now<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.870> wouldn't<00:02:50.350> take<00:02:50.470> a

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
it and now just wouldn't take a

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.140 
it and now just wouldn't take a
screenshot<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:53.010> let's<00:02:54.010> ignore<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.370> one<00:02:54.700> it's

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
screenshot so let's ignore that one it's

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.090 
screenshot so let's ignore that one it's
not<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.330> good<00:02:55.570> feature<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.560> me<00:02:56.680> anyway<00:02:56.920> don't

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
not a good feature for me anyway don't

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.590 
not a good feature for me anyway don't
like<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.370> shake<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.790> device<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.420> take<00:02:58.570> a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
like to shake the device to take a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.140 
like to shake the device to take a
picture<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.709> one<00:02:59.910> caption<00:03:00.910> what<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.090> do

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
picture but the one caption what I do

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.510 
picture but the one caption what I do
like<00:03:01.480> they<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> timer<00:03:02.620> trigger<00:03:03.190> just

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
like they have the timer trigger just

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.580 
like they have the timer trigger just
like<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.820> other<00:03:03.970> app<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.290> they<00:03:05.350> have<00:03:05.470> this

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
like the other app but they have this

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.190 
like the other app but they have this
notification<00:03:05.920> trigger<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.670> really<00:03:06.970> neat<00:03:07.200> so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
notification trigger just really neat so

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.780 
notification trigger just really neat so
how<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.560> works<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:09.010> whenever<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.550> are<00:03:09.640> at<00:03:09.760> a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
how it works is whenever you are at a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.729 
how it works is whenever you are at a
page<00:03:10.630> or<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.959> screen<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.470> want<00:03:11.650> to

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
page or a screen that you want to

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.810 
page or a screen that you want to
capture<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.370> pull<00:03:12.550> on<00:03:12.580> your

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
capture you just pull on your

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.229 
capture you just pull on your
notification<00:03:13.420> bar<00:03:14.459> click<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.700> trigger<00:03:15.940> and

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
notification bar click the trigger and

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.180 
notification bar click the trigger and
that's<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:17.190> takes<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.310> picture<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.860> let's<00:03:20.860> see

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
that's it takes a picture and let's see

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.940 
that's it takes a picture and let's see
you<00:03:21.340> know<00:03:21.400> their<00:03:21.580> options<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.709> save

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you know their options you can save

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.430 
you know their options you can save
images<00:03:27.340> as<00:03:27.549> jpg<00:03:27.970> or<00:03:28.150> PNG<00:03:28.420> they<00:03:29.110> don't<00:03:29.260> offer

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
images as jpg or PNG they don't offer

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.380 
images as jpg or PNG they don't offer
the<00:03:29.709> bitmap<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.700> other<00:03:30.820> application

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
the bitmap like the other application

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.170 
the bitmap like the other application
but<00:03:31.600> it's<00:03:32.140> not<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.380> format<00:03:32.739> i<00:03:32.830> would<00:03:32.980> use<00:03:33.190> you

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
but it's not a format i would use you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.620 
but it's not a format i would use you
can<00:03:34.299> auto<00:03:34.510> register<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.940> app<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.360> it's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
can auto register the app so that it's

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.330 
can auto register the app so that it's
always<00:03:38.049> on<00:03:38.230> whenever<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.830> reboot<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.310> device

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
always on whenever you reboot the device

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.310 
always on whenever you reboot the device
and<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.940> can<00:03:40.060> tell<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.480> where<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.690> save<00:03:41.080> it<00:03:41.230> on

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
and you can tell it where to save it on

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.560 
and you can tell it where to save it on
your<00:03:41.350> SD<00:03:41.739> card<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.130> also<00:03:43.030> i'll<00:03:43.239> give<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.420> a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
your SD card and also i'll give it a

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.990 
your SD card and also i'll give it a
specific<00:03:43.720> file<00:03:44.260> name<00:03:44.470> prefix<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.190> pretty

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
specific file name prefix so pretty

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.310

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.580 
simple lap and this is the one I like
better<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.489> two<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:48.850> let's<00:03:48.970> look<00:03:49.150> at<00:03:49.330> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
better of the two and let's look at the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.130 
better of the two and let's look at the
output<00:03:50.590> for<00:03:50.799> that<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:53.040> back

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.020 

gallery<00:03:57.140> didn't<00:03:57.350> pick<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.530> up<00:03:57.740> yet<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.730> let's

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
gallery didn't pick it up yet so let's

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.630 
gallery didn't pick it up yet so let's
just<00:03:59.090> go<00:03:59.270> to<00:03:59.360> my<00:03:59.510> file<00:03:59.750> manager<00:04:00.640> and

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
just go to my file manager and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.490 
just go to my file manager and
screenshots<00:04:02.600> up<00:04:03.700> drill<00:04:04.700> cap<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:06.110> that's<00:04:06.320> the

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
screenshots up drill cap so that's the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.970 
screenshots up drill cap so that's the
picture<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.190> took<00:04:08.620> okay<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:09.680> that's<00:04:09.920> a

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
picture that I took okay so that's a

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.410 
picture that I took okay so that's a
quick<00:04:10.100> review<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.970> two<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.180> would

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
quick review of the two I would

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.660 
quick review of the two I would
recommend<00:04:11.840> drill<00:04:12.230> cap<00:04:12.470> too<00:04:12.770> just<00:04:13.280> because<00:04:13.550> it

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
recommend drill cap too just because it

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.430 
recommend drill cap too just because it
has<00:04:13.820> that<00:04:14.000> notification<00:04:14.450> trigger<00:04:15.020> so<00:04:15.320> it's

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
has that notification trigger so it's

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.069 
has that notification trigger so it's
always<00:04:15.650> on<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.239> one<00:04:17.600> click<00:04:17.900> away

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
always on and you just one click away

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.949 
always on and you just one click away
from<00:04:18.519> triggering<00:04:19.519> a<00:04:19.700> screen<00:04:19.970> capture<00:04:20.239> but

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
from triggering a screen capture but

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.930 
from triggering a screen capture but
both<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.410> apps<00:04:21.560> work<00:04:21.890> fairly<00:04:22.370> well<00:04:22.490> except

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
both of the apps work fairly well except

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.970 
both of the apps work fairly well except
in<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.180> shake<00:04:23.390> mode<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:24.080> wasn't<00:04:24.260> happy<00:04:24.860> with

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
in the shake mode I it wasn't happy with

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.750 
in the shake mode I it wasn't happy with
both<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.220> them<00:04:25.460> hope<00:04:26.300> this<00:04:26.450> has<00:04:26.600> been<00:04:26.630> helpful
