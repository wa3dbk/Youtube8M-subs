out<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.060> day<00:02:10.390> yesterday<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:11.140> about<00:02:11.349> 7:00

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
out all day yesterday it's about 7:00

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.050 
out all day yesterday it's about 7:00
a.m.<00:02:11.770> on<00:02:12.010> Sunday<00:02:12.340> morning<00:02:12.370> here<00:02:12.849> we're<00:02:12.970> gonna

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
a.m. on Sunday morning here we're gonna

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.500 
a.m. on Sunday morning here we're gonna
go<00:02:13.209> out<00:02:13.330> again<00:02:13.360> today<00:02:14.849> total<00:02:15.849> amount<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.239> grip

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
go out again today total amount of grip

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.020 
go out again today total amount of grip
keep<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.140> mind<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.709> multiple<00:02:18.580> compound

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
keep in mind this is a multiple compound

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.210 
keep in mind this is a multiple compound
tire<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.690> you've<00:02:19.840> got<00:02:20.019> softer<00:02:20.500> tire<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:21.069> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
tire so you've got softer tire on the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.250 
tire so you've got softer tire on the
edge<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.450> edge<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> tire<00:02:22.989> and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
edge of the on the edge of the tire and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.559 
edge of the on the edge of the tire and
then<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.620> firmer<00:02:23.980> compound<00:02:24.459> along<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.150> center

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
then a firmer compound along the center

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.050 
then a firmer compound along the center
portion<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.230> that's<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.340> help<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
portion and that's going to help the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.950 
portion and that's going to help the
tire<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.420> maintain

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
tire to maintain

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.840 
tire to maintain
a<00:02:29.020> nice<00:02:29.380> round<00:02:29.710> profile<00:02:30.250> throughout<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.700> life

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
a nice round profile throughout the life

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.520 
a nice round profile throughout the life
of<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.900> know<00:02:32.020> especially<00:02:32.350> if<00:02:32.410> you're

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
of it you know especially if you're

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.630 
of it you know especially if you're
using<00:02:32.650> your<00:02:32.860> tire<00:02:33.040> for<00:02:33.250> more<00:02:33.430> than<00:02:33.610> just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
using your tire for more than just

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.870 
using your tire for more than just
twisties<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:36.010> Canyon<00:02:36.370> carving<00:02:36.760> and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
twisties and you know Canyon carving and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.610 
twisties and you know Canyon carving and
even<00:02:37.060> track<00:02:37.270> days<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:37.900> you're<00:02:38.200> commuting

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
even track days if you're commuting

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.610 
even track days if you're commuting
occasionally<00:02:39.520> or<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.870> know<00:02:40.960> do<00:02:41.170> some<00:02:41.320> highway

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
occasionally or you know do some highway

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.410 
occasionally or you know do some highway
miles<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.980> get<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.340> fun<00:02:42.490> roads<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.390> know

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
miles to get to the fun roads you know

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.020 
miles to get to the fun roads you know
that<00:02:43.690> harder<00:02:44.110> Center<00:02:44.680> compound<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:45.910> to

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
that harder Center compound is going to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.540 
that harder Center compound is going to
help<00:02:46.240> keep<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.290> crown<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.130> tire<00:02:48.310> from

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
help keep the crown of the tire from

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.730 
help keep the crown of the tire from
flat<00:02:48.850> spotting<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.290> take<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.500> look

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
flat spotting and if you take a look

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.470 
flat spotting and if you take a look
there<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.370> can<00:02:51.520> see<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.820> still<00:02:52.090> got<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.300> nice

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
there you can see it's still got a nice

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.600 
there you can see it's still got a nice
round<00:02:52.810> profile<00:02:53.320> obviously<00:02:53.530> I<00:02:54.100> hit<00:02:54.490> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
round profile obviously I hit the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.250 
round profile obviously I hit the
mountains<00:02:54.940> last<00:02:55.180> weekend<00:02:55.690> I'm<00:02:55.810> at<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.020> track

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
mountains last weekend I'm at the track

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.250 
mountains last weekend I'm at the track
this<00:02:56.410> weekend<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.720> have<00:02:58.780> done<00:02:58.990> quite<00:02:59.080> a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
this weekend so but I have done quite a

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.660 
this weekend so but I have done quite a
bit<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.410> highway<00:02:59.740> on<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.070> as<00:03:00.160> well<00:03:00.340> I've<00:03:00.520> been

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
bit of highway on it as well I've been

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.580 
bit of highway on it as well I've been
commuting<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.270> it's<00:03:01.660> maintained<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.170> very<00:03:02.200> nice

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
commuting so it's maintained a very nice

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.730 
commuting so it's maintained a very nice
profile<00:03:03.160> turning<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.180> these<00:03:04.330> tires<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:05.020> very

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
profile turning on these tires is very

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.530 
profile turning on these tires is very
predictable<00:03:06.160> like<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.700> mentioned<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.120> part<00:03:07.330> two

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
predictable like I mentioned in part two

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.130 
predictable like I mentioned in part two
it<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:07.990> kind<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.320> rolls<00:03:09.250> into<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.760> turn<00:03:10.140> you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
it just kind of rolls into the turn you

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.630 
it just kind of rolls into the turn you
do<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.680> turn<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.010> bike<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.490> doesn't

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
do have to turn the bike in it doesn't

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.000 
do have to turn the bike in it doesn't
just<00:03:12.910> fall<00:03:13.210> over<00:03:13.320> which<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.440> kind<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.710> like<00:03:14.860> you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
just fall over which I kind of like you

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.290 
just fall over which I kind of like you
know<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.130> kind<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.430> got<00:03:15.580> used<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.000> right<00:03:16.150> away

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
know I kind of got used to it right away

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.030 
know I kind of got used to it right away
some<00:03:16.780> tires<00:03:16.990> take<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.260> little<00:03:17.530> longer<00:03:17.710> to<00:03:17.920> get

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
some tires take a little longer to get

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.450 
some tires take a little longer to get
used<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:19.240> one<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:20.530> kind<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.770> felt<00:03:21.250> very

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
used to this one just kind of felt very

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.980 
used to this one just kind of felt very
natural<00:03:21.670> turns<00:03:22.210> in<00:03:22.390> smoothly<00:03:22.720> and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
natural turns in smoothly and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.690 
natural turns in smoothly and
predictably<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.680> then<00:03:24.160> just<00:03:24.400> kind<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.580> have

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
predictably and then just kind of have

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.040 
predictably and then just kind of have
to<00:03:24.760> pick<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.060> bike<00:03:25.210> back<00:03:25.420> up<00:03:25.630> out<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.990> the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
to pick the bike back up out of the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.260 
to pick the bike back up out of the
turns<00:03:26.370> got<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.580> gas<00:03:27.700> pretty<00:03:28.060> hard

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
turns got on the gas pretty hard

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.080 
turns got on the gas pretty hard
yesterday<00:03:28.510> coming<00:03:29.080> out<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.290> some<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.470> these

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
yesterday coming out of some of these

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.740 
yesterday coming out of some of these
sweepers<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:32.650> know<00:03:32.740> even<00:03:33.070> at<00:03:33.750> higher

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
sweepers and you know even at higher

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.940 
sweepers and you know even at higher
lean<00:03:35.050> angles<00:03:35.470> no<00:03:36.690> slips<00:03:37.690> at<00:03:37.960> all<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.650> mean<00:03:38.680> it

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
lean angles no slips at all I mean it

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.920 
lean angles no slips at all I mean it
was<00:03:39.070> just<00:03:39.100> planted<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.060> rocketed<00:03:40.510> me<00:03:40.660> right

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
was just planted and rocketed me right

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.510 
was just planted and rocketed me right
out<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.260> corner<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:41.830> it's<00:03:42.010> very<00:03:42.220> cool

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
out of the corner so it's very cool

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.790 
out of the corner so it's very cool
actually<00:03:43.480> captured<00:03:43.870> some<00:03:44.050> ride<00:03:44.230> footage<00:03:44.590> so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
actually captured some ride footage so

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.960 
actually captured some ride footage so
we'll<00:03:44.920> throw<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.130> up<00:03:45.430> at<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.580> end<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:45.910> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
we'll throw that up at the end of the
