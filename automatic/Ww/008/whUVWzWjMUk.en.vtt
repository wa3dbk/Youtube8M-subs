00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
concerns when we first got to play the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.230 
concerns when we first got to play the
game<00:04:53.740> was<00:04:54.130> where<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.460> Titans<00:04:54.910> going<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.150> be

overpowered compared to the pilots but

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.860 
overpowered compared to the pilots but
you<00:04:57.580> find<00:04:57.880> that<00:04:58.000> because<00:04:58.270> there<00:04:58.390> are<00:04:58.420> so<00:04:58.510> many

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
you find that because there are so many

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.230
