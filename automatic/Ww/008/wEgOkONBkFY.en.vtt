00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.350
 hello friend and repairman am technician mt 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.039
 thomson and today I bring another tip 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.320
 for you 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.439
 tip number 3 thermostatic valve line 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.960
 fit on the line fit motor spin and fary 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.759
 when the motor runs without hot air 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.900
 uses a thermostatic valve with 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.179
 just a pipe 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.060
 however with two holes here goes a sensor 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.730
 is the one who forms the map of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.969
 4053 injection and a temperature sensor 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.539
 of the panel is detail when lamp is a 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.520
 thermal switch is code 30 46 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.149
 This was the pointer on the panel if it goes 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.489
 use the 3041 red color and when 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.100
 the car has hot air is the same valve 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.109
 Thermostatic but with two pipes that right 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.760
 here it continues hot air Pro 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.629
 temperature sensor and the club 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 electronic 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.239
 but we also have the same valve 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.640
 without hot air with a hole 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.860
 there already is another sensor is a sensor does 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.380
 double function it has the injection line 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.590
 and two injection terminals in one 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.710
 terminal for panel code 40 33 gmt 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.570
 thomson careful with the application on the line 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.580
 fit is very diversified application 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.470
 when the faithful engine is a model of 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.150
 thermostatic valve when the engine 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.520
 It's another model that I'm going to show. 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.430
 now in the line fire is already another model 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.850
 thermostatic valve that accompanies the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.030
 green electronic club 4056 or with 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.920
 with the 4099 bracket as well as 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.850
 complex complicated is the application of 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.410
 line fit and do not forget the 1.6 engines 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.780
 16v is another carcass model with the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.110
 same procedure with a hole or two 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.110
 holes 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.530
 stay tuned in the nt thomson tips that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.530
 We will always have news for you.
