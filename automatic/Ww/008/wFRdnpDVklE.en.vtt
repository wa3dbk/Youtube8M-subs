00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
believe it's called prepping for

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.140 
believe it's called prepping for
playoffs<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.250> that<00:00:51.280> had<00:00:51.790> a<00:00:51.820> lot<00:00:51.970> of<00:00:52.000> people

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
playoffs so that had a lot of people

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.640 
playoffs so that had a lot of people
questioning<00:00:52.630> will<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:52.990> be<00:00:53.080> a<00:00:53.110> team<00:00:53.380> of<00:00:53.410> week

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
questioning will it be a team of week

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.430 
questioning will it be a team of week
for<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:53.950> last<00:00:53.980> week<00:00:54.810> so<00:00:55.810> this<00:00:56.020> could<00:00:56.200> possibly

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
for the last week so this could possibly

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.680 
for the last week so this could possibly
would<00:00:56.920> be<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.250> last<00:00:57.460> batch<00:00:57.940> for<00:00:58.360> team<00:00:58.570> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
would be the last batch for team the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.810 
would be the last batch for team the
week<00:00:58.870> because<00:00:59.860> we<00:01:00.070> just<00:01:00.310> finished<00:01:00.640> off<00:01:00.760> the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
week because we just finished off the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.000 
week because we just finished off the
regular<00:01:01.090> season<00:01:01.560> we<00:01:02.560> are<00:01:02.710> going<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
regular season we are going the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.340 
regular season we are going the
postseason<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.670> playoffs<00:01:04.030> but<00:01:04.659> it's<00:01:05.110> going<00:01:05.290> to

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
postseason to playoffs but it's going to

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.039 
postseason to playoffs but it's going to
be<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> little<00:01:05.860> bit<00:01:06.040> harder<00:01:06.369> to<00:01:06.720> pick<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.750> full

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
be a little bit harder to pick a full

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.350 
be a little bit harder to pick a full
roster<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:09.460> team<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.759> week<00:01:09.909> maybe<00:01:10.090> they'll

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
roster for team the week maybe they'll

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.770 
roster for team the week maybe they'll
have<00:01:10.509> some<00:01:10.570> may<00:01:10.750> be<00:01:10.810> something<00:01:11.050> different<00:01:12.780> but

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780
