hpi so fearing that I Mickey switched
into<00:00:20.730> my<00:00:20.910> bronze<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.480> he<00:00:21.960> predicts<00:00:22.260> that

into my bronze on as he predicts that

very nicely under going right for his

very nicely under going right for his
stealth<00:00:24.150> rocks<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> max<00:00:25.439> attack

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
stealth rocks so I'm a max attack

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.349 
stealth rocks so I'm a max attack
Muslims<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.430> go<00:00:26.519> right<00:00:26.670> for<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> earthquake

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
Muslims can go right for the earthquake

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.700 
Muslims can go right for the earthquake
doing<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.750> would<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.080> off<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> decent

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
doing that would it get off a decent

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.779 
doing that would it get off a decent
chunk<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.980> whatever<00:00:29.160> he<00:00:29.310> switched<00:00:29.550> into

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
chunk on whatever he switched into

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.730 
chunk on whatever he switched into
barring<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.630> his<00:00:30.810> gyarados<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.500> lodi

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
barring like his gyarados and in lodi

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.810 
barring like his gyarados and in lodi
ass<00:00:31.890> would<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.309> switching<00:00:32.610> him<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
ass would not be switching him the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
ass would not be switching him the
bronze<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.510> hands<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.530> into

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
bronze on so hands are going out into

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920 
bronze on so hands are going out into
his<00:00:35.250> pollito<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:36.030> based<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.420> his<00:00:36.510> damage<00:00:36.809> I'm

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
his pollito now based on his damage I'm

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
his pollito now based on his damage I'm
thinking<00:00:37.290> he<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.500> offensive<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.460> he<00:00:38.610> does<00:00:38.850> show

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
thinking he is offensive so he does show

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.119 
thinking he is offensive so he does show
the<00:00:39.329> leftover<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.320> he's<00:00:40.800> actually<00:00:40.920> an

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the leftover so he's actually an

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
the leftover so he's actually an
offensive<00:00:41.579> lefties<00:00:42.059> politoed<00:00:42.570> he's<00:00:42.780> gonna<00:00:42.899> he

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
offensive lefties politoed he's gonna he

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.450 
offensive lefties politoed he's gonna he
would<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.260> hired<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> pump<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.309> for

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
would be hired to pump as I can go for

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
would be hired to pump as I can go for
the<00:00:44.520> earthquake<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.539> brings<00:00:45.750> him

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the earthquake which actually brings him

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
the earthquake which actually brings him
down<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> point<00:00:46.710> where<00:00:46.860> he<00:00:47.160> knocks<00:00:47.430> me<00:00:47.700> out

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
down to the point where he knocks me out

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
down to the point where he knocks me out
right<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> tea<00:00:49.410> tart<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
right here I can go out to tea tart and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
right here I can go out to tea tart and
pursuit<00:00:50.129> trapping<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.629> wanted<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
pursuit trapping or if I wanted to I

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
pursuit trapping or if I wanted to I
could<00:00:52.379> switching<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> slobo<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
could switching the slobo right here and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.920 
could switching the slobo right here and
knock<00:00:53.760> him<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.360> my<00:00:54.449> attacks<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
knock him out with one of my attacks so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.540 
knock him out with one of my attacks so
figuring<00:00:55.289> he<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:55.530> predict<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.160> would

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
figuring he would predict that and would

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.060 
figuring he would predict that and would
switch<00:00:56.820> into<00:00:57.090> jirachi<00:00:57.390> end<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
switch into jirachi end up going for the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
switch into jirachi end up going for the
trick<00:00:59.340> room<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.730> he<00:01:00.449> doesn't<00:01:00.629> switching<00:01:01.079> out

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
trick room as he doesn't switching out

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.569 
trick room as he doesn't switching out
to<00:01:01.289> rachi<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:01.680> means<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.340> off<00:01:02.430> an

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
to rachi which means i can get off an

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
to rachi which means i can get off an
earthquake<00:01:03.059> hopefully<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.290> damage

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
earthquake hopefully do a lot of damage

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.960 
earthquake hopefully do a lot of damage
though<00:01:04.769> he<00:01:04.920> does<00:01:05.100> pack<00:01:05.339> these<00:01:05.489> sugar<00:01:05.760> which

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
though he does pack these sugar which

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
though he does pack these sugar which
means<00:01:06.210> he's<00:01:06.659> gonna<00:01:06.750> take<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.290> reasonably

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
means he's gonna take that reasonably

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.380 
means he's gonna take that reasonably
well<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.549> knock<00:01:08.760> me<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
hoping that this dragon pulse would be

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.210 
hoping that this dragon pulse would be
enough<00:04:31.729> to<00:04:32.060> take<00:04:32.419> out<00:04:32.600> my<00:04:32.930> teat<00:04:33.470> are<00:04:33.650> but<00:04:33.949> I<00:04:33.979> am

actually able to survive and I was
actually<00:04:35.660> hoping<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.260> he<00:04:36.320> would<00:04:36.440> knock<00:04:36.620> me

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650

out<00:04:36.830> because<00:04:37.100> had<00:04:37.490> he<00:04:37.520> knocked<00:04:37.790> me<00:04:37.970> out<00:04:38.030> there

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
out because had he knocked me out there

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.030 
out because had he knocked me out there

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
I can go on to my Gliscor go right for

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.080 
I can go on to my Gliscor go right for

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
like he ended up doing because if I
