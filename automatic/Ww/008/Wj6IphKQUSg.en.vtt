 Hello Welcome to the cup cake poisoning 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:21.020
 This time we will introduce a mini bouquet cupcake decoration of roses 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.020
 Make a rose bouquet with prachoco and decorate the cup business condition 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.020
 We introduce necessary materials and tools this time 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:32.700
 Constarch or now flaver 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.640
 The top of the cupcakes was dome- shaped 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.980
 This method is explained in detail in another video 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:48.820
 Please by all means try to check those who in the description field Satoshi not seen yet so keep high Works 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:53.570
 We prepared 4 colors of pracho purple pink green and red 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:57.290
 Only white is Motoyama and of course you can also use plastic chocolate 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.910
 Cotton swab or ordinary cotton swab for Honda 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.330
 Table Knife Marui Dies Here the diameter is 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.490
 4.2 is a thing of centimeters 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.710
 Let's get started 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.590
 At first we finish the surface of cupcake like quilted dough 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.560
 Use the life load 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.560
 There is a dedicated tool, but use a knife 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:33.210
 Because you want to quilting fabric and draw a line to make a person Shi is this also sex a little diagonally 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 Be sure to pull back to the end of the cupcake 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.120
 This is done 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.650
 It looks like the head of the melon bread 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:50.120
 Please prepare by hand if the end with this column floats a little 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:53.550
 This is ok Next we will make a bouquet 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.320
 Make from a small rose flower 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:02.510
 Stretch out from red plachoco 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:07.550
 We make red and pink roses this time, but please make something of your favorite color 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:15.280
 I use plachoco, but of course you can use it with this column 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.280
 I use this one because plastic chocolate is easier to eat with fondant and coloring is better. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.450
 Please cut in a band if you extend the prachoco 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:30.650
 Make two reds and three pinks 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.010
 The pink used for the belly is a little darker than the pink fondant on the cupcake 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.010
 is 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.780
 Create a belly in 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:49.150
 Let's make quickly because plastic chocolate melts with heat of hand 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.430
 Also wound round and round plastic chocolate cut into strip 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.019
 If I lose everything I will pick it up 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.019
 This is the completion of the rose 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.520
 When I make a wave, I make a few waves 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.520
 You can finish server Rappoku 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.290
 We now have 5 balum flowers 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.219
 The following creates a stalk 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.000
 After the green plachoco , it takes a fog and comes with the bridge 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:41.180
 Please make 5 air 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:47.209
 As I say again, let's work quickly because plastic chocolate is easy to melt 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.519
 As it is hard to melt with confusion, it doesn't matter if you touch it for a little longer time, but when it gets dry 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.319
 It may be cracked 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.120
 On the other hand, prachoco does not stick to tick over time, but a little 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.640
 You may receive 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.060
 There is a move to put a good tent on both 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.530
 Let's use properly depending on purpose 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.660
 If this tutorial is liked by all means to the channel registration of cup cake recording 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.280
 Please give me 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:19.070
 Update new videos twice a week 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.030
 I don't have to worry so much now because the air length is not equal here, so I will cut and align it later 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.890
 Is also ok 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.890
 Then extend the white fondant 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:35.280
 Cut a circle using a die 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:40.340
 Turn over and place a rose flower on the side with corn starch 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.870
 Than less likely to stick with the corn starch it is attached to when to put the last cup cake 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.139
 Don't forget to turn it over 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.720
 I press a little when I 'm hungry and stick to the land 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:56.470
 Next I put on a red rose 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.470
 Please tilt a little so that the belly is facing the front 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:09.449
 When you put three roses you put the other one stage rose on it 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:13.879
 This will make it three-dimensional and make the bouquet plump 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.879
 When you are back next will take care 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.919
 Ms. goods put you Japan on the under in the same way as bra 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:36.600
 If you have the whole country , cut it here, but do n't cut the white mess 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:40.000
 Please cut off where you left Honda 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:44.010
 I use purple plachoco here 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.010
 It will be a ribbon to bundle the formation 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.410
 Take an appropriate amount and stretch it in the same way as with stems 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.410
 Cut in half 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.610
 Let's push up the bouquet 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.990
 Wrapped rose flower with white fondant 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:10.889
 If you put a purple ribbon on it, the remaining part will be down. 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:15.800
 Please make sure that the top of the rose flower and stem is not visible. 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:21.800
 I will hold it from above so that the ribbon can not be removed at the end 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:27.169
 Now you have a mini booty and you're done if you put it on the cupcake too 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.220
 Honda and he are different from prachoco , so I don't stick, so just put a little water 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.610
 Please fix 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.610
 Thank you for seeing if you enjoyed it
