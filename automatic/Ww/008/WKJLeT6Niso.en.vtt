00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.020
 once on the moon an unusual baby was born 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 I was born and it happened that he got 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.410
 where I found a lot of new friends 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.490
 hello and here's what happened next we 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.490
 by you now and find out 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.610
 then I fashioned scales grandfather 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.059
 but something I do not deal with them 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.730
 can 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.980
 help you of course see what scales I have 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.890
 grandfather made beautiful 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.420
 Already horror and just junk something and 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.489
 weigh cargo 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.059
 refuse to help me set them up 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.140
 of course granny 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.539
 well, what do you need well, nothing special 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.989
 we will put on the scales 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:07.240
 different loads and determine which one is bigger 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:11.000
 weighs scales and learns something 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.300
 what a complicated thing these scales will help 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.360
 I will need to compare the weight of the load 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.539
 on the right and left scales and press 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 to the correct sign more less or 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.360
 equal and then out and earn 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:49.530
 so well and what a burden heavier soul seems 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:59.940
 scales begin to work and now we put 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:07.050
 a couple more loads and now you need 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:09.800
 determine which load is heavier earned 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.800
 my scales 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.409
 continue to adjust the scales 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:36.900
 so well and what a load hard 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.900
 it seems more scales start working 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.240
 and now we put another pair of goods 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:04.590
 and now you need to determine which load 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.590
 soul earned my scales 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.200
 continue to adjust the scales 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.950
 so what load are we heavier 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.450
 scales seem 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.450
 start working 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:56.990
 and now we put a couple more goods and now 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:59.710
 need to decide what kind of load earned 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.710
 my scales 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.330
 continue to adjust the scales 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:26.350
 so well and what a burden but it seems 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.350
 scales start working 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.710
 and now we put another pair of goods 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:53.530
 and now you need to determine which load 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.530
 harder earned my scales 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.140
 continue to adjust the scales 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.949
 so my what a load and live less 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.449
 scales seem 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.449
 start working 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.810
 and now we put another pair of goods 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:44.370
 and now you need to determine which load 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:48.120
 jelly and more 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.120
 earned my scales
