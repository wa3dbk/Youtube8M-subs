00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.910 
web at Exploration films.com when I
first<00:00:08.490> began<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.420> move<00:00:10.139> from<00:00:10.590> being<00:00:10.769> an

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
first began to move from being an

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.640 
first began to move from being an
evolutionist<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:12.210> being<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.750> creationist

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
evolutionist to being a creationist

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.279 
evolutionist to being a creationist
and<00:00:13.969> my<00:00:14.969> dental<00:00:15.269> students<00:00:15.540> had<00:00:15.690> challenged<00:00:16.170> me

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
and my dental students had challenged me

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.170 
and my dental students had challenged me
we<00:00:16.619> began<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.190> look<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.699> assumptions

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
we began to look at the assumptions

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.760 
we began to look at the assumptions
behind<00:00:18.390> evolution<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.529> had<00:00:19.650> never

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
behind evolution which I had never

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.750 
behind evolution which I had never
looked<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.520> before<00:00:21.170> was<00:00:22.170> never<00:00:22.380> taught<00:00:22.650> now<00:00:23.400> an

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
looked at before was never taught now an

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.820 
looked at before was never taught now an
assumption<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> guess<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.199> might<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> good

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
assumption is a guess it might be a good

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.769 
assumption is a guess it might be a good
guess<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.310> might<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.580> an<00:00:26.880> educated<00:00:27.300> guess<00:00:27.599> but

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
guess it might be an educated guess but

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
guess it might be an educated guess but
it's<00:00:27.930> still<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> guess<00:00:28.939> alright<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> first

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it's still a guess alright so the first

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.959 
it's still a guess alright so the first
assumption<00:00:30.869> behind<00:00:31.289> evolution<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.669> what

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
assumption behind evolution is that what

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
assumption behind evolution is that what
they<00:00:33.120> call<00:00:33.149> spontaneous<00:00:33.719> generation

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
they call spontaneous generation

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.370 
they call spontaneous generation
occurred<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.809> when<00:00:37.140> when

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
occurred now all that is is when when

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.160 
occurred now all that is is when when
they<00:00:37.500> say<00:00:37.710> spontaneous<00:00:38.460> generation<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.390> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
they say spontaneous generation in this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.280 
they say spontaneous generation in this
context<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> means<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.660> somehow<00:00:42.660> dead

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
context all that means is somehow dead

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.459 
context all that means is somehow dead
chemicals<00:00:44.010> came<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> life<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.050> no<00:00:46.230> life

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
chemicals came to life there was no life

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860 
chemicals came to life there was no life
and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> sudden<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.600> sort<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and then all of a sudden in some sort of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.770 
and then all of a sudden in some sort of
primordial<00:00:49.350> ooze<00:00:49.800> here<00:00:50.700> comes<00:00:51.000> something

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
primordial ooze here comes something

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.250 
primordial ooze here comes something
that's<00:00:52.350> alive<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:54.210> somehow<00:00:54.539> able<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that's alive and is somehow able to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.150 
that's alive and is somehow able to
reproduce<00:00:55.500> itself

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
reproduce itself

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
reproduce itself
that's<00:00:56.670> called<00:00:56.940> spontaneous<00:00:57.600> generation<00:00:57.870> now

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
that's called spontaneous generation now

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.819 
that's called spontaneous generation now
evolutionist<00:01:00.180> curcuit<00:01:00.570> says<00:01:00.870> that's<00:01:01.620> an

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
evolutionist curcuit says that's an

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.529 
evolutionist curcuit says that's an
assumption<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:02.550> why<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.940> an<00:01:03.210> assumption

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
assumption now why is that an assumption

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
assumption now why is that an assumption
because<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.379> can't<00:01:04.589> make<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.739> happen<00:01:05.220> with

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
because they can't make it happen with

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
because they can't make it happen with
all<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> sophisticated<00:01:07.110> laboratory

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
all of the sophisticated laboratory

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.370 
all of the sophisticated laboratory
equipment<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.400> today<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.990> we

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
equipment we have today with all of we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.690 
equipment we have today with all of we
have<00:01:10.409> every<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> chemical<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> can

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
have every kind of chemical you can

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
have every kind of chemical you can
think<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.020> every<00:01:13.380> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> powerful

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
think of we have every kind of powerful

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.390 
think of we have every kind of powerful
computer<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> campuses<00:01:16.979> where<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> go

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
computer so on the campuses where I go

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
computer so on the campuses where I go
say<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> professors<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.750> arguing

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
say to the professors that are arguing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
say to the professors that are arguing
against<00:01:19.650> creation<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.759> evolution<00:01:21.210> I'll

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
against creation and for evolution I'll

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120 
against creation and for evolution I'll
say<00:01:21.360> okay<00:01:21.630> look<00:01:21.869> you've<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.380> those<00:01:22.560> computers

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
say okay look you've got those computers

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.260 
say okay look you've got those computers
you've<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> laboratory<00:01:24.060> equipment

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you've got the laboratory equipment

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
you've got the laboratory equipment
you've<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.570> every<00:01:24.780> chemical<00:01:25.130> mix<00:01:26.130> them<00:01:26.310> up

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
you've got every chemical mix them up

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
you've got every chemical mix them up
make<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.119> come<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.570> life<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> have

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
make it come to life that's all you have

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.399 
make it come to life that's all you have
to<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.520> evolution<00:01:30.090> assumes<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to do because evolution assumes that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.010 
to do because evolution assumes that
that<00:01:31.770> happened<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.970> time<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.810> past

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that happened at one time in the past

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.830 
that happened at one time in the past
all<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.420> that's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
all right now that's that's that's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.080 
all right now that's that's that's
probably<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> first<00:01:37.350> major<00:01:38.130> assumption<00:01:38.970> that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
probably the first major assumption that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
probably the first major assumption that
dead<00:01:39.509> things<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.079> come<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.439> life<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.189> second

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
dead things can come to life the second

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.660 
dead things can come to life the second
major<00:01:41.790> assumption<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.509> make<00:01:42.689> is

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
major assumption they make is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.790 
major assumption they make is
most<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.720> them<00:01:44.810> make<00:01:45.050> there<00:01:45.260> may<00:01:45.410> be<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.560> few

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
most of them make there may be a few

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.260 
most of them make there may be a few
that<00:01:45.950> don't<00:01:46.070> think<00:01:46.370> this<00:01:46.520> way<00:01:46.700> but<00:01:46.910> most<00:01:47.060> of

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
that don't think this way but most of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.350 
that don't think this way but most of
them<00:01:47.390> say<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:48.050> only<00:01:48.290> ever<00:01:48.470> happened<00:01:48.950> once<00:01:49.360> so

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
them say that only ever happened once so

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.180 
them say that only ever happened once so
now<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.050> dead<00:01:51.260> chemicals<00:01:51.800> somehow

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
now you have the dead chemicals somehow

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.400 
now you have the dead chemicals somehow
they<00:01:52.400> come<00:01:52.670> there<00:01:52.910> now<00:01:53.090> they're<00:01:53.330> alive<00:01:53.600> but<00:01:54.320> it

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
they come there now they're alive but it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.110 
they come there now they're alive but it
only<00:01:54.530> happened<00:01:54.980> once<00:01:55.220> now<00:01:55.520> why<00:01:55.760> would<00:01:55.970> they

the 80th power electrons in the whole

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.370 
the 80th power electrons in the whole
universe<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.660> there<00:02:59.840> aren't<00:02:59.989> even<00:03:00.260> enough

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380

with<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.739> simple<00:03:04.220> protein<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.989> then<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.739> would

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
with a simple protein and then you would

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.580 
with a simple protein and then you would
have<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.280> somehow<00:03:07.940> get<00:03:08.390> only<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.170> left-handed

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
have to somehow get only the left-handed

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.770 
have to somehow get only the left-handed
amino<00:03:09.830> acids<00:03:10.250> all<00:03:10.970> right<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.330> that's<00:03:11.480> one<00:03:11.750> of

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
amino acids all right so that's one of

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.000 
amino acids all right so that's one of
the<00:03:11.930> reasons<00:03:12.200> they<00:03:12.350> say<00:03:12.560> well<00:03:12.799> it<00:03:12.920> only

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
the reasons they say well it only

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.890 
the reasons they say well it only
happened<00:03:13.430> once<00:03:13.610> now<00:03:14.239> that's<00:03:14.480> where<00:03:14.690> they<00:03:14.780> get

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
happened once now that's where they get

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.780 
happened once now that's where they get
their<00:03:15.049> Tree<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.320> Life<00:03:15.430> where<00:03:16.430> they<00:03:16.549> say<00:03:16.760> oh

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
their Tree of Life where they say oh

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.100 
their Tree of Life where they say oh
look<00:03:17.030> at<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.299> we<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.450> this<00:03:17.660> one<00:03:17.900> little

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
look at this we have this one little

over here but that's an assumption but

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.630 
over here but that's an assumption but
once<00:03:29.810> they<00:03:30.080> make<00:03:30.410> those<00:03:30.650> assumptions<00:03:31.010> then

once they make those assumptions then
another<00:03:31.940> assumption<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.870> viruses

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
another assumption is that viruses

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.650 
another assumption is that viruses
plants<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:33.950> bacteria<00:03:34.070> than<00:03:34.940> animals<00:03:35.450> they're

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
plants and bacteria than animals they're

related<00:03:42.820> we<00:03:43.820> all<00:03:43.970> came<00:03:44.180> from<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.480> first<00:03:44.780> cell

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
related we all came from that first cell

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.020 
related we all came from that first cell
but<00:03:45.320> that's<00:03:45.560> an<00:03:45.739> assumption<00:03:46.160> now<00:03:46.670> what<00:03:46.880> they

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
but that's an assumption now what they

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.060 
but that's an assumption now what they
do<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.329> textbook<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:48.019> they'll<00:03:48.680> draw<00:03:48.890> these

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
do in the textbook is they'll draw these

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.280 
do in the textbook is they'll draw these
pictures<00:03:49.100> of<00:03:49.640> life<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.150> then<00:03:50.900> they'll<00:03:51.110> have<00:03:51.230> a

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
pictures of life and then they'll have a

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.650 
pictures of life and then they'll have a
horse<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.890> they'll<00:03:52.010> have<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.300> fern<00:03:53.300> and

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
horse and they'll have a fern and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.100 
horse and they'll have a fern and
they'll<00:03:53.810> have

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
they'll have

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.230 
they'll have
coelacanth<00:03:55.040> fish<00:03:55.130> down<00:03:55.610> here<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.060> now<00:03:56.120> have

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
coelacanth fish down here and now have

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.600 
coelacanth fish down here and now have
man<00:03:56.510> way<00:03:56.750> up<00:03:56.960> here<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.710> then<00:03:57.920> some<00:03:58.100> pine<00:03:58.340> trees

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
man way up here and then some pine trees

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.700 
man way up here and then some pine trees
over<00:03:58.850> here<00:03:59.000> but<00:03:59.780> they<00:03:59.900> hook<00:04:00.290> them<00:04:00.440> up<00:04:00.530> with

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
over here but they hook them up with

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.070 
over here but they hook them up with
lines<00:04:01.030> but<00:04:02.030> there's<00:04:02.210> nothing<00:04:02.600> on<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.840> lines

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
lines but there's nothing on the lines

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.910 
lines but there's nothing on the lines
well<00:04:03.920> why<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.280> there<00:04:04.580> nothing<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:04.970> those<00:04:05.120> lines

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
well why is there nothing on those lines

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.650 
well why is there nothing on those lines
well<00:04:06.920> because<00:04:07.400> those<00:04:07.670> are<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:07.970> missing<00:04:08.360> links

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
well because those are the missing links

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.940 
well because those are the missing links
there's<00:04:09.110> nothing<00:04:09.440> there<00:04:09.590> cuz<00:04:09.770> there's

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
there's nothing there cuz there's

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.650 
there's nothing there cuz there's
nothing<00:04:10.280> there<00:04:10.460> but<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:11.180> gives<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.570> a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
nothing there but that gives you a

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.410 
nothing there but that gives you a
picture<00:04:11.990> in<00:04:12.350> your<00:04:12.560> head<00:04:12.800> oh<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:14.030> see<00:04:14.210> these

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
picture in your head oh you see these

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.760 
picture in your head oh you see these
things<00:04:14.570> are<00:04:14.750> all<00:04:14.870> connected<00:04:15.170> they're<00:04:15.650> all

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
things are all connected they're all

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.000 
things are all connected they're all
hooked<00:04:15.890> up<00:04:16.100> but<00:04:16.970> it's<00:04:17.120> really<00:04:17.410> it's<00:04:18.410> really<00:04:18.829> a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
hooked up but it's really it's really a

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.550 
hooked up but it's really it's really a
fraudulent<00:04:19.459> thing<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.060> do<00:04:20.209> because<00:04:20.660> there's

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
fraudulent thing to do because there's

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.140 
fraudulent thing to do because there's
nothing<00:04:21.799> on<00:04:22.070> those<00:04:22.280> lines<00:04:22.610> because<00:04:22.940> there's

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
nothing on those lines because there's

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.540 
nothing on those lines because there's
nothing<00:04:23.600> there<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.620> it's<00:04:24.800> an<00:04:24.890> assumption<00:04:25.280> that

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
nothing there so it's an assumption that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.150 
nothing there so it's an assumption that
there's<00:04:25.910> things<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.390> here<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.200> between<00:04:27.710> that

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
there's things in here in between that

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.450 
there's things in here in between that
hook<00:04:28.370> them<00:04:28.490> up<00:04:28.900> they<00:04:29.900> aren't<00:04:30.140> hooked<00:04:30.320> up<00:04:30.470> all

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
hook them up they aren't hooked up all

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.880 
hook them up they aren't hooked up all
right<00:04:31.700> well<00:04:32.090> then<00:04:32.330> they<00:04:32.480> say<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:35.890> reptiles

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
right well then they say that reptiles

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.980 
right well then they say that reptiles
birds<00:04:38.169> mammals<00:04:39.580> amphibians<00:04:40.750> they're<00:04:41.750> all

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
birds mammals amphibians they're all

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.140 
birds mammals amphibians they're all
related<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:43.010> fish<00:04:43.310> came<00:04:43.580> out<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.940> water

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
related the fish came out of the water

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.510 
related the fish came out of the water
became<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.050> amphibians<00:04:45.650> in<00:04:45.980> the<00:04:46.130> water<00:04:46.340> and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
became the amphibians in the water and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.100 
became the amphibians in the water and
out<00:04:46.640> of<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.820> water<00:04:46.940> became<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.660> reptiles

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
out of the water became the reptiles

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.750 
out of the water became the reptiles
which<00:04:48.740> became<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.250> birds<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.730> mammals

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
which became the birds and the mammals

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.360 
which became the birds and the mammals
that<00:04:50.330> is<00:04:50.930> an<00:04:51.080> assumption<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:51.800> that's<00:04:52.220> what

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
that is an assumption and that's what

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.710 
that is an assumption and that's what
dr.<00:04:52.610> curcuit<00:04:52.910> says<00:04:53.060> that's<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.360> guess<00:04:53.540> because

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
dr. curcuit says that's a guess because

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.270 
dr. curcuit says that's a guess because
we<00:04:54.020> don't<00:04:54.200> know<00:04:54.350> because<00:04:54.470> we<00:04:54.710> can't<00:04:54.950> make<00:04:55.010> it

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
we don't know because we can't make it

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.560 
we don't know because we can't make it
happen<00:04:55.610> for<00:04:55.940> instance<00:04:56.230> if<00:04:57.230> evolution<00:04:57.620> is<00:04:57.860> true

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
happen for instance if evolution is true

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.659 
happen for instance if evolution is true
then<00:04:59.570> if<00:04:59.870> reptiles<00:05:00.500> let's<00:05:00.830> say<00:05:01.010> became<00:05:01.370> Birds

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
then if reptiles let's say became Birds

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.940 
then if reptiles let's say became Birds
that's<00:05:02.180> what<00:05:02.330> evolution<00:05:02.479> taught<00:05:02.960> me<00:05:03.169> reptiles

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
that's what evolution taught me reptiles

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.600 
that's what evolution taught me reptiles
first<00:05:04.250> then<00:05:04.550> birds<00:05:04.850> so<00:05:05.479> we<00:05:05.630> have<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> reptile

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
first then birds so we have a reptile

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.180 
first then birds so we have a reptile
cold-blooded<00:05:07.610> dense<00:05:08.360> bones<00:05:08.860> that's<00:05:09.860> going<00:05:10.130> to

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
cold-blooded dense bones that's going to

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.150 
cold-blooded dense bones that's going to
evolve<00:05:10.490> into<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.150> bird<00:05:11.450> warm<00:05:12.080> blooded<00:05:12.470> hollow

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
evolve into a bird warm blooded hollow

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.620 
evolve into a bird warm blooded hollow
bones<00:05:13.870> now<00:05:15.310> is<00:05:16.310> there<00:05:16.610> any<00:05:16.790> such<00:05:17.060> thing<00:05:17.120> as

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
bones now is there any such thing as

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.980 
bones now is there any such thing as
let's<00:05:18.020> say<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.410> lukewarm<00:05:18.860> blooded<00:05:19.790> semi<00:05:20.630> dance

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
let's say a lukewarm blooded semi dance

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.650 
let's say a lukewarm blooded semi dance

what about Archaeopteryx leading
evolutionary<00:05:33.710> thinkers<00:05:34.400> now<00:05:34.580> are<00:05:34.729> telling<00:05:34.970> us

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
evolutionary thinkers now are telling us

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.820 
evolutionary thinkers now are telling us
no<00:05:35.240> that's<00:05:35.450> a<00:05:35.510> pure<00:05:35.720> bird<00:05:35.930> that's<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:36.440> pure<00:05:36.650> bird

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
no that's a pure bird that's a pure bird

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.469 
no that's a pure bird that's a pure bird
as<00:05:37.040> a<00:05:37.100> matter<00:05:37.370> of<00:05:37.460> fact<00:05:37.700> they<00:05:37.820> have<00:05:37.970> birds<00:05:38.210> now

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
as a matter of fact they have birds now

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.719 
as a matter of fact they have birds now
that<00:05:38.690> they<00:05:38.810> have<00:05:38.900> found<00:05:39.140> that<00:05:39.320> are<00:05:39.560> before<00:05:40.190> the

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
that they have found that are before the

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.260 
that they have found that are before the
are<00:05:40.970> crap<00:05:41.240> Archaeopteryx<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.260> so<00:05:43.190> what<00:05:44.090> is

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
are crap Archaeopteryx and so what is

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.010 
are crap Archaeopteryx and so what is
evolution<00:05:44.600> then<00:05:45.100> well<00:05:46.100> it's<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:46.880> faith<00:05:47.210> system

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
evolution then well it's a faith system

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.350 
evolution then well it's a faith system
because<00:05:48.470> it's<00:05:48.650> based<00:05:48.890> on<00:05:49.130> assumptions<00:05:49.820> that

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
because it's based on assumptions that

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.400 
because it's based on assumptions that
even<00:05:50.840> today<00:05:51.290> the<00:05:52.100> leading<00:05:52.490> evolutionary

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
even today the leading evolutionary

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.340 
even today the leading evolutionary
thinkers<00:05:54.410> of<00:05:54.440> our<00:05:54.800> day<00:05:55.070> they<00:05:55.580> cannot<00:05:56.150> hook<00:05:57.140> up

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
thinkers of our day they cannot hook up

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.339 
thinkers of our day they cannot hook up
these<00:05:58.240> vast<00:05:59.830> distances<00:06:00.830> between<00:06:02.349> various

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
these vast distances between various

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:04.750 
these vast distances between various
types<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.740> creatures<00:06:04.130> but<00:06:04.340> will<00:06:04.490> you<00:06:04.610> see

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
types of creatures but will you see

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.370 
types of creatures but will you see
those<00:06:04.970> are<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.150> transitional<00:06:05.840> forms<00:06:06.169> which

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
those are the transitional forms which

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.670 
those are the transitional forms which
that<00:06:06.650> now<00:06:06.800> that's<00:06:07.070> the<00:06:07.310> new

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
that now that's the new

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.530 
that now that's the new
for<00:06:07.889> the<00:06:07.979> missing<00:06:08.280> link<00:06:08.490> you<00:06:08.639> see<00:06:08.820> it<00:06:09.330> doesn't

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
for the missing link you see it doesn't

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.939 
for the missing link you see it doesn't
sound<00:06:09.780> as<00:06:09.930> missing<00:06:10.350> if<00:06:10.470> we<00:06:10.560> call<00:06:10.740> it<00:06:10.860> the

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
sound as missing if we call it the

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.280 
sound as missing if we call it the
transitional<00:06:11.580> form<00:06:11.820> and<00:06:12.150> so<00:06:12.570> well<00:06:12.990> those<00:06:13.139> are

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
transitional form and so well those are

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.540 
transitional form and so well those are
the<00:06:13.380> transitional<00:06:13.919> forms<00:06:14.130> now<00:06:14.220> we<00:06:14.340> haven't

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
the transitional forms now we haven't

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.310 
the transitional forms now we haven't
found<00:06:14.699> them<00:06:14.940> yet<00:06:14.970> but<00:06:15.330> we<00:06:15.479> will<00:06:15.690> we<00:06:15.930> will<00:06:15.960> give

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
found them yet but we will we will give

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.870 
found them yet but we will we will give
us<00:06:16.440> enough<00:06:16.680> time<00:06:16.860> we<00:06:17.009> will<00:06:17.190> well<00:06:17.520> what<00:06:17.729> they

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
us enough time we will well what they

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.969 
us enough time we will well what they
are<00:06:17.910> finding<00:06:18.509> with<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:18.900> time<00:06:19.199> they<00:06:19.410> have<00:06:19.620> is

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
are finding with the time they have is

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.100 
are finding with the time they have is
and<00:06:20.250> especially<00:06:21.210> now<00:06:21.720> with<00:06:21.780> things<00:06:21.990> like

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
and especially now with things like

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.689 
and especially now with things like
molecular<00:06:22.560> biology<00:06:23.340> where<00:06:23.490> they<00:06:23.580> can

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
molecular biology where they can

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.400 
molecular biology where they can
actually<00:06:23.880> go<00:06:24.180> in<00:06:24.300> and<00:06:24.330> look<00:06:24.570> at<00:06:24.660> the<00:06:24.750> molecules

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
actually go in and look at the molecules

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.610 
actually go in and look at the molecules
one<00:06:26.370> quick<00:06:26.610> example<00:06:26.870> Rama<00:06:27.870> Pittacus<00:06:28.410> was

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
one quick example Rama Pittacus was

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.980 
one quick example Rama Pittacus was
supposed<00:06:28.860> to<00:06:28.949> be<00:06:29.039> an<00:06:29.190> ancestor<00:06:29.880> of<00:06:30.120> man<00:06:30.570> that

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
supposed to be an ancestor of man that

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
was it was assumed to be our ancestor

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.999 
was it was assumed to be our ancestor
and<00:06:33.690> then<00:06:33.840> you<00:06:33.930> have<00:06:34.050> Vincent's<00:06:34.500> I<00:06:34.680> reach<00:06:34.830> out

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009 
and then you have Vincent's I reach out

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:37.700 
and then you have Vincent's I reach out
there<00:06:35.280> Berkeley<00:06:36.210> and<00:06:36.360> and<00:06:36.509> he<00:06:37.110> does<00:06:37.590> the

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.750 
an orangutan
well<00:06:43.410> it's<00:06:43.530> still<00:06:43.710> in<00:06:43.770> some<00:06:44.039> textbook<00:06:44.340> as<00:06:44.639> an

well it's still in some textbook as an

well it's still in some textbook as an

the molecular level it has nothing to do
with<00:06:49.560> man<00:06:49.919> so<00:06:50.550> this<00:06:51.150> whole<00:06:51.570> idea<00:06:51.600> of<00:06:52.320> big<00:06:53.250> bang

with man so this whole idea of big bang
macro<00:06:54.570> evolution<00:06:54.780> is<00:06:55.440> based<00:06:56.130> on<00:06:56.490> a<00:06:56.729> whole
