00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.140
 when talking about x vaginitis everyone on 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.880
 Mind automatically comes golf 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.099
 however, the successful model itself 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.940
 Wolfsburg is not at all a class above 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.000
 posad 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.619
 the model has been produced for 73 years now 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.910
 eighth generation produced 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:26.279
 we will consider it today 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:29.130
 more closely Germany Passat mainly 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.590
 pensioners choose for themselves and managers 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.340
 as a company car in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.860
 the first place 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 they like reliability and economy 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.540
 plus safety and large trunk 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.410
 In Germany, the most popular body type 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.899
 wagon 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 at passat it is called this option 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.260
 car is perfect for both 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.770
 long distance travel so for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770
 business trip 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 stay the general staff car interior me 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 undoubtedly like these horizontal 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.770
 lines located above the air ducts 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 looks particularly good combination 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.340
 digital display devices of course 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 have their own advantages 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.260
 especially regarding what's on it 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 displayed and how else is displayed 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.510
 say visually and aesthetically personally 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.960
 I like the real ones better 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.540
 chrome rings 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.920
 not virtual a set of humor and ign 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.690
 minced wine from in general for aesthetes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.890
 Volkswagen Engineer Installed 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.180
 analog clock on the center console 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.050
 advantages of a digital dashboard 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 obviously 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.580
 navigator is located before the eyes of what 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.880
 allows not to be distracted once again from 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.880
 roads 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.950
 now the legroom is quite 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.950
 enough both in front and behind 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.590
 she for me zest car this 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.530
 new two-liter engine etc. and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.700
 4 cylinder biturbo power 240 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.770
 Horse power 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.020
 just a couple of years ago for such power 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.060
 needed a motor for 1 liter and two 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.590
 cylinder more engine of course 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.649
 meets new toxicity standards 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.539
 euro 6 will have to add 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.039
 this blue solution which is used 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.030
 for diesel exhaust gas cleaning 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.030
 engines 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.650
 if you do not constantly push 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.780
 the gas pedal to the floor is the most powerful 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.640
 two-liter diesel will consume 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.340
 about five and a half liters per 100 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.319
 kilometers to one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.660
 car accelerates for six point 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.310
 three tenths of a second in baseline 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.319
 complete set for the trades with a 2-liter 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.540
 the engine also provides full 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.629
 drive that helps in any situation 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.250
 feel confident on the road so on 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.470
 Italian island of Sardinia where we 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.420
 conducted a test drive passat variant with 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.870
 ease overcame all winding 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.870
 turns 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.840
 type of association passat actually 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.519
 ride like a gulf but i'm sure it's because 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.010
 that the new facade is assembled according to 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.930
 Volkswagen concepts on the same modular 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.120
 a platform that golf has only given 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.109
 case the design is slightly stretched and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.569
 dragging the beat the water changed and 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.700
 the appearance of the trade wind everywhere in the design 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.430
 car can be found long straight 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.069
 lines from this body itself seems through 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.549
 too elongated its length a little less than five 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.549
 meters 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.900
 trunk volume is 650 liters but if 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.290
 tilt the rear seats that volume 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.550
 increase to 1780 liters but lead off 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.550
 Of course not everything will turn out 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.020
 here you are probably interested that I am here 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.940
 do with this boat the answer is simple the referee 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.630
 then the cargo which the passat is able to take 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.700
 in tow 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.460
 so for example you need to transfer the boat to 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.770
 trailer from point a to point b passat 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.590
 able to impose 2 tons 200 kilograms 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.480
 perfect car tractor both but good 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.490
 not everyone has a ride with a trailer 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.620
 drivers specifically for such 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.170
 car enthusiasts put on the car 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.510
 electronic assistant assistant who 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.810
 helps the driver to control the trailer 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.460
 the sole nearby main problem 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.780
 which side should i turn the steering wheel 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.180
 to make the trailer move 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.720
 exactly where I need with this and 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.250
 helps e-assistant driver 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.830
 includes reverse gear 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.320
 presses a button and the parking assistant 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.360
 then using levers to control 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.520
 side mirrors exposes 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.120
 trailer heading 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.540
 it can be seen on the display it stretches 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.450
 bye fund man parking 2 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.070
 and then depending on the settings steering 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:47.400
 the wheel turns in the right direction 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:49.740
 direction and so the steering wheel turns the trailer 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.530
 going back to the parking lot allotted to him 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.750
 place of father michael super never once i 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:03.050
 didn't drive back with a trailer so easily 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.050
 and behind the fan zone 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.250
 Busygin positions himself as 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.210
 manufacturer of mass models they 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.280
 premium class 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.410
 however passat showing that massive 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.650
 consumer can join premium 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:24.270
 quality in germany prices for the trade wind

 start at 20 6950 euro model 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.600
 which we tested 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.370
 diesel engine full set 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.370
