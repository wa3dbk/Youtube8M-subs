00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
way skills in a row I actually put in a

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.820 
way skills in a row I actually put in a
clip<00:02:19.690> where<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.930> sprayed<00:02:20.260> someone<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.680> would

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830

that getting like clips illegals were

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.100 
that getting like clips illegals were
really<00:02:27.370> good<00:02:27.519> because<00:02:27.700> optic<00:02:28.480> d<00:02:28.599> treats<00:02:28.930> used

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
really good because optic d treats used

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.520 
really good because optic d treats used
to<00:02:30.030> he's<00:02:31.030> playing<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.480> hardcore<00:02:31.870> or<00:02:32.319> he's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
playing like PC or whatever and use the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.050 
playing like PC or whatever and use the
D<00:02:34.299> going<00:02:34.540> like<00:02:34.810> single<00:02:35.170> fire<00:02:35.349> people<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.060> you

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.280 
uh you know he was definitely a big
inspiration<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.859> me<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.760> um<00:03:46.079> you<00:03:47.079> know<00:03:47.200> of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
inspiration to me but um you know of

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.259 
inspiration to me but um you know of
course<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.650> don't<00:03:47.709> have<00:03:47.919> nearly<00:03:48.280> as<00:03:48.639> good

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.809 
course I don't have nearly as good
eclipse<00:03:49.599> as<00:03:49.750> Grizz<00:03:49.989> did<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.410> know<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:51.130> think<00:03:51.579> my

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
eclipse as Grizz did you know I think my

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.490 
eclipse as Grizz did you know I think my
best<00:03:52.030> clip<00:03:52.209> was<00:03:52.389> like<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.540> 360<00:03:53.169> that<00:03:53.290> was<00:03:53.380> my

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
best clip was like a 360 that was my

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.920 
best clip was like a 360 that was my
opener<00:03:53.889> 360<00:03:54.730> off<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.419> something<00:03:55.750> that

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
opener 360 off of something that

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.470 
opener 360 off of something that
couldn't<00:03:56.470> be<00:03:56.530> more<00:03:56.769> than<00:03:57.010> like<00:03:57.160> 10<00:03:57.370> feet<00:03:57.609> let's

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
couldn't be more than like 10 feet let's

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.539 
couldn't be more than like 10 feet let's
just<00:03:58.660> say<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.840> couldn't<00:03:59.290> you<00:04:00.099> couldn't<00:04:00.130> do<00:04:00.519> a

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
just say you couldn't you couldn't do a

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.580 
just say you couldn't you couldn't do a
720<00:04:01.209> even<00:04:01.630> if<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:01.810> wanted<00:04:02.139> to<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.410> know<00:04:02.440> you

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
720 even if you wanted to you know you

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.330 
720 even if you wanted to you know you
would<00:04:02.829> land<00:04:03.040> first<00:04:03.569> but<00:04:04.569> um<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:06.190> know<00:04:06.310> I

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
would land first but um you know I

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.970 
would land first but um you know I
constantly<00:04:07.030> evolved<00:04:07.599> as<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.750> montage<00:04:08.230> maker<00:04:08.530> as

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
constantly evolved as a montage maker as

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.870 
constantly evolved as a montage maker as
a<00:04:09.459> as<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.329> sniper<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:11.620> used<00:04:12.069> videos<00:04:12.519> as<00:04:12.730> an

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
a as a sniper I used videos as an

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.259 
a as a sniper I used videos as an
example<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.829> sort<00:04:14.829> of<00:04:15.040> set<00:04:15.489> standards<00:04:16.209> for

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
example to sort of set standards for

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.509 
example to sort of set standards for
myself<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:17.109> slowly<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.680> slowly<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.340> slowly

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
myself and slowly and slowly and slowly

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.930 
myself and slowly and slowly and slowly
I<00:04:18.880> started<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.479> get<00:04:19.719> better<00:04:20.109> clips

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
I started to get better clips

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
I started to get better clips
and<00:04:21.330> I<00:04:21.630> learned<00:04:22.500> spawns<00:04:22.920> and<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:24.060> know<00:04:24.210> get<00:04:24.930> a

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
and I learned spawns and you know get a

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.360 
and I learned spawns and you know get a
knowledge<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.950> game<00:04:26.100> that<00:04:26.130> I'm<00:04:26.340> playing

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
knowledge of the game that I'm playing

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.370 
knowledge of the game that I'm playing
like<00:04:26.940> one<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.450> most<00:04:27.570> important<00:04:27.990> things<00:04:28.200> to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
like one of the most important things to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.950 
like one of the most important things to
get<00:04:28.620> montage<00:04:29.040> clips<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.300> know<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.480> spawns

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
get montage clips is to know the spawns

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.630 
get montage clips is to know the spawns
so<00:04:31.350> if<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.530> guys<00:04:31.680> know<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.950> spawns<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.460> guys

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
so if you guys know the spawns you guys

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.590 
so if you guys know the spawns you guys
are<00:04:32.790> going<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.970> know<00:04:33.180> where<00:04:33.450> they're<00:04:33.570> coming

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
are going to know where they're coming

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.570 
are going to know where they're coming
from<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:35.010> know<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:37.560> know<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.740> try<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> pick
