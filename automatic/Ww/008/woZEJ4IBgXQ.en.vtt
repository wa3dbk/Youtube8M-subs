00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
two major different types of ruffles

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.850 
two major different types of ruffles
there<00:00:12.000> are<00:00:12.120> ruffles<00:00:12.570> where<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.590> side<00:00:13.830> is

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
there are ruffles where one side is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.250 
there are ruffles where one side is
stitched<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.940> side<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.240> loose<00:00:15.929> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
stitched and one side is loose and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.700 
stitched and one side is loose and
there's<00:00:17.190> another<00:00:17.430> type<00:00:17.550> where<00:00:18.240> two<00:00:19.230> sides<00:00:19.529> are

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
there's another type where two sides are

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.140 
there's another type where two sides are
loose<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.279> stitched<00:00:20.460> right<00:00:20.789> down<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
loose so it's stitched right down the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.750 
loose so it's stitched right down the
center<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.980> personally<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.430> style

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
center I personally like this style

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.490 
center I personally like this style
better<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.180> think<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.720> has<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:25.199> bit<00:00:25.320> more

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
better I think it has a little bit more

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.900 
better I think it has a little bit more
movement<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> little<00:00:26.670> bit<00:00:26.789> more

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
movement is a little bit more

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
movement is a little bit more
interesting<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> type<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> I'm

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
interesting so this is the type that I'm

so the first thing you're going to have

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.060 
so the first thing you're going to have
to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.950> figure<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.469> where<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to do is figure out where you want it

to do is figure out where you want it
and<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.699> width<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.120> you'll<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.300> measure<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and the width so you'll just measure it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.939 
and the width so you'll just measure it
out<00:00:55.969> all<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.449> way<00:00:57.539> around<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.649> front

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
out all the way around but with front

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.830 
out all the way around but with front
and<00:00:59.100> back<00:00:59.309> because<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.510> want<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.809> sure

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and back because you want to make sure

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.060 
and back because you want to make sure
that<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.199> ruffle<00:01:01.469> goes<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.800> way<00:01:01.920> around

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that your ruffle goes all the way around

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270 
that your ruffle goes all the way around
unless<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:03.110> design<00:01:04.110> decision<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
unless to your design decision is to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
unless to your design decision is to
just<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.729> part<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:09.290> we<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:11.630> 47<00:01:12.630> inches<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
just do part so here we have 47 inches I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.100 
just do part so here we have 47 inches I
like<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> two<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.119> ratio<00:01:15.299> which

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
like to do a two to one ratio which

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
like to do a two to one ratio which
means<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.710> fabric<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.759> doubled

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
means your fabric is going to be doubled

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.780 
means your fabric is going to be doubled
whatever<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:19.170> length<00:01:19.439> needs<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
whatever your length needs to be so

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
whatever your length needs to be so
because<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.750> big<00:01:22.049> we're<00:01:22.740> probably

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
because this is so big we're probably

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
because this is so big we're probably
going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.119> make<00:01:24.299> four<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> these<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
going to have to make four of these in

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.520 
going to have to make four of these in
order<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.600> get<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.080> around<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
order to get all the way around but that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
order to get all the way around but that
depends<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> width<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.520> fabric<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
depends on the width of your fabric so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.880 
depends on the width of your fabric so
that's<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.079> thing<00:01:31.259> you'll<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> figure

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that's one thing you'll have to figure

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
that's one thing you'll have to figure
out<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.159> make<00:01:32.189> sure<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> ask<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.180> buy

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
out and make sure you ask when you buy

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.880 
out and make sure you ask when you buy
your<00:01:33.570> fabric<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> width<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> fabric

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
your fabric what the width of the fabric

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.130 
your fabric what the width of the fabric
is<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.549> way<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.049> even

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
is so that way you know or you can even

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.330 
is so that way you know or you can even
measure<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.189> bit<00:01:38.310> easier

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
measure it but it's a little bit easier

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
measure it but it's a little bit easier
if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> ask<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.810> how<00:01:40.049> many

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
if you ask that way you know how many

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
if you ask that way you know how many
ruffles<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> takes<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.189> cover<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.670> whole

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
ruffles it takes to cover the whole

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.149 
ruffles it takes to cover the whole
dress<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.170> once<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:43.979> measurements

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
dress so once you have your measurements

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
you're going to pull thread this is why

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.150
