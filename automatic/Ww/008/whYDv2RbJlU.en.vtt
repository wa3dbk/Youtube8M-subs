00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
about these glasses well of course they

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.750

have pineapples on them and I thought

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.970 
have pineapples on them and I thought
that<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.090> subtle<00:02:19.750> touch<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> pineapples

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that this subtle touch of the pineapples

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.120 
that this subtle touch of the pineapples
was<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:22.450> enough<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.260> bring<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
was just enough to bring in the
