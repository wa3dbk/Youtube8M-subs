00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:17.580
Oh my transient desire, please come true

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.360
In this dark room the light

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.840
Shines on a mechanism that started move

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.640
My thin fingertips wandered around

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.140
And touched a sharpen knife

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.100
I touched my wound, my lips got wetted; relentlessly, a drop falls down

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.640
Under my incorruptible sight; my cold eyes are saturating, filled with loyalty

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.360
When there wasn’t Heaven, nor Earth, the life began from Ginnuga’s tears

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.880
What has been granted is a guardian of the mission, my oath of night

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.700
Ah, many times I’ve been hunted by emotions

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.920
Dizziness assaults me, mercilessly

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.040
I bear the boundaries of my social class

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.900
I remember keeping them on my shoulders, in a funny show of nothingness

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.600
My nails are eroded; on my shoulders, my arms, my breasts, a red ache

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.200
Under the veil I wear as a sign of agreement, yearning for my request, tears are falling down

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.860
However, if there’s something I truly wish, is that I want to serve thou

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.660
The red moonlit by your side even today is gorgeous; the blame of the Faith of Night

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:42.220
So, take my hand; the oath’s nectar sweetly, sweetly impregnates you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.780
But you drink only a single drop

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.760
Until all exposed, all devoted, this whole life will become beautiful

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.480
Under this veil I wear as a sign of agreement, I soaked myself into fresh blood that resembles this body

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.080
I touched my wound, my lips got wetted; relentlessly, a drop falls down

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.840
Under my incorruptible sight; my cold eyes are saturating, filled with loyalty

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.400
However, if there’s something I truly wish, is that I want to serve thou

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.320
The red moonlit by your side even today is gorgeous; the blame of the Faith of Night
