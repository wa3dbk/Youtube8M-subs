is I think it's called flashing tape or
something<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.120> think<00:00:36.149> use<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> repair<00:00:36.989> ducts

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290

we are actually gonna be pulling it off
of<00:00:59.579> there<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.660> why<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.809> want<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> light

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
of there so that's why you want to light

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.340 
of there so that's why you want to light
a<00:01:01.829> stick<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.760> okay<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
a stick it down okay and then when you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
a stick it down okay and then when you
choose<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.680> stencil<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.240> want<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> pick

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
choose your stencil you want to pick

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.320 
choose your stencil you want to pick
something<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.470> has<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.610> least<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
something that has at least I think it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.399 
something that has at least I think it
works<00:01:09.510> best<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:09.750> something<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.080> has<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> lot

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
works best with something that has a lot

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
works best with something that has a lot
of<00:01:10.470> detail<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.850> that's<00:01:12.180> why<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> picked<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of detail so that's why I picked the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
of detail so that's why I picked the
striped<00:01:12.930> flower<00:01:13.260> circle<00:01:13.860> stencil<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.729> six

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
striped flower circle stencil that's six

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.170 
striped flower circle stencil that's six
by<00:01:15.240> six<00:01:15.720> version<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:17.850> wanted

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
by six version of it because they wanted

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
by six version of it because they wanted
it<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.170> detail<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:19.920> using

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it to have all that detail now I'm using

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.249 
it to have all that detail now I'm using
an<00:01:20.280> orange<00:01:20.759> stick<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.140> it's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
an orange stick I think that's what it's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780 
an orange stick I think that's what it's
called<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.650> used<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.159> your<00:01:23.310> nails<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
called it's used for like your nails and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
called it's used for like your nails and
stuff<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.119> buy<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.500> your

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
stuff you just buy it at the at your

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
stuff you just buy it at the at your
drugstore<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:26.130> whatever<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.030> has<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> sharp

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
drugstore or whatever and it has a sharp

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
drugstore or whatever and it has a sharp
end<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.290> totally<00:01:28.770> pointy<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.340> if

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
end but not totally pointy because if

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
end but not totally pointy because if
you<00:01:29.850> push<00:01:30.180> too<00:01:30.390> hard<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:30.810> pierce<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you push too hard you will pierce the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
you push too hard you will pierce the
metal<00:01:32.070> tape<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:32.820> want<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
metal tape and you really don't want to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
metal tape and you really don't want to
and<00:01:33.180> notice<00:01:33.600> how<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.840> senses<00:01:34.170> shifts<00:01:34.439> all

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and notice how my senses shifts all

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
and notice how my senses shifts all
around<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.549> were<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> tape<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
around if I were to tape it like a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
around if I were to tape it like a
sensible<00:01:36.960> person<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.470> would<00:01:37.560> stay<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.799> place

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
sensible person it would stay in place

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.960 
sensible person it would stay in place
but<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:39.090> tele<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> dangerously<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> am

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but I like tele of a dangerously so I am

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.490 
but I like tele of a dangerously so I am
NOT<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> tape<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
NOT going to tape it I'm just going to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
NOT going to tape it I'm just going to
hold<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.220> my<00:01:44.340> hand<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:45.270> again<00:01:45.600> like

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
hold it down with my hand now again like

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.090 
hold it down with my hand now again like
I<00:01:45.869> mentioned<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> want<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.740> careful<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I mentioned you want to be careful of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.910 
I mentioned you want to be careful of
not<00:01:47.250> piercing<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.509> tape<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.619> better<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
not piercing the tape so it's better to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.069 
not piercing the tape so it's better to
go<00:01:50.040> over<00:01:50.340> things<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.700> couple<00:01:51.119> times<00:01:51.450> rather

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
go over things a couple times rather

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.600 
go over things a couple times rather
than<00:01:52.409> pushing<00:01:52.649> too<00:01:53.070> hard

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
than pushing too hard

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.200 
than pushing too hard
okay<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.049> am<00:01:55.290> simply<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.219> trace<00:01:56.820> this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
okay so I am simply going to trace this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.020 
okay so I am simply going to trace this
whole<00:01:57.479> stencil<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.200> my<00:01:58.409> orange<00:01:58.829> stick<00:01:59.030> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
whole stencil with my orange stick and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.450 
whole stencil with my orange stick and
again<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.619> knew<00:02:01.740> you're<00:02:01.920> gonna<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.159> busy

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
again if you knew you're gonna be busy

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.459 
again if you knew you're gonna be busy
running<00:02:02.670> around<00:02:02.850> or<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.840> perfection<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
running around or if perfection is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
running around or if perfection is
important<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.250> ahead<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> tape<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.000> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
important to you go ahead and tape it so

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.730 
important to you go ahead and tape it so
that<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.079> have<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.439> hand

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that you don't have to have your hand

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
that you don't have to have your hand
there<00:02:08.009> because<00:02:08.610> what<00:02:08.759> you'll<00:02:08.910> notice<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.660> i

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
there because what you'll notice is as i

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.280 
there because what you'll notice is as i
trace<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.619> does<00:02:10.950> shift<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.849> bit

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
trace it does shift a little bit

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.140 
trace it does shift a little bit
and<00:02:12.349> I<00:02:12.439> do<00:02:12.500> end<00:02:12.980> up<00:02:13.159> but<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.579> know<00:02:13.730> what<00:02:13.760> I

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
imperfect handmade look that's how it

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.660 
imperfect handmade look that's how it
was<00:02:21.829> made<00:02:22.099> by<00:02:22.430> me<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.890> I'm<00:02:24.890> okay<00:02:25.250> with<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.549> but

if you're not go ahead and tape it down

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.380 
if you're not go ahead and tape it down

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
some improvisational marks with my

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.339 
some improvisational marks with my
orange<00:02:52.909> stick<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.659> basically<00:02:54.049> I'm<00:02:54.319> just

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
orange stick and basically I'm just

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.229 
orange stick and basically I'm just
doodling<00:02:55.099> with<00:02:55.159> a<00:02:55.310> stick<00:02:55.639> if<00:02:55.819> you're<00:02:55.939> a<00:02:55.970> Zen

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
doodling with a stick if you're a Zen

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.449 
doodling with a stick if you're a Zen
tangler<00:02:56.810> or<00:02:57.200> doodle<00:02:57.530> or<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.769> any<00:02:57.919> kind<00:02:58.250> I'm

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
tangler or doodle or of any kind I'm

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.000 
tangler or doodle or of any kind I'm
just<00:02:58.639> doing<00:02:58.819> lines<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.599> dashes<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.620> just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
just doing lines and dashes and just

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.649 
just doing lines and dashes and just
filling<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:01.849> it<00:03:02.000> looks<00:03:02.419> a<00:03:02.540> little

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
filling it in so that it looks a little

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.539 
filling it in so that it looks a little
more<00:03:02.930> complex<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.950> also<00:03:04.189> so<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.459> more

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
more complex and also so it's more

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.610 
more complex and also so it's more
individualized<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.659> me<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.019> we<00:03:06.230> could<00:03:06.379> all<00:03:06.590> use

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
individualized to me so we could all use

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.309 
individualized to me so we could all use
a<00:03:06.950> stencil<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.669> yet<00:03:08.239> all<00:03:08.419> end<00:03:08.900> up<00:03:09.139> with

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
a stencil and yet all end up with

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.899 
a stencil and yet all end up with
something<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:10.010> looked<00:03:10.280> totally<00:03:10.700> different

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
something that looked totally different

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.030 
something that looked totally different
and<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.329> can<00:03:11.569> see<00:03:11.840> what<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.079> difference<00:03:12.530> just

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
and you can see what a difference just

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.339 
and you can see what a difference just
that<00:03:13.189> little<00:03:13.459> bit<00:03:13.639> of<00:03:13.790> detail<00:03:14.359> makes<00:03:14.689> and<00:03:14.959> it

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
that little bit of detail makes and it

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.289 
that little bit of detail makes and it
is<00:03:15.500> something<00:03:15.919> that<00:03:16.069> again<00:03:16.400> makes<00:03:17.120> it

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
is something that again makes it

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.059 
is something that again makes it
uniquely<00:03:17.720> yours<00:03:17.989> I'm<00:03:18.199> a<00:03:18.319> big<00:03:18.530> fan<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.709> using

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
uniquely yours I'm a big fan of using

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.250 
uniquely yours I'm a big fan of using
stencils<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.879> then<00:03:20.000> finding<00:03:20.599> ways<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.810> make

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
stencils and then finding ways to make

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.039 
stencils and then finding ways to make
them<00:03:21.500> even<00:03:22.159> more<00:03:22.489> your<00:03:22.970> own<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.840> I'm<00:03:23.930> just

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
them even more your own so I'm just

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.719 
them even more your own so I'm just
gonna<00:03:24.139> go<00:03:24.440> ahead<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.949> fill<00:03:25.129> these<00:03:25.280> all<00:03:25.430> in<00:03:25.579> and

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
gonna go ahead and fill these all in and

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.280 
gonna go ahead and fill these all in and
again<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.419> not<00:03:26.569> like<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:26.959> have<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.169> know

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
again this is not like you have to know

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.930 
again this is not like you have to know
how<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.500> draw<00:03:27.889> it<00:03:28.310> doesn't<00:03:28.609> have<00:03:28.729> to<00:03:28.819> be

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
how to draw it doesn't have to be

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.210 
how to draw it doesn't have to be
complicated<00:03:29.569> this<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.650> fun<00:03:30.829> thing<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.159> you

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
complicated this is a fun thing and you

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.530 
complicated this is a fun thing and you
can<00:03:31.340> definitely<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.819> this<00:03:31.849> with<00:03:32.060> kids<00:03:32.329> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
can definitely do this with kids the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.149 
can definitely do this with kids the
only<00:03:32.720> danger<00:03:33.229> is<00:03:33.319> pushing<00:03:33.709> too<00:03:33.829> hard

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
only danger is pushing too hard

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.520 
only danger is pushing too hard
really<00:03:34.579> so<00:03:35.209> if<00:03:35.299> you<00:03:35.389> had<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> more<00:03:35.870> rounded<00:03:36.349> tool

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
really so if you had a more rounded tool

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.229 
really so if you had a more rounded tool
like<00:03:36.739> let's<00:03:36.949> say<00:03:37.099> an<00:03:37.190> embossing<00:03:37.639> tool<00:03:38.090> or

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
like let's say an embossing tool or

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.599 
like let's say an embossing tool or
something<00:03:38.419> like<00:03:38.599> that<00:03:38.889> then<00:03:39.889> you<00:03:40.069> would<00:03:40.310> be

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
something like that then you would be

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.729 
something like that then you would be
much<00:03:41.000> less<00:03:41.329> in<00:03:41.569> danger<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:42.019> piercing<00:03:42.530> through

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
much less in danger of piercing through

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.770 
much less in danger of piercing through
so<00:03:43.280> that's<00:03:43.579> that's<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.269> can't<00:03:44.690> imagine

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
so that's that's I can't imagine

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.149 
so that's that's I can't imagine
anything<00:03:45.169> else<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.530> could<00:03:45.650> go<00:03:45.799> wrong<00:03:45.979> with

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
anything else that could go wrong with

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.159 
anything else that could go wrong with
this<00:03:46.220> that's<00:03:46.579> that's<00:03:46.970> really<00:03:47.329> only<00:03:47.479> it<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.019> now

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
this that's that's really only it so now

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.140 
this that's that's really only it so now
you<00:03:48.260> can<00:03:48.409> see<00:03:48.590> when<00:03:49.099> it's<00:03:49.250> all<00:03:49.459> done<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.030> all

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
you can see when it's all done and all

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.530 
you can see when it's all done and all
the<00:03:50.180> detail<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.169> it's<00:03:51.290> fabulous<00:03:52.540> it

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
the detail is that it it's fabulous it

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.849 
the detail is that it it's fabulous it

actually like the side that's sticky
more<00:04:22.729> than<00:04:22.969> the<00:04:23.090> side<00:04:23.270> that's<00:04:23.479> not<00:04:23.719> because

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
more than the side that's not because

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.240 
more than the side that's not because
this<00:04:24.289> side<00:04:24.469> that<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.740> see<00:04:24.919> is<00:04:25.010> there's

this side that you see is there's
de-bossed

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
de-bossed

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.689 
de-bossed
the<00:04:26.360> other<00:04:26.509> side<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:27.169> embossed<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:28.009> so<00:04:28.430> what

craft<00:04:40.849> sheet<00:04:41.090> down<00:04:41.300> or<00:04:41.840> not<00:04:41.990> craft<00:04:42.229> that<00:04:42.440> craft

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
craft sheet down or not craft that craft

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.640 
craft sheet down or not craft that craft
foam<00:04:42.889> instead<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:44.139> paper<00:04:45.139> because<00:04:45.440> it'll

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
foam instead of paper because it'll

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.149 
foam instead of paper because it'll
stick<00:04:45.979> and<00:04:46.340> now<00:04:46.879> I'm<00:04:47.240> putting<00:04:47.569> on<00:04:47.990> some<00:04:48.530> I

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
stick and now I'm putting on some I

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.860 
stick and now I'm putting on some I
think<00:04:49.250> that<00:04:49.520> was<00:04:49.610> aleene's<00:04:49.970> tacky<00:04:50.090> glue<00:04:50.629> but<00:04:50.840> I

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
think that was aleene's tacky glue but I

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.480 
think that was aleene's tacky glue but I
have<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.199> admit<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.770> after<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.250> couple

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
have to admit to you that after a couple

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.850 
have to admit to you that after a couple
hours<00:04:52.759> it<00:04:53.360> still<00:04:53.750> was<00:04:53.930> not<00:04:54.080> dry<00:04:54.349> so<00:04:54.379> then<00:04:54.800> I

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
hours it still was not dry so then I

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.559 
hours it still was not dry so then I
threw<00:04:55.069> some<00:04:55.220> gel<00:04:55.400> medium<00:04:55.819> in<00:04:56.000> there<00:04:56.210> instead

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
threw some gel medium in there instead

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.240 
threw some gel medium in there instead
which<00:04:56.900> worked<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.259> little<00:04:57.379> bit<00:04:57.590> better<00:04:57.830> so<00:04:58.129> I<00:04:58.159> do

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
which worked a little bit better so I do

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.909 
which worked a little bit better so I do
recommend<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:59.330> use<00:04:59.690> golden<00:05:00.050> heavy<00:05:00.319> gel<00:05:00.560> medium

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
recommend I use golden heavy gel medium

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.589 
recommend I use golden heavy gel medium
in<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:01.099> end<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.460> I'm<00:05:01.550> just<00:05:01.580> trimming<00:05:02.090> off<00:05:02.360> the

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
in the end and I'm just trimming off the

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.870 
in the end and I'm just trimming off the
excess<00:05:03.139> paper<00:05:03.470> there<00:05:03.830> which<00:05:04.069> you<00:05:04.190> can<00:05:04.340> see<00:05:04.639> and

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
excess paper there which you can see and

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.659 
excess paper there which you can see and

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
then once your notebook is dry it's time

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.570 
then once your notebook is dry it's time

paper is we're gonna use perfect pearls
and<00:05:15.530> these<00:05:15.680> are<00:05:15.860> wonderful<00:05:16.430> little<00:05:16.639> mica

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
and these are wonderful little mica

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.050 
and these are wonderful little mica
pigment<00:05:17.960> powders<00:05:18.349> and<00:05:18.800> I'm<00:05:19.219> just<00:05:19.400> tapping<00:05:19.610> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
pigment powders and I'm just tapping a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.850 
pigment powders and I'm just tapping a
soft<00:05:20.539> brush<00:05:20.900> in<00:05:21.020> there<00:05:21.139> and<00:05:21.199> I've<00:05:21.349> chosen<00:05:21.650> to

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
soft brush in there and I've chosen to

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.230 
soft brush in there and I've chosen to
work<00:05:21.949> with<00:05:22.069> two<00:05:22.310> colors<00:05:22.729> I'm<00:05:22.909> working<00:05:23.120> with

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
work with two colors I'm working with

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.779 
work with two colors I'm working with
sort<00:05:23.419> of<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.599> blue<00:05:23.870> patina<00:05:24.409> and<00:05:24.770> then<00:05:25.219> a<00:05:25.250> white

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
sort of a blue patina and then a white

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.700 
sort of a blue patina and then a white
ish<00:05:26.150> color<00:05:26.629> which<00:05:26.960> will<00:05:27.139> read<00:05:27.379> a<00:05:27.409> little<00:05:27.560> bit

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
ish color which will read a little bit

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.709 
ish color which will read a little bit
silver<00:05:28.069> because<00:05:28.340> it's<00:05:28.520> on<00:05:28.639> top<00:05:28.969> of<00:05:29.150> silver<00:05:29.509> and

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
silver because it's on top of silver and

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.830 
silver because it's on top of silver and
basically<00:05:30.469> it's<00:05:31.430> taking<00:05:31.969> the<00:05:32.150> stickiness

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
basically it's taking the stickiness

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.610 
basically it's taking the stickiness
away<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:33.710> it's<00:05:34.639> coloring<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.419> and<00:05:35.630> really

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
away and it's coloring it and really

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.990 
away and it's coloring it and really
just<00:05:36.650> making<00:05:37.159> it<00:05:37.280> look<00:05:37.310> cool<00:05:37.550> so<00:05:37.580> there<00:05:37.880> you

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
just making it look cool so there you

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.809 
just making it look cool so there you
can<00:05:38.060> see<00:05:38.360> some<00:05:38.990> of<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.229> colored<00:05:39.770> detail<00:05:40.520> I

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
can see some of the colored detail I

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.610 
can see some of the colored detail I
almost<00:05:41.300> feel<00:05:41.630> like<00:05:41.690> if<00:05:41.960> we<00:05:42.169> did<00:05:42.380> this<00:05:42.440> with<00:05:42.590> a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
almost feel like if we did this with a

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.890 
almost feel like if we did this with a
brown<00:05:42.949> it<00:05:43.279> would<00:05:43.490> look<00:05:43.759> like<00:05:43.969> leather<00:05:44.630> like

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
brown it would look like leather like

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.749 
brown it would look like leather like
I've<00:05:45.020> used<00:05:45.229> a<00:05:45.259> brown<00:05:45.440> chalk<00:05:45.770> or<00:05:46.009> a<00:05:46.039> pan<00:05:46.279> pastel

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
I've used a brown chalk or a pan pastel

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.129 
I've used a brown chalk or a pan pastel
or<00:05:46.789> something<00:05:47.210> like<00:05:47.330> that<00:05:47.389> you<00:05:47.810> could<00:05:47.960> really

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
or something like that you could really

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.680 
or something like that you could really
make<00:05:48.259> it<00:05:48.440> look<00:05:48.680> sort<00:05:48.919> of<00:05:49.009> a<00:05:49.130> so<00:05:49.490> I<00:05:49.789> should<00:05:50.569> try

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
make it look sort of a so I should try

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.360 
make it look sort of a so I should try
that<00:05:50.719> so<00:05:51.080> leather<00:05:51.380> embossing<00:05:52.039> that<00:05:52.069> would<00:05:52.279> be

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
that so leather embossing that would be

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.459 
that so leather embossing that would be
cool<00:05:52.580> anyway<00:05:53.060> okay<00:05:53.330> but<00:05:53.810> here's<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.229> step

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
cool anyway okay but here's the step

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:56.589 
cool anyway okay but here's the step
where<00:05:54.919> again<00:05:55.219> we<00:05:55.400> kick<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.729> up<00:05:55.849> a<00:05:55.969> notch<00:05:56.000> okay

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
where again we kick it up a notch okay

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.110 
where again we kick it up a notch okay
I'm<00:05:57.050> taking<00:05:57.349> just<00:05:57.680> some<00:05:57.800> rough<00:05:58.190> sandpaper<00:05:58.550> and

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
I'm taking just some rough sandpaper and

I'm taking just some rough sandpaper and
i'm<00:05:59.389> sandi<00:05:59.930> now<00:06:00.110> everywhere<00:06:00.770> that's<00:06:01.069> raised

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
i'm sandi now everywhere that's raised

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.379 
i'm sandi now everywhere that's raised
on<00:06:02.120> here<00:06:02.840> okay<00:06:03.319> should<00:06:03.680> be<00:06:04.039> sands<00:06:04.759> it<00:06:04.880> away<00:06:05.120> by

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
on here okay should be sands it away by

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.029 
on here okay should be sands it away by
the<00:06:05.449> sandpaper<00:06:05.960> and<00:06:06.139> because<00:06:06.469> I<00:06:06.500> have<00:06:06.800> that

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
the sandpaper and because I have that

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.830 
the sandpaper and because I have that
nice<00:06:07.279> thick<00:06:07.580> layer<00:06:07.819> of<00:06:07.849> gel<00:06:08.240> medium<00:06:08.599> under

nice thick layer of gel medium under

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.629 
nice thick layer of gel medium under
there<00:06:08.990> I'm<00:06:09.500> not<00:06:09.710> at<00:06:09.860> all<00:06:09.979> worried<00:06:10.520> about

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
there I'm not at all worried about

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.379 
there I'm not at all worried about
pushing<00:06:11.240> in<00:06:11.779> my<00:06:12.229> design<00:06:12.590> at<00:06:12.770> all<00:06:12.919> and<00:06:13.250> then<00:06:13.880> the
