00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.480
 hello good today I'm going to prepare some 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.730
 pork skewers with Andalusian species 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.739
 the ingredients that I will use will be 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.440
 pork skewers with Andalusian species 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.960
 they are already marinated and all potatoes 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.170
 fried to accompany I will use the sticks 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.680
 to puncture then salt skewers 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 black pepper sunflower oil for 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.190
 Fry and olive oil 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.730
 the marinade is quite easy and simple 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.670
 prepare 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 I have taken a plastic container and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.079
 I put the pieces of meat, milk, 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.270
 the spices and then I covered it with the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 water and I left it about 24 hours in the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.019
 fridge that I had it a little bit more and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.470
 then they take it out and you can 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.470
 prepare 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.340
 Well, we'll start when we already have 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.540
 all prepared and I already have the skewers 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.480
 preparations that I have put to six 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.000
 pieces by pizza and the oil from the 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.840
 fryer is already hot we will add the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 chips 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.950
 we see the face 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.160
 we will move a little 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.960
 that they are doing 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.730
 and on a griddle with the fire in half 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.890
 more or less is a little bit more of the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.890
 half we will put the skewers 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.019
 they are making the potatoes also 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.879
 They are making the skewers and we will go 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.750
 spinning around so they are done well 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.750
 on all sides 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.840
 you can spend a few minutes that are already 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.840
 well done the pinchitos will already be and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 we will take them out we have gone around and 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 return 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.960
 we will take them out and wait about 5 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.960
 minutes more potatoes are made 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.599
 Well, after about 5 minutes 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.150
 we see that the potatoes start to float 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.530
 we will take them out I will throw a little bit of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.550
 come out here 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.550
 and we will take it out 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.620
 and now once we have them out 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.880
 we will add a little salt 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.620
 we see moving 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.849
 and I will also give you a little bit of 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.849
 black pepper 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.440
 and now we will distribute them and already 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.440
 we will have ready
