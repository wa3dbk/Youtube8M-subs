let's<00:01:45.720> take<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> look<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.140> these<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> little<00:01:46.500> bit

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
let's take a look at these a little bit

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.730 
let's take a look at these a little bit
closer<00:01:47.450> alright<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.170> close<00:01:49.200> these

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
closer alright as you see up close these

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.370 
closer alright as you see up close these
are<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.250> physically<00:01:50.759> similar<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> LD

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
are really physically similar to the LD

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.039 
are really physically similar to the LD
10<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.950> LD<00:01:53.280> 20<00:01:53.640> which<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.329> course<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.720> did<00:01:54.930> not

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
10 and LD 20 which of course I did not

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.709 
10 and LD 20 which of course I did not
bring<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.799> me<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.909> prove<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.540> they

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
bring with me to prove to you that they

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
bring with me to prove to you that they
are<00:01:57.810> similar<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> trust<00:01:59.369> me<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.610> are

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
are similar but I trust me they are

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
are similar but I trust me they are
really<00:01:59.909> similar<00:02:00.119> alright<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> nice<00:02:01.320> big

there

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850 
there
smooth<00:02:18.390> reflector<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.470> thing<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.710> gonna

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
smooth reflector so this thing is gonna

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.470 
smooth reflector so this thing is gonna
have<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> decent<00:02:20.340> amount<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.550> throat<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
have a decent amount of throat and the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.110 
have a decent amount of throat and the
same<00:02:21.690> thing<00:02:21.960> on<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> LD<00:02:22.530> 22<00:02:23.010> that's<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.970> course

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
same thing on the LD 22 that's of course

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.520 
same thing on the LD 22 that's of course
bigger<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.660> it's<00:02:24.900> powered<00:02:25.170> by<00:02:25.200> two

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
bigger because it's powered by two

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.690 
bigger because it's powered by two
doublea's<00:02:25.950> instead<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.670> single<00:02:26.940> double-a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
doublea's instead of a single double-a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.090 
doublea's instead of a single double-a
so<00:02:29.700> let's<00:02:29.850> throw<00:02:29.970> some<00:02:30.090> batteries<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.720> these

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
so let's throw some batteries in these

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.140 
so let's throw some batteries in these
I'm<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.160> trying<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.580> say<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> lot

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.890 
recently I definitely recommend that you
use<00:02:34.860> something<00:02:35.340> other<00:02:35.640> than<00:02:35.820> alkaline<00:02:36.480> in

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
use something other than alkaline in

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.680 
use something other than alkaline in
these<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.310> these<00:02:38.610> or<00:02:38.850> any<00:02:39.000> other<00:02:39.210> lights<00:02:39.480> to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
these in these or any other lights to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.600 
these in these or any other lights to

take double-a batteries or triple A's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.970 
take double-a batteries or triple A's
for<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.910> matter<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> reason<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.950> that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
for that matter and the reason is that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.010 
for that matter and the reason is that
alkaline<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.180> leak<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.600> these

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
alkaline is like to leak and these

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.510 
alkaline is like to leak and these
flashlights<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.280> they're<00:02:47.400> not

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
flashlights you know they're not

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.370 
flashlights you know they're not
inexpensive<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.230> average

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
inexpensive you know the average

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.230 
inexpensive you know the average
flashlight<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:50.490> sell<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.820> about<00:02:51.000> 80

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
flashlight that we sell is about 80

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.080 
flashlight that we sell is about 80
bucks<00:02:51.710> these<00:02:52.710> are<00:02:52.860> less<00:02:53.040> than<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.370> but

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
bucks these are less than that but

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.220 
bucks these are less than that but
that's<00:02:54.270> that's<00:02:54.630> not<00:02:54.780> an<00:02:54.960> insignificant

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
that's that's not an insignificant

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
that's that's not an insignificant
amount<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.830> money<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.700> an<00:02:56.820> alkaline

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
amount of money so you have an alkaline

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.090 
amount of money so you have an alkaline
the<00:02:57.330> leaks<00:02:57.540> inside<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.080> here<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.920> actually

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
the leaks inside of here it can actually

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.550 
the leaks inside of here it can actually
bond<00:02:59.700> itself<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.540> inside<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.200> battery

bond itself to the inside of the battery

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.680 
bond itself to the inside of the battery
tube<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.460> can't<00:03:02.670> get<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:02.970> out<00:03:03.090> if<00:03:03.540> you

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
tube and you can't get it out if you

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.210 
tube and you can't get it out if you
leave<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.080> there<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.470> too<00:03:04.590> long<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.070> that

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
leave it in there for too long so that

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.490 
leave it in there for too long so that
that's<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.580> possibility<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.720> definitely<00:03:07.260> just

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
that's a possibility but definitely just

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.260 
that's a possibility but definitely just
even<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.800> little<00:03:07.950> bit<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.250> leaking<00:03:08.580> can<00:03:09.090> ruin

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
even a little bit of leaking can ruin

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.010 
even a little bit of leaking can ruin
the<00:03:09.480> circuit<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.050> inside<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.560> hedge

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
the circuit on the inside of the hedge

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.510 
the circuit on the inside of the hedge
so<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.140> can<00:03:13.290> ruin<00:03:13.440> all<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.830> kind<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.160> stuff<00:03:14.220> in

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
so it can ruin all this kind of stuff in

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.870 
so it can ruin all this kind of stuff in
there<00:03:14.670> ruin<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> contacts<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.550> any<00:03:17.550> kind<00:03:17.820> of

so<00:03:35.100> again<00:03:35.310> one<00:03:35.730> double-a<00:03:36.300> battery<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.020> LD

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
so again one double-a battery on the LD

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.030 
so again one double-a battery on the LD
12<00:03:37.650> two<00:03:38.370> batteries<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.330> LD<00:03:39.780> 22<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.890> let's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
12 two batteries on the LD 22 so let's

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.160 
12 two batteries on the LD 22 so let's
show<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.370> interface<00:03:41.930> okay<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.050> two

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
show you the interface okay the two

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.199 
show you the interface okay the two
lights<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.860> same<00:03:44.100> exact<00:03:44.550> interface<00:03:45.030> so

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
lights have the same exact interface so

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.640 
lights have the same exact interface so
we're<00:03:45.330> gonna<00:03:45.420> use<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.780> LD<00:03:46.050> twelve<00:03:46.320> here<00:03:46.530> to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
we're gonna use the LD twelve here to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.320 
we're gonna use the LD twelve here to
show<00:03:46.770> you<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.980> interface<00:03:47.220> switch<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.240> the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
show you the interface switch on the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.690

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
activation press it all the way for

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.250 
activation press it all the way for
constant<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.570> turn<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.870> off<00:03:54.990> and<00:03:55.140> on

that<00:03:55.440> way<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.190> see<00:03:56.310> if<00:03:56.430> you're<00:03:56.550> just

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
that way you can see if you're just

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.370 
that way you can see if you're just
using<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.030> rear<00:03:57.240> switch<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:58.140> not<00:03:58.290> gonna

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
using that rear switch it's not gonna

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.140 
using that rear switch it's not gonna
switch<00:03:58.680> modes<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.310> if<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.820> do<00:03:59.970> want<00:04:00.120> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
switch modes on you if you do want to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.760 
switch modes on you if you do want to
switch<00:04:00.360> modes<00:04:00.570> that's<00:04:01.050> so<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.290> switch<00:04:01.530> on<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
switch modes that's so the switch on the

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.820 
switch modes that's so the switch on the
head<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.070> for<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:03.060> each<00:04:03.180> time<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.540> tap<00:04:03.780> it<00:04:03.990> it

head is for and each time you tap it it

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.580 
head is for and each time you tap it it
cycles<00:04:05.250> between<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:06.690> different<00:04:07.020> outputs<00:04:07.350> you

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
cycles between the different outputs you

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.960 
cycles between the different outputs you
have<00:04:07.680> four<00:04:07.890> different<00:04:08.070> outputs<00:04:08.550> that<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.760> can

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
have four different outputs that you can

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.290 
have four different outputs that you can
choose<00:04:09.120> between<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:12.000> have<00:04:12.120> some

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
the regular illumination all right so

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.100 
the regular illumination all right so

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
big 40 mag light that I always use let's

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.950 
big 40 mag light that I always use let's
try<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.830> mag<00:05:15.009> light<00:05:15.219> first<00:05:15.780> there's<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.840> little

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
try the mag light first there's a little

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.950 
try the mag light first there's a little
bush<00:05:17.229> about<00:05:17.500> 15<00:05:18.009> feet<00:05:18.219> tree<00:05:19.090> out<00:05:19.240> there<00:05:19.270> at<00:05:19.629> 100

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
bush about 15 feet tree out there at 100

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.980 
bush about 15 feet tree out there at 100
feet<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:21.669> can<00:05:21.819> see<00:05:21.969> not<00:05:22.330> bad<00:05:22.539> but<00:05:22.750> not<00:05:22.840> great

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
feet you can see not bad but not great

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.459 
feet you can see not bad but not great
really<00:05:23.919> tightly<00:05:24.219> focused<00:05:24.580> beam<00:05:24.969> not<00:05:25.840> really<00:05:26.169> a

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
really tightly focused beam not really a

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.499 
really tightly focused beam not really a
great<00:05:27.069> deal<00:05:27.310> of<00:05:27.340> illumination<00:05:27.909> as<00:05:28.210> far<00:05:28.389> as

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
great deal of illumination as far as

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.589 
great deal of illumination as far as
area<00:05:28.870> going<00:05:29.139> on<00:05:29.259> let's<00:05:29.620> try<00:05:29.770> out<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.979> LD<00:05:30.599> 12

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
area going on let's try out the LD 12

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.430 
area going on let's try out the LD 12
first<00:05:31.990> there<00:05:32.800> is<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.310> low<00:05:33.520> mode<00:05:34.289> tilt<00:05:35.289> it<00:05:35.409> down

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
first there is the low mode tilt it down

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.350 
first there is the low mode tilt it down
just<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:35.889> you<00:05:35.949> can<00:05:36.039> see<00:05:36.250> actually<00:05:37.120> does<00:05:37.210> pretty

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
just so you can see actually does pretty

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.240 
just so you can see actually does pretty
well<00:05:37.569> up<00:05:37.659> close<00:05:37.900> but<00:05:38.800> then<00:05:38.919> there's<00:05:39.099> the

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
well up close but then there's the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.939 
well up close but then there's the
second<00:05:39.580> mode<00:05:39.729> third<00:05:40.500> there's<00:05:41.500> your<00:05:41.680> highest

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
second mode third there's your highest

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.309 
second mode third there's your highest
output<00:05:42.130> so<00:05:43.060> pretty<00:05:43.270> good<00:05:43.449> not<00:05:43.779> too<00:05:43.900> bad<00:05:44.080> for<00:05:44.259> a

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
output so pretty good not too bad for a

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.839 
output so pretty good not too bad for a
single<00:05:44.590> double-a<00:05:44.889> battery<00:05:45.340> I<00:05:45.430> mean<00:05:45.550> it's<00:05:45.669> able

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
single double-a battery I mean it's able

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.580 
single double-a battery I mean it's able
to<00:05:45.909> line<00:05:46.060> up<00:05:46.150> that<00:05:46.210> tree<00:05:46.569> hunter<00:05:47.319> feet<00:05:47.469> away

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
to line up that tree hunter feet away

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.969 
to line up that tree hunter feet away
really<00:05:48.099> well<00:05:49.349> no<00:05:50.349> question<00:05:50.680> about<00:05:50.800> what's

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
really well no question about what's

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.680 
really well no question about what's
going<00:05:51.190> on<00:05:51.250> out<00:05:51.430> there<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.789> decent<00:05:52.449> amount<00:05:52.630> of

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
going on out there and decent amount of

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.719 
going on out there and decent amount of
spill<00:05:52.930> so<00:05:53.169> the<00:05:53.289> area<00:05:53.590> around<00:05:54.159> the<00:05:54.310> hotspot

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
spill so the area around the hotspot

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:55.830 
spill so the area around the hotspot
which<00:05:54.880> is<00:05:54.969> the<00:05:55.060> bright<00:05:55.210> part<00:05:55.449> in<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.599> center

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
which is the bright part in the center

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.769 
which is the bright part in the center
of<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:55.960> spill<00:05:56.310> pretty<00:05:57.310> good<00:05:57.460> as<00:05:57.580> well<00:05:57.779> so

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
of the spill pretty good as well so

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.779 
of the spill pretty good as well so
let's<00:05:58.990> try<00:05:59.139> out<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.529> LD<00:06:00.270> 22<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:03.580> get<00:06:03.729> it

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
let's try out the LD 22 and get it

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.480 
let's try out the LD 22 and get it
pointed<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.210> right<00:06:04.330> way<00:06:04.949> let's<00:06:05.949> just<00:06:06.129> make

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
pointed the right way let's just make

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.769 
pointed the right way let's just make
sure<00:06:06.580> that's<00:06:06.699> on<00:06:06.879> high<00:06:07.060> real<00:06:07.270> quick<00:06:07.449> yeah<00:06:07.659> it

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:07.779 
sure that's on high real quick yeah it

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.580 
sure that's on high real quick yeah it
was<00:06:07.900> so<00:06:08.529> again<00:06:09.279> up<00:06:09.490> close<00:06:10.169> low<00:06:11.169> modes<00:06:11.379> great

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
was so again up close low modes great

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.119 
was so again up close low modes great
for<00:06:11.770> that<00:06:11.860> second<00:06:13.080> even<00:06:14.080> at<00:06:14.169> a<00:06:14.229> distance<00:06:14.259> zoom

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
for that second even at a distance zoom

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.070 
for that second even at a distance zoom
in<00:06:15.219> on<00:06:15.310> that<00:06:15.400> real<00:06:15.550> quick<00:06:15.659> that's<00:06:16.659> the<00:06:16.810> second

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
in on that real quick that's the second

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.619 
in on that real quick that's the second
output<00:06:17.349> not<00:06:17.800> too<00:06:17.979> bad<00:06:18.190> and<00:06:18.460> then<00:06:19.330> there's<00:06:19.479> the

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
output not too bad and then there's the

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.450 
output not too bad and then there's the
third<00:06:19.870> even<00:06:20.289> better<00:06:20.560> and<00:06:20.919> of<00:06:20.979> course<00:06:21.190> the<00:06:21.310> high

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
third even better and of course the high

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.680 
third even better and of course the high
is<00:06:21.520> even<00:06:21.940> better<00:06:22.060> so<00:06:22.210> you<00:06:22.360> can<00:06:22.449> see<00:06:22.569> the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
is even better so you can see the

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.320 
is even better so you can see the
difference<00:06:23.050> in<00:06:23.169> the<00:06:23.319> the<00:06:23.620> power<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:23.949> the<00:06:24.330> two

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
difference in the the power of the two

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.570 
difference in the the power of the two
doublea's<00:06:25.779> versus<00:06:26.199> the<00:06:26.289> one<00:06:26.409> double<00:06:26.710> a<00:06:26.830> what

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
doublea's versus the one double a what

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.999 
doublea's versus the one double a what
that<00:06:27.729> extra<00:06:27.940> double<00:06:28.150> a<00:06:28.330> will<00:06:28.449> get<00:06:28.659> you<00:06:29.009> in

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
that extra double a will get you in

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.100 
that extra double a will get you in
terms<00:06:30.789> of<00:06:31.000> output<00:06:31.180> he'll<00:06:31.930> do<00:06:32.020> them

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
terms of output he'll do them

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.110 
terms of output he'll do them
side-by-side<00:06:32.289> real<00:06:32.860> quick<00:06:33.039> there<00:06:33.909> will<00:06:34.090> be

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
side-by-side real quick there will be

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.990 
side-by-side real quick there will be
the<00:06:34.659> and<00:06:35.440> I'm<00:06:35.830> not<00:06:36.070> good<00:06:36.279> at<00:06:36.370> getting<00:06:36.610> these<00:06:36.849> in

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
the and I'm not good at getting these in

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.839 
the and I'm not good at getting these in
high<00:06:37.180> to<00:06:37.690> start<00:06:37.960> with<00:06:38.139> so<00:06:38.830> there's<00:06:39.009> the<00:06:39.190> LD<00:06:39.430> 22

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
high to start with so there's the LD 22

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:40.589 
high to start with so there's the LD 22

12 on the right I want to shine around a

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.119 
12 on the right I want to shine around a
little<00:06:42.939> bit<00:06:43.150> just<00:06:44.080> you<00:06:44.139> can<00:06:44.319> see<00:06:44.349> different

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
little bit just you can see different

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:46.379 
little bit just you can see different
colors<00:06:45.370> and<00:06:45.490> everything<00:06:45.699> and<00:06:46.029> the<00:06:46.120> different

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
colors and everything and the different

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.950 
colors and everything and the different
powers<00:06:46.689> of<00:06:46.719> them<00:06:48.360> so<00:06:49.360> these<00:06:49.479> are<00:06:49.599> relatively

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
powers of them so these are relatively

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.390
