00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
because different segments of the aorta

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.430 
because different segments of the aorta
act<00:00:02.520> differently<00:00:03.030> our<00:00:03.810> recommend

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
act differently our recommend

act differently our recommend
recommendations<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.520> when<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.940> operate

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
recommendations about when to operate

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
recommendations about when to operate
depend<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:06.899> which<00:00:07.080> portion<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.710> aorta<00:00:07.919> is

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
depend on which portion of the aorta is

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.549 
depend on which portion of the aorta is
involved<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:10.370> the<00:00:11.370> descending<00:00:12.179> aorta<00:00:12.559> can

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
involved and so the descending aorta can

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.589 
involved and so the descending aorta can
often<00:00:13.920> tolerate<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.820> bit<00:00:15.030> larger<00:00:15.389> size

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
often tolerate a little bit larger size

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.320 
often tolerate a little bit larger size
before<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.109> becomes<00:00:16.500> dangerous<00:00:17.330> different

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
before it becomes dangerous different

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.480 
before it becomes dangerous different
than<00:00:18.420> what<00:00:18.570> we've<00:00:18.720> seen<00:00:18.800> with<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> ACE<00:00:20.070> ending

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
than what we've seen with the ACE ending

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.730 
than what we've seen with the ACE ending
aorta<00:00:20.939> where<00:00:21.119> there<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> hinge<00:00:22.289> point<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
aorta where there was a hinge point in

aorta where there was a hinge point in
the<00:00:22.859> curve<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> around<00:00:24.060> six<00:00:24.600> centimeters<00:00:25.279> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the curve and around six centimeters the

the curve and around six centimeters the
risk<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:27.269> having<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:28.130> complication<00:00:30.500> related

risk for having a complication related

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.060 
risk for having a complication related
to<00:00:31.679> an<00:00:31.830> aneurysm<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> descending<00:00:33.390> aorta

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
to an aneurysm of the descending aorta

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.650 
to an aneurysm of the descending aorta
typically<00:00:35.070> occurs<00:00:36.020> out<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.440> 7<00:00:38.040> centimeters

typically occurs out at 7 centimeters

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.030 
typically occurs out at 7 centimeters
and<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> standard<00:00:40.350> recommendation<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and so the standard recommendation of

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
and so the standard recommendation of
when<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.309> operate<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.850> someone's<00:00:42.270> descending

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
when we operate on someone's descending

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.330 
when we operate on someone's descending
aorta<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.500> 6<00:00:44.340> centimeters<00:00:45.649> as<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.920> mentioned

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
aorta is 6 centimeters as I mentioned

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.080 
aorta is 6 centimeters as I mentioned
previously<00:00:47.840> for<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> ACE<00:00:49.079> ending<00:00:49.500> aorta

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
previously for the ACE ending aorta

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.430 
previously for the ACE ending aorta
there<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.300> certain<00:00:51.719> subsets<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> patients

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
there are certain subsets of patients

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
there are certain subsets of patients
who<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.730> curve<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> shifted<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
who we think this curve is shifted to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.139 
who we think this curve is shifted to
the<00:00:54.750> left<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:56.160> includes<00:00:56.489> patients<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the left that includes patients with a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
the left that includes patients with a
family<00:00:57.539> history<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.989> aortic<00:00:58.440> disease<00:00:58.770> someone

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
family history of aortic disease someone

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
family history of aortic disease someone
who<00:00:59.879> survived<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.629> aortic<00:01:01.050> dissection

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
who survived an aortic dissection

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
who survived an aortic dissection
someone<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.760> connective<00:01:03.329> tissue<00:01:03.539> disorder

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
someone with connective tissue disorder

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.880 
someone with connective tissue disorder
like<00:01:04.290> Marfan's<00:01:04.860> loeys-dietz<00:01:05.580> syndrome<00:01:05.720> etc

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
like Marfan's loeys-dietz syndrome etc

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.620 
like Marfan's loeys-dietz syndrome etc
and<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.250> those<00:01:08.400> folks<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:09.299> often

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and so when those folks will often

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.420 
and so when those folks will often
recommending<00:01:10.229> will<00:01:11.070> often<00:01:11.310> recommend

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
recommending will often recommend

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
recommending will often recommend
operating<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> aorta<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> bit

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
operating on the aorta when it's a bit

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.510 
operating on the aorta when it's a bit
smaller<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.430> five<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> half<00:01:15.270> centimeters

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
smaller like five and a half centimeters

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.249 
smaller like five and a half centimeters
another<00:01:17.520> important<00:01:18.060> thing<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> understand<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
another important thing to understand is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200 
another important thing to understand is
that<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:20.159> only<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.729> look<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> absolute

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that not only do we look at the absolute

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.350 
that not only do we look at the absolute
size<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> aorta<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.460> recommend<00:01:24.299> an

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
size of the aorta when we recommend an

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
size of the aorta when we recommend an
operation<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.500> try<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> predict<00:01:26.250> what

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
operation for it or try to predict what

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.359 
operation for it or try to predict what
the<00:01:26.490> risk<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.170> having<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.409> complication<00:01:28.950> from

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the risk of having a complication from

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030 
the risk of having a complication from
your<00:01:29.520> aneurysm<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.290> also<00:01:31.439> look<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
your aneurysm is but we also look at the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.819 
your aneurysm is but we also look at the
rate<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.520> growth<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.229> important

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
rate of growth and so it's important

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.800 
rate of growth and so it's important
when<00:01:35.340> you've<00:01:35.490> had<00:01:35.579> multiple<00:01:35.820> imaging<00:01:36.479> studies

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
when you've had multiple imaging studies

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.450 
when you've had multiple imaging studies
of<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.170> aorta<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.220> big

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
of your aorta because it's not big

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
of your aorta because it's not big
enough<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> operate<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.170> understand

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
enough to operate on is to understand

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.520 
enough to operate on is to understand
the<00:01:40.979> trends<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.610> time<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the trends over time if we see that the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
the trends over time if we see that the
aorta<00:01:43.950> has<00:01:44.100> grown<00:01:44.399> more<00:01:44.700> than<00:01:44.850> five

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
aorta has grown more than five

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.420 
aorta has grown more than five
millimeters<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.200> year's<00:01:46.470> time<00:01:46.530> we

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
millimeters in one year's time we

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
millimeters in one year's time we
consider<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> rapid<00:01:48.659> amount<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.049> growth

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
consider that a rapid amount of growth

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.260 
consider that a rapid amount of growth
and<00:01:49.619> we'll<00:01:50.040> generally<00:01:50.520> recommend<00:01:51.149> an

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and we'll generally recommend an

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.130 
and we'll generally recommend an
operation<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.200> section<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.280> aorta<00:01:54.140> for

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
operation on that section of aorta for

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.319 
operation on that section of aorta for
every<00:01:55.560> person<00:01:56.009> though<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.850> always

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
every person though it's always

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
every person though it's always
important<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.380> understand<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.040> we

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
important that we understand that we

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.450 
important that we understand that we
have<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.520> balance<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.000> risk<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.689> surgery

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
have to balance the risk of surgery

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.679 
have to balance the risk of surgery
against<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> risk<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.909> rupture<00:02:03.299> or

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
against the risk of rupture or

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.780 
against the risk of rupture or
dissection<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.159> when<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.520> healthy

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
