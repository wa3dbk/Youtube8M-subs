 Diogo to vote the issue of sufficient dementia of dead soldiers 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.059
 I think people did not know 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.690
 my reading at that moment 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.409
 People need to know how to brush wisdom teeth. 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.519
 it is intended to be missing with 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:18.939
 in the same empirical study 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.349
 many times that of education was my text believing that the 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.429
 educational problem in which people had no dental culture 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.829
 I wrote my first book that drew a smile that they for their end 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.250
 is a practical guide for anyone any dentistry 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.070
 submitted pakaramba from egypt without fast backing 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.790
 and then I started to be called to give lecture 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.780
 and on that issue of the book 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.090
 so I was invited by schools to talk in schools 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.620
 on these issues the world team 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.170
 testimonials from educators how do you make 3 500 copies for one more of the team 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.400
 date from when I started these lectures at first spoke 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.630
 schools and my speech and appropriated by the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.970
 audience 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.140
 And then when I started public school 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.700
 the mother who does not appear in the next video 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.010
 There you go, denying what was said in Canada. 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.079
 but take a look at my son's mouth 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.399
 to her it showed the mouth of her son I saw that mouth all toasted 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.740
 and she spoke thus with the problem without which she does not have a great year 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.690
 the side March motta in large 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.070
 I do not have money and look how many people have day and how I 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.250
 I do the expovap ap ap ap ap ap ap ap ap your papinho 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.310
 but it turns out that this status as a candidate 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.540
 since I did not have money there I said 5 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.980
 was not in the university goes in the final the website but it is not every day was in the 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.330
 faculty that always 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.370
 there are no names and there is already no one 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.740
 when she sensitizes me to a story that her mother and me 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.170
 the total cost of the process 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.670
 that's how I started the process of having a social vision and doing something 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.939
 this began to spread to increasingly find such audiences and 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.359
 this kind of mother these kind of crimes 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.399
 that's when I got the idea to say good 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.589
 some friends and we make a reality 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.390
 that's how the network began 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.980
 of voluntary dentists and then we set up the good 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.919
 and the dentist of the good and then the dentist of the good happened to have of simple mdb them 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:37.469
 action 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.539
 one of the first to children from 0 to 5 years and fine 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.909
 Let's go to public school. 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.889
 or entities it is 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.289
 the social partners where they are 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.969
 we identify the poorest children 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.159
 closer to the first job so the older children 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.239
 we are further ahead 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.959
 and children with more vocal problems, I am 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.319
 the mouth destroyed 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.319
 these children are selected and they are 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.739
 and then we begin to mobilize the dental class of the private sector 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.840
 and he opened a time in his schedule to 2 3 braaten of that child until the 18 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.879
 years and have the opportunity to volunteer within the 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.119
 and dentists who attend at sea 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.570
 creations is a network that has been growing 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.399
 is growing 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.259
 and today there are almost five thousand Indians 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.780
 how many children have this right can we save 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.819
 got you out of your condition 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.320
 It's more or less says that we propose ourselves as 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.389
 as emergency in the class of the environment the project dentist of the good 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.619
 disney 5 we had six hundred children 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.229
 then in 2006 we have next month 53 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.759
 in 2007 we opened six thousand five hundred children 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.209
 and this year we know that in the calendar 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.839
 on time 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.779
 our our term 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.039
 on August 28th every dentistry 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:11.299
 When we reward the best dentists in the country, it's not my best. 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.609
 restoration the best appliance 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.699
 but I got easier with the dentist who did most that year for 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.210
 more children than we have been able to reproduce the same project in 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.340
 other countries 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.680
 We're already doing the same thing that we're doing here. 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.389
 happening in argentina in venezuela and in portugal 'in brazil there are 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.159

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.180

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:49.900
 stay 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.770
 why is it that it has not passed from 17% 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.500
 since she had gone to the dentist and there at the beginning when I wrote the book 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.020
 the best school is the best part only to whom I was telling people 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.050
 you can not even find the worst choice for the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.889
 it is out of the reality of the money he has that family has 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.909
 He was expelled by family. 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.150
