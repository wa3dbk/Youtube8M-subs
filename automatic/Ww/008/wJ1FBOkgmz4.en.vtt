00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.830
 this has many faces is like peeling 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.830
 an onion or the face of a bastard 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.190
 hello and welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.930
 I bring you a trick here on the map cut 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.450
 of at and good this trick what 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.880
 would consist in staying in the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.320
 how to make like we say and be able to enter 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.390
 in places where with the after life 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.430
 we can enter and well the first thing that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.070
 we need is with colleague a colleague 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.340
 invites us to his departure according 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.559
 be he the host the judge can not 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.390
 transform into good ghost mode 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.040
 may but can not do the same 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.350
 trick that we since the game does not 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.989
 You can leave the game 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.190
 and good for it what we would need 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.129
 would enter a game 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.649
 personalized and good to revive us to 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.839
 all once revived what 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.190
 we would have to do would be to wait for 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.309
 give us the grenades to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.409
 committing suicide does not need to commit suicide 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.409
 the match that would be the lic bird or the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.299
 posy 78 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.399
 and good with notes when they notice the 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.549
 grenades as you see we committed suicide all 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.799
 those of us who are not the host here committed suicide 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.840
 he has war because he wanted and good when 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.110
 let's have hands like that of ghost 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.910
 we abandon 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.210
 and now what we have to do will be 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.690
 wait for him to invite us to join 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.630
 we 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.060
 and it comes out of the two forms the truth I 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.250
 I recommend joining if you do not have people who 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.720
 that's one, so you better invite but 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.630
 Well I recommend you to join like this 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.060
 directly this is only in private 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.280
 they are not worth public but the good thing about this 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.430
 what you have is that here in private you can 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.160
 climb rank if you create good barriers 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.770
 because I'm going to show you places where 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.120
 you can create barriers with this trick is 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.860
 that can put you everywhere 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.430
 these of 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.430
 of the afterlife mode where you can get 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.320
 all of the fabrics but we do not 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.899
 we could in the normal character but 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.610
 with this trick if we can as you can 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.800
 observe now this is open to 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.270
 us that we just joined is 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.720
 as if we were in art earl mode 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.730
 there is still but we are not 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.130
 and good the truth is that it is very good 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.140
 what is happening 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.610
 well this has a disadvantage that 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.750
 we can open doors those who have 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.220
 this and good as you see the host sees it like this 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.050
 As you can see, the imp gets in there 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.570
 and goes out when he wants like that he would see it 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.540
 host this can also serve to 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.060
 trolling anyone and good the truth 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.800
 which is very good I will show you a couple of 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.390
 little pieces of map for you to go 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.130
 boiling 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.870
 and good your pleasure in all holes 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.420
 of these art like I told you 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.790
 before 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.770
 and well nothing this is all I hope that you 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.390
 I liked him a line and to attribute 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.390
 for more videos until soon 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.610
 but I do not like it 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.610
 while painting the walls 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.970
 and standing 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.510
 like 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.970
 yes 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.290
 yes 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.479
 I guess you're lucky 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.479
 so woman 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.250
 all right 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.760
 do not touch me 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.530
 like 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.979
 goodbye
