I wonder what we'll get in this next

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.870 
I wonder what we'll get in this next
pack<00:03:33.450> could<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.230> be<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.410> blinky<00:03:35.040> code<00:03:35.310> card<00:03:35.640> and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
pack could it be a blinky code card and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.259 
pack could it be a blinky code card and
a<00:03:36.269> bruiser<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.900> Ned<00:03:37.200> glump<00:03:37.670> let's<00:03:38.670> find<00:03:39.030> out

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
a bruiser and Ned glump let's find out

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.479 
a bruiser and Ned glump let's find out
shall<00:03:39.300> we

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
shall we

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.500 
shall we
first<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.820> code<00:03:42.030> card<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:43.500> blinky<00:03:44.040> and

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
first up the code card it's blinky and

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.100 
first up the code card it's blinky and
the<00:03:45.510> glump

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
the glump

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.280 
the glump
I'm<00:03:46.260> guessing<00:03:46.680> yep<00:03:47.430> bruiser<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.870> Ned

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
I'm guessing yep bruiser and Ned

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.280 
I'm guessing yep bruiser and Ned
surprise<00:03:50.190> surprise

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
surprise surprise

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.570 
surprise surprise
so<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.320> guess<00:03:52.590> technically<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.100> could<00:03:53.400> almost

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
so I guess technically I could almost

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.600 
so I guess technically I could almost
like<00:03:53.970> open<00:03:54.780> up<00:03:54.810> half<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.230> box<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:56.070> then<00:03:56.340> sell

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
like open up half the box and then sell

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.820 
like open up half the box and then sell

going from the front so let's see if we

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.140 
going from the front so let's see if we
got<00:05:31.110> another<00:05:31.230> Holga<00:05:31.770> code<00:05:32.040> and<00:05:32.400> Holga<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:32.970> tin

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150
