00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.360
 many mysteries has this game and this 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.450
 is one of them and we know that it appeared 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.019
 when the trailer came out of fainé 64 and 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.360
 before the premiere of this and the truth is 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.880
 that because we finally up to 64 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.310
 we play in a house I know that the majority already 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.310
 has its own theories and reasons for 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.320
 why but there are others that do not and every 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.320
 who decides which one you want to stay with 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.300
 I just a few days ago on the page of 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.490
 facebook I asked some of 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.100
 you this and many were the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.410
 participants and thanks them I 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.190
 I chose five that were very interesting 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.770
 for me and I want to share them with you 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.260
 before starting this I asked him hours 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.770
 before the game came out that is 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.980
 nobody had the idea ready how and the 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.980
 why do we play here now if we start 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.379
 The first theory was written by Juan 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.080
 Andrey Portillo was going like that, my theory is that 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.600
 this house is the house of the purple man and 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.240
 that he in a past maybe once 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.520
 none of this had happened could have 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.979
 had a son who has discovered what 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.830
 what his father did and he has seen pictures 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.110
 also in the past the purple man 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.900
 could have given him the doll of plhus 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.720
 trap and there must have been the souls of 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.270
 the children and how the child would be the son 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.990
 of the purple man because these will want 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.990
 get revenge 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.490
 [Music] 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.120
 the second theory was written by 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.270
 sebastián alexander baldía ale and this goes 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.490
 well the reason why it's a house was 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.070
 because a child bought plus trap and the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.500
 he took home the animatronics there is no 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.410
 men located plus tap and that's why 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.840
 are in your house 2 neinver consumption for 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.420
 scare the child and as they say the image 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.420
 from the plus that big things can come 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 in small packages then plus after that 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.360
 small package and the animatronics the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.320
 big things that will torment a child 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.320
 for five nights 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.659
 [Music] 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.540
 which is in third place was 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.120
 written by daniel padilla garcía iba 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.370
 in the following way we all know that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.280
 is a child the main character of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.799
 this game but for me the reason why 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.650
 which one we play in a house is because it is 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.200
 a new life of scott in it appears 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.959
 a child as a protagonist maybe that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.750
 child is a reference even to their children 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.510
 since it is a new idea and the reason for 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.879
 the creation of this is to connect it or 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.969
 to solve and end an 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.669
 mystery that we all know and still not 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:56.379
 had been revealed which is the 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.379
 bite of 87 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.069
 in position number 4 we have the theory 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.829
 of esteban marcos montenegro and the 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.769
 he wrote the reason why we play 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.200
 here is because it's scott's dream he 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.720
 he always said it, I had nightmares with 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.180
 the first game of fineness fredys and by 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.269
 that this game also I think is the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.190
 first of all and in addition money always 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.890
 it was the animatronic that scared the most 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.189
 was for that reason in the trailer 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.069
 bonnie appear more times and this is the 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.829
 Scott's house because it's his dream and there 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.560
 we will play and maybe I had several stuffed animals 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.569
 that also scared him for that reason 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.569
 I represent him in the game 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.570
 [Music] 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.060
 and finally we have the exact theory of 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.430
 the reason for this mystery I do not know how to 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.790
 did but he said it hours before 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.230
 premiere of job 64 its owner is 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.470
 ramsés fl and goes like this the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.120
 reason is because the game is a prequel 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.640
 and this is a boy from a party in the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.150
 pizzeria and if it was affected by 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.850
 the bite of 87 and the story goes five 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.420
 days before the birthday where it happened 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.830
 this tragic accident in which he was 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.310
 the victim of the bite of 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.280
 animatronic he did in the year 1987 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.980
 but he had already had plots with it 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.430
 because his friends scared him for that 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.350
 reason we are in a nightmare mode I do not 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.590
 It is nothing more to say who decides 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.840
 you by your own theory choose the one that 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.020
 you convince you more and if it does not convince you 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.840
 none is your own theory and leave me the 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.000
 know in the comment box give me 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.970
 a law to support me and motivate me 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.200
 make more videos as these share it 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.750
