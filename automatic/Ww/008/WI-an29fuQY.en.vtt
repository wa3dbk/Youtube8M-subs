 I have considered the following to I will give away a server among all 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.089
 subscribers 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.559
 Percent of this was Wettig Barnim 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.349
 first fared to a thousand percent 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.810
 So, they introduced an arbitrary import and painted and users percent Vista 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.039
 Processes suddenly fire all subscribers ads 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.550
 Scroll a bit 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.820
 and nowhere really easy on and percent less gets on 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 Percent of this server of server power to run for a full year 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.490

 the whole book is edited by Nitra Blom 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.930
 where we also had that our server 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.990
 Percent he drove down now and I do not really know myself 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.100
 have time 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.680
 and therefore percent now lost in general with that percent there 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.990
 time goes by unnecessarily, I say 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.570
 and that stands at our first suspicion as markets all that until then 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.600
 subscribe for us 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.230

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.440
 Percent estimated where such a bit of coking meters this Cells this check 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.830
 Percent or more BZ appear suspicious 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.390
 really leave these out, so if they look like they're easy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 Thank you for this service 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.950
 Mixing the excepted voices are really just about having like that 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
