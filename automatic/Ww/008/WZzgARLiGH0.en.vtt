00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.170
 the sighting of the belgium is one 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.760
 unique testimony of its kind for 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 in fact, the first time in history 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.139
 lauro belgian buttock reveals the elements 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 more burning than a phenomenon that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.189
 scientists and military did not hesitate 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 to define inexplicable and May 30th 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.480
 of 1990 a few kilometers from the border 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.400
 with the holland 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.890
 hundreds of people including three 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 police patrols watch for 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.899
 several minutes the evolution of one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.540
 strange triangular apparatus 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.300
 gloss and sem art science radars that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.910
 they control the air traffic of the area 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.950
 they pick up an abnormal signal 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.989
 no one imagines yet what from there 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.790
 a few minutes will then happen at 00 05 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.550
 from the Air Force headquarters 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.059
 Belgian military orders to make 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.860
 take off two f16 planes take you 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.230
 immediately in radar contact with 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.370
 what later will be defined 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.290
 unidentified flying object 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.530
 suddenly to the unknown object 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.100
 going from 300 to 1700 feet in height 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.009
 accelerates from 280 1,700 kilometers per hour 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.810
 in just one second, making them lose 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.369
 own tracks 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.930
 an acceleration impossible for 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.270
 any manufacturing aircraft 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.030
 Earth that would cause death 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.159
 immediate of every human being since the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 maximum limit that can bear a 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.950
 fighter pilot is five times more 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 bass 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.409
 at the end of the investigation the colonel 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.390
 the brower head of the operation section 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.329
 Belgian aviation releases one 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.329
 spooky exotic todd statement 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.469
 that when serious scientists say 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.450
 that we must have the courage to 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.369
 to face the hypothesis of phenomena of 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.030
 extraterrestrial origin 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.560
 how she reacts we are always cautious 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.899
 because we need proof 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.709
 concrete these hypotheses is clear 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.709
 remains open
