video aerial systems and I'm here today
to<00:00:09.910> explain<00:00:10.330> to<00:00:10.480> you<00:00:10.629> the<00:00:10.900> Blue<00:00:11.259> Beam<00:00:11.499> antenna

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:12.039 
to explain to you the Blue Beam antenna

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.119 
to explain to you the Blue Beam antenna
set<00:00:12.900> when<00:00:13.900> picking<00:00:14.200> an<00:00:14.320> antenna<00:00:14.709> set<00:00:14.980> you

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
set when picking an antenna set you

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.770 
set when picking an antenna set you
always<00:00:15.519> are<00:00:15.669> looking<00:00:15.849> for<00:00:16.180> what<00:00:16.449> will<00:00:16.630> give

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
always are looking for what will give

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.780 
always are looking for what will give
you<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:17.020> best<00:00:17.260> video<00:00:17.650> for<00:00:17.710> your<00:00:18.070> missions<00:00:18.430> and

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
you the best video for your missions and

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.820 
you the best video for your missions and
we've<00:00:19.330> video<00:00:19.630> areas<00:00:19.990> systems<00:00:20.320> have<00:00:20.470> developed

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
we've video areas systems have developed

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.590 
we've video areas systems have developed
the<00:00:20.920> Blue<00:00:21.160> Beam<00:00:21.370> sets<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:22.000> there<00:00:22.360> are<00:00:22.420> three

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
the Blue Beam sets and there are three

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.290 
the Blue Beam sets and there are three
types<00:00:22.840> to<00:00:23.050> choose<00:00:23.080> from<00:00:23.670> there's<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:25.060> Blue

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
types to choose from there's the Blue

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.830 
types to choose from there's the Blue
Beam

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
Beam

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.090 
Beam
omni's<00:00:27.120> there's<00:00:28.120> the<00:00:28.330> Blue<00:00:28.510> Beam<00:00:28.750> WIPs<00:00:29.350> or

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
omni's there's the Blue Beam WIPs or

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.750 
omni's there's the Blue Beam WIPs or
there's<00:00:30.940> the<00:00:31.180> Blue<00:00:31.390> Beam<00:00:31.630> Ultra<00:00:32.590> so<00:00:33.430> what<00:00:33.640> are

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
there's the Blue Beam Ultra so what are

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.710 
there's the Blue Beam Ultra so what are
they<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.060> what<00:00:34.150> are<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.360> differences

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
they and what are the differences

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.160 
they and what are the differences
between<00:00:34.990> them<00:00:35.350> well<00:00:36.510> they're<00:00:37.510> all<00:00:37.750> basically

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
between them well they're all basically

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.960 
between them well they're all basically
the<00:00:38.530> same<00:00:38.680> style<00:00:39.310> of<00:00:39.400> antenna<00:00:39.790> they're

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
the same style of antenna they're

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.520 
the same style of antenna they're
omnidirectional<00:00:40.420> which<00:00:41.050> means<00:00:41.260> they<00:00:41.410> get

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
omnidirectional which means they get

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.740 
omnidirectional which means they get
coverage<00:00:42.010> all<00:00:42.280> around<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.970> they're<00:00:43.360> great

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
coverage all around you they're great

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.200 
coverage all around you they're great
for<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.050> transmitter<00:00:44.590> or<00:00:44.680> receiver<00:00:45.210> antenna

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
for a transmitter or receiver antenna

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.440 
for a transmitter or receiver antenna
they're<00:00:47.170> circularly<00:00:47.800> polarized<00:00:48.399> so<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.120> helps

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
they're circularly polarized so it helps

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.300 
they're circularly polarized so it helps
resist<00:00:49.810> the<00:00:49.960> multipath<00:00:50.560> interference<00:00:50.800> to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
resist the multipath interference to

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.690 
resist the multipath interference to
cause<00:00:51.489> your<00:00:51.640> video<00:00:51.910> to<00:00:52.060> mix<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.540> scramble<00:00:53.700> the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
cause your video to mix and scramble the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.490 
cause your video to mix and scramble the
only<00:00:54.970> difference<00:00:55.390> here<00:00:55.750> between<00:00:56.140> each

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
only difference here between each

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.350 
only difference here between each
antenna<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:57.040> how<00:00:57.340> they're<00:00:57.579> mounted<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.090> how

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
antenna is how they're mounted and how

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.860 
antenna is how they're mounted and how
they<00:00:58.510> perform<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.370> original<00:01:00.850> sets<00:01:01.120> were

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
they perform the original sets were

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.950 
they perform the original sets were

versatile they work excellent and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.120 
versatile they work excellent and
they're<00:01:16.450> still<00:01:16.810> preferred<00:01:17.260> by<00:01:17.409> most<00:01:17.740> pilots

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
they're still preferred by most pilots

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.910 
they're still preferred by most pilots
out<00:01:18.490> there<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:19.390> course<00:01:19.570> there's<00:01:20.380> also<00:01:20.680> the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
out there of course there's also the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.700 
out there of course there's also the
Blue<00:01:21.280> Beam<00:01:21.460> whips<00:01:22.330> what's<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.380> difference

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
Blue Beam whips what's the difference

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.430 
Blue Beam whips what's the difference
the<00:01:24.280> only<00:01:24.340> difference<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.360> coaxial<00:01:25.930> cable

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
the only difference is the coaxial cable

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.440 
the only difference is the coaxial cable
it's<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.460> same<00:01:27.729> antenna<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.270> only

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
it's the same antenna the only

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.940 
it's the same antenna the only
difference<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:29.020> it's<00:01:29.260> not<00:01:29.380> quite<00:01:29.680> as

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
difference is it's not quite as

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.530 
difference is it's not quite as
versatile<00:01:30.430> because<00:01:30.790> I've<00:01:31.030> installed<00:01:31.360> a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
versatile because I've installed a

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.649 
versatile because I've installed a
coaxial<00:01:32.110> cable<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.770> given<00:01:33.340> length<00:01:33.549> just<00:01:34.450> so

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
coaxial cable of a given length just so

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.359 
coaxial cable of a given length just so
it<00:01:34.780> immediately<00:01:35.140> stays<00:01:35.530> far<00:01:35.950> enough<00:01:36.220> away

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
it immediately stays far enough away

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.100 
it immediately stays far enough away
from<00:01:36.670> your<00:01:36.790> transmitter<00:01:37.270> or<00:01:37.479> your<00:01:37.689> receiver

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
from your transmitter or your receiver

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.050 
from your transmitter or your receiver
so<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.770> don't<00:01:39.040> get<00:01:39.159> reflections<00:01:39.760> off<00:01:39.909> the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
so you don't get reflections off the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.370 
so you don't get reflections off the
system<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:42.220> my<00:01:42.369> newest<00:01:42.729> set<00:01:43.060> I'm<00:01:43.290> keeping<00:01:44.290> the

is where I started and this is my latest

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.840 
is where I started and this is my latest
innovation<00:01:59.049> after<00:01:59.259> two<00:01:59.500> years<00:01:59.829> I<00:02:00.159> have<00:02:00.670> come

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
innovation after two years I have come

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.080 
innovation after two years I have come
up<00:02:00.970> with<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.290> better<00:02:02.290> axial<00:02:02.829> ratio<00:02:03.090> better

they<00:02:41.410> still<00:02:41.709> work<00:02:41.920> great<00:02:42.570> just<00:02:43.570> because<00:02:43.780> this

they still work great just because this
