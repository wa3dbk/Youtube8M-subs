I had just called my friend and asked

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.100 
I had just called my friend and asked

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
her about it it would have been fine so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
her about it it would have been fine so
my<00:01:58.200> therapist<00:01:58.710> called<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> an<00:01:59.520> interpersonal

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
my therapist called it an interpersonal

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
my therapist called it an interpersonal
triangle<00:02:00.930> or<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> right

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
triangle or I think that's the right

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.800 
triangle or I think that's the right
term<00:02:01.979> basically<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.180> me<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> having

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
term basically if it's me and you having

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
term basically if it's me and you having
problems<00:02:03.960> we're<00:02:04.560> aligned<00:02:04.950> right<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.460> our

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
to you or straight-line if this gets too

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.900

stressful<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.380> can't<00:02:10.979> deal<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.400> often

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
stressful or I can't deal with it often

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.150 
stressful or I can't deal with it often
people<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:12.810> reach<00:02:13.020> for<00:02:13.290> something<00:02:13.500> outside

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
people will reach for something outside

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.250 
people will reach for something outside
of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.490> line<00:02:14.700> which<00:02:15.060> creates<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.720> triangle

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
of the line which creates the triangle

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.190 
of the line which creates the triangle
and<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.740> he<00:02:16.890> says<00:02:17.160> don't<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.360> because<00:02:18.900> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and so he says don't do that because it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.080 
and so he says don't do that because it
feels<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.740> drama<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.520> learned<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.970> valuable

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
