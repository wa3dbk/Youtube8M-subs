00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.660 
with his assault rifle so that being new
for<00:01:18.720> me<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.350> being<00:01:19.530> said<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
for me you know that being said this is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
for me you know that being said this is
something<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> learning<00:01:21.869> experience

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
something that is a learning experience

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.600 
something that is a learning experience
for<00:01:22.619> me<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> bring<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.460> guys

for me and I want to bring you guys

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
for me and I want to bring you guys
through<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.170> do

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
through it to see if I can actually do

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
through it to see if I can actually do
because<00:01:25.740> I've<00:01:25.890> never<00:01:26.040> had<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.640> incentive<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
because I've never had and incentive to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.569 
because I've never had and incentive to
to<00:01:27.869> learn<00:01:28.080> how<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> snipe<00:01:28.619> correctly<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> mean

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
to learn how to snipe correctly I mean

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.580 
to learn how to snipe correctly I mean
as<00:01:30.000> far<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.360> quick<00:01:30.570> scoping<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.140> something

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
as far as quick scoping that something

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.990 
as far as quick scoping that something
will<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.400> comes<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.820> getting

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
will see I think that comes with getting

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480 
will see I think that comes with getting
used<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> gun<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.810> begin<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
used to the gun to begin with but I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.149 
used to the gun to begin with but I
guess<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.840> only<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> road<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.710> level

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
guess this is a not only a road to level

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.149 
guess this is a not only a road to level
30<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.729> MSR<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.380> me<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.799> road

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
30 with the MSR but for me it's a road

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.690 
30 with the MSR but for me it's a road
to<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.460> sniper<00:01:42.500> see

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
to a sniper see

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.279 
to a sniper see
and<00:01:44.270> that's<00:01:44.420> something<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.780> think<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.140> guys

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
and that's something I think you guys
