 yo people welcome to a new qu'il ne 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.700
 Today we again have a verlekker 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.040
 question I have answered you 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.790
 sent to me on twitter with ascii 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.620
 gpp 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.820
 if you don't follow me yet have a 20 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.719
 work like this is my personal 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.820
 account 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 and this is the golf ball account 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 provisions so if you want to hear it then 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.270
 never miss information again 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.859
 people like your thumbs already had thatched 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.689
 I thought the plate again time 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.460
 so let's start with the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.760
 first question and the first question comes from 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.230
 jeroen and jeroen that question how are you up 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.989
 the idea came to start with 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 youtube actually used to be in 2006 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.260
 was that then was with the friend of mine 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 a lot of hunting and the movies 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.860
 also gta finish by the way i had this one 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 place needed to show it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 and youtube stood all 2006 so then had it 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.510
 I created an account or it was me 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.039
 a 2800 this account fanned a few and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.449
 then I put up videos and a few years 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.460
 later view large bridge 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 American youtubers who also have game channel 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.030
 for example, had the bases like me 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.030
 my neck my favorite example and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.430
 of course from pottery smoke and yes now 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 I do this anyway ask me what would you like 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.939
 if you were a cat well I think 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 sleep eat sleep eat yourself once 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.180
 wash because if needed and then 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.340
 basically everything again 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.960
 he did not forget to annoy your boss 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.939
 because you want to eat 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 irritate your boss because you're at the most 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.970
 logical place for slept yes that kind 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.820
 stuff 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.439
 in other words, my cats are really terrible 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.299
 young they go to sleep then they read the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.939
 wake up half a day is mine 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.860
 they have eaten those whining for food 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.049
 yes they want to sleep for hours by waking them up 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 we eat them again what the fuck I want 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.200
 man also had roi who asks 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.119
 so left though the channel is wrong 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.280
 pronounce but now come best why 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.390
 column power to this I can put on two 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 interpret ways 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 maybe he asks why conop power 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.049
 in my name or why do I drink 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.880
 Anyway the coal power 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.200
 she will mainly answer two what we 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 they buy power in menu name 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.670
 yes that is from the energy drink brand 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.610
 because that was very addicted to and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.460
 the ground 2006 2008 therefore I had it in 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.080
 my name processed 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.180
 as faithful as the answer to that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.450
 another question ramon van der maas asks 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.229
 on a scale from one to 69 what are you 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.390
 favorite color 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.160
 and the alphabet on which scale on a 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.900
 fruit bowl arno 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.300
 I look like I am smart but I am 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.190
 whether or not you ask for the question 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.459
 recognized on the street and if so what did you find 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.220
 of it 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.480
 That was a nice question that I am 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.640
 recognized several times last month 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.430
 last time was on an open day of the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.569
 rkc waalwijk stood there with mitch then 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.300
 little football 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.010
 the cold no to guests and dietetics and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.140
 the me and who knows the most from your 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.790
 approach until the photo became fuckin 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.739
 always nice to meet fans 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.209
 the market really greeted very bluntly 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.739
 your not good was the best 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.080
 and if we already had good then makes 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.640
 it was even better and beautiful then after that 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.050
 Match I had seen the walked away 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.670
 To come new to me already 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.540
 beuker we also know the picture on 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.610
 fucking cool 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.320
 neighborhood really one of the nicest divisor and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.420
 a few days later told a match 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.640
 who walked in a supermarket and that someone 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.440
 then also recognized him and that forms were 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.120
 never happened that anyone mix in them one 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.010
 Jack and thereby without me will our 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.540
 even though hilarious is really super fat and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.820
 angelique it just came to me 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.530
 My god is in the picture with you a bit 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.269

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.820
 problem I'm not scary open 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.860
 I what you think of this shirt 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.570
 it seeing the fact that there is a goat in it 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.250
 and that there are very many goats in that 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.630
 goat standing of course does mean that 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.549
 that it is still a fucking awesome shirt 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.489
 so i would exist i am nick 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.829
 Harbers who asks Samsung or Apple 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.720
 In terms of telephones, I always have Samsung goes 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.070
 so then I like the choice easily 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.110
 I sometimes played with iphones 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.820
 But Billy is just not bad you know 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.400
 well but it's just not my thing and 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.090
 in terms of computer jeff also say apple 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.680
 computers 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.600
 i'm completely working with windows and 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.459
 I seriously tried the mac 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.120
 to work because I was in school and then 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.739
 breda 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.180
 and there they had so many windows 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.100
 so computers me from mac every time 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.840
 computer and yes if all windows 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.489
 computers are busy then you have to go back 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.780
 all that mix and the fire I say 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.310
 Just wedding day from safe to we 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.450
 try to cooperate but it will 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.790
 might be a matter of getting used to 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.350
 we don't really like that backup 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.769
 are not accustomed to the latter 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.410
 ask fabian woud that question plush chicken 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.540
 well and if not I would give them an xvr and myself 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.949
 already on freethiel need to that is also possible 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.230

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.260
 I don't know which chicken is really fucking 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.360

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.720
 those were today's questions 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.850
 maybe a cue and ebb soon 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.930
 press the thumb up and down in the fall 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.530
