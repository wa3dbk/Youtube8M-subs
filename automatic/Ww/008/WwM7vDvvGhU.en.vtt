I bought a pair because backup lighting

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.220 
I bought a pair because backup lighting
is<00:00:19.060> highly<00:00:19.330> recommended<00:00:19.480> for<00:00:20.050> nighttime

the<00:00:25.930> primary<00:00:26.350> appeal<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.800> European<00:00:27.220> lighting

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
the primary appeal of European lighting

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.620 
the primary appeal of European lighting
is<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:27.700> fact<00:00:28.029> that<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.300> beam<00:00:28.450> is

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
is the fact that the beam is

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.510 
is the fact that the beam is
asymmetrical<00:00:29.380> in<00:00:29.560> shape<00:00:29.830> to<00:00:29.980> illuminate<00:00:30.369> the

asymmetrical in shape to illuminate the
road<00:00:30.730> rather<00:00:31.419> than<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.810> spot<00:00:32.050> light<00:00:32.290> which<00:00:32.470> can

the difference in a moment I've been

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
look at how I did the shoot to ensure

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.569 
look at how I did the shoot to ensure
all<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.230> images<00:03:38.560> were<00:03:38.709> shot<00:03:38.739> identically

one<00:03:52.930> premium<00:03:53.319> at<00:03:53.470> low<00:03:53.620> power<00:03:53.829> it's<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.730> bit

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
one premium at low power it's a bit

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.819 
one premium at low power it's a bit
disappointing<00:03:55.180> however<00:03:55.840> remember<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> light

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
disappointing however remember the light

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.500 
disappointing however remember the light
is<00:03:56.980> being<00:03:57.129> spread<00:03:57.430> out<00:03:57.609> more<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.209> camera

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
is being spread out more and the camera

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.210 
is being spread out more and the camera
is<00:03:58.569> not<00:03:58.720> capturing<00:03:59.139> as<00:03:59.260> much<00:03:59.319> detail<00:03:59.889> as<00:03:59.919> the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
is not capturing as much detail as the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.449 
is not capturing as much detail as the
eye<00:04:00.250> can<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:02.049> is<00:04:02.260> both<00:04:02.440> premiums<00:04:03.010> at<00:04:03.220> low

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
eye can this is both premiums at low

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.990 
eye can this is both premiums at low
power<00:04:03.669> much<00:04:04.629> better<00:04:04.959> with<00:04:05.199> twice<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.650> light

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
power much better with twice the light

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.339 
power much better with twice the light
things<00:04:07.000> get<00:04:07.239> interesting<00:04:07.690> when<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.870> switch<00:04:08.169> to

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
things get interesting when I switch to

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.909 
things get interesting when I switch to
high-power

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
high-power

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.879 
high-power
this<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.519> just<00:04:09.760> one<00:04:10.000> light<00:04:10.239> 80<00:04:10.599> Lux<00:04:11.049> quite

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
this is just one light 80 Lux quite

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.740 
this is just one light 80 Lux quite
frankly<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.669> enough<00:04:12.940> light<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.359> ride<00:04:13.540> at

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
frankly this is enough light to ride at

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.990 
frankly this is enough light to ride at
most<00:04:13.930> speeds<00:04:14.260> if<00:04:14.889> I'm<00:04:15.099> going<00:04:15.400> fast<00:04:15.579> enough

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
most speeds if I'm going fast enough

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.250 
most speeds if I'm going fast enough
then<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.269> suppose<00:04:16.630> more<00:04:16.959> is<00:04:17.079> always<00:04:17.320> better

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
then I suppose more is always better

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.479 
then I suppose more is always better
here's<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.320> look<00:04:20.560> at<00:04:20.709> both<00:04:20.829> lights<00:04:21.160> at<00:04:21.340> high

back<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.370> one<00:04:54.639> premium<00:04:55.199> the<00:04:56.199> output<00:04:56.620> although

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
back to one premium the output although

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.890

quite good adding a second light only
makes<00:05:01.569> it<00:05:01.690> better<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:02.169> think<00:05:02.979> this<00:05:03.129> is<00:05:03.280> overkill

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
makes it better I think this is overkill

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.249

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
for most writing but I think it'll come
