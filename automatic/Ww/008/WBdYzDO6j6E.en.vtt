00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.010
 as far as 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.369
 hole depth what should be the depth 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.689
 cut through this reception is awesome 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:29.630

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.320
 more it always needs to be 43 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.370
 millimeter look on the walls 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:40.879
 it should not be took the knife and for herachil 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.510
 centimeter cut through took the wheel I 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.900
 spoke 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.030
 four inches deep hole 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.120
 you know that there are four millimeters 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.449
 you are sure of it and then you know that 4 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.449
 millimeter if you leave like this 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.640
 you take a screwdriver 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 Now you take the edge cling like this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.520
 his law then already like that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:37.170
 this region is moving here and drown here 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:44.600
 so look again at the edge of the groped hole 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:49.230
 and you heat it up again on the edge 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 in the hole it is pushed and drowned and what 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.900
 while this is nothing I showed you in 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.410
 packing from and there now we stick on masha 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.410
 then 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.610
 material material and so slow down 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.540
 just glue and it will all be without 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:15.320
 Hurry up, there is no need for a line, and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.390
 here here here then if more glue 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.760
 rolls in it is easy to clean too 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.740
 you can even shorter than that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.950
 so take a finger and run a finger 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.910
 smeared the type and everything and start purchasing 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.910
 helped 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.519
 I'll take the ticket here this screwdriver is necessary 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.519
 work 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 2 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.020
 then you will change you like one 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.250
 millimeter set aside 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.130
 From this to catch you know then 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.260
 way here and then that little bit all 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.790
 here you are here and so on Siberia 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.540
 correct and so here so here and here 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.970
 so take it 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.630
 but this is not for you to see the edge 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:19.030
 then he clings better if he breaks that 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.400
 it is always there 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.580
 limited space on it is impossible 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.920
 damage will already be seen by many 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.170
 packs in sight this water is bad 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.450
 pack look what else is the reason 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.050
 see what kind of curve is packing 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.780
 you see 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.600
 you know why because not at once 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.460
 cut it is necessary for one run took 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.460
 the knife set so and against him the gift of 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.290
 stretched at a time that is one time before 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.420
 cut to half to here then 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.810
 intercepted can turn the handlebars come on 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.810
 farther
