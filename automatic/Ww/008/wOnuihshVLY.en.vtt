00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.470
 one 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.880
 let's prepare polo shirts 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.210
 The ingredients are 2 teaspoons 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.369
 violet paste 100 ml of water 200 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.789
 milliliters of syrup and 2 yogurts 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.059
 Greeks and we started preparing the layer 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.449
 of violets in a bowl we put the water on 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.730
 syrup and violet paste I leave you 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.200
 the light syrup link in the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.220
 description of this video 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.220
 we mix well 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.420
 we prepare the layer of yogurt putting in 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.420
 a bowl of Greek yoghurts and syrup 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.480
 and we mix 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.870
 now in our ice cream mold 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.730
 we put a layer of violets and keep 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.730
 in the freezer for one hour 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.090
 and over time we put a layer of 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.799
 yogurt and we put it back in the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.799
 freezer for another hour 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.850
 again a layer of violets 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.440
 and finally a layer of yogurt we can 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.290
 make only two layers instead of four 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.220
 if we want to put in the freezer 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.220
 for four hours 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.860
 and this is the final result 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.520
 I hope you like it
