because that's like the only way that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
because that's like the only way that
you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.829> into

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250

you can actually do so but going into
this<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.789> knew<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.020> one

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this I knew that it was going to be one

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.770 
this I knew that it was going to be one
of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.559> most<00:00:46.739> ridiculous<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.969> craziest<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
of the most ridiculous and craziest and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
of the most ridiculous and craziest and
just<00:00:49.050> absurd<00:00:49.980> challenge<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.730> I've<00:00:50.850> done<00:00:50.969> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
far because the only way that you're

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.470 
far because the only way that you're
really<00:00:53.340> gonna<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.520> able<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.850> go<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
really gonna be able to go about it is

easily<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> play<00:01:34.320> video<00:01:34.590> games<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.040> need<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
easily when I play video games I need to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.460 
easily when I play video games I need to
be<00:01:35.340> moving<00:01:35.640> around<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.140> tried

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
be moving around a lot and so I tried

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
be moving around a lot and so I tried
that<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> couple<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.790> kills<00:01:39.030> but

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that out I got a couple of kills but

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.690 
that out I got a couple of kills but
then<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> moved<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> next<00:01:40.619> tactic<00:01:41.220> which

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
then I moved on to the next tactic which

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
then I moved on to the next tactic which
is<00:01:41.850> basically<00:01:42.390> running<00:01:42.689> around<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
is basically running around like a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.380 
is basically running around like a
madman<00:01:43.799> trying<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.340> flank<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.759> enemy<00:01:45.090> as<00:01:45.180> fast

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
madman trying to flank my enemy as fast

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.420 
madman trying to flank my enemy as fast
as<00:01:45.509> possible<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.470> getting<00:01:46.710> behind<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
as possible and then getting behind the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
as possible and then getting behind the
target<00:01:47.909> placing<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.869> mind<00:01:49.079> running

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
target placing down the mind running

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380 
target placing down the mind running
away<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> couple<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.460> seconds<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
away for a couple of seconds to not you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.359 
away for a couple of seconds to not you
know<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> course<00:01:51.780> suicide<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.920> turn

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
know of course suicide on that turn

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
know of course suicide on that turn
around<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.149> fire<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.840> then

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
around and then fire on it and then

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
around and then fire on it and then
below<00:01:55.259> my<00:01:55.530> target<00:01:55.950> into<00:01:56.130> smithereens<00:01:56.369> but

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
below my target into smithereens but

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
below my target into smithereens but
really<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.780> only<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.950> tactic<00:01:59.579> was

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
really the only way that that tactic was

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.730 
really the only way that that tactic was
even<00:02:00.060> remotely<00:02:00.420> successful<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.680> came

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
even remotely successful is if I came

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100 
even remotely successful is if I came
across<00:02:02.009> someone<00:02:02.430> who<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:03.479> completely

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
across someone who was completely

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
across someone who was completely
oblivious<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> their<00:02:05.100> surroundings<00:02:05.610> even

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
oblivious to their surroundings even

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.240 
oblivious to their surroundings even
when<00:02:06.149> someone<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.689> camping<00:02:07.229> normal<00:02:08.009> players

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
when someone is camping normal players

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.520 
when someone is camping normal players
or<00:02:08.489> players<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.750> some<00:02:10.080> sort<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> idea

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
or players that have some sort of idea

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.380 
or players that have some sort of idea
as<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.069> what<00:02:11.220> they're<00:02:11.370> doing<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.879> battlefield

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
as to what they're doing in battlefield

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.430 
as to what they're doing in battlefield
3<00:02:12.420> there<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:12.989> always

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
3 there are always

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.540 
3 there are always
checking<00:02:13.710> their<00:02:13.830> surroundings<00:02:14.400> they're

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
checking their surroundings they're

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.400 
checking their surroundings they're
always<00:02:14.850> peeking<00:02:15.090> behind<00:02:15.540> every<00:02:16.050> couple<00:02:16.350> of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
always peeking behind every couple of

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.570 
always peeking behind every couple of
seconds<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.860> make<00:02:17.010> sure<00:02:17.130> someone<00:02:17.490> isn't

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
seconds to make sure someone isn't

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.130 
seconds to make sure someone isn't
flanking<00:02:18.060> them<00:02:18.240> they're<00:02:18.660> checking<00:02:18.960> their

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
flanking them they're checking their

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.990 
flanking them they're checking their
mini-map<00:02:19.590> constantly<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.400> getting

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
mini-map constantly and so getting

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.430 
mini-map constantly and so getting
behind<00:02:21.120> someone<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:21.960> completely

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
behind someone that is completely

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.620 
behind someone that is completely
oblivious<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.430> taking<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> time<00:02:24.090> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
oblivious and then taking the time to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.840 
oblivious and then taking the time to
place<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.960> mine<00:02:25.350> directly<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.430> their<00:02:26.640> feet

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
place the mine directly at their feet

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.790 
place the mine directly at their feet
without<00:02:27.210> them<00:02:27.390> hearing<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:27.960> footsteps<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
without them hearing your footsteps and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.380 
without them hearing your footsteps and
then<00:02:29.040> running<00:02:29.310> away<00:02:29.490> for<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> couple<00:02:30.270> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
then running away for a couple of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.150 
then running away for a couple of
seconds<00:02:30.660> then<00:02:30.810> turn<00:02:30.840> around<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.710> trying

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
seconds then turn around and then trying

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.790 
seconds then turn around and then trying
to<00:02:32.280> blow<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.760> isn't<00:02:33.450> easy<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.440> most

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
to blow it up isn't easy and most

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.410 
to blow it up isn't easy and most
players<00:02:35.130> turn<00:02:35.520> around<00:02:35.790> at<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.000> point<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
players turn around at that point and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.090 
players turn around at that point and
then<00:02:36.510> pump<00:02:36.720> your<00:02:36.870> face<00:02:37.050> full<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.560> bullets<00:02:37.920> and

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
then pump your face full of bullets and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.890 
then pump your face full of bullets and
so<00:02:38.550> pretty<00:02:38.790> much<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> found<00:02:39.300> myself<00:02:39.540> doing

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so pretty much what I found myself doing

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.130 
so pretty much what I found myself doing
was<00:02:40.050> always<00:02:40.500> going<00:02:40.710> after<00:02:41.270> bipod<00:02:42.270> users<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
was always going after bipod users and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.200 
was always going after bipod users and
snipers<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> then<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.460> relying<00:02:45.000> on

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
snipers and then really just relying on

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.420 
snipers and then really just relying on
a<00:02:45.270> whole<00:02:45.570> lot<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:46.080> luck<00:02:46.260> because<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.710> doesn't

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
a whole lot of luck because it doesn't

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.730 
a whole lot of luck because it doesn't
require<00:02:47.640> any<00:02:47.970> skill<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.480> did<00:02:49.050> try<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.410> figure

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
require any skill I did try to figure

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.950 
require any skill I did try to figure
out<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.100> was<00:02:50.220> any<00:02:50.490> way<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.790> throw<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
out if there was any way to throw the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.600 
out if there was any way to throw the
mines<00:02:52.260> because<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> would<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.370> made<00:02:53.490> this

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
mines because that would have made this

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.610 
mines because that would have made this
thing<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.970> little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.240> easier<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:54.990> no<00:02:55.110> unless

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
thing a little bit easier but no unless

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.680 
thing a little bit easier but no unless
unless<00:02:55.920> I'm<00:02:56.130> completely<00:02:56.250> mistaken<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.510> have

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
unless I'm completely mistaken you have

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.080 
unless I'm completely mistaken you have
to<00:02:57.870> place<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.290> directly<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.100> ground<00:02:59.550> you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
to place it directly on the ground you

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.000 
to place it directly on the ground you
have<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.300> get<00:03:00.570> right<00:03:00.960> next<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> target<00:03:01.710> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
have to get right next to the target to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.530 
have to get right next to the target to
blow<00:03:02.190> them<00:03:02.340> up<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:03.270> just<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
blow them up and it's just the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.600 
blow them up and it's just the
combination<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.470> all<00:03:04.740> of<00:03:04.950> those<00:03:05.040> factors<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
combination of all of those factors that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.460 
combination of all of those factors that
just<00:03:06.030> made<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.360> either<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.870> had<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.200> be<00:03:07.290> very

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
just made it either I had to be very

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.320 
just made it either I had to be very
patient<00:03:07.710> like<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.160> said<00:03:08.370> earlier<00:03:08.700> or<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.240> was

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
patient like I said earlier or it was

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.270 
patient like I said earlier or it was
just<00:03:09.510> required<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.200> ridiculous<00:03:10.860> amount<00:03:11.010> of

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
just required a ridiculous amount of

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.570 
just required a ridiculous amount of
luck<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.720> all<00:03:12.960> honesty<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.980> didn't

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
luck and it in all honesty this didn't

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.640 
luck and it in all honesty this didn't
require<00:03:14.820> any<00:03:15.030> skill<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.840> were<00:03:16.050> some<00:03:16.380> times

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
require any skill there were some times

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.340 
require any skill there were some times
where<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.190> was<00:03:17.700> able<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.270> kind<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.690> bake<00:03:18.930> people

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
where I was able to kind of bake people

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.140 
where I was able to kind of bake people
into<00:03:19.709> some<00:03:19.860> traps<00:03:20.130> which<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.520> fairly<00:03:20.940> amusing

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
into some traps which is fairly amusing

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.390 
into some traps which is fairly amusing
where<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.870> would<00:03:22.320> kind<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.739> take<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> couple<00:03:23.190> of

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
where I would kind of take a couple of

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.740 
where I would kind of take a couple of
shots<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.790> wasn't<00:03:24.060> actually<00:03:24.150> trying<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.540> kill

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
shots I wasn't actually trying to kill

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.180 
shots I wasn't actually trying to kill
them<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.410> was<00:03:25.590> just<00:03:25.620> trying<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.950> get<00:03:26.010> their

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
them but I was just trying to get their

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.520 
them but I was just trying to get their
attention<00:03:26.280> they<00:03:27.120> would<00:03:27.300> round<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:28.020> corner<00:03:28.380> I

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
attention they would round the corner I

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.320 
attention they would round the corner I
would<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.770> had<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.220> mine<00:03:29.459> placed<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:30.239> I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
would have had a mine placed and then I

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.180 
would have had a mine placed and then I
would<00:03:30.450> fire<00:03:30.720> those<00:03:31.440> were<00:03:31.680> always<00:03:31.830> very

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
would fire those were always very

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.060 
would fire those were always very
satisfying<00:03:32.850> but<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.630> extremely<00:03:33.930> hard<00:03:34.920> to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
satisfying but it is extremely hard to

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.920 
satisfying but it is extremely hard to
pull<00:03:35.250> off<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.760> often<00:03:36.090> than<00:03:36.209> not<00:03:36.239> they're
