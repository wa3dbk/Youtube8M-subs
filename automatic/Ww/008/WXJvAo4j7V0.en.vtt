about<00:00:41.309> hunt<00:00:41.730> 200<00:00:42.540> gigabyte<00:00:43.550> my<00:00:44.550> goal<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
about hunt 200 gigabyte my goal here is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.869 
about hunt 200 gigabyte my goal here is
to<00:00:45.239> extend<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:46.110> C<00:00:46.289> partition<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:46.980> 100<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> 150

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
to extend my C partition from 100 to 150

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.970 
to extend my C partition from 100 to 150
so<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> select<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> C<00:00:51.629> partition<00:00:52.110> click<00:00:52.649> move

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so I select the C partition click move

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.840 
so I select the C partition click move
and<00:00:53.160> resize<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.250> window<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.789> find

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and resize in this window you will find

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.560 
and resize in this window you will find
that<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.660> only<00:00:58.640> reduce<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> C<00:01:00.090> partition

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that you can only reduce the C partition

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
that you can only reduce the C partition
you<00:01:00.809> cannot<00:01:01.109> extend<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> reason<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you cannot extend it the reason is you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.260 
you cannot extend it the reason is you
don't<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.989> any<00:01:04.350> free<00:01:05.040> space<00:01:05.189> left<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
don't have any free space left on this

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.039 
don't have any free space left on this
desk<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> first<00:01:08.700> step<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
desk so the first step is you have to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.039 
desk so the first step is you have to
create<00:01:10.290> some<00:01:10.710> free<00:01:10.950> space<00:01:11.479> let's<00:01:12.479> select<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
create some free space let's select the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.940 
create some free space let's select the
partition<00:01:13.380> T<00:01:13.710> move<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> resize<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:16.770> this

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
partition T move and resize in this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
partition T move and resize in this
window<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.670> change<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.689> partition<00:01:19.020> size

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
window you can change the partition size

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.740 
window you can change the partition size
of<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.920> D<00:01:20.100> partition<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.570> either

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
of your D partition you can either

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620 
of your D partition you can either
select<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.920> border<00:01:23.280> drag<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.420> left

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
select your right border drag your left

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
select your right border drag your left
or<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.860> select<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.430> left<00:01:26.790> border<00:01:27.030> drag

or you can select the left border drag
to<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.600> right<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.220> stack<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to the right or you can stack the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.590 
to the right or you can stack the
partition<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.270> move<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> around<00:01:32.210> one<00:01:33.210> common

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
partition and move it around one common

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.649 
partition and move it around one common
mistake<00:01:33.720> people<00:01:34.290> make<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.400> only<00:01:36.270> change

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
mistake people make is they only change

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.679 
mistake people make is they only change
the<00:01:36.780> partition<00:01:37.049> by<00:01:37.350> jackets<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:37.979> border

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
the partition by jackets right border

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.520 
the partition by jackets right border
let's<00:01:39.689> say<00:01:41.299> drag<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> right<00:01:42.600> border<00:01:42.899> stop<00:01:43.350> at

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
let's say drag the right border stop at

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.730 
let's say drag the right border stop at
about<00:01:43.890> 50<00:01:44.340> click<00:01:44.549> right<00:01:44.759> click<00:01:45.030> ok<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
about 50 click right click ok now you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.789 
about 50 click right click ok now you
can<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.759> unallocated<00:01:48.240> space<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.079> created

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
can see the unallocated space is created

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.149 
can see the unallocated space is created
after<00:01:50.009> my<00:01:50.250> D<00:01:50.399> partition<00:01:51.170> if<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> select<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
after my D partition if we I select the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.569 
after my D partition if we I select the
C<00:01:53.310> partition<00:01:53.820> move<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.720> resize<00:01:55.460> nothing<00:01:56.460> has

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
C partition move and resize nothing has

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.020 
C partition move and resize nothing has
been<00:01:56.610> changed<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.450> cannot<00:01:57.810> extend<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:59.030> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
been changed you cannot extend it the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
been changed you cannot extend it the
reason<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.719> unallocated<00:02:01.170> space<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
reason is the unallocated space is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.510 
reason is the unallocated space is
created<00:02:02.369> after<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.360> D<00:02:03.420> partition<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.710> next<00:02:05.340> to
