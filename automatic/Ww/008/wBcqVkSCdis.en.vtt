00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.089
 each photo 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.419
 she has foreground in the background 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.470
 the background 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.800
 usually have to match your background 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.130
 if the goal is to show a scene 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 d extreme sensitivity 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.080
 what do you want to call attention to? 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.480
 in person 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 you can not have a background that draws more attention 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.420
 what 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.300
 The feeling you want to pass. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.660
 if you want to compose a beautiful scenery 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.190
 with the three people 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.050
 and you who is a high contrast I think it is worth paying attention in the background 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.550
 the fund always important it will just marked what you have in the foreground 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.670
 now we have to always pay attention to what I said before 7 please 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.630
 eyes 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.180
 drew attention to what you wanted to aim at the proposal is a rule 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.920
 for that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 I loved it when someone and talked about a photograph I made and the person said 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.090
 denying that the respect context 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.560
 I started using this respect to the context what is the objective 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.000
 What is the purpose of this photo? 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.760
 How important is the background in this picture? 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.950
 I want to put the red bottom because I will have the black and white fought a medium 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.140
 of gray or puts the black background that they touch with high contrast with the call 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.540
 attention is from skin that is white 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.880
 I think it's up to every photographer that's why every year I take photos 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.509
 alone the photographer 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.990
 it is not the guy who pushes the button is the one who drives the person who chooses the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.120
 environment 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.539
 in marriage exert 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:41.980
 two situations 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.920
 the situation where there is something going on the mandates are learned by cutting the cake 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.970
 or are you saying, sir, he's putting on an alliance that there's no way to choose 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.000
 You will not ask the priest to change places because you have a better background. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.619
 Did you find the angle better? 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.369
 and along with the game of light to the environments that you are using you choose the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.260
 that there was on average what is best the moment 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.630
 if you are in a studio 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.210
 doing a photo shoot or you're with the couple that you can 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.369
 choose here it fits here 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.829
 creativity of each 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.949
 always remembering what the purpose of the photo is the foreground 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.159
 is to add the two planes so that it has a nice contrast 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.980
 he acted that it is better I do the best I think that is where it stands out each 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.619
 one 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.680
 taste the harmony of it all 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.600
 This makes what we have or do not succeed in our photography.
