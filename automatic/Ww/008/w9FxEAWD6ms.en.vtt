first time since Genesis era sonic we're
trying<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.509> basically<00:00:30.869> reproduce<00:00:31.470> the

trying to basically reproduce the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.130 
trying to basically reproduce the
Genesis<00:00:32.430> experience<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.420> momentum<00:00:33.870> based

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
exploration and paths that players can

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.540 
exploration and paths that players can
take<00:00:41.370> throughout<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> game<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.800> development

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
take throughout the game the development

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.189 
take throughout the game the development
team<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.760> taking<00:00:44.850> inspiration<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
team is taking inspiration from the

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.569 
team is taking inspiration from the
original<00:00:46.500> green<00:00:46.680> hill<00:00:46.890> zone<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> other

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
original green hill zone and the other

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.040 
original green hill zone and the other
levels<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.149> building<00:00:48.390> levels<00:00:48.660> based<00:00:48.809> on

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
levels that was building levels based on

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
levels that was building levels based on
and<00:00:49.320> they're<00:00:49.980> rebuilding<00:00:50.340> those<00:00:50.609> stages<00:00:50.850> in

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and they're rebuilding those stages in

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
and they're rebuilding those stages in
HD<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.230> basically<00:00:52.500> trying<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> make<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
HD but just basically trying to make it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.819 
HD but just basically trying to make it
feel<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.359> did<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:55.109> are<00:00:55.350> using<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
feel like it did we are using the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.849 
feel like it did we are using the
Hedgehog<00:00:56.519> engine<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.600> basically<00:00:58.230> we're

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
Hedgehog engine and so basically we're

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
Hedgehog engine and so basically we're
using<00:00:59.429> global<00:00:59.699> illumination<00:00:59.969> technology

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
using global illumination technology

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
using global illumination technology
just<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> make<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.410> incredibly<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.429> know

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
just to make this incredibly you know

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
just to make this incredibly you know
vibrant<00:01:02.989> level<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.410> we<00:01:04.500> weren't

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
vibrant level something that we weren't

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
vibrant level something that we weren't
able<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.009> before<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.820> detailed

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
able to do before more detailed

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.179 
able to do before more detailed
animations<00:01:06.710> more<00:01:07.710> details<00:01:08.070> scenery<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
animations more details scenery so you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.980 
animations more details scenery so you
get<00:01:11.549> two<00:01:11.820> parts<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> game<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> get

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
get two parts of the game you get

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
get two parts of the game you get
classic<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.560> modern<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> modern

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
classic and modern so this is the modern

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
classic and modern so this is the modern
we're<00:01:15.119> looking<00:01:15.299> at<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:15.540> correct<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
we're looking at right now correct so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.719 
we're looking at right now correct so
this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.770> basically<00:01:16.890> building<00:01:17.340> upon<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
this is basically building upon the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.670 
this is basically building upon the
successful<00:01:18.299> daytime<00:01:19.229> sonic<00:01:19.560> unleashed

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
successful daytime sonic unleashed

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649 
successful daytime sonic unleashed
formula<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.759> also<00:01:20.880> used<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.299> Sonic

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
formula also that we also used in Sonic

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.539 
formula also that we also used in Sonic
Colors<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.890> basically<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Colors and so basically this is a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.600 
Colors and so basically this is a
mixture<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.509> from<00:01:24.930> behind<00:01:25.170> sonic<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> also<00:01:26.369> at

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
mixture of from behind sonic and also at

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.520 
mixture of from behind sonic and also at
times<00:01:26.820> turning<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> sonic<00:01:27.689> side<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.500> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
times turning to sonic side and kind of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.660 
times turning to sonic side and kind of
2.5<00:01:29.070> 3d<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.329> includes<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> sonic<00:01:31.860> boost<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
2.5 3d this includes a sonic boost the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
2.5 3d this includes a sonic boost the
quickstep<00:01:33.180> homing<00:01:33.840> attack<00:01:33.899> are<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> other

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
quickstep homing attack are the other

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
quickstep homing attack are the other
powers<00:01:35.070> aren't<00:01:35.310> available<00:01:35.520> win<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.180> classic

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
powers aren't available win in classic

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.580 
powers aren't available win in classic
mode<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> very<00:01:37.140> different<00:01:37.439> experience

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
lots of ways you can apply them so when

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950 
lots of ways you can apply them so when
you<00:01:53.369> actually<00:01:53.549> we're<00:01:54.360> designing<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.719> as<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you actually we're designing this as you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
you actually we're designing this as you
build<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.409> whole<00:01:55.560> level<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.159> decide

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
build the whole level and then decide

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.219 
build the whole level and then decide
where<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.479> camera<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.200> on

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
where the camera was going to be on

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
where the camera was going to be on
Sonic<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.770> particular<00:01:59.100> moment<00:01:59.219> or<00:01:59.549> was<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
Sonic that particular moment or was it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.380 
Sonic that particular moment or was it
something

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
something

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.360 
something
you<00:02:00.450> guys<00:02:00.570> cleaned<00:02:00.810> out<00:02:00.930> my<00:02:00.960> pants<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.890> built

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
you guys cleaned out my pants we built

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.270 
you guys cleaned out my pants we built
the<00:02:02.490> level<00:02:02.729> geometry<00:02:03.210> first<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.010> then<00:02:05.010> kind

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the level geometry first and then kind

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
the level geometry first and then kind
of<00:02:05.370> thought<00:02:05.580> about<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:06.180> obviously<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.900> had

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
of thought about well obviously we had

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.940 
of thought about well obviously we had
some<00:02:07.140> idea<00:02:07.409> when<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.620> were<00:02:07.710> building<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
some idea when we were building the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.139 
some idea when we were building the
level<00:02:08.160> geometry<00:02:08.459> maybe<00:02:08.640> where<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.880> camera

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
level geometry maybe where the camera

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.059 
level geometry maybe where the camera
would<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.990> then<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.259> tune<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.560> camera<00:02:10.920> as

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
would be but then we tune the camera as

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.670 
would be but then we tune the camera as
we<00:02:11.970> go<00:02:12.090> making<00:02:12.510> different<00:02:12.630> passes<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
we go making different passes to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.710 
we go making different passes to
basically<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.640> know<00:02:14.730> what<00:02:15.150> works<00:02:15.300> best<00:02:15.540> with

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
basically you know what works best with

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.390 
basically you know what works best with
a<00:02:15.750> player<00:02:15.990> at<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.319> time<00:02:16.530> how<00:02:16.920> did<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.130> pick

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
a player at this time how did you pick

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.670 
a player at this time how did you pick
which<00:02:18.209> parts<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.810> Sonic<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.530> it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
which parts of Sonic that you like it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.920 
which parts of Sonic that you like it
was<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.890> fight<00:02:20.220> amongst<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.700> team<00:02:20.930> basically

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
was a fight amongst the team basically

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.660 
was a fight amongst the team basically
we<00:02:22.050> had<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> big<00:02:22.380> discussion<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:23.340> sought

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
we had a big discussion we sought

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.550 
we had a big discussion we sought
community<00:02:24.090> input<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.020> know<00:02:25.290> what<00:02:25.440> are

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
community input so you know what are

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.750 
community input so you know what are
people's<00:02:25.770> favorite<00:02:26.040> stages<00:02:26.400> at<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.580> time<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
making this game we had got input from

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.570 
making this game we had got input from
people<00:02:31.319> like<00:02:31.530> one<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.860> their<00:02:31.950> favorite<00:02:32.190> stages
