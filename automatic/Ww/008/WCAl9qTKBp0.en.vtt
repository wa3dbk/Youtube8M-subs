overall<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.880> squat<00:02:12.600> is<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> natural<00:02:13.680> movement

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
overall a squat is a natural movement

overall a squat is a natural movement
for<00:02:14.490> us<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:15.720> wide<00:02:16.290> stance<00:02:16.710> squat<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.340> your

for us a wide stance squat with your

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.100 
for us a wide stance squat with your

that's<00:02:20.100> not<00:02:20.340> something<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.330> daily

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
that's not something we do on a daily

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.640 
that's not something we do on a daily
basis<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.760> more<00:02:24.090> technical<00:02:24.630> lift<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.170 
basis so it's a more technical lift it
requires<00:02:26.400> um<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:29.010> requires<00:02:29.760> more
