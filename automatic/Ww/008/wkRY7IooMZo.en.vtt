00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.410
 turn on 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.549
 I sometimes have problems and blow in 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.790
 model how can you go 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.790
 to resolve 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.570
 in the first place, we have to have a haircut 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.280
 his brother in a blaze to say but 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 what we indeed do much against that question 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
 we still got a lot of k and that's because 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.260
 People actually have the habit of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.060
 her then really set up bridges and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.529
 actually put the key in it whole 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.269
 those for step party 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 quite the blessed skirt really just to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.550
 for Brussels right but before and then 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 afterwards nice to put aside we have 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 the woman then needs one dryer and one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.840
 brush and the other small brush so the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.590
 firm larger root that the southern 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.410
 bank a stupid 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.899
 line with the length of your hair 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 blues look so I actually take care of it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 so that I brush my hair with that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.230
 can now fully lock 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.449
 that he actually did not completely complete at first 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 so I can wrap around that root 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.649
 if we had we get a light one 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.860
 bulging at the root 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.990
 but real length temple that quite 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 important went to choice they principle 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.520
 so softly 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.119
 we were actually going to start mercy 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.110
 so i have a water trap here 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.110
 brought along 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.369
 so watch the blaze family a wet one 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.619
 status 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.310
 we take ours and harder over it 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.020
 to go 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.909
 everything just straight forward bus to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.530
 can feel free to use a brush one 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.530
 actually had left to right 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.899
 so consciously and actually an hour direction 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.360
 for that is the traffic jam in the direction 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.600
 where you are harder and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.470
 modern decorated conference 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.470
 another side and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.390
 and constantly let that go back and forth 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.390
 to move 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.759
 let's say until it's the biggest 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.229
 portion of the moisture actually large 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.530
 dot 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.530
 tomorrow 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.600
 voila 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.020
 This is the one that you still slightly that still 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.900
 slightly 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.900
 actually we have to be perfectly moist 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.140
 just with a dryer 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.140
 you go 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.159
 but bring it for him 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.950
 the advantage that he does not brush so 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.080
 small excuses that are smaller than can 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.080
 we start fixing with a brush 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.500
 So if we fix the with the brush and then 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.430
 I again put a lot of effort into it 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.430
 actually pry 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 so long it will take here 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.250
 perfect 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.250
 blessing 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.020
 further
