Cameleon<00:00:10.740> three<00:00:11.580> into<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.120> car<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.889> found<00:00:14.070> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
Cameleon three into the car we found a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.709 
Cameleon three into the car we found a
little<00:00:14.429> bit<00:00:14.519> tricky<00:00:14.849> at<00:00:14.940> first<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.360> after<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
little bit tricky at first but after a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.570 
little bit tricky at first but after a
few<00:00:15.809> experiments<00:00:16.470> where<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.859> know<00:00:16.949> we've

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
few experiments where you know we've

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.830 
few experiments where you know we've
found<00:00:17.789> some<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:18.060> good<00:00:18.210> ways<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.539> doing<00:00:18.690> it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
found some really good ways of doing it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.080 
found some really good ways of doing it
so<00:00:19.109> I'll<00:00:19.320> show<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.500> my<00:00:19.680> tips

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
so I'll show you my tips

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.509 
so I'll show you my tips
first<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:21.869> take<00:00:22.109> off<00:00:22.410> your<00:00:22.939> bassinet<00:00:23.939> or

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
first of all take off your bassinet or

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.609 
first of all take off your bassinet or
seat<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.539> place<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> side<00:00:28.349> now

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
seat and just place it to the side now

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.040 
seat and just place it to the side now
we<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.400> doing<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> slope<00:00:30.269> today<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
we are doing it on a slope today so it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
we are doing it on a slope today so it
could<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.439> easier<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.890> you're<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.189> flat<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.790> if

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
could be easier if you're on flat but if

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.240 
could be easier if you're on flat but if
I'm<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> slope<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.200> find<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.950> put<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I'm on a slope I find that if I put the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
I'm on a slope I find that if I put the
pram<00:00:35.489> uphill<00:00:35.969> from<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.480> helps<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.879> first

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
pram uphill from me that helps so first

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900 
pram uphill from me that helps so first
of<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.950> let<00:00:41.610> down

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
of all what you want to do is let down

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
of all what you want to do is let down
the<00:00:42.360> handle<00:00:43.350> okay<00:00:44.040> don't<00:00:44.969> let<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the handle okay don't let it go to the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.750 
the handle okay don't let it go to the
ground<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.680> use<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:46.980> foot<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> stop<00:00:47.610> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
ground you can use your foot to stop it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.029 
ground you can use your foot to stop it
but<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.030> find<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.690> hold<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.350> using

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
strong arm I can grab the side here and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.710 
strong arm I can grab the side here and
place<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.530> car<00:01:07.830> okay<00:01:08.700> notice<00:01:09.450> I've<00:01:09.689> put

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
place it in the car okay notice I've put

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
place it in the car okay notice I've put
the<00:01:10.049> handle<00:01:10.409> down<00:01:10.619> there's<00:01:10.920> some<00:01:11.040> other

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the handle down there's some other

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
the handle down there's some other
videos<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.790> show<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> whole<00:01:12.390> pram<00:01:12.659> being<00:01:12.960> up

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
videos that show the whole pram being up

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140 
videos that show the whole pram being up
the<00:01:13.350> other<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.890> find<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the other way I find is good because the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 
the other way I find is good because the
basket<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.720> facing<00:01:16.140> upward<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.799> your

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
basket is facing upward so all your

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.609 
basket is facing upward so all your
stuff<00:01:17.369> doesn't<00:01:17.610> fall<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:17.970> everywhere<00:01:18.630> your

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
stuff doesn't fall out everywhere your

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
stuff doesn't fall out everywhere your
handles<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.520> gives<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> nice

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
handles down here it gives it a nice

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.170 
handles down here it gives it a nice
flat<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:23.549> did<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
flat side and we did it with that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
flat side and we did it with that
handbrake<00:01:24.840> off<00:01:25.049> obviously<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.950> your

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
handbrake off obviously you get your

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
handbrake off obviously you get your
baby<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.430> before<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.090> take<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> handbrake

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
baby up before you take the handbrake

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
baby up before you take the handbrake
off<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:29.280> took<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> off<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.420> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
off but we took it off like that if you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.260 
off but we took it off like that if you
really<00:01:31.049> want<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> compact<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> pram<00:01:32.490> down<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
really want to compact the pram down you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090 
really want to compact the pram down you
can<00:01:33.479> pop<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> wheels<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.590> point<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
can pop the wheels out at this point and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.840 
can pop the wheels out at this point and
just<00:01:35.130> pop<00:01:35.880> them<00:01:36.060> somewhere<00:01:36.450> else<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.930> way

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
just pop them somewhere else that way
