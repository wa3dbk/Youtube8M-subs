well awesome misfits here's the thing I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
well awesome misfits here's the thing I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
could tell you my workout routine every

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.190 
could tell you my workout routine every
day<00:00:43.640> but<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.270> problem<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> wouldn't

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
day but the problem is is you wouldn't

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.430 
day but the problem is is you wouldn't
be<00:00:46.260> able<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.320> would

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
be able to do it so I think it would

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.520 
be able to do it so I think it would
just<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:50.100> discourage<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.350> really<00:00:52.350> want

just really discourage you I really want

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
just really discourage you I really want
you<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> believe<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.699> anything

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you to believe that you can do anything

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.810 
you to believe that you can do anything
you<00:00:54.210> want<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.570> life<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.370> tell<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> my

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you want in life but if I tell you my

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
you want in life but if I tell you my
workout<00:00:57.180> routine<00:00:57.350> I'm<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.469> incredible

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
workout routine I'm an incredible

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.549 
workout routine I'm an incredible
athlete<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.750> really

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
athlete and I think it would just really

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
athlete and I think it would just really
make<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> feel<00:01:01.859> bad<00:01:02.309> about<00:01:02.340> yourself<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
make you feel bad about yourself and I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.850 
make you feel bad about yourself and I
don't<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
don't want to do that to you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
don't want to do that to you
so<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.750> should<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.049> move<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so I think we should just move on to the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
so I think we should just move on to the
next<00:01:07.740> question<00:01:09.049> next<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:11.420> at<00:01:12.420> Zack
