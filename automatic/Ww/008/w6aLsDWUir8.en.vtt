00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.010
 the success of our society

 indeed their interest actually according to their tastes 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.430
 naked but I think it's important 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.260
 people need to be known primarily the same 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.790
 it's a very strong trend that is there finalizing people but by the 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.550
 grace of the mind it's true that I wrote to banier

 here we go 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.769
 and it is successful 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.079
 greenpeace is very expensive for them 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.799
 there are large formats without it being in an outing on the artists have 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.179
 not yet 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.289
 for those who are not yet known 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:43.289
 the boost that deserved 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.819
 and that I try to 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.959
 half an inch and expose a maximum how coco year 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.839
 we have a bus line in front of his girls school at the same time I 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.750
 spent up close 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.909
 it no longer makes sense in the computer sector mcafee 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.639
 my action 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.160
 and that I matured for two years 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.369
 two other agents but I absolutely wanted 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.539
 work and drastic rigor 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.699
 by being amateurs 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.389
 but without any information barrier on the subject but I really wanted 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.189
 of 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.209
 to enter this sector for years a knife 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.989
 to all these rising artists 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.249
 have a hard time making more a little gem 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.389
 it's not their job they're artists 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.759
 finally in France 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.330
 you know there is writing the opposite of what is called everyone at the table 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.010
 you have a lot of netizens who are bringing us a term to this huge in 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.679
 made 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.299
 internet for me this is the Senegalese rugby match because gary r 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.890
 the patrol put online by 2010 and highlights these six at me pretty 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:43.690
 online 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.690
 he and I secularism or war 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.669
 ziguélé display 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.669
 and yes that says things in hand 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.449
 this revolt in his country 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.609
 the middle class 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.609
 for you who is actually very little by tri-ace call jal 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:06.689
 and if you 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.859
 I looked through there haye serious threat to this 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.019
 to different 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.049
 with the agios 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.199
 of sophie as well as real 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.079
 am I trying to do it's really a beautiful woman 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.019
 the interim voted an extension 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.650
 elea mariama i have to be attentive even if it arrives in floral force 100 m 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.419
 end of 2008 m 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.479
 that's what I'm trying to do 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.569
 do it 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.289
 it's actually offering a very eclectic choice 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.289
 and a million someone really 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.550
 to have fun he found at home to his shoe 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.290
 I am really happy 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.150
 just a little bit the picture is in balance 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.749
 the services of the city hall and mauritania 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:49.110
 when I start to get interested 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.610
 people want to know the installation 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.759
 we'll get the picture 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.759
 photographers who are capable of young photographers 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.289
 but I'm trying to come 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.699
 put it forward made by all types 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.339
 of brilliant mendoza sanaa 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.499
 so in fact and I made a mix of things that can be 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.699
 at mediapart 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:11.930
 clear house 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.219
 there was neither one nor the other 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.520
 there is nothing in front of justice 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.919
 but not what I know about this very professional lack of me 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:20.200
 all 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.729
 we knew him every month 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.809
 every month a vernissage 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:26.139
 so this is this one 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.689
 the young people you see here 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.689
 hang in there who is a little out of the walls 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.990
 nantes in a hotel actually not afraid 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.990
 so I multiply the exhibitions the artists 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.430
 public 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.289
 as often in business 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.289
 email can sometimes not do the same thing we find out 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.960
 the notion of new apartments 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.999
 at the level of social services online 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.849
 curiously these young elected could be for young people 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.219
 protesters 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.300
 in the process other than the fact 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.510
 his season began to test it went through the clash of 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.129
 tables that is the system 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.349
 but it's the creation 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.429
 at the bottom of the table% to a childbirth elsewhere far beyond 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.249
 public 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:12.330
 there are people in their is often more directed by the artist there is a 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:13.860
 board 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.249
 parents to finance themselves 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:18.619
 this evening 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:22.689
 this time it's like that received 36 people contribute to the creation 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.689
 valuable 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.629
 all artists moves slowly 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.309
 always further 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:34.959
 Well, it's just that huge Quebec evening on April 27 at 8 pm in the city 

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:35.580
 osaka 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.389
 in the inverted Alzheimer's patients had raised a maximum toyota 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.020
 resilience it is still surprising to see otherwise 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.060
 at the time when the ride our other communication mode csc 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.460
 a call to all good things like this 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.889
 others our world 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.889
 it's also that to the full total what I can their years 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.300
 veterans actually fear if we asked for a week 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.660
 the aircraft manufacturer of the air force helicopter the media in 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:00.839
 this year 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.860
 at the same time it is a little more complicated clement 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.249
 are the paintings 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.550
 they are 46% to sacrifice themselves unique and authentic 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.550
 because artists have not been so palpable among many 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:15.129
 I'm about ten dozen applications per week in fact a 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:16.550
 job 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.099
 he is more and more happy 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:19.979
 he has a lot of artists who 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:22.490
 who is looking for ways to 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.159
 two years that we do 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:25.939
 besides a concentration 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:28.399
 that and that depended on the artists 

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:31.119
 as to their intentions 

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:32.289
 and a little earlier 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:33.409
 to dedicate them 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.759
 many heinous acts 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:35.880
 rather dollars 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.249
 in e external in this claim 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.180
 in the landing net 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.749
 I'm really giving it to him 

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:44.659
 so I'm happy to have ignored classic it's me I did not say 

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:45.580
 better 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.449
 if necessary all do then report abuse 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.559
 a box 

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:52.289
 certainly the artists 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.289
 photo roger rosello irritates the Parisian corrèziens 

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:58.339
 alerted the rescue 

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.459
 I thank the elected officials we received the tender for business aircraft
