well<00:01:33.840> some<00:01:34.079> cards<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.799> piss-poor<00:01:35.420> I've

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
well some cards do very piss-poor I've

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
well some cards do very piss-poor I've
I've<00:01:37.320> learned<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> helps<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> turn

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
I've learned that it helps if you turn

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.109 
I've learned that it helps if you turn
off<00:01:38.579> grass<00:01:39.740> anti-aliasing<00:01:40.740> try<00:01:41.070> lowering<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
off grass anti-aliasing try lowering the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.960 
off grass anti-aliasing try lowering the
resolution<00:01:43.310> sometimes<00:01:44.310> resolution<00:01:44.820> doesn't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
resolution sometimes resolution doesn't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.280 
resolution sometimes resolution doesn't
even<00:01:45.180> work<00:01:45.360> which<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.899> odd<00:01:46.049> since

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
even work which is kind of odd since

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.899 
even work which is kind of odd since
resolution<00:01:46.860> usually<00:01:47.189> works<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.490> most<00:01:47.610> games

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
resolution usually works in most games

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
resolution usually works in most games
but<00:01:48.030> yeah<00:01:48.689> wasteland<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.409> other<00:01:49.560> mods<00:01:49.829> like

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
but yeah wasteland and other mods like

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.940 
but yeah wasteland and other mods like
that<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.759> sure<00:01:51.000> someone<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:52.200> dayz<00:01:52.500> for

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that I'm sure someone will do dayz for

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.420 
that I'm sure someone will do dayz for
ARMA<00:01:53.250> 3<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.829> some<00:01:56.130> fan

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
that's that that's really bad like we

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.640 
that's that that's really bad like we
shouldn't<00:02:33.060> mod<00:02:33.420> an<00:02:33.630> alpha<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.290> can<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.530> it

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
shouldn't mod an alpha but we can do it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410 
shouldn't mod an alpha but we can do it
anyway<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.580> know<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:35.880> some<00:02:36.000> people<00:02:36.300> it's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
anyway and you know for some people it's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
anyway and you know for some people it's
really<00:02:36.480> good<00:02:36.840> because<00:02:36.990> wasteland<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.800> awesome

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
really good because wasteland is awesome

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.530 
really good because wasteland is awesome
I've<00:02:38.340> played<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.940> really<00:02:39.180> enjoyed<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
I've played it and I really enjoyed it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.380 
I've played it and I really enjoyed it
but<00:02:39.900> sometimes<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.250> performance<00:02:41.850> was<00:02:41.970> really

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
but sometimes the performance was really

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.199 
but sometimes the performance was really
piss<00:02:42.780> poor<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:44.100> know<00:02:44.190> with<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> mid-range<00:02:44.790> card

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
piss poor you know with a mid-range card

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.270 
piss poor you know with a mid-range card
you<00:02:45.810> should<00:02:46.020> really<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.320> weary<00:02:46.680> about<00:02:46.920> playing

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
you should really be weary about playing

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130 
you should really be weary about playing
wasteland<00:02:47.730> because<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.360> might<00:02:48.540> not<00:02:48.720> get<00:02:48.959> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
wasteland because you might not get the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.420 
wasteland because you might not get the
best<00:02:49.170> performance<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.070> when<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.280> say

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
best performance and when I say

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.860 
best performance and when I say
mid-range<00:02:50.940> I'm<00:02:51.330> talking<00:02:51.600> about<00:02:51.630> something
