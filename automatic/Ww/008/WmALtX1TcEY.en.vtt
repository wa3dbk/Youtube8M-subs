greatest end-all-be-all thing that you

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.190 
greatest end-all-be-all thing that you
can<00:03:41.670> do<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:41.940> but<00:03:42.210> since<00:03:42.450> they<00:03:42.600> did<00:03:42.870> do<00:03:43.080> it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
can do this but since they did do it

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.320 
can do this but since they did do it
with<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.380> PSP<00:03:43.860> go<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.340> they<00:03:44.850> did<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.120> with<00:03:45.240> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
with the PSP go and they did it with the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.210 
with the PSP go and they did it with the
PSP<00:03:45.750> 3000<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.500> got<00:03:46.710> a<00:03:46.740> feeling<00:03:47.070> they're<00:03:47.160> gonna

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
nice I prefer sometimes to play the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.770 
nice I prefer sometimes to play the
games<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:20.100> my<00:04:20.820> pointer<00:04:21.060> station<00:04:21.359> controller

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
games with my pointer station controller

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.150 
games with my pointer station controller
so<00:04:22.049> it's<00:04:22.169> nice<00:04:22.350> when<00:04:22.380> I've<00:04:22.650> got<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.980> in<00:04:23.070> my

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
so it's nice when I've got that in my

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.370 
so it's nice when I've got that in my
hand<00:04:23.400> because<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:24.419> know<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.630> ghost<00:04:24.900> fun<00:04:25.200> and

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
hand because you know the ghost fun and

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.220 
hand because you know the ghost fun and
all<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> PSP<00:04:26.880> 3000<00:04:27.510> but<00:04:27.660> there's<00:04:27.900> no

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
all so is the PSP 3000 but there's no

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.840 
all so is the PSP 3000 but there's no
doubt<00:04:28.530> playing<00:04:28.950> with<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.190> PlayStation<00:04:29.460> 3

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
doubt playing with the PlayStation 3

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.950 
doubt playing with the PlayStation 3
controller<00:04:30.240> trumps<00:04:30.720> all<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:32.720> so<00:04:33.720> then

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
controller trumps all of that so then

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.560 
controller trumps all of that so then
the<00:04:34.590> last<00:04:34.800> thing<00:04:35.040> you<00:04:35.130> can<00:04:35.160> do<00:04:35.430> obviously<00:04:35.610> is

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
the last thing you can do obviously is

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.450 
the last thing you can do obviously is
you<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:36.960> go<00:04:37.110> ahead<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.530> drive<00:04:37.800> around<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.340> the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
you can go ahead and drive around to the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.420 
you can go ahead and drive around to the
internet<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.510> can<00:04:39.720> go<00:04:40.010> check<00:04:41.010> all<00:04:41.190> your

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
network stuff and you can obviously head

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.250 
network stuff and you can obviously head

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
you can do it with this external video

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.630 
you can do it with this external video
source<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.200> like<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.740> said<00:04:57.800> I'll<00:04:58.160> come<00:04:58.370> back<00:04:58.490> and

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
source so like I said I'll come back and

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.070 
source so like I said I'll come back and
show<00:04:58.700> you<00:04:58.850> guys<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:59.060> video<00:04:59.270> so<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.660> can<00:04:59.780> see<00:04:59.960> how

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
show you guys a video so you can see how

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.780 
show you guys a video so you can see how
it<00:05:00.200> looks<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:01.130> is<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.340> video<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.610> is

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
it looks this is a video that is

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.570 
it looks this is a video that is
compressed<00:05:02.300> for<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.660> PSP<00:05:02.960> so<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.040> is<00:05:04.130> 480<00:05:04.490> by

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
compressed for the PSP so it is 480 by

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.580 
compressed for the PSP so it is 480 by
272<00:05:05.240> so<00:05:05.510> it's<00:05:05.630> definitely<00:05:06.050> getting<00:05:06.170> stretched

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
272 so it's definitely getting stretched

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.290 
272 so it's definitely getting stretched
out<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:07.460> fit<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.730> monitor<00:05:08.030> but<00:05:08.180> it's

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
out to fit the monitor but it's

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.360 
out to fit the monitor but it's
definitely<00:05:08.720> watchable<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.410> would<00:05:09.980> definitely
