00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.560
 well all the boys are medinas 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.119
 welcome back my channel with a 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.500
 new video today I have just returned 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.570
 with a new nuclear my very opinion 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.349
 very nice that it is just a nuclear 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.939
 there is no d 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.470
 I don't say very very nice because it is 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.939
 carried out also in the circumstance 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.650
 quite strange however a nice look 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.150
 leur to see but above all it was 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.680
 nice to play then what 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 fixed it is a nuclear up 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.400
 deathmatch this time was not alone 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.260
 thought in a group because I explain a 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.110
 the dynamics of this nucleus then 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.079
 we were trying a record 75 0 1 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.949
 bed in the south east but unfortunately not 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.580
 we succeeded 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.320
 precisely I died like 17 1 is 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.879
 arrived 17 told my companions that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.769
 they were in a group of six with me well ha 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.439
 started playing with their weapons 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.000
 they very kindly did it then 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.470
 after a while I immediately found myself in 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.879
 series to them said the gas race tender 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.430
 treads that I do nuclear is 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.009
 leave me enemies don't kill the only one 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.020
 neo of this match from that mongoloid 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.790
 if it can be said that it ran for the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.250
 point map firing in the air does not 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.840
 I know why precisely if I have to envelopes 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.939
 rare gameplay for sure not boosters 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.670
 on nuclear so bussereau something of a 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.999
 slightly more striking I do not know that clear 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.070
 such an individual precisely because I do not see 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.509
 the sense of making busellato gameplay 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.280
 of the genus, however, precisely 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.140
 I hope that as background gameplay 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.249
 like it can precisely 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.749
 I guess I'm wrong because it's not 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:37.609
 so a background member brings you 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.560
 this gameplay to tell you that I do 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.630
 I'm going through right now and I'm getting sea 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.640
 just finding good with mine 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.460
 family I'm having fun and I hope that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.960
 you too are enjoying yourself 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.819
 my videos that I have planned for you 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.139
 I'm loading anyway as you will see 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.090
 this core is also beautiful because it has 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:55.189
 carried out very quickly on the two 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.569
 three and a half minutes is done with a 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.159
 sv file with or sv dilemma is a dilemma 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.770
 vital guys I tell you I never have 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.840
 understood if sv sv maybe write apple 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.789
 with a comment precisely with a viewfinder 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.860
 reflex and adjustable football weapon that is 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.560
 really devastating in every respect 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.959
 vista so I recommend using it yes 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.069
 use it the camouflage was the classic 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.860
 beautiful week nyse 115 or arsenal e 115 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.530
 from verona mimetica very beautiful that is 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.840
 always just very fun to play 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.650
 with this we say with a little more 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.019
 to the leopards that you can't 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.489
 you can't really hear it anyway 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.569
 video is already adding the term 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.489
 I hope you like them sometimes 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.590
 above all by success via these types 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.390
 of videos rather short fast concise 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 that don't take you too long but 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.689
 which above all do not take away either 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.489
 too much time for me to do it because 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.989
 precisely having to leave and will have to 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.700
 prepare all the videos in three days 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.620
 quite complicated so I do 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.700
 these short videos and I hope precisely that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.230
 be to your liking 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.640
