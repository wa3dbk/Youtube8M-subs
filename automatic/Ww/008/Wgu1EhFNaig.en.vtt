this<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.470> giving<00:03:23.770> me<00:03:23.800> just<00:03:24.459> terrific<00:03:24.820> contrast

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660

placed so I'm working them through and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.670 
placed so I'm working them through and
creating<00:03:31.570> another<00:03:31.750> line<00:03:32.050> with<00:03:32.290> my<00:03:32.470> mini

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
creating another line with my mini

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.040

I<00:04:00.370> know<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.700> say<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.120> about<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.360> lot<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.570> the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
I know I say that about a lot of the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.360 
I know I say that about a lot of the
things<00:04:01.930> we<00:04:02.050> work<00:04:02.230> with<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.130> Heather

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
things we work with this is Heather

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.699 
things we work with this is Heather
isn't<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.060> striking<00:04:04.390> look<00:04:05.170> at<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.530> it's

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
isn't it striking look at it it's

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.229 
isn't it striking look at it it's
beautiful<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.550> look<00:04:06.670> at<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.880> coverage

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
beautiful and look at the coverage

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.060 
beautiful and look at the coverage
normally<00:04:08.080> we<00:04:08.200> think<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.590> Heather<00:04:08.830> as

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
normally we think of Heather as

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.190 
normally we think of Heather as
something<00:04:09.790> that's<00:04:09.940> used<00:04:10.239> for<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.600> filler<00:04:10.930> and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
something that's used for a filler and

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.960 
something that's used for a filler and
we<00:04:11.680> are<00:04:11.830> going<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.130> make<00:04:12.310> use<00:04:12.489> of<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.820> as<00:04:12.940> a

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
we are going to make use of it as a

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.250 
we are going to make use of it as a
filler<00:04:13.330> here<00:04:13.660> as<00:04:13.780> well

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
filler here as well

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.750 
filler here as well
but<00:04:14.560> we're<00:04:14.709> also<00:04:14.860> going<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.160> make<00:04:15.370> use<00:04:15.550> of<00:04:15.580> the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
but we're also going to make use of the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.670 
but we're also going to make use of the
fact<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.090> this<00:04:16.239> particular<00:04:16.480> Heather<00:04:17.109> has

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
fact that this particular Heather has

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.860 
fact that this particular Heather has
points<00:04:18.250> on<00:04:18.430> it<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.760> because<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:19.330> has<00:04:19.480> points

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
points on it and because it has points

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.960 
points on it and because it has points
on<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.230> we<00:04:20.350> can<00:04:20.560> delineate<00:04:20.799> line<00:04:21.340> with<00:04:21.640> it<00:04:21.789> and

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
on it we can delineate line with it and

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.880 
on it we can delineate line with it and
so<00:04:22.510> I'm<00:04:22.720> going<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:22.990> take<00:04:23.169> some<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.470> my<00:04:23.680> Heather

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
so I'm going to take some of my Heather

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.560 
so I'm going to take some of my Heather
and<00:04:24.789> I'm<00:04:24.910> going<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.150> work<00:04:25.300> some<00:04:25.539> pieces<00:04:25.810> in

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
and I'm going to work some pieces in

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.850 
and I'm going to work some pieces in
but<00:04:26.660> I'm<00:04:26.750> not<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:27.110> going<00:04:27.230> to<00:04:27.320> use<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.650> to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
but I'm not just going to use it to

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.890 
but I'm not just going to use it to
create<00:04:28.190> filler<00:04:28.700> I'm<00:04:28.970> going<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.480> take<00:04:29.660> some<00:04:29.870> of

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
create filler I'm going to take some of

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.840 
create filler I'm going to take some of
the<00:04:30.050> Heather<00:04:30.260> make<00:04:30.860> use<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.550> linear

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
the Heather make use of the linear

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.390 
the Heather make use of the linear
aspects<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.660> it<00:04:32.780> as<00:04:32.900> well<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:33.800> create<00:04:34.100> another

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
aspects of it as well and create another

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.910 
aspects of it as well and create another
line<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:35.090> here<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:36.080> notice<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.410> have<00:04:36.530> something

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
line in here so notice I have something

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.800 
line in here so notice I have something
going<00:04:37.040> here<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.670> something<00:04:38.030> going<00:04:38.210> over<00:04:38.540> here

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
going here and something going over here

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.140 
going here and something going over here
let's<00:04:39.260> take<00:04:39.500> another<00:04:39.620> piece<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.280> our<00:04:40.850> Heather

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
let's take another piece of our Heather

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.140 
let's take another piece of our Heather
and<00:04:41.420> work<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.140> over<00:04:42.350> onto<00:04:42.980> this<00:04:43.370> side<00:04:43.640> so

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
and work it over onto this side so

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.460 
and work it over onto this side so
notice<00:04:44.450> we've<00:04:44.570> got<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.750> little<00:04:44.960> triangular

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
notice we've got a little triangular

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.860 
notice we've got a little triangular
thing<00:04:45.800> working<00:04:46.100> with<00:04:46.400> our<00:04:46.520> Heather<00:04:46.760> now<00:04:47.510> I<00:04:47.540> can

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870

thing working with our Heather now I can
take<00:04:48.080> advantage<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.160> fact<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:49.520> Heather

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
take advantage of the fact that Heather

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.350 
take advantage of the fact that Heather
has<00:04:50.750> this<00:04:51.440> kind<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.950> filler<00:04:52.310> effect<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.000> take

and I'm taking some of my Heather that I
have<00:05:22.760> here<00:05:23.030> I'm<00:05:23.240> breaking<00:05:23.660> it<00:05:23.780> down<00:05:23.990> into

smaller little pieces and then working

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.280

it into my design so that I'm covering

it into my design so that I'm covering
my<00:05:30.500> mechanics<00:05:31.130> quite<00:05:31.730> nicely<00:05:32.030> with<00:05:32.450> my

my mechanics quite nicely with my

my mechanics quite nicely with my
