00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
lot of fun at the same time so it may

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
lot of fun at the same time so it may
have<00:01:11.070> legs<00:01:11.280> I'm<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.610> sure<00:01:11.850> about<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.240> taking

have legs I'm not sure about it taking
off<00:01:12.659> big<00:01:13.290> time<00:01:13.500> though<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.340> could<00:01:14.490> be

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
off big time though I think it could be

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.660 
off big time though I think it could be
good<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> one-off<00:01:15.509> maybe<00:01:16.080> every<00:01:16.350> year

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
good as a one-off maybe every year

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
good as a one-off maybe every year

I think he's involved Bob Fulton Bob

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.770 
I think he's involved Bob Fulton Bob
Dwyer<00:01:31.110> few<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.130> those<00:01:32.250> guys<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> personally

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.770 
Dwyer few of those guys but I personally
think<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.799> become<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> yeah<00:01:36.390> one-off

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.749 
think it can become a yeah one-off
fixture<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.470> probably<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.189> best<00:01:38.400> sort

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
fixture would be probably the best sort

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.120 
fixture would be probably the best sort
of<00:01:38.850> option<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.930> don't<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.500> you'd<00:01:40.860> see

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
of option there I don't think you'd see

on the last day out of League which it
does<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.120> get<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.330> ball<00:03:09.480> thrown

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
does because you get the ball thrown

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.530 
does because you get the ball thrown
ball<00:03:09.870> around<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.620> as<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.040> said<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.459> reckon<00:03:12.269> I

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
ball around so as I said I reckon I

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.420 
ball around so as I said I reckon I
reckon<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.260> an<00:03:13.380> interesting<00:03:13.620> concept<00:03:14.190> it

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
reckon it's an interesting concept it

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.300 
reckon it's an interesting concept it
should<00:03:14.700> be<00:03:14.910> explored<00:03:15.810> further<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.920> think

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
should be explored further and I think

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.310 
should be explored further and I think
well<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:17.880> could<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.209> seeing<00:03:18.510> how<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.019> would<00:03:19.200> be

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
well we could be seeing how it would be

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.250 
well we could be seeing how it would be
this<00:03:19.470> way<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.829> kangaroos<00:03:20.540> versus<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:22.110> All

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
this way the kangaroos versus the All

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.039 
this way the kangaroos versus the All
Blacks<00:03:22.430> yeah<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.489> would<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.850> they<00:03:24.060> leave

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
Blacks yeah it would be that they leave

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.920 
Blacks yeah it would be that they leave
you<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.410> about<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.739> one
