hello<00:00:04.759> we're<00:00:05.270> here<00:00:05.420> to<00:00:05.569> demonstrate

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:05.800 
hello we're here to demonstrate

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.629 
hello we're here to demonstrate
installing<00:00:06.800> Truphone<00:00:07.250> on<00:00:07.430> the<00:00:07.520> new<00:00:07.700> Nokia<00:00:08.530> n95

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:09.639 
installing Truphone on the new Nokia n95

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.100 
installing Truphone on the new Nokia n95
it's<00:00:10.639> very<00:00:10.820> straightforward<00:00:11.299> process<00:00:11.389> and

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
it's very straightforward process and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.470 
it's very straightforward process and
it's<00:00:12.680> the<00:00:12.740> same<00:00:13.039> as<00:00:13.280> installing<00:00:13.789> Truphone<00:00:14.299> on

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
it's the same as installing Truphone on

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.230 
it's the same as installing Truphone on
the<00:00:14.660> dock<00:00:15.379> you<00:00:15.410> 60<00:00:16.129> B<00:00:16.850> 61<00:00:17.480> East<00:00:18.470> 61<00:00:18.890> I<00:00:18.920> he's<00:00:19.580> 65

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
the dock you 60 B 61 East 61 I he's 65

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.260 
the dock you 60 B 61 East 61 I he's 65
he's<00:00:21.170> 70<00:00:21.710> 90<00:00:22.330> not<00:00:23.330> yet<00:00:23.480> nati<00:00:24.670> for<00:00:25.670> example<00:00:26.060> and

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
he's 70 90 not yet nati for example and

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.480 
he's 70 90 not yet nati for example and
it's<00:00:27.050> very<00:00:27.620> straightforward<00:00:27.800> it's

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
it's very straightforward it's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.450 
it's very straightforward it's
essentially<00:00:29.060> a<00:00:29.300> process<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:30.350> lots<00:00:30.770> of<00:00:30.860> accepts

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
essentially a process of lots of accepts

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.209 
essentially a process of lots of accepts
and<00:00:31.670> continues<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:32.509> next<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:33.230> on<00:00:33.260> there's

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
and continues and next and so on there's

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.350 
and continues and next and so on there's
only<00:00:34.340> one<00:00:34.579> moment<00:00:34.910> where<00:00:35.000> I<00:00:35.030> think<00:00:35.120> you'll

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
only one moment where I think you'll

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.930 
only one moment where I think you'll
really<00:00:35.539> I<00:00:35.960> want<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:36.710> point<00:00:36.920> out<00:00:37.220> how<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.820> be

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
really I want to point out how to be

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.680 
really I want to point out how to be
careful<00:00:38.329> but<00:00:39.200> essentially<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.640> do<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.000> and

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
careful but essentially this a do it and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.870 
careful but essentially this a do it and
it<00:00:41.899> starts<00:00:42.260> for<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.470> simple<00:00:42.800> text<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.489> the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
it starts for the simple text of the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.200 
it starts for the simple text of the
word<00:00:44.030> true<00:00:44.630> to<00:00:45.320> our<00:00:45.410> special<00:00:45.920> number<00:00:46.760> which<00:00:47.000> is

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
word true to our special number which is

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.280 
word true to our special number which is
plus<00:00:47.570> four<00:00:48.530> four<00:00:49.540> seven<00:00:50.540> six<00:00:51.380> two<00:00:52.160> four<00:00:53.290> triple

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
plus four four seven six two four triple

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.780 
plus four four seven six two four triple
zero

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:04.240 
zero
triple<00:00:55.790> zero<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:58.210> that's<00:00:59.210> T<00:01:00.110> are<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:03.559> text

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
triple zero and that's T are you so text

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.639 
triple zero and that's T are you so text
true<00:01:04.399> two<00:01:04.699> plus<00:01:05.059> four<00:01:05.210> four<00:01:05.479> seven<00:01:06.259> six<00:01:06.409> two

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649

four zero zero zero zero zero zero and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.169 
four zero zero zero zero zero zero and
you<00:01:11.030> send<00:01:11.359> that<00:01:11.479> message<00:01:11.689> as<00:01:12.319> normal<00:01:13.249> and<00:01:13.520> the

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
you send that message as normal and the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.359 
you send that message as normal and the
idea<00:01:14.479> is<00:01:14.689> that<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.530> goes<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.799> our<00:01:15.979> servers

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
idea is that that goes to our servers

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.910 
idea is that that goes to our servers
and<00:01:16.520> bounces<00:01:16.909> back<00:01:16.939> with<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.630> unique<00:01:18.020> link<00:01:18.380> that

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
and bounces back with a unique link that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.830 
and bounces back with a unique link that
you<00:01:19.069> can<00:01:19.249> open<00:01:19.429> to<00:01:19.939> install<00:01:20.270> your<00:01:20.509> copy<00:01:20.719> of

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
you can open to install your copy of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.199 
you can open to install your copy of
true<00:01:21.079> phone<00:01:26.109> there's<00:01:27.109> our<00:01:27.319> text<00:01:27.950> message<00:01:28.219> so

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
true phone there's our text message so

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.440 
true phone there's our text message so
let's<00:01:29.420> open<00:01:29.569> that<00:01:29.749> up<00:01:30.279> as<00:01:31.279> you<00:01:31.369> can<00:01:31.459> see<00:01:31.520> here

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
let's open that up as you can see here

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.280 
let's open that up as you can see here
is<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.229> link<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.709> you<00:01:34.369> simply<00:01:34.609> open<00:01:34.999> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.470 

and<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.640> mentioned<00:01:42.030> there's<00:01:42.210> lots<00:01:42.390> of

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
and as I mentioned there's lots of

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.620 
and as I mentioned there's lots of
standard<00:01:43.250> accept<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.520> continues<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:45.480> on
