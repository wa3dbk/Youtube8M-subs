that's for your front finger your front

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.859 
that's for your front finger your front
thing<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.189> just<00:01:57.490> barely<00:01:57.820> catches<00:01:58.420> on<00:01:58.659> the

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
thing you just barely catches on the

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.719 
thing you just barely catches on the
front<00:01:59.079> of<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.259> nose<00:01:59.439> just<00:01:59.950> enough<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.520> get<00:02:00.610> it

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
front of the nose just enough to get it

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.779 
front of the nose just enough to get it
to<00:02:00.759> flip<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.299> it's<00:02:01.659> doing<00:02:01.780> its<00:02:02.020> 360<00:02:02.530> rotation

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
to flip as it's doing its 360 rotation

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.999 
to flip as it's doing its 360 rotation
so<00:02:03.789> again<00:02:04.630> same<00:02:05.049> with<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.350> baryon<00:02:05.649> pamphlet

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
so again same with the baryon pamphlet

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.919 
so again same with the baryon pamphlet
having<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:06.490> wider<00:02:06.759> board<00:02:07.119> really<00:02:07.479> helps

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
having a wider board really helps

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.509 
having a wider board really helps
because<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.380> have<00:02:08.470> more<00:02:08.649> surface<00:02:09.069> area<00:02:09.220> and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
because you have more surface area and

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.160 
because you have more surface area and
more<00:02:09.940> finger<00:02:10.269> positions<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.780> play<00:02:10.959> around

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
more finger positions to play around

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.500 
more finger positions to play around
with<00:02:11.380> catching<00:02:12.069> your<00:02:12.160> 360<00:02:12.519> flip<00:02:12.849> is<00:02:13.000> also<00:02:13.300> very

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
with catching your 360 flip is also very

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.759 
with catching your 360 flip is also very
important<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.170> make<00:02:14.319> sure<00:02:14.349> you're<00:02:14.590> not<00:02:14.709> over

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
important to make sure you're not over

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.490 
important to make sure you're not over
rotating<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.269> pop<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> really<00:02:16.810> high<00:02:16.930> 360

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
rotating so you pop a really high 360

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.620 
rotating so you pop a really high 360
flip<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.980> comes<00:02:18.280> around<00:02:18.640> make<00:02:19.180> sure<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.390> stop

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
flip and comes around make sure you stop

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.690 
flip and comes around make sure you stop
rotating<00:02:20.050> with<00:02:20.470> your<00:02:20.590> two<00:02:20.739> fingers<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.610> bring

rotating with your two fingers and bring
it<00:02:21.849> down<00:02:21.880> before<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.420> flips<00:02:22.690> any<00:02:22.900> more<00:02:23.080> than<00:02:23.260> it

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
it down before it flips any more than it

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.630 
it down before it flips any more than it
should<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.830> also<00:02:24.130> want<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.400> reiterate

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
should I also want to reiterate

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.100 
should I also want to reiterate
something<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.330> said<00:02:25.660> during<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
something that I said during the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.500 
something that I said during the
demonstration<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.370> do<00:02:27.940> not<00:02:28.120> let<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
demonstration and that is do not let the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.300 
demonstration and that is do not let the
board<00:02:28.720> go<00:02:28.900> above<00:02:29.049> your<00:02:29.260> hand<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.680> know<00:02:30.040> it's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
board go above your hand I know it's

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.039 
board go above your hand I know it's
tempting<00:02:30.549> because<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.330> lot<00:02:31.540> easier<00:02:31.780> to

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
tempting because it's a lot easier to

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.080 
tempting because it's a lot easier to
get<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.290> full<00:02:32.500> rotation<00:02:33.010> if<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.819> scoop

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
get the full rotation if you can scoop

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.880 
get the full rotation if you can scoop
the<00:02:34.209> board<00:02:34.420> with<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:34.690> whole<00:02:34.900> hand<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.650> get

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the board with your whole hand and get

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.920 
the board with your whole hand and get
your<00:02:36.010> hand<00:02:36.190> underneath<00:02:36.430> there<00:02:36.760> however<00:02:37.450> it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
your hand underneath there however it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.199 
your hand underneath there however it
looks<00:02:38.140> extremely<00:02:38.500> unrealistic<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.760> you

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
looks extremely unrealistic and you

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.789 
looks extremely unrealistic and you
won't<00:02:40.450> be<00:02:40.660> able<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.870> catch<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.230> train<00:02:41.410> Club<00:02:41.620> at

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
won't be able to catch a train Club at

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.289 
won't be able to catch a train Club at
the<00:02:41.920> peak<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.250> its<00:02:42.430> height<00:02:42.610> because<00:02:42.970> your<00:02:43.090> hand

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
the peak of its height because your hand

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.970 
the peak of its height because your hand
will<00:02:43.450> be<00:02:43.480> underneath<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.930> board<00:02:44.200> rather<00:02:44.769> than

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
will be underneath the board rather than

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.979 
will be underneath the board rather than
above<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.849> make<00:02:46.209> sure<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.390> when<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.750> pop

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
above it so make sure that when you pop

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.990 
above it so make sure that when you pop
it<00:02:47.200> keep<00:02:47.590> your<00:02:47.739> hand<00:02:47.890> above<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.130> board<00:02:48.459> but<00:02:48.970> I

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
it keep your hand above the board but I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.850 
it keep your hand above the board but I
do<00:02:49.180> its<00:02:49.329> rotation<00:02:49.750> catch<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.470> if<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.590> need<00:02:50.829> to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
do its rotation catch it if you need to

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.440 
do its rotation catch it if you need to
and<00:02:51.430> bring<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.790> back<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.120> ground<00:02:52.329> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
and bring it back to the ground and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.150 
and bring it back to the ground and
right<00:02:52.750> away<00:02:52.959> well<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.620> does<00:02:53.829> it<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:53.980> this
