crazy big well these are both excellent
choices<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.950> happens<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.460> my<00:00:11.610> husband

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
choices and it happens that my husband

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.020 
choices and it happens that my husband
has<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.719> survivor<00:00:13.349> core<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:14.070> his<00:00:14.309> phone<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> I

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
has the survivor core on his phone and I

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.180 
has the survivor core on his phone and I
have<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> survivor<00:00:15.630> slim<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.170> my<00:00:16.320> phone<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.160> I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
have the survivor slim on my phone so I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.290 
have the survivor slim on my phone so I
thought<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.580> would<00:00:17.730> give<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.029> little

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
thought I would give you a little

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.590 
thought I would give you a little
comparison<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.650> go<00:00:22.609> okay<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:24.359> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
comparison here we go okay so here is

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.630 
comparison here we go okay so here is
the<00:00:25.109> survivor<00:00:26.000> core<00:00:27.590> it<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the survivor core it is of all the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.900 
the survivor core it is of all the
survivor<00:00:30.740> products<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.040> Griffin<00:00:32.340> sells

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
survivor products that Griffin sells

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.910 
survivor products that Griffin sells
this<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.829> it's<00:00:34.829> rated<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> two<00:00:35.969> meter<00:00:36.540> drop

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
this one it's rated for a two meter drop

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.560 
this one it's rated for a two meter drop
my<00:00:37.920> guess<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> probably<00:00:38.610> provides<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
my guess is it probably provides the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
my guess is it probably provides the
least<00:00:39.750> protection<00:00:40.460> not<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.670> two<00:00:41.850> meters<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
least protection not that two meters is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.560 
least protection not that two meters is
a<00:00:42.420> small<00:00:42.780> amount<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.640> slender<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
a small amount but it's so slender and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.650 
a small amount but it's so slender and
slim<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> pretty<00:00:47.000> of<00:00:48.000> course<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> one

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
slim and pretty of course it was the one

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.290 
slim and pretty of course it was the one
that<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:48.870> husband<00:00:49.200> had<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.739> his<00:00:49.920> phone

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
that my husband had to have on his phone

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
that my husband had to have on his phone
it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.449> really<00:00:51.840> attractive<00:00:51.960> case<00:00:52.620> nice

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it's a really attractive case nice

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
it's a really attractive case nice
rubberized<00:00:53.760> sides<00:00:55.219> just<00:00:56.300> really<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.600> nice

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
rubberized sides just really really nice

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.650 
rubberized sides just really really nice
overall<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> only<00:00:59.039> thing<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.180> counts<00:01:00.570> as

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
overall the only thing that it counts as

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
overall the only thing that it counts as
a<00:01:00.690> negative<00:01:01.109> against<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
a negative against this I think is the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.369 
a negative against this I think is the
fact<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:02.969> tends<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.629> scratch<00:01:03.960> but

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
fact that the back tends to scratch but

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.289 
fact that the back tends to scratch but
this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> something<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.640> only<00:01:05.850> notice

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this is something you only notice

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.940 
this is something you only notice
honestly<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> case<00:01:07.470> off<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
honestly if you have the case off the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
honestly if you have the case off the
phone<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> phone<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.299> long<00:01:09.330> as

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
phone if it's on the phone as long as

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
phone if it's on the phone as long as
you're<00:01:09.720> not<00:01:09.750> peering<00:01:10.320> super<00:01:10.650> super<00:01:10.950> close<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
you're not peering super super close you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.649 
you're not peering super super close you
won't<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.420> him<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> clear<00:01:13.290> back<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
won't see him with the clear back and

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
won't see him with the clear back and
there's<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.890> said<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.460> really

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
there's that's as I said this is really

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
there's that's as I said this is really
the<00:01:17.850> only<00:01:18.090> negative<00:01:18.630> thing<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.200> say

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the only negative thing that you can say

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.760 
the only negative thing that you can say
about<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.479> survivor<00:01:21.840> slim<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.560> my

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
about this so now survivor slim on my

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.749 
about this so now survivor slim on my
phone<00:01:23.070> survivor<00:01:23.790> slim<00:01:24.439> he's<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.250> slim

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
phone survivor slim he's not that slim

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.440 
phone survivor slim he's not that slim
as<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> tell<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.950> definitely<00:01:29.520> thicker

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
as you can tell it's definitely thicker

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.760 
as you can tell it's definitely thicker
than<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> survivor<00:01:31.439> core<00:01:32.689> however<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
than the survivor core however it you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.200 
than the survivor core however it you
definitely<00:01:35.250> gain<00:01:35.460> something<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
definitely gain something with that

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.249 
definitely gain something with that
thickness<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.680> both<00:01:37.920> drop<00:01:38.579> rated<00:01:39.259> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
thickness they are both drop rated to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.350 
thickness they are both drop rated to
meet<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:40.650> exceed<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.250> same<00:01:41.460> milspec<00:01:41.939> rating

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
meet or exceed the same milspec rating

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.580 
meet or exceed the same milspec rating
my<00:01:43.320> guess<00:01:43.860> would<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.119> survivor<00:01:45.930> slim

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
my guess would be that the survivor slim

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.300 
my guess would be that the survivor slim
falls<00:01:47.189> into<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.090> exceed<00:01:48.979> side<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
falls into the exceed side of the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.240 
falls into the exceed side of the
equation<00:01:51.020> versus<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> survivor<00:01:52.649> core<00:01:53.040> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
equation versus the survivor core is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.420 
equation versus the survivor core is
probably<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.850> meeting<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.720> six<00:01:55.110> foot<00:01:55.430> six

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
probably just meeting that six foot six

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.230 
probably just meeting that six foot six
inch<00:01:56.729> drop<00:01:57.890> for<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.040> thing<00:01:59.310> you've<00:01:59.579> got<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> lot

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
inch drop for one thing you've got a lot

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179 
inch drop for one thing you've got a lot
more<00:02:00.270> protection<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.140> goes<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.680> onto<00:02:02.100> the

more protection that goes over onto the

a<00:02:13.300> screen<00:02:13.900> protector<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.650> do<00:02:15.550> not<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:16.000> that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
screen protector on my phone because I

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.470 
screen protector on my phone because I
have<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> tempered<00:02:18.670> glass<00:02:18.820> one<00:02:19.240> that's

have a tempered glass one that's

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.260 
have a tempered glass one that's
permanently<00:02:19.900> installed<00:02:20.320> or<00:02:20.590> well<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.520> guess<00:02:22.060> I

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
permanently installed or well I guess I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.700 
permanently installed or well I guess I
can't<00:02:22.540> take<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.780> off<00:02:22.870> for<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.110> review<00:02:23.410> or<00:02:23.590> it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
can't take it off for the review or it

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.380 
can't take it off for the review or it
will<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:23.920> trashed<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.550> guess<00:02:24.880> permanently

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
will be trashed so I guess permanently

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.520 
will be trashed so I guess permanently
in<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.660> sense<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> meaning<00:02:27.960> but<00:02:28.960> so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
in that sense of the meaning but so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.990 
in that sense of the meaning but so
anyway<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> does<00:02:30.190> come<00:02:30.370> with<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.550> little<00:02:30.700> bit

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
anyway it does come with a little bit

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.790 
anyway it does come with a little bit
more<00:02:31.600> front<00:02:32.110> protection<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.840> survivor<00:02:34.840> core

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
a very grippy silicon material and it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.170 
a very grippy silicon material and it
makes<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.050> this<00:02:59.470> phone<00:03:00.220> case<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:00.790> hard

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
makes this this phone case really hard

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.900 
makes this this phone case really hard
to<00:03:01.600> drop<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.110> if<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.350> does<00:03:02.530> drop<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.640> feels

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
to drop and if it does drop it feels

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.180 
to drop and if it does drop it feels
like<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.210> would<00:03:04.300> bounce<00:03:04.480> I'm<00:03:05.380> not<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.710> dropper

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
like it would bounce I'm not a dropper

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.010 
like it would bounce I'm not a dropper
haven't<00:03:06.640> dropped<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:07.060> don't<00:03:07.420> intend<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.810> drop

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
haven't dropped it don't intend to drop

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.290 
haven't dropped it don't intend to drop
it<00:03:08.200> but<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.820> feel<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> lot<00:03:10.240> more

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
it but I would feel a lot more

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.930 
it but I would feel a lot more
comfortable<00:03:10.600> using<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:12.310> dropping<00:03:12.640> it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
comfortable using this and dropping it

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.430 
comfortable using this and dropping it
then<00:03:14.490> certainly<00:03:15.490> dropping<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.440> survivor

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
then certainly dropping the survivor

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.100 
then certainly dropping the survivor
core<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.240> it<00:03:19.330> all<00:03:19.450> depends<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.840> what<00:03:19.960> you're

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
core so it all depends on what you're

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.790 
core so it all depends on what you're
looking<00:03:20.200> for<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.860> phone<00:03:21.400> case<00:03:22.770> they're<00:03:23.770> both

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
looking for in a phone case they're both

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.820 
looking for in a phone case they're both
really<00:03:24.340> good<00:03:24.490> choices<00:03:25.080> it's<00:03:26.080> my<00:03:26.320> opinion<00:03:26.590> that

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
really good choices it's my opinion that

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.100 
really good choices it's my opinion that
the<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.730> more<00:03:28.420> protective<00:03:28.900> than<00:03:28.930> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
the one is more protective than the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.050 
the one is more protective than the
other<00:03:29.290> griffin<00:03:30.220> does<00:03:30.370> not<00:03:30.520> make<00:03:30.670> any<00:03:30.880> mention

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
other griffin does not make any mention

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.690 
other griffin does not make any mention
of<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:32.050> mean<00:03:32.740> just<00:03:32.920> looking<00:03:33.310> at<00:03:33.430> them<00:03:33.550> side

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
of this I mean just looking at them side

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.790 
of this I mean just looking at them side
by<00:03:33.730> side<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.150> figure<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.230> guy's<00:03:35.410> gotta

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
by side you figure the this guy's gotta

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.470 
by side you figure the this guy's gotta
be<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.760> bit<00:03:37.000> more<00:03:37.180> protective<00:03:37.690> than<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.950> one

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
be a bit more protective than this one

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.810 
be a bit more protective than this one
but<00:03:40.480> either<00:03:41.140> one<00:03:41.410> is<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> good<00:03:41.830> choice

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
but either one is a good choice

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.110 
but either one is a good choice
and<00:03:43.320> definitely<00:03:44.370> consider<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.700> survivor
