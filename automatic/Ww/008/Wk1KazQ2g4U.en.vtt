00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.119
 on the seventh day we enjoyed the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 encounter between neighbors of 0 and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 they propel from that bet the big 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.980
 rivals that were played in this match 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.980
 the leadership of group 1 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.570
 the match started with some 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.070
 skirmishes in both goals but 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.979
 both teams were just 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.479
 feeling the rhythm of the game would go on 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.159
 continuous increase throughout the 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.399
 encounter until you reach an end 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.399
 apotheosis 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.480
 although there were some clear opportunities 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.090
 it would not be until well into the first 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.890
 time that the first goal would come 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.550
 shot from the left flank of 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.550
 Ricardo Tails 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.119
 with some sporadic attacks that do not 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.039
 materialized in goals we would reach 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.810
 a second time that would offer us a 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.810
 totally different rhythm 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.310
 the isotopes had been thoroughly reviewed 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.940
 his tactics at rest and they came out 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.010
 ready to everything in this second time 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.120
 Manuel Pazos would be integrated in 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.640
 materialize the first one for your team 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.650
 just a minute later the artillery 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.030
 of isotopes would get a second goal for 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.030
 mediation of pablo gonzález 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.450
 0's neighbors remained at the foot of the canyon in 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.950
 This meeting in which more than one 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.950
 player got injured 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.939
 for the third time isotopes drums jorge 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.189
 marqueta this time with a goal by ignacio 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.189
 vergara after passing the test to sancho 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.850
 the fourth consecutive isotope goal 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.920
 would arrive from pablo gonzález 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.750
 the neighbors response was not made 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.490
 wait and on the next play to 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.490
 héctor gonzález would mark the second 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.409
 neighbors of zero had awakened from 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.730
 new and not only would it make it easy to isotopes 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.569
 although in this exciting phase of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.219
 match 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.600
 moments later these would mark 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:44.120
 thanks again to pablo gonzález 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.700
 0 neighbors would soon counterattack to 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.700
 score the third goal of rubén 10 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.510
 Isotopes took the lead and the pace 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.010
 and the hardness of the party was increasing 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.010
 squeezing every play 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.129
 the fourth goal of neighbors would mark it 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.129
 Victor Diaz 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.700
 a little later the own víctor 10 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.230
 I would see the red with what neighbors 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.470
 would be temporarily in inferiority 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.470
 numerical 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.470
 isotopes attacked profusely the goal 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.630
 contrary but it was jose mary palace 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.630
 who would score for the tie at five 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.700
 with very little time for the end both 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.720
 equipment was used thoroughly 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.490
 0 neighbors marked again 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.980
 coming forward through ruben mediation 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.709
 but soon we saw the answer 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.540
 of pitucos that again equaled the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.540
 scoreboard thanks to marcos rodrigo 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.590
 in the last seconds however 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.630
 neighbors again I would go around the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.960
 match with a spectacular goal by Pedro 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.960
 bouquet 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.629
 with the arrival of the end of this 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.480
 exciting match we tackled one of 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.200
 Their protagonists 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.200
 good 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.430
 currently the first of the group 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.750
 with all matches won 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.700
 this has been a pretty game 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.290
 important to us because they were two 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.790
 seconds we needed to win this 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.590
 match 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.070
 if it does not complicate us much the thing has 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.910
 been a vibrant match and it has 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.910
 cost life 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.520
 well not sometimes head and there are 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.120
 colleagues that I really like to win 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.120
 much 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:33.360
 I do not know how a game like that to see the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.360
 second base
