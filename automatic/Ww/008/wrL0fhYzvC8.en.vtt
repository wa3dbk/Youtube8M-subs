00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:03.450
 so this is the first video 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.250
 afp - a video that's a real one that has not yet arrived it's become 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.219
 difficult 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.469
 so for this difficult start of the season in Ivory Coast 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.529
 the co2 of a vehicle 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.099
 preferably 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.579
 too sad and it starts again 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.589
 so that's this southern point and change cell 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 while sitting in the red go ahead 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.189

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.390
 however, we notice 17th 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.970
 stronger for 6 7% against 6 7% in September of the site 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 that's what awaits 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 then at the scene of the disaster 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.140
 we are reassured 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.440

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.950
 brunner 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.470
