00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
really really easy so let's have a look

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.429 
really really easy so let's have a look
about<00:01:19.420> how<00:01:20.069> to<00:01:21.069> do<00:01:21.249> it<00:01:21.399> for<00:01:22.119> good<00:01:22.299> like<00:01:22.689> with

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439

because where you put your tongue on it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.559 
because where you put your tongue on it
is<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:27.429> biggest<00:01:27.759> where<00:01:28.119> you'll<00:01:28.270> have<00:01:28.450> the

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
is the biggest where you'll have the

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.359 
is the biggest where you'll have the
biggest<00:01:28.840> amount<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.170> trouble<00:01:29.499> and<00:01:29.649> it's<00:01:30.189> just

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
biggest amount of trouble and it's just

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.800 
biggest amount of trouble and it's just
a<00:01:30.429> matter<00:01:30.579> of<00:01:30.670> moving<00:01:30.880> your<00:01:31.149> tongue<00:01:31.329> backwards

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
a matter of moving your tongue backwards

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.389 
a matter of moving your tongue backwards
and<00:01:31.960> forwards<00:01:32.350> until<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.799> can<00:01:32.920> get<00:01:33.039> a<00:01:33.100> sound

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
and forwards until you can get a sound

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.139 
and forwards until you can get a sound
so<00:01:34.319> now<00:01:35.319> you<00:01:35.409> get<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.679> rather<00:01:36.159> unpleasant<00:01:36.520> view
