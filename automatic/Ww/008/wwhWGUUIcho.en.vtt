00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.129
 good guys welcome was video 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.129
 5 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.340
 we are with this car that seems to seem 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.860
 a car of the future is a kind of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.350
 aerial platform in which can be a 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.820
 collision between subscribers we have to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.039
 go all with this car and we have to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.270
 complete the circuit obviously because 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.680
 if it does not make any sense at all 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.750
 less more than through cars and not 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.060
 would have collided with the valley are 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 enough control points so the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
 characteristic of being somewhat long so 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.010
 long as my toe so 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.450
 we talk about how many we go fourth are 21 the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.620
 shell on the wall I think this that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.719
 this slowed down a bit more but it seems that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.149
 is not having much chaotic the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.149
 channel and reverse how are I doing this 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.350
 for a moment I was in a space 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.149
 unqualified temporary and a hole 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.800
 black as you were to call it worth files 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.850
 we apply second and I want to win 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.370
 I want to win, I mean it right now 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.930
 out of nonsense I want to win ex 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 comrades as partners do not stay 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.710
 there and that with so many marinetti this 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.600
 car looks like a big sheet my kids do not 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.309
 I fit all of them suddenly I put on 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.690
 fifth touch of the feet I tell you that 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.850
 this car looks more frog and as if the 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.330
 wheel will unfold as well as which 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.330
 frog knows 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.789
 the last but that is above what 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.950
 last is all because this is because 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.259
 happening this can not be wrong because 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.320
 my car doubles in the parking lot 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.880
 madryn already like that man more line 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.030
 I will throw everyone I am the god of the universe 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.140
 hostile to all that is impossible Uncle 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.510
 really impossible this race 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.880
 the boy is going to see - he has worked 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.260
 to see if we get ahead the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.840
 position of guys up to a point 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.280
 complicated but very well very well the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.080
 true that is quite enough 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.610
 profitable what he has done sometimes does not come out 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.210
 something very profitable very smart 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.220
 for your part, subscriber 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.780
 we stop fifth we're going fifth we're going 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.710
 super away from those who are there 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.710
 floating in the air 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.140
 above 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.180
 Buckingham is worth every point 6 proposed 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.830
 I have the point that is the important thing is 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.570
 there is always willing to have the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.350
 no matter how we fall, we are from the 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.350
 important platform 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:30.480
 these people I do not understand anything 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.240
 two cars face but one comes out 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.240
 shot back 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.080
 this is outrageous that this guy from 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.320
 truth is worth as you can see the face that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.420
 it's pretty funny but it indicates a 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.420
 little the one that we follow fifth 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.300
 with which the first is expected as the 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.540
 team 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.610
 we are here and we get attached like me 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.610
 I am the first as always 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.019
 because not at all 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.099
 little by little 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.790
 please 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.360
 They will arrive and arrive by your daddy 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.290
 I do not know about there I do not know why it goes through 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.760
 have a long cost if the car 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.280
 out narrower eye than a little bit 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.150
 Here it is well well well well well I 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 fourth how much it is going to hatch is 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.160
 like the eggs of the hens mass of 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.440
 line lad values â€‹â€‹guys goes eye that 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.669
 Come on, fourth sun, we 're going to miss rooms 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.669
 still half a turn 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.560
 of the race 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.400
 incredibly amazing 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:55.740
 interesting I find it interesting that it is 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:05:02.389
 a detail that really is incredible 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.389
 good the fifth and why 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.210
 a kid is really easy for the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.210
 people 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.530
 come on, guys, come on guys 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.870
 today I arrived fifth and this is a 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.890
 so complicated to be in a position 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.890
 pretty more decent 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.480
 truth is worth 25 seconds is already 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.590
 four points are missing three missing 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.590
 points and the guys 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.640
 we are not going to turn around 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.830
 and by dodging that climatic mother of mine 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.540
