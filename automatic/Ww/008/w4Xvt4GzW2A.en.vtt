00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.460
 double van der stur people are welcome at new skoll belonged to me 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.660
 them in July and of course you always ask something about squash in the comments 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.720
 want to see here for the next episode then I watch mommy and then there must be 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.150
 make some sort of choice and today it has fallen on someone she 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.880
 I want a combination between a neighborhood team and a cheap team 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.539
 cheap players that I always and also that way on earth that I and that may 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:22.900
 not 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.140
 best if sens that is best logical place chosen can do 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 and jaco took because those are two more Ivorian cards that you can 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.579
 says buy five corps on the market for five and you can then link them 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.319
 with a cheaper scene from the bundesliga on a glue or a rm 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.199
 we are also team stop i did that through drogba 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.499
 do not judge before you have seen something I thought in the beginning maybe 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:46.570
 even from at t pants at sea him is not the best choice 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.120
 he feels a bit slow on his dribbles not very well I have this 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.290
 years not used so I know how you play 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.590
 but god I have not regretted it for a moment I will of course go with this team 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.450
 golden cup in but first you see corner instructions add what to 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.810
 get let purpose 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.430
 people pitstops decent volendam back in the skin so it remains central 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.660
 behind release in the dutch put out of the group and for the rest 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.580
 it, however, purely 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.730
 how to chill a personal and play 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.810
 fast cheap can buy more actively 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.509
 the police verkoop.nl use code against time to shorten the figures 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.850
 it could also be that many people asked this video to see a team 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.760
 his review 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.270
 I have actually done a record break and that way you can watch it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.190
 otherwise this is of course his potential channel of the reviews 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.790
 on the door and I know for sure 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.260
 that he is also going to do enough oil fiers so just stick with me 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.730
 especially for squads it can also be a danish with the team or the ciz but late 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.490
 so there is a lot to be said about it behind the first game 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.030
 against this good league a team with bpl mixed expression of cavani pastorie bruyne 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.780
 physical pasar malam waste 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.749
 and then a chelsy midfield and a number of kills defenders 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:51.659
 but we do not dive for, among other things, and for that I want to say 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.990
 jaco then breaks through and it is really a very good striker 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.180
 who himself may not use the emerging but the duty 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.220
 a little sentiment vlaar has that two or three years ago 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.360
 don't know exactly anymore 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.050
 played a very good year in real life remember the two or three informs 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.330
 always uniforms of the golden location is 85 triplets 85 psv suspicious fate in 85 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.160
 fit 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.549
 85 he thinks 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.930
 it's something in that neighborhood it was the music section to play with him and 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.379
 can do who then also played a spark at lyon and that was 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.369
 on a duo that I used very often 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.529
 and that duo wants to try this out a bit and it was a good reason 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.369
 to use troops because they didn't really see the first game 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.749
 because their opponent 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.739
 cover the name well but then and in the sequel and especially in the final 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.740
 we will really see a lot of drogba 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.150
 and the final came against a cheaper chili 10 but of course nothing is with it 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.219
 but also good 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.159
 it is not for nothing cheap let me say so we are just a number 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.280
 mistakes in that team 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.109
 at my opponent who could not pit under our pressure from that series in the 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.999
 45th minute all four shots four goals 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:56.619
 four to call so that makes sense so again 4 boalsert golden goal you go we 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.189
 come the semi-final and in the semi-final ek says more often is often the best 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.540
 opponent present but this time I don't even know how this big in the 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.429
 final has come if that is actually the name 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.859
 respect for you that with such a bad team you are completely a woman 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:10.440
 come 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.449
 but drogba 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.469
 the puppet finally shows why I am so incredibly good and 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.829
 scores the 0 and kalou with a shepherd because that is possible now he is quite long ahead 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.789
 his doing also scored anyway this opponent goes series spicy throughout 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.919
 easily sit in the final for s if you want to try the tenth yourself 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.259
 certainly use the three attackers by a few years of kooiman and kalou and the rest 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.009
 I actually did not see screams that might be positive for the 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:33.669
 defense if you don't see them 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.659
 then it means they do their job, I don't have a lot of goals 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.329
 I had to go through some of these in those final lakers and he looks really good 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.319
 passes by ping an then I don't know why mandala didn't think so 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.359
 cool head off defender but good as transit times benefit and that scores 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.760
 I find that on the middle left bars I might perform almost not seen 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.969
 it is because I played a lot from the middle and they didn't play much there 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.089
 for use 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.989
 and for the rest you can not partly because of the book value is also a 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.319
 possible and put that team around it there are two hours behind 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.559
 Sneijder who entered a very nice five 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:11.739
 thermal foot but who made good use of the roba from this mess 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.519
 stood well to watch scores the 2 2 from that moment it actually went 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.900
 only better 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.130
 we get a corner that does not notice but it works incredibly bad 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.760
 Out goalkeeper can do and again after a head wind came wind came in 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.090
 shoot 2 3 ahead 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.930
 that's probably the beauty 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.310
 I imagine that he came against the ten against storms that was there 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.740
 it is cheap busy team i could with my 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.470
 is in shape and you can see timo, so I will dominate for a while 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.750
 Drew was a short free kick from the city smoke which he wished the gold was great 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.880
 So that cup means that we meet the requirement that I had it set 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.199
 then you can go through 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.069
 say it all by heart 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.860
 if i led the animal that the gold cup this means it has different 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.770
 texas can win the different teams at finding levels and that just so 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.990
 for me very good team try it from this report not to follow but it 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.230
 channel like as we are and check it all here later 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.780
 well people
