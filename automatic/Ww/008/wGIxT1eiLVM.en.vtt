00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.339

when<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:38.700> apply<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.270> self-tanning<00:01:40.200> lotion

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:40.349 
when you apply your self-tanning lotion

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.949 
when you apply your self-tanning lotion
and<00:01:41.099> I<00:01:41.399> definitely<00:01:41.970> recommend<00:01:42.239> using<00:01:42.660> one<00:01:42.810> of

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
and I definitely recommend using one of

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.900 
and I definitely recommend using one of
these<00:01:43.110> whether<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.369> from<00:01:44.489> this<00:01:44.640> site

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
these whether you get it from this site

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.999 
these whether you get it from this site
or<00:01:45.090> another<00:01:45.119> site<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:45.989> it<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.319> really<00:01:46.619> helps

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
or another site but it just really helps

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.770 
or another site but it just really helps
when<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.789> get<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.300> really<00:01:48.569> good<00:01:48.720> tan

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
when you want to get a really good tan

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
when you want to get a really good tan
then<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.069> second<00:01:50.610> step<00:01:50.849> is<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.239> most

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
then the second step is the most

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.300 
then the second step is the most
important<00:01:51.959> and<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.590> self<00:01:52.979> tanning

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
important and this is the self tanning

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
important and this is the self tanning
lotion<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.330> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> shade<00:01:55.349> ultra

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
lotion and this is in the shade ultra

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.770 
lotion and this is in the shade ultra
dark<00:01:56.129> because<00:01:56.970> I<00:01:57.149> still<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.539> little<00:01:57.690> bit

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
dark because I still have a little bit

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.350

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.240 
that I think it's a good idea the only
thing<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.139> you<00:04:24.260> do<00:04:24.380> have<00:04:24.530> to<00:04:24.620> be<00:04:24.740> careful<00:04:25.160> when

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
you apply it you want to really rub it

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.839 
you apply it you want to really rub it
in<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.440> also<00:04:27.680> want<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.099> make<00:04:28.280> sure<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.639> right

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
in you also want to make sure that right

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.100 
in you also want to make sure that right
after<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.210> do<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.630> don't<00:04:29.810> put<00:04:29.990> on<00:04:30.080> a

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110

bunch of clothes it's really nice

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.839 
bunch of clothes it's really nice

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
because it can stain it so I usually

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.510

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
then it also kind of is a process

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.740 
then it also kind of is a process
because<00:04:50.310> there's<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.970> few<00:04:51.180> different<00:04:51.450> steps
