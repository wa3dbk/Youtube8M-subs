00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.299
 servus people today something completely different 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.610
 and a small review of the asus 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.460
 zenbook namely the ixs 31 in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.369
 the touch version here very nice too 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.310
 See how thin the thing really is 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.810
 with usb3 ports and i'm packing too 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.250
 again the amazon link then see 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 her the exact specifications that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.869
 So that's really a short 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.630
 review its 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.500
 left and right one usb stick possible 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.059
 usb 3.0 in itself really fancy 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.969
 notebook i had the predecessor already 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.129
 from the sender without touch version and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.539
 The thing is super easy in 13 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.440
 zÃ¶ller in the case with a 528th 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.850
 ssd disk you can see how fast that is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.300
 I went here right away 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.520
 the keyboard is lit and the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.469
 touchscreen really works first 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.399
 cream is really absolutely comparable 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.230
 to every ipad yes windows 8 one can 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.199
 as you know in the ton of knock that is 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.080
 just unfortunately a bit of bullshit 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.180
 the sound that we now here unfortunately 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 do not listen to things is too 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.960
 really good so it is one of the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.390
 Few laptops really get it right 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 give gas and we see here now how 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.009
 I kind of touch the functions 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 Try out with the internet explorer 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.479
 here just a google search and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.780
 Just here is really without 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.630
 any delays since pictures 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 call big make small load 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 It really is the internet explorer 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 I am not a fan of means and I am 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 explorer but that's really one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.140
 thing in the windows 8 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.579
 has improved because he really got it up 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.840
 touch optimizes that works 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.460
 really good too with the tabs 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.770
 It works well even if I do 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 on youtube this is working 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.420
 really good 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.650
 So first touchscreen cream is the only one 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.080
 problem is that the screen is not 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.500
 quite as hell is therefore the version 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.150
 without touchscreen is highly praised with the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.520
 screen brightness you really have to 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.600
 say it is a bit stupid in part 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.310
 This is how a finger shows 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.620
 not anymore but that's cool in windows 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.900
 8 you can move the tabs tor 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 except when on the bild.de page there goes 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.620
 it does not seem like it always does 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.120
 but otherwise you can actually 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.500
 move in very chic 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.510
 this is currently playing in the explorer 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.769
 otherwise the tile system yes like 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.700
 said windows 8 should not be here now 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.610
 be rated 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.640
 but the laptop itself really 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.860
 Send very quiet battery life around the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.630
 five hours in normal operation one can 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.080
 So also as a business angel laptop 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.750
 to take 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.730
 it is windows 8 this home version 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.940
 installed means that you can 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.140
 do not log in to a domain 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.970
 that is if you are the professional 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.500
 used then only works if 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.790
 you for example in terminal server has 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.260
 or something like that said 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.570
 screen brightness i find it in 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.640
 order to work outside 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.370
 reflects super extreme like any ipad 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.459
 but the screen really without 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.780
 any problems and you somehow 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.250
 that you have to wait there for it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.250
 jerky or something else is really 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.190
 Great this as a tablet only as 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.600
 notebook still in the back 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.510
 what else can you say as I said 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:28.959
 illuminated keyboard also for work 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:35.620
 at night very chic and full hd 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:37.780
 resolution has the 1920 x 1080 and has 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.980
 with his 5 and the ssd that i believe 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.130
 on 4 gb ram 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.600
 he has 4 gb ram that's the intel core 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.299
 i5 3317 with 1.7 ghz and has an intel 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.670
 hd 4000 graphics card so does not set the 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.350
 gamer laptop and that 's one too 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.730
 Chic thing you can really left 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.640
 another easy application 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.460
 fade in 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.380
 you can decide so there 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.090
 for example because they are not 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.580
 newsfeed is still a dazzling one 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.069
 quite chic and honest windows 8 without 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.360
 Touchscreen even more crap with 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.470
 At least it is still touchscreen 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.640
 reasonably okay you can go here 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.459
 really nice through the programs 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.980
 change and also what do you do? 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.650
 It is not a super calculating machine 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.620
 It is enough for the simplest tasks 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.840
 perfect as a multimedia story though 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.610
 of course as a gamer pc due to the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.419
 missing graphics card and the missing 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.820
 computer performance also not suitable 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.310
 otherwise really a nice toy 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.830
 and with the few microsoft apps there 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.840
 run and the asus apps again 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.970
 it is actually one 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.040
 nice box 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.090
 That's why I have a very clear one 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.730
 buy recommendation 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.630
 the thing currently costs at Amazon in 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.690
 the 13 3 inch variant as a touch screen 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.880
 just under 1200 euros 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.600
 and I think for the 1200 euro gets 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.040
 you really spend a lot of your money and that 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.570
 value for money is right 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.720
 said the screen could be a tick 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.729
 be brighter 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.560
 the touchpad you should use it 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.040
 We'll see you soon 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.720
 a built-in giant part has of course 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.180
 thereby the problem that it now and then 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.890
 times wrong clicks are who me 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.070
 just normal reboot seen so that 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.900
 offers really fast fast 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.060
 battery life is good so everything is tip-top 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.590
 so asus also has his own here 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.180
 Design back to the black 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.250
 In principle, that's what it's like 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.010
 design of the zen books and i think 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.850
 absolutely succeeded and if the thing is now 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.229
 23 years everything is wonderful, yes me 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.300
 Thanks for seeing, I hope you have 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.610
 get a good impression of that 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.560
 mix 31 as I said clear purchase recommendation 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.300
 if you want to have your laptop for 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.880
 go have what you want to work 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.720
 Doing a bit of multimedia is perfect 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.430
 not suitable for gaming otherwise 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.110
 I wish you a nice day and 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.229
 say goodbye to the last one 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.979
 Pictures of the asus ux21 zenbook with 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.220
 touch function 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.220
 servus people
