is fully mechanical even the d-pad on
the<00:01:03.239> side<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.110> mechanical<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.220> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the side right here is mechanical it is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.000 
the side right here is mechanical it is
eight<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.990> mechanical<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.500> kind<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
eight way mechanical so it's not kind of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
eight way mechanical so it's not kind of
an<00:01:08.100> emulated<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.939> between<00:01:09.390> diagonals<00:01:10.020> no<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
an emulated in between diagonals no it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
an emulated in between diagonals no it
actually<00:01:11.010> has<00:01:11.130> dedicated<00:01:11.369> diagonals<00:01:12.299> it's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
actually has dedicated diagonals it's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.440 
actually has dedicated diagonals it's
fully<00:01:13.140> compatible<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.860> synapse<00:01:14.369> 2.0<00:01:14.939> which

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
fully compatible with synapse 2.0 which

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
fully compatible with synapse 2.0 which
means<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.990> program<00:01:16.259> any<00:01:16.770> key<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.580> do

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
means you can program any key to do

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.850 
means you can program any key to do
anything<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.780> whether<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.259> just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
anything you want to whether it's just

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.039 
anything you want to whether it's just
remapping<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> whether<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> macro<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
remapping it whether it's a macro you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.510 
remapping it whether it's a macro you
can<00:01:22.229> even<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:23.009> has<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> shift

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
can even it even has a shift

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520

extremely well built overall and it
feels<00:01:57.270> very<00:01:57.420> solid<00:01:57.840> which<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.259> good<00:01:58.469> because

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
feels very solid which is good because

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080 
feels very solid which is good because
the<00:01:58.860> gaming<00:01:59.159> peripherals<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.880> thrown

the gaming peripherals can get thrown

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.719 
the gaming peripherals can get thrown
around<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.600> bit<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.890> has<00:02:02.280> look<00:02:02.579> at

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
around a little bit and it has look at

tell<00:02:35.849> me<00:02:35.939> what<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.150> think<00:02:36.359> now<00:02:36.510> that's<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> lot

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
tell me what you think now that's a lot

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.740 
tell me what you think now that's a lot
better<00:02:38.239> there<00:02:39.239> we<00:02:39.359> go

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
better there we go

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.379 
better there we go
that's<00:02:40.019> more<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.409> it<00:02:40.439> so<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.639> actually<00:02:41.909> will

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
that's more like it so it actually will

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.839 
that's more like it so it actually will
work<00:02:42.450> no<00:02:43.260> matter<00:02:43.470> what<00:02:43.889> your<00:02:44.040> hand<00:02:44.189> size<00:02:44.519> is

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
work no matter what your hand size is

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.309 
work no matter what your hand size is
and<00:02:45.329> I'm<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.689> trying<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.989> think<00:02:46.170> if<00:02:46.290> there's

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
and I'm just trying to think if there's

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.289 
and I'm just trying to think if there's
any<00:02:46.650> uh<00:02:46.799> yes<00:02:47.159> I'm<00:02:47.340> missing<00:02:47.669> one<00:02:47.879> more<00:02:48.060> thing

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
any uh yes I'm missing one more thing

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.929 
any uh yes I'm missing one more thing
about<00:02:48.419> the<00:02:48.599> customizability<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:50.069> pin<00:02:50.669> right

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
about the customizability this pin right

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.179 
about the customizability this pin right
here<00:02:51.000> pop<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.049> out<00:02:52.079> and<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.859> can<00:02:52.889> actually

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
here pop that out and you can actually

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.280 
here pop that out and you can actually
adjust<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.819> positioning<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.689> palm<00:02:54.989> or

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
adjust the positioning of the palm or

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.039 
adjust the positioning of the palm or
the<00:02:55.700> inside<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.849> your<00:02:56.970> palm<00:02:57.120> rest<00:02:57.419> as<00:02:57.629> well<00:02:57.780> so

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
the inside of your palm rest as well so

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.780 
the inside of your palm rest as well so
if<00:02:58.139> you<00:02:58.230> want<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.409> more<00:02:58.560> flat<00:02:58.799> profile<00:02:59.280> where<00:02:59.730> as

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
if you want a more flat profile where as

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.129 
if you want a more flat profile where as
you<00:02:59.879> could<00:03:00.030> see<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.299> way<00:03:00.389> slick<00:03:00.689> held<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.049> was

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
you could see the way slick held it was

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.199 
you could see the way slick held it was
more<00:03:01.349> like<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.950> would<00:03:02.459> probably<00:03:02.579> hold<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
more like this I would probably hold it

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.539 
more like this I would probably hold it
more<00:03:03.329> flat<00:03:03.689> however<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.769> can<00:03:04.950> even<00:03:05.099> put<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.459> in

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
more flat however you can even put it in

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.520 
more flat however you can even put it in
free<00:03:05.790> play<00:03:05.970> mode<00:03:06.060> by<00:03:06.629> simply<00:03:06.959> pulling<00:03:07.139> out<00:03:07.379> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
free play mode by simply pulling out the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.619 
free play mode by simply pulling out the
pin<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.739> then<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.879> adjust<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.359> so

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
pin and then you can adjust it so

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.509 
pin and then you can adjust it so
however<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.169> want<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.919> have<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.069> just

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
however you want and just have it just

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.550 
however you want and just have it just
sit<00:03:12.120> there<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.540> well<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.930> already<00:03:13.260> called<00:03:13.470> it

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
sit there and well I already called it

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.479 
sit there and well I already called it
free<00:03:13.709> play<00:03:13.859> mode<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.129> that's<00:03:14.190> what<00:03:14.370> it's

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
free play mode and that's what it's

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.740 
free play mode and that's what it's
called<00:03:14.609> so<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.849> don't<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.120> another<00:03:15.299> word<00:03:15.510> for

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
called so I don't have another word for

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.089 
called so I don't have another word for
it<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.620> pretty<00:03:16.889> much<00:03:16.979> covers

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
it I think that pretty much covers

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.159 
it I think that pretty much covers
everything<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.389> say<00:03:18.599> about<00:03:18.629> the<00:03:19.019> orb

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
everything that we can say about the orb
