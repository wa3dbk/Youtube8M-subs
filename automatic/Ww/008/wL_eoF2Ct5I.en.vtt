00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.350
 because it has almost become quiet around 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.889
 but he is punctual to the tournament start 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.889
 he returns 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.029
 as a german national team should 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.470
 You always have the goal when you are in one 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 tournament is also about winning and how 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 I think it would be for the whole 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.460
 team for us for ours for ours 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.350
 work, it would also be an important signal 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 in the direction of 2006 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.620
 because it can be almost completely body 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.579
 be fixed world champion with 38 um 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.559
 then explode 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.930
 but that's exactly why there is the verbal 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.800
 king khan or volcano of earlier days 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.660
 no longer can make compromises 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.940
 but not sporty 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.309
 I will then set up 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.850
 of course what I can mean 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 easy to implement optimally 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.310
 and then someday will surely be the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.350
 time will come to that then no more 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 converted or 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.539
 will be rotated when that will be like 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.659
 said it is alone in the hands of 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.960
 responsible trainers just no word 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.520
 too much wait because he 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 He knows that he is in the better position 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.950
 is all polls see him as number 1 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.880
 all performance comparisons are also his 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.840
 balance sheet 2005 world class it therefore leads 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.840
 no way past him 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.970
 the birthday boy oliver kahn 36 years 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.580
 we say congratulations 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.860
 the methusalem phenomenon in this young 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.230
 team he is with distance of 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.270
 oldest gives only an older one 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.920
 players here at this tournament 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.920
 that is the tunisian great 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.500
 No need to spend time sailing ship 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.500
 squad 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.540
 extra applause for the birthday boy 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.970
 Friederich deflected Germany 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.970
 with 1 0 through the gate of kevin kuranyi 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.160
 louis ii 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.230
 it just has to come with us 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.569
 yellow card 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.790
 but again no smart action 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.790
 she as expected and lets him run 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:22.830
 here to see clearly good 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:25.300
 Opportunity for the australia dust 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.569
 with his stupidity with this stupid 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.569
 foul 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.390
 mertesacker they all have 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:40.030
 The question is how long will it be? 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:41.990
 hannover 96 will be two to two 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.410
 attacks cheer clearly 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.490
 nobody expected jean alesi 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.930
 played at the weekend in the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.250
 trophy final 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.530
 so a little bit in the back 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.019
 beware that I am a similar one 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.060
 situation experience the first half as 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.340
 immediate 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.569
 the compensation fell 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.670
 So how do you like ballack but then 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.740
 looked in spite of the beleagured 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:09.130
 situation that draws of course entitled 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.120
 also looked at where podolski 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.120
 can be found 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.550
 that was extremely important they start like that 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.150
 far in the back and now would say 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.150
 the game decided 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.320
 stocker 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.250
 first try to keep alum huge 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.610
 could and then pushed on john rhys 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.910
 ifans azzurra the spanish cup 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.910
 finalists 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.580
 Children do not let him do anything 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.780
 you see all wacken got hurt
