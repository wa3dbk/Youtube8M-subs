00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.390 
start getting the same that I am going
to<00:01:14.369> need<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.790> build<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.030> glass<00:01:15.299> floor<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
to need to build a glass floor and

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.560 
to need to build a glass floor and
hopefully<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> before<00:01:18.210> any

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
hopefully I can do this before any

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.230 
hopefully I can do this before any
monster<00:01:18.960> spawn<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.560> doubt<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
monster spawn I doubt I can get all of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
monster spawn I doubt I can get all of
the<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.200> need<00:01:22.350> welp<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.830> know

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the I'm gonna need welp I don't know

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.490 
the I'm gonna need welp I don't know
doesn't<00:01:23.189> take<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.369> long<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.729> Santa<00:01:24.500> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
doesn't take that long to get Santa it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.080 
doesn't take that long to get Santa it
doesn't<00:01:25.890> look<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.009> any<00:01:26.250> most<00:01:26.460> respond<00:01:26.880> yet

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
doesn't look like any most respond yet

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.060 
doesn't look like any most respond yet
so<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:27.330> good<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:31.850> do<00:01:32.850> dig<00:01:33.180> down<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> lot<00:01:33.720> I

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
so that's good I do dig down a lot I

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.260 
so that's good I do dig down a lot I
think<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.130> actually<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.490> pretty<00:01:35.700> safe<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> do

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
think it actually is pretty safe to do

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.840 
think it actually is pretty safe to do
it<00:01:37.250> it's<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.579> sand<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:40.850> something

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it it's with sand because if something

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.429 
it it's with sand because if something
could<00:01:42.060> drop<00:01:42.360> straight<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> usually

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
could drop straight down then it usually

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
could drop straight down then it usually
would<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.159> mean<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> could<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.360> type<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
would I mean it could be the type of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.230 
would I mean it could be the type of
sand<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> naturally<00:01:47.100> spawns<00:01:47.369> over<00:01:47.610> air<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
sand that naturally spawns over air and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
sand that naturally spawns over air and
I'm<00:01:49.049> pretty<00:01:49.259> much<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.439> hoping<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.159> not

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
I'm pretty much just hoping it's not

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:03.710 
I'm pretty much just hoping it's not
what<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> dig<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:50.939> inside<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:56.509> 64<00:01:57.509> all<00:01:57.869> right

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.240 

mmm<00:02:05.640> still<00:02:06.640> no<00:02:07.480> monsters<00:02:08.140> I'm<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:09.010> in<00:02:09.130> this

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
mmm still no monsters I'm like in this

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.360 
mmm still no monsters I'm like in this
peaceful<00:02:09.520> new<00:02:09.850> world<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:11.590> its<00:02:11.770> incredibly

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
peaceful new world with its incredibly

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.490 
peaceful new world with its incredibly
thick<00:02:12.700> trees<00:02:14.760> okay<00:02:15.870> where's<00:02:16.870> my<00:02:17.050> furnace<00:02:17.590> at

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
thick trees okay where's my furnace at

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.810 
thick trees okay where's my furnace at
furnace<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.980> then<00:02:21.700> some<00:02:22.210> coal<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:24.430> eat

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
furnace and then some coal I just eat

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.400 
furnace and then some coal I just eat
through<00:02:25.210> coal<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.840> series<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.380> is

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
through coal in this series it is

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.790 
through coal in this series it is
ridiculous<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:29.620> should<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.190> good<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
ridiculous that should be good in the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.910 
ridiculous that should be good in the
meantime<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.580> will<00:02:34.710> get<00:02:35.710> some<00:02:36.300> some<00:02:37.300> ice<00:02:37.480> okay
