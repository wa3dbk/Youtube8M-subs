 parties - we can know the color black and serve a wine 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:14.709
 monarchy 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.179
 this shows at thorn casino 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.189
 I am not trying to convey home the correct way of how it should be 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.989
 served red wine 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.309
 no one can be credited to the outflow of capital 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.029
 who was tempted 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.710
 this wine was also climbing cava 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 without ciro increased from 6 hours holy claw that she the place where I am 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.070
 it is pure luck that the author is what segments 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.110
 st pete to settle to the bottom of the bottle as 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.120
 very criterion account 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.650
 How are you going to shake the bottle? 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.510
 they floated 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.400
 with this standard in that of six holy hours both the budget that go 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.860
 precipitate in the bottom the bottle or how it will give face to trw can announce 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.800
 the child with the wine 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.040
 sahin that the pure rumor 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.820
 so why I sing so much is the wine that even for a few years like I already 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 I spoke so much is in receipts 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.530
 ups versus cri 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.890
 if I go directly from the bottle to the glass 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.650
 will happen the goddess of the councilman called three or with two or three cups 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.900
 and i have stayed by hugo 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.140
 with the temptation pair of boots and the temptation very calmly 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 and eight raise the galley with the procedure wine 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.850
 at the same time it is also another reason why they make temptation 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.790
 has to do with the year sawed 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.860
 of the wine regiment both wine and a few years 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.140
 closed in the bottle I want this now 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.220
 of an orgy 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.150
 that is 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.520
 cause some variation of face mood in contact with the vinyl 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.440
 to advise you with the process 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.420
 dulce says in action 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.870
 campbell mubarak referring to the aromas of wine if you live much cooler 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.869
 easily has more easily opposed the so-called liking 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.800
 some theories were grounded and at the same time 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.129
 what do you want 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.680
 that the wine be opened two hours 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.379
 three hours 4 hours before being served 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.939
 I particulary 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.229
 in red table wines 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.520
 then it's an hour half an hour before the astral imi hall 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.920
 have ten moments credited parties and in the temperature the minutes of the square 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.199
 we can not take advantage of the estate so the wine is already in the right place 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.199
 why the supposed supplement will be 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.719
 so I'll get a corkscrew 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.089
 I'm going to make a cut here 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.049
 around the swell bottle 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.359
 but is this part that yes 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.469
 more stress 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:49.830
 and here I am because 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.059
 so that the wine 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.049
 alright 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.329
 passed to the bottle 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.890
 Dalton also got married 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.109
 do not get in touch with this part that yes crittenton rises strange 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.919
 but whoever got what was left a blow to be eventually participate more 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:16.379
 kuito- green light for the Corkscrew project in Rwanda 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 chics as urgent as possible 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.409
 by the project 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.449
 short film 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.449
 very quietly 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.709
 Let's sit without a foursome. 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.359
 around 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.139
 so I'm going to take it slowly because we do not run the risk of her leaving 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.929
 usually the tip of the show 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.170
 in very old wines 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.390
 given that I listen to juveniles having contact with the bill may be 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.499
 carefree 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.499
 and I do it so much for her 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.459
 though it's already in the corner and a smell 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.739
 now I'm going to light up here to be worth living 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.419
 I meet the 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.929
 piovani to be real in a passage of the peppers or not 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.510
 I go to the bottle with my friends eyes. 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.430
 practically no time for I could have a year 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.709
 of controls 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.709
 comparatively rapha value 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:25.739
 I will not use the wine very slowly from the bottle to the singer leaving it well 

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:27.990
 dark and the singer's couturier 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990
 without having let the rough ones 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.749
 - We have a very beautiful color. 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.749
 I already have a very pronounced chestnut tree 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.400
 according to prove it 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.779
 I as a professional I'm going to run the producers the wind changes into nothing 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.779
 what is one element they thought 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.740
 to ceasa wines to the song 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.400
 and even the same 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.430
 therefore it is a specific tool for the voting of wines 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.860
 it has to be in various concrete with which the life of the few and given to these 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.129
 that the project creates damnation to help 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.420
 at the time in the selection of the agreement 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.420
 of the wine itself 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.449
 so much sir confirms 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.699
 it's in kastanies already enough the zÃ© speck 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.969
 because it is the fruit of aging 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.979
 of the earthquake itself 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.979
 quinzinho that over the years that thin 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.139
 I have very good rome rome came the cry 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.099
 confirms the old 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.830
 juveniles and then what you still notice really likes 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.860
 presence in the domain lease 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.449
 we have at the end of the goal that still very prolonged a wine very much 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.330
 boom 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.550
 we think we're gone 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.229
 and the appropriate amount 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.400
 it is precisely this 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.809
 I never civil 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:16.689
 more than this amount came to what for what closure 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.729
 we can do it either we end up in the area in slang 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.659
 professional 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.139
 the script I saw on the glass 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.419
 in full both 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.790
 is to shake the 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.909
 locally so early 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:30.409
 Nothing to do 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.610
 the oscillations so that is the slip 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.869
 and then it's ready 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:41.669
 so far we have to give the students of the wine itself the bouquet given that 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.539
 instead of cream 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:44.409
 pro cent 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.869
 vilks armament 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.869
 and the time in the same the proof or 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:59.729
 after all, I realize that it's not that difficult, 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.360
 is that others who have created all that we lack 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.330
 love
