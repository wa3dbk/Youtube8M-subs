 really they have said they have 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.129
 approached to form games 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.129
 totally different 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.079
 according to what they said is the first cycle of 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 three-year development with sledgehammer 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.649
 games at the helm and are trying 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.360
 shake or be according to what they have said 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.460
 try to be trying to shake the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.700
 formula in several ways so that it comes out 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.070
 a perfect game says that this game 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.899

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.619
 fascinating story a version some

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.350
 exoskeleton so we've talked so much 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.280
 during these days and good as they have 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 saying 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 well, the game has been located in the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.090
 private already you know has become 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.979
 with power 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.929
 to rescue humanity from a world 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.750
 devastated that struggles to rebuild 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.179
 after a global attack with its 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.759
 cons all armies and the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.800
 infrastructure that they have and you are a 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.350
 advanced soldier 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.720
 as they said strengthened with new 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.510
 unique opportunity that is a very project 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.610
