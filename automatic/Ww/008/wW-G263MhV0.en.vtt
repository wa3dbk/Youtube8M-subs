00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.080
 Granite is a mathematical rock which millions of years ago 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.349
 slow cooling caused the earth's crust 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 Granites essentially consist of minerals the Quandts Glamor and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.499
 feldspar 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.109
 different mineralization led to different colors 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 Expulsion of the restructuring of the material 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.249
 Kenny occurs on every continent 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.019
 the main actors areas 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.339
 Leagues in Italy 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.520
 Spain Norway she may Rijkaard India China and Brazil 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.890
 Granny 14 is among the toughest and care the lightest natural stone materials 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.269
 and are therefore suitable 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.440
 excellent for use in the kitchen area 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.399
 the robustness of the material 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.949
 makes dismantling further processing and refining the material into one 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.710
 complicated matter 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.579
 in committees loft beds with heavy equipment 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.920
 and with the help of explosives the local none for Carsten Pape 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.980
 won 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.780
 Here it is not uncommon that a quarry first years of 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.430
 Preparation time and from construction activity 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.619
 regular 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469
 and beautiful in our sense 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.469
 Good work produces good material 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.760
 after the acquisition of the ruble, this same processing value of 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.750
 Transported quarry 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.700
 There, the first processing step is the so-called 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.550
 blatantly start 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.330
 With the help of special machines depending on the strength between 40 and 70 wafers 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.190
 sawed off from a pool 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.240
 These wafers are called unmasked because they produce nonspecific snacks 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.010
 become 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.179
 Length and width of the respective map 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.880
 because finally directly on the size of the block 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.240
 which could be won from the quarry 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.840
 In the following processing step, the mass data are polished on one side 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.790
 the later surface and already brought to a shine 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.820
 after a detailed identification of the &amp; MaaÃŸ card, this is ready for 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.640
 Further transport to the finishing station z 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.779
 There are orders from customers in front of Pecik Race worktops 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:15.209
 with exactly defined masts need 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.560
 due to the existing orders 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.499
 the unmasked are then cut to the required dimensions 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.499
 and continued to work in different ways 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:29.409
 a refining process which is widely used in Germany and on the 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.639
 Requirements of kitchen worktops is tailored 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.939
 is the so-called two plus two method or sandwich method 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.099
 In this method, the later worktop with a starting position of 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.180
 two centimeters with other border strips of thickness 2 cm 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.650
 doubled to a worktop of 4 cm thickness 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:55.530
 The never on doubling takes place here with special care procedure 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.280
 and with Amir's contribution to the material 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.770
 and the plate before breakage 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.009
 and further damage 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.219
 Despite the elaborate Keith this procedure offers this approach 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.730
 numerous advantages 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.770
 Ultimately crucial in the worktop area 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:17.419
 the weight of the fold by this construction in comparison to massive 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.230
 Slabs greatly reduced 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.450
 which eliminates numerous handling and installation problems 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.349
 at the same time the reinforcement of the material by Amir and stern of the 4 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.399
 that the material at the neuralgic places can never break 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.620
 With the help of state-of-the-art cnc-controlled machines, the necessary 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.009
 Cutouts 50 plates 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.369
 Rinse fixtures and sockets in the prepared workplace at risk 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.989
 even in the polished recesses 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.549
 are no longer a problem for machines of the current generation 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:57.360
 In the subsequent manual processing all operations are performed 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.480
 which are not mechanically possible or very difficult to perform 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.770
 Countertops manufacturing 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.210
 So, despite all machine support, it always stays the same 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.209
 Handwork 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.299
 after final inspection all individual parts 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.199
 and comprehensive labeling 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.060
 leave the worktops that we are honored against the end customer 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.340
 at the end customer 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.750
 Niemann's specially trained team is the final assembly of the crafted Grande 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.750
 Worktops on the existing kitchen in front 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.360
 the plates are delivered ready 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.280
 the clear only need to be precise 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.750
 plans against the installation of the single plates 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.970
 as well as the supplied accessories 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.970
 such as residues and the smallest worry 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.640
 with practiced hand and a victory we can directly 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.050
 Niemann's installation teams then work on finishing the trend 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.389
 Worktops in front 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.840
 and hand over after a short reaction time 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.840
 varied cuisine to the trend could 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.819
 Both you and your family will be satisfied owners
