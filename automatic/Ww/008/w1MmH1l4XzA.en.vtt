planet<00:03:17.330> tay<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.510> begin<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:17.930> why<00:03:18.800> don't<00:03:18.950> care

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
planet tay to begin with why don't care

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.040 
planet tay to begin with why don't care
players<00:03:19.490> are<00:03:19.610> actually<00:03:20.000> real<00:03:20.150> more<00:03:20.750> familiar

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
players are actually real more familiar

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.960 
players are actually real more familiar
with<00:03:21.080> tay<00:03:21.440> because<00:03:21.800> that's<00:03:22.010> where<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.489> let<00:03:22.850> go

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
with tay because that's where the let go

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.660 
with tay because that's where the let go
low<00:03:23.030> come<00:03:23.330> from<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.660> hunter<00:03:23.900> worms<00:03:24.230> oh<00:03:24.670> okay

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
low come from the hunter worms oh okay

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.370 
low come from the hunter worms oh okay
so<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:25.880> makes<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.270> and<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.989> probably<00:03:27.260> the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
so that makes and and and probably the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.680 
so that makes and and and probably the
reason<00:03:27.500> why<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.550> lot<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.910> people<00:03:28.970> ask<00:03:29.270> that<00:03:29.420> is

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
reason why a lot of people ask that is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.900 
reason why a lot of people ask that is
because<00:03:30.140> we<00:03:30.290> say<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.250> goal<00:03:31.550> of<00:03:31.670> art<00:03:31.790> from

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
because we say that the goal of art from

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.090 
because we say that the goal of art from
teh<00:03:32.270> so<00:03:32.780> they<00:03:33.170> assume<00:03:33.440> Oh<00:03:33.620> wolf<00:03:33.890> you're<00:03:33.980> going

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
teh so they assume Oh wolf you're going

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
teh so they assume Oh wolf you're going
to<00:03:34.160> be<00:03:34.220> from<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.459> place<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.820> have<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:34.940> be<00:03:35.060> able

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
to be from a place you have to be able

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.670 
to be from a place you have to be able
to<00:03:35.270> walk<00:03:35.360> around<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.020> oh<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.410> can't

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
to walk around on it oh you can't

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.640 
to walk around on it oh you can't
because<00:03:37.010> Tay<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.550> gas<00:03:38.030> giant<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.989> before<00:03:39.530> we

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
because Tay is a gas giant so before we
