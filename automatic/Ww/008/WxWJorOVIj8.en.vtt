00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.969 

all<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.319> video<00:00:01.500> we're<00:00:01.800> going<00:00:01.890> to

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
all right in this video we're going to

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.649 
all right in this video we're going to
talk<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.159> finding<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.820> magnitude<00:00:03.389> and

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
talk about finding the magnitude and

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.230 
talk about finding the magnitude and
direction<00:00:04.140> angle<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.710> vector<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.430> we've<00:00:06.120> got

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
direction angle of a vector so we've got

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.470 
direction angle of a vector so we've got
four<00:00:06.509> examples<00:00:06.600> here<00:00:07.580> let's<00:00:08.580> do<00:00:08.730> Part<00:00:09.000> A<00:00:09.120> first

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
four examples here let's do Part A first

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.240 
four examples here let's do Part A first
a<00:00:09.809> lot<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.230> times<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:10.710> I'll<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.130> I'll

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
a lot of times what I'll do is I'll

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520 
a lot of times what I'll do is I'll
simply<00:00:11.610> graph<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.179> vector<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:13.139> kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.349> get<00:00:13.500> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
simply graph the vector to kind of get a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.210 
simply graph the vector to kind of get a
feel<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:15.120> direction<00:00:15.750> angle<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.350> if<00:00:17.010> you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
feel for this direction angle so if you

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.380 
feel for this direction angle so if you
graph<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.850> vector<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.359> components

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
graph the vector with components

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.580 
graph the vector with components
negative<00:00:19.350> three<00:00:19.619> comma<00:00:19.830> four<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:22.230> way<00:00:22.380> we'll

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
negative three comma four the way we'll

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.590 
negative three comma four the way we'll
graph<00:00:23.039> them<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.519> always<00:00:23.699> kind<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> put<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
graph them is we always kind of put the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.630 
graph them is we always kind of put the
starting<00:00:24.990> point<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.380> origin<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
starting point at the origin and the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.700 
starting point at the origin and the
negative<00:00:27.029> three<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.630> says<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.990> three<00:00:28.349> units

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
negative three just says go three units

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.609 
negative three just says go three units
to<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> left<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> second

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to the left and then the second

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.580 
to the left and then the second
component<00:00:31.859> says<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.700> four<00:00:33.030> units<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
component says go four units up so the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
component says go four units up so the
vector<00:00:34.980> negative<00:00:35.790> three<00:00:36.149> comma<00:00:36.420> four<00:00:36.780> would

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
vector negative three comma four would

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.030 
vector negative three comma four would
be<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.739> vector<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.250> points<00:00:38.570> kind<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> off

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
be this vector that points kind of off

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.150 
be this vector that points kind of off
to<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.070> left<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.040> it's<00:00:44.040> going

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to the left and up it's got a it's going

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.819 
to the left and up it's got a it's going
to<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.340> sitting<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.789> Quadrant<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.829> okay

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to be sitting here in Quadrant two okay

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
to be sitting here in Quadrant two okay
so<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> figure<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.969> angle<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so we want to figure out that angle you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
so we want to figure out that angle you
know<00:00:49.260> maybe<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.950> call<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.250> theta<00:00:50.489> that's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
know maybe we can call it theta that's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.770 
know maybe we can call it theta that's
associated<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:53.430> vector<00:00:53.850> maybe

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
associated with this this vector maybe

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.590 
associated with this this vector maybe
the<00:00:54.930> first<00:00:55.079> thing<00:00:55.230> let's<00:00:55.500> find<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> magnitude

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
the first thing let's find the magnitude

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
the first thing let's find the magnitude
so<00:00:57.600> let's<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> figure<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so let's see so to figure out the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
so let's see so to figure out the
magnitude<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.570> vector<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> maybe<00:01:02.250> we

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
magnitude of this vector so maybe we

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.270 
magnitude of this vector so maybe we
call<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.879> vector<00:01:03.539> V<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> magnitude<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
call this vector V so the magnitude of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
call this vector V so the magnitude of
vector<00:01:05.430> V<00:01:05.640> again<00:01:06.210> sometimes<00:01:06.869> I've<00:01:07.080> seen<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
vector V again sometimes I've seen it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
vector V again sometimes I've seen it
with<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.549> you'll<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
with a you know you'll put it in just a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.380 
with a you know you'll put it in just a
single<00:01:09.990> set<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.170> bars<00:01:10.970> sometimes<00:01:11.970> people<00:01:12.299> also

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
single set of bars sometimes people also

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.120 
single set of bars sometimes people also
write<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.080> two

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
write it with two

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.430 
write it with two
so<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.640> figure<00:01:16.910> out<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> magnitude<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:18.110> simply

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
so to figure out the magnitude we simply

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.220 
so to figure out the magnitude we simply
take<00:01:18.650> each<00:01:19.600> component<00:01:20.800> we<00:01:21.800> square<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:23.230> square

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
take each component we square it square

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.780 
take each component we square it square
each<00:01:24.380> one<00:01:24.590> add<00:01:24.860> them<00:01:25.070> together<00:01:25.220> in<00:01:25.520> square

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
each one add them together in square

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.460 
each one add them together in square
root<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:26.210> again<00:01:26.420> oh<00:01:26.540> we're<00:01:26.750> really<00:01:26.930> using

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
root it so again oh we're really using

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.730 
root it so again oh we're really using
it's<00:01:27.620> just<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:28.040> distance<00:01:28.940> formula

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
it's just the distance formula

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.680 
it's just the distance formula
Pythagorean<00:01:30.740> theorem<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.030> negative<00:01:32.390> 3

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
Pythagorean theorem so negative 3

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.880 
Pythagorean theorem so negative 3
squared<00:01:33.050> that's<00:01:33.200> going<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.470> be<00:01:33.560> 9<00:01:35.470> plus<00:01:36.470> 16

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
squared that's going to be 9 plus 16

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.410 
squared that's going to be 9 plus 16
that'll<00:01:37.700> be<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:37.910> square<00:01:38.300> root<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:38.630> 25<00:01:40.420> which

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
that'll be the square root of 25 which

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.520 
that'll be the square root of 25 which
will<00:01:41.570> simply<00:01:41.900> give<00:01:42.140> us<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.530> magnitude<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.700> 5<00:01:44.530> so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
will simply give us a magnitude of 5 so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.960 
will simply give us a magnitude of 5 so
we<00:01:45.860> would<00:01:45.980> say<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.310> vector<00:01:46.700> has<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.850> magnitude

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
we would say this vector has a magnitude

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.100 
we would say this vector has a magnitude
of<00:01:47.720> 5<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:49.150> when<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.270> want<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.570> find<00:01:50.750> out<00:01:50.900> the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
of 5 and when you want to find out the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.920 
of 5 and when you want to find out the
direction<00:01:51.410> angle<00:01:52.210> what<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.330> could<00:01:53.510> do<00:01:53.690> is<00:01:53.810> you

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
direction angle what you could do is you

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.910 
direction angle what you could do is you
could<00:01:54.020> think<00:01:54.140> about<00:01:54.260> a<00:01:54.410> little<00:01:54.680> right

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
could think about a little right

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.510 
could think about a little right
triangle<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:57.200> here's<00:01:57.470> theta<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.009> opposite

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
triangle so here's theta so the opposite

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.020 
triangle so here's theta so the opposite
side<00:02:01.580> would<00:02:01.940> have<00:02:02.000> length<00:02:02.680> for<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.460> adjacent

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
side would have length for the adjacent

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.999 
side would have length for the adjacent
side<00:02:05.210> okay<00:02:05.570> yeah<00:02:05.840> there's<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.200> negative<00:02:06.710> but

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
side okay yeah there's a negative but

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.120 
side okay yeah there's a negative but
I'm<00:02:07.190> going<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.430> use<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.670> positive<00:02:08.330> 3<00:02:09.130> because

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
I'm going to use a positive 3 because

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.770 
I'm going to use a positive 3 because
again<00:02:10.340> we're<00:02:10.459> talking<00:02:10.729> about<00:02:10.820> triangles<00:02:11.480> here

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
again we're talking about triangles here

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.760 
again we're talking about triangles here
so<00:02:12.470> if<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:12.770> do<00:02:12.890> tangent<00:02:14.050> well<00:02:15.050> tangent<00:02:15.320> is

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
so if we do tangent well tangent is

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.660 
so if we do tangent well tangent is
opposite<00:02:16.490> over<00:02:16.550> adjacent<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:18.370> what<00:02:19.370> we'll<00:02:19.519> do

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
opposite over adjacent and what we'll do

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.750 
opposite over adjacent and what we'll do
now<00:02:19.850> is<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:21.500> figure<00:02:21.709> out<00:02:21.860> theta<00:02:22.220> will<00:02:22.610> just

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
now is to figure out theta will just

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.470 
now is to figure out theta will just
take<00:02:22.910> arc<00:02:23.239> tangent<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.959> both<00:02:24.260> sides<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.390> we'll

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
take arc tangent of both sides so we'll

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.170 
take arc tangent of both sides so we'll
take<00:02:26.690> arctangent<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.920> four<00:02:28.519> over<00:02:29.269> 3<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:32.030> let's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
take arctangent of four over 3 so let's

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.570 
take arctangent of four over 3 so let's
see<00:02:32.330> here<00:02:32.540> I'm<00:02:33.170> just<00:02:33.350> going<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.530> hit<00:02:33.650> 4<00:02:34.010> over<00:02:34.280> 3

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
see here I'm just going to hit 4 over 3

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.480 
see here I'm just going to hit 4 over 3
in<00:02:34.700> my<00:02:34.820> calculator

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
in my calculator

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.110 
in my calculator
so<00:02:37.500> 4/3<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.650> one<00:02:38.980> point<00:02:39.340> three<00:02:39.970> repeating<00:02:40.710> so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
so 4/3 is one point three repeating so

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.760 
so 4/3 is one point three repeating so
4/3<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.900> next<00:02:44.140> thing<00:02:44.290> I'm<00:02:44.410> going<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.620> do

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
4/3 and the next thing I'm going to do

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.910 
4/3 and the next thing I'm going to do
is<00:02:45.070> take<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.460> inverse<00:02:45.940> tangent<00:02:46.270> of<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:49.920> so

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
is take the inverse tangent of that so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.130 
is take the inverse tangent of that so
let's<00:02:51.100> see<00:02:51.220> 4<00:02:51.550> divided<00:02:51.970> by<00:02:52.000> 3<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.750> now<00:02:52.780> if<00:02:53.080> we

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
let's see 4 divided by 3 and now if we

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.740 
let's see 4 divided by 3 and now if we
do<00:02:53.320> inverse<00:02:53.740> tangent<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.490> that<00:02:54.700> I'm<00:02:55.420> getting

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
do inverse tangent of that I'm getting

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.720 
do inverse tangent of that I'm getting
fadeth<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.740> be<00:02:58.110> fifty<00:02:59.110> three<00:02:59.440> point<00:02:59.800> one<00:03:00.340> three

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
fadeth to be fifty three point one three

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.490 
fadeth to be fifty three point one three
degrees<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.780> think<00:03:02.020> I'm<00:03:02.080> going<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.320> round

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
degrees and I think I'm going to round

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.990 
degrees and I think I'm going to round
this<00:03:02.740> off<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:04.350> 53<00:03:05.350> degrees<00:03:05.730> now<00:03:06.730> again

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
this off just to 53 degrees now again

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.840 
this off just to 53 degrees now again
this<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.210> really<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:09.370> know<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.580> can<00:03:09.760> think

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
this is really you know you can think

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.430 
this is really you know you can think
about<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.080> going<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.290> give

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
about this this is really going to give

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.860 
about this this is really going to give
us<00:03:11.530> an<00:03:11.680> angle<00:03:11.860> here<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.940> first<00:03:13.540> quadrant

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
us an angle here in the first quadrant

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.370 
us an angle here in the first quadrant
right<00:03:14.350> 53<00:03:15.040> degrees<00:03:15.610> is<00:03:15.960> just<00:03:16.960> going<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.170> fall

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
right 53 degrees is just going to fall

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.550 
right 53 degrees is just going to fall
in<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.890> first<00:03:18.490> quadrant<00:03:19.170> well<00:03:20.170> what<00:03:20.440> we're

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
in the first quadrant well what we're

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.860 
in the first quadrant well what we're
going<00:03:20.710> to<00:03:20.740> do<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.130> figure<00:03:21.490> out<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.830> angle<00:03:23.830> here

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
going to do to figure out the angle here

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.560 
going to do to figure out the angle here
so<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:26.020> know<00:03:26.170> really<00:03:27.210> this<00:03:28.210> angle<00:03:30.570> this

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
so we know really this angle this

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.720 
so we know really this angle this
reference<00:03:32.080> angle<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.680> going<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.980> be<00:03:33.100> 53

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
reference angle is just going to be 53

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.850 
reference angle is just going to be 53
degrees<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.990> figure<00:03:35.230> out<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.590> direction

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
degrees so to figure out the direction

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.790 
degrees so to figure out the direction
angle<00:03:36.550> since<00:03:36.970> it's<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.240> Quadrant<00:03:37.480> two<00:03:38.020> we'll

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
angle since it's in Quadrant two we'll

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.630 
angle since it's in Quadrant two we'll
take<00:03:38.980> 180<00:03:39.940> degrees<00:03:40.540> subtract<00:03:41.470> away<00:03:41.640> 53

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
take 180 degrees subtract away 53

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.200 
take 180 degrees subtract away 53
degrees<00:03:43.060> that's<00:03:43.990> going<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.290> give<00:03:44.410> us<00:03:45.210> 127

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
degrees that's going to give us 127

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.720 
degrees that's going to give us 127
degrees<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.260> that's<00:03:47.800> going<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.070> be<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
degrees and that's going to be the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.880 
degrees and that's going to be the
direction<00:03:49.420> angle<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:50.800> for<00:03:51.430> our<00:03:51.930> vector<00:03:52.930> with

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
direction angle now for our vector with

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.080 
direction angle now for our vector with
components<00:03:53.920> negative<00:03:54.880> 3<00:03:55.180> comma<00:03:55.510> 4
