00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.440
 hi friends how are you this time 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 I bring an equal day and a craft 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.170
 I hope you like it is something that I 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.970
 happened and I show you the materials that 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:00.950
 let's use we will not need a 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.829
 a coffee box that we no longer occupy 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.400
 old lady 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.210
 we will be using also 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.530
 colored pebbles and we will be 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.680
 using this 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.750
 also a silicone gun 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.720
 and we will be using 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.470
 a cap of some perfume that digit 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.660
 let's have 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.740
 and some little glitter we have for 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.110
 there 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.430
 so you can see the best ones are 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.410
 these bright 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.840
 that can be pasted or can buy 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.479
 stickers too 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.500
 well let's start and we will take 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.109
 this our empty box I decided and what 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.189
 let's go to the cassette sorry this 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:55.729
 we are going to open and we are going to put this one 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.119
 little bit of glue all over the shore of 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.490
 that can be opened and we're going to hit it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.689
 I know this is an ornament that we are not going to 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.049
 be opening the box but for 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.560
 more security we are going to paste okay my 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.560
 beautiful 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:21.019
 and then ready we paste well 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.599
 and well, here we already see our 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.269
 box already well insured and this we 're going 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.859
 to use by the back and what 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.859
 opposite is what we are going to decorate 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.640
 well let's start let's decorate 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 with these little stones that I showed to 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.950
 a principle this is already to taste ok 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.900
 and well I started putting him a 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.900
 little heart 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.450
 Well, it makes me very funny to put him 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.180
 the little stones I think this is the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.569
 part more fun because you decorate it 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.790
 to your taste and well I know it's a 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.580
 craftsmanship very easy and that many are going 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.050
 to like for the same thing that is easy as well 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.050
 I hope that girls do 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.770
 and well I think I'm the wolf like that 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.120
 as of chanel and by the sides follow 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.060
 decorating with pebbles 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.299
 maybe it's not going to stay super exactly 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.970
 but good in this case I will be 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.340
 using these stickers because no 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.920
 I found the little stones so small and 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.510
 I will go forming the cee I will remove 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.510
 these ornaments hehe 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.159
 well then I think to make a 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.950
 craftsmanship you have to have enough 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.780
 wit pretty creativity and then 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.420
 we have to use the things that 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.530
 we have at home so this is a 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:17.110
 option I will start to form the cee of 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.110
 Chanel with these bright 2 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.920
 that's how it took off a little bit 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.560
 of time because then this one did not have 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.240
 loose stones but you have to 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.240
 take advantage of the material that we have 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.000
 more or less is staying like this in this 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.159
 way and I'll be putting more 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.310
 little stones I already told you that 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:01.819
 decoration is how you want and your 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.789
 creativity this only in this 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.439
 example an idea and you do it as 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.389
 you want 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.610
 What I wanted was to take advantage of 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:16.100
 material that I had at home and not walk 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.640
 buying this the truth stuff 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.640
 ah 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.480
 good and that's how it's getting very 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:34.220
 cool and this is the cover of a perfume that 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.770
 I finished and I saved it for 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.430
 do this craft we're going to put the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.580
 silicon all along the shore and we're going to 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.470
 paste on top of our coffee box 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.320
 many will wonder why not 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.940
 I honor some empty perfume but the 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.190
 the truth is that I want to recycle 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.180
 and besides, he did not have in this way 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.150
 we are not squeezing either and that's how we're doing 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.330
 being more or less 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.090
 and well I'm going to decorate the lid for 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.810
 that looks prettier but you 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.810
 they decide how 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.550
 seeing it well as I needed 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.650
 like a ribbon cited down as in 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.969
 medium on the lid would also look very 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.309
 all right 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.299
 this was all that god blesses and 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:23.299
 thank you very much for watching
