BUCKWHEAT KASHA BY ZEPTER

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.459
Hello ! I am pleased to welcome you as guests!

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.609
Today I 'll show you how to cook

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.369
buckwheat porridge in a Zepter pot in a simple way.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.960
For this recipe we will need: buckwheat and water in a 1:1 ratio,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.380
salt and butter to taste.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.079
I cook buckwheat porridge with green buckwheat.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.469
Green buckwheat, unlike fried buckwheat,

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.970
preserves more nutrients:

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.400
iron, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iodine and vitamins.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.630
In addition, green buckwheat helps digestion and boosts immunity.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.620
Until the 50s of the last century green buckwheat was used for food.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.060
Frying the buckwheat began with Nikita Khrushchev.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.090
During a trip to America, he learned that for better storage

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.470
buckwheat should to fry.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.140
We will prepare the green buckwheat.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.450
The washed buckwheat put into the pan.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.190
Pour it with water.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.090
Add some salt.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.610
Immediately add a butter.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.920
The buckwheat has not got to genetic experiments.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.170
Therefore, there is no genetically modified buckwheat.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.980
Cover with a lid.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.670
The new thermokontrol has two sector (as opposed to the old one).

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.900
Using the old thermokontrol need to cook until the middle of the green sector.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.869
There are four marks, so need to cook to the second mark.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.309
Cover with a lid.

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:22.629
Cook on low heat until the thermokontrol`s arrow reaches the second mark of the green sector.

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.079
The arrow reached the second mark of the green sector, even a little further.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.139
Turning off the heat and leave with closed lid for 15 minutes.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:37.129
It took 15 minutes - buckwheat is ready!

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:47.509
Mix.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:52.419
You can set the table.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:59.129
This taste differs from the taste of brown fried buckwheat.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.199
But it is very useful!

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:05.539
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.000
