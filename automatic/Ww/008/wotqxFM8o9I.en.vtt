then you want to be a second player

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.560 
then you want to be a second player
which<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.190> second<00:00:54.460> controller<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:57.570> alright

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
which is second controller well alright

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.569

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
figure if the map which this really is

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.240
