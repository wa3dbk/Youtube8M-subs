these three for an example so I select

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.210 
these three for an example so I select
them<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.340> drag<00:00:22.119> them<00:00:22.150> over<00:00:22.630> here<00:00:23.070> into<00:00:24.070> this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
area and you can see this is the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.640 
area and you can see this is the
playhead<00:00:28.390> that<00:00:28.599> I'm<00:00:28.720> moving<00:00:29.050> back<00:00:29.200> and<00:00:29.410> forth

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
playhead that I'm moving back and forth

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.710 
playhead that I'm moving back and forth
if<00:00:30.009> I<00:00:30.489> was<00:00:30.669> to<00:00:30.820> play<00:00:31.029> through<00:00:31.329> these<00:00:31.480> pictures

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
if I was to play through these pictures

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.139 
if I was to play through these pictures
it<00:00:32.500> would<00:00:32.739> actually<00:00:32.950> play<00:00:33.460> right<00:00:33.700> now<00:00:33.730> as<00:00:34.120> a

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
it would actually play right now as a

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.910 
it would actually play right now as a
slideshow<00:00:34.540> it's<00:00:35.020> just<00:00:35.290> not<00:00:35.470> terribly

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
slideshow it's just not terribly

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.590 
slideshow it's just not terribly
interesting<00:00:36.520> there's<00:00:36.730> no<00:00:36.880> movement<00:00:37.360> there's

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
interesting there's no movement there's

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.580 
interesting there's no movement there's
no<00:00:37.750> transition<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:39.129> there<00:00:39.640> is<00:00:39.969> no<00:00:40.210> narration

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
no transition and there is no narration

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.810 
no transition and there is no narration

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
so the first thing you probably want to

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.009 
so the first thing you probably want to
do<00:00:42.969> is<00:00:43.120> make<00:00:43.420> sure<00:00:43.449> they're<00:00:43.809> in<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:43.989> right

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
do is make sure they're in the right

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.720 
do is make sure they're in the right
order<00:00:44.379> if<00:00:44.679> you<00:00:44.829> want<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.100> change<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.489> order

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
order if you want to change the order

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.759 
order if you want to change the order
you<00:00:45.850> can<00:00:45.910> slide<00:00:46.329> them<00:00:46.539> around<00:00:46.660> just<00:00:47.530> by

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
you can slide them around just by

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.169 
you can slide them around just by
dragging<00:00:48.070> them<00:00:48.399> and<00:00:48.489> dropping<00:00:48.609> them<00:00:49.030> where

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
dragging them and dropping them where

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.400 
dragging them and dropping them where
you<00:00:49.269> want<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:51.399> double<00:00:51.789> click<00:00:52.059> one<00:00:52.410> it'll

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
you want if you double click one it'll

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.400 
you want if you double click one it'll
take<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.769> to<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.460> edit<00:00:55.300> tab<00:00:55.539> and<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:56.230> could

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
take you to the edit tab and you could

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.529 
take you to the edit tab and you could
set<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.769> duration<00:00:57.129> for<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.789> pictures<00:00:58.179> here

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
set the duration for the pictures here

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.919 
set the duration for the pictures here
you<00:00:59.050> can<00:00:59.289> see<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.769> it's<00:01:00.010> by<00:01:00.640> default<00:01:00.910> at<00:01:01.449> 7

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
you can see that it's by default at 7

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.330 
you can see that it's by default at 7
seconds<00:01:02.469> on<00:01:02.589> each<00:01:03.370> picture<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:06.100> go<00:01:06.280> to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
seconds on each picture if you go to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.850 
seconds on each picture if you go to
animations<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.480> will<00:01:07.630> see<00:01:07.930> on<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.260> left<00:01:08.440> all

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
animations you will see on the left all

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.560 
animations you will see on the left all
of<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.159> transitions<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.940> you<00:01:10.210> could<00:01:10.360> have

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
of the transitions that you could have

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.530 
of the transitions that you could have
and<00:01:11.260> over<00:01:11.890> on<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.160> right<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.430> have<00:01:12.700> some<00:01:13.240> in

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
and over on the right you have some in

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.650 
and over on the right you have some in
and<00:01:13.810> zoom<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.980> will<00:01:15.310> give<00:01:15.790> us<00:01:15.910> some<00:01:16.180> movement

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
and zoom that will give us some movement

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.570 
and zoom that will give us some movement
so<00:01:17.140> I'm<00:01:17.230> going<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.440> select<00:01:17.620> that<00:01:17.860> picture<00:01:18.430> in

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
so I'm going to select that picture in

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.840 
so I'm going to select that picture in
the<00:01:18.700> middle<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:20.800> tap<00:01:21.160> one<00:01:21.190> of<00:01:21.640> these

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
the middle and when I tap one of these

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.750 
the middle and when I tap one of these
transitions<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:23.410> will<00:01:23.560> add<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
transitions it will add that to the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.390 
transitions it will add that to the
picture<00:01:25.120> so<00:01:25.540> if<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.170> pull<00:01:26.410> this<00:01:26.560> down<00:01:26.620> I<00:01:26.860> can<00:01:27.220> see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
picture so if I pull this down I can see

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.550 
picture so if I pull this down I can see
all<00:01:27.550> my<00:01:27.580> different<00:01:27.940> transitions<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.050> I

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
all my different transitions and I

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.770 
all my different transitions and I
actually<00:01:29.770> want<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.250> get<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.910> dissolves<00:01:31.570> I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
actually want to get to the dissolves I

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.840 
actually want to get to the dissolves I
usually<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:33.040> keep<00:01:33.250> them<00:01:33.430> simple

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
usually like to just keep them simple

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.540 
usually like to just keep them simple
and<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.420> like<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.870> one<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.290> blur<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.310> can

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
and I like that one the blur so I can

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.280 
and I like that one the blur so I can
either<00:01:36.610> drag<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.150> playhead<00:01:37.510> over<00:01:37.570> this<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.110> see

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290
