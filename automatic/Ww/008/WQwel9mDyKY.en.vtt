 by far the heaviest and hardest 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.500
 allow heavy metal band in the world 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.230
 compressor head from germany the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.480
 four-time drama stick boy guitarist 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 angles and what the fund wants to do

 wednesday the frankfurt music fair 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.060
 Rock where you order 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.070
 Renowned guitar manufacturer gibson 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.789
 An automatic guitar tune device 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.220
 imagine 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.559
 in the foreground, of course, is the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.870
 music and the three heavyweights 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.769
 a repertoire from last berlin to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.769
 engine has enough 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.219
 a berliner technology artist has come 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.949
 fraser has created and indeed to large 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.780
 Sharing recycled scrap that notices 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.269
 but not to the metal musicians 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.860
 with four arms has become natural 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.410
 an advantage over normal 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.250
 drummers and also guitarist winkels 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.850
 should be so nice with its 78 fingers 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.550
 guitar virtuosos in the shadows 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.220
 ask and what is bones is according to the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.649
 website the most accurate base in the world 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.509
 because so much is possible have compressor 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.310
 Of course they are in high demand 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.190
 just some performances on a metal 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.289
 festival in australia completed where it 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.420
 gibson height is sure that you 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.250
 also arrive well at the music fair 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.810
 become 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.789
 Well, I think they are already 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.460
 special robot that kinda 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.259
 wilder comes so a bit edgy 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.020
 and angular and a bit dirty 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.060
 that, too, really fits the music 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.770
 and identify the people with those 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.420
 we had her first appearance on the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.420
 Great metal festival in Australia 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.970
 it will certainly fit in the 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.979
 frankfurt music fair 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.110
 probably also because the robot in contrast 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.130
 to musicians of flesh and blood he 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.680
 are easy to clean 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.810
 because that's where sex drugs and rock'n 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.090
 Rolling is more likely at the congress 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.090
 pragmatic machine oil and dry
