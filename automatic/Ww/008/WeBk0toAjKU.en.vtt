00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120 

I<00:00:05.540> think<00:00:06.540> well<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.319> need<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.529> improve<00:00:07.710> on<00:00:07.950> we

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
I think well we need to improve on we

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.379 
I think well we need to improve on we
need<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.309> improve<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.000> just<00:00:09.179> getting

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
need to improve on and just getting

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.790 
need to improve on and just getting
lined<00:00:09.540> up<00:00:09.690> too<00:00:09.840> fast<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.200> me<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.380> think<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.679> had

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
lined up too fast for me I think we had

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.110 
lined up too fast for me I think we had
some<00:00:10.950> mental<00:00:11.130> breakdowns<00:00:11.580> defensively

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
some mental breakdowns defensively

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.870 
some mental breakdowns defensively
offensively<00:00:13.250> we<00:00:14.250> did<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> lot<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.610> great<00:00:14.849> things

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
offensively we did a lot of great things

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.670 
offensively we did a lot of great things
today<00:00:15.269> our<00:00:15.450> play<00:00:15.599> action<00:00:15.780> was<00:00:16.109> really<00:00:16.529> nice

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
today our play action was really nice

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.620 
today our play action was really nice
but<00:00:17.609> if<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.820> still<00:00:18.029> need<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.330> better<00:00:18.480> at

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
but if we still need to get better at

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.990 
but if we still need to get better at
the<00:00:19.109> quarterback<00:00:19.380> position<00:00:19.730> we<00:00:20.730> need<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.910> get

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the quarterback position we need to get

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240 
the quarterback position we need to get
more<00:00:21.289> confidence<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.380> our<00:00:22.500> quarterbacks<00:00:22.980> but

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
more confidence in our quarterbacks but

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.220

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
