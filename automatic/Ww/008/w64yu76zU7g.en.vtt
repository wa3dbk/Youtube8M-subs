 we also give up the webcast 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.569

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.430
 a big blow in the scrotum changes 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.750

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.659
 creamery is the huge tv that will produce 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.250
 season 3 less budget and type of 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.170
 size more human and especially the whole 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.500

 she can not go out and see it 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.319
 you spin two minutes in the show 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:04:07.590

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:08.160

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.630

 the show is still 52 minutes 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.620
 weekly but each show 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.030
 welcomes a guest a small audience and 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.440
 just three columnists on the 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.810
 plateau but turns every time 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.370
 finally that turns each time more 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.680
 we welcome carroll who takes care of 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.780
 mangas and joe voiceover of season 2 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.340
 which includes the TV series section 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.990
 david preferring to focus only 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.180
 at the presentation of the show 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.860
 nico previously chronicler the story 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.750

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.550

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.870
 90 baptist foal previously well 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.280
 coiffé presents science fiction and 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.300
 scientifically demonstrates every 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.770
 cinema clichés 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.610
 as for me I present the heading that 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.450
 you are watching 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.450
 currently 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.410
 the mood of the show is a lot 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.070
 more relaxed than it's alive it's 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.870
 messy 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.630
 it's youpi but still professional 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.130
 and bam season 4 is the season 4 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.570
 it's you who will decide it will be done 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.130
 on more or less gay tv and the 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.900
 content will depend on your commitment 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.580
 this season 4 will be so much more 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.990
 interactive so you will have a lot more 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.260
 opportunities to make this show 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.360
 your show supported more or less 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.700
 skillful who supported more or less geek 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.230
 broth more or less geek who is 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:41.260
 so much supported him more or less 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.830
 geek years to those of more or less 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.900
 the excess is important do it 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.070
 now maybe lynch approaches me 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.420
 to support you 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.280
 it is no longer a single address the 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.450
 youtube channel of more or less geek tv 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.490
 so subscribe that if it's not 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.640
 still done and said if the kiss and good 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.640
