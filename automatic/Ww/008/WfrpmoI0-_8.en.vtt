 our question about the author means 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.690
 let's start the analysis 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.860
 we are very simple where possible mediator 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.430
 him fingers selected game me there 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.310
 then play 5 open string second 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 the side clamped on the first fret and then 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.500
 her 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 open and third string on the throne was 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.790
 show how it is played means so 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.790
 next play and feel on the ground 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.920
 fret then fourth string on 3 fret 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.360
 the third string is open and this is the third 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.200
 clamp the string in the morning hell 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.200
 show 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.310
 then play the open string oven 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.970
 4 on the third fret 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.680
 this country in the second year the city 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.520
 tom this fourth string open 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.390
 again in the second year 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.080
 and then goes to open the third and fourth 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.080
 together 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.290
 then comes the interesting part itself 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.319
 play and fifth string on 3 fret 4 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.420
 open 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.420
 then the same string on 2 fret clamp 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.090
 then open again 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.090
 and then comes the fifth string on 3 fret 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.310
 this is so on click on 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.209
 wire third string 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.160
 then on this hall one fourth string 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.160
 4 open and fifth string here this water 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
 together 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 further you do not clamp anything 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.590
 just the first second third fourth 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.350
 third string 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.810
 next you pinch the fourth fourth 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:04.150
 string on 2 frets here and so do not play 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.010
 too much as it is a bust 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.260
 five 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.620
 4 3 4 2 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.239
 4 3 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.239
 that's how it is played fast 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.840
 then you push the sixth string on 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:32.350
 first fret 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:36.490
 brute force 6 2 3 4 topics 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.800
 better pinky to heal on 3 young 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.220
 this sixth string game is exactly the same 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.220
 busting 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.710
 on this we finish our analysis 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.680
