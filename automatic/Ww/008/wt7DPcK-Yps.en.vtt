hey<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.570> Steve<00:00:01.079> with<00:00:01.319> synthetic<00:00:01.709> here<00:00:01.890> again

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hey guys Steve with synthetic here again

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey guys Steve with synthetic here again
um<00:00:02.460> today<00:00:02.850> I'm<00:00:03.120> doing<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.510> demo<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.380> kind<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
um today I'm doing a demo of kind of a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.980 
um today I'm doing a demo of kind of a
circumvented<00:00:05.970> project<00:00:06.420> that<00:00:06.509> I'm<00:00:06.600> doing<00:00:06.870> that

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
circumvented project that I'm doing that

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.860 
circumvented project that I'm doing that
that<00:00:07.350> basically<00:00:08.099> turns<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.719> these

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
that basically turns in one of these

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.629 
that basically turns in one of these
little<00:00:10.139> keyboards<00:00:10.650> you've<00:00:10.860> probably<00:00:11.190> seen

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
little keyboards you've probably seen

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.060 
little keyboards you've probably seen
many<00:00:11.880> times<00:00:12.240> at<00:00:12.809> restores<00:00:13.620> toy<00:00:14.130> stores<00:00:16.070> flea

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
many times at restores toy stores flea

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070 
many times at restores toy stores flea
markets<00:00:17.460> whatever<00:00:17.820> but<00:00:18.539> they're<00:00:18.750> kind<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> fun

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
markets whatever but they're kind of fun

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.200 
markets whatever but they're kind of fun
they<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> neat<00:00:19.800> little<00:00:19.890> bended<00:00:20.340> note<00:00:20.910> sound

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
they got a neat little bended note sound

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
they got a neat little bended note sound
to<00:00:21.449> them<00:00:21.630> anyway<00:00:22.289> we're<00:00:22.500> gonna<00:00:22.650> part<00:00:22.980> over

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to them anyway we're gonna part over

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800 
to them anyway we're gonna part over
here<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.519> come<00:00:23.640> take<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> look<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.600> what

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
here you can come take a look and what

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.259 
here you can come take a look and what
I've<00:00:24.960> done<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.580> I've<00:00:26.580> I've<00:00:27.570> made<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I've done is I've I've made it so so it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.330 
I've done is I've I've made it so so it
can<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:30.630> work<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.109> one<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.800> our<00:00:31.980> eight

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
can actually work with one of our eight

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.770 
can actually work with one of our eight
subsequent<00:00:33.030> or<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.239> any<00:00:33.329> sequencer

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
subsequent or with any sequencer

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.000 
subsequent or with any sequencer
actually<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> haven't<00:00:34.500> hooked<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> my

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
actually but I haven't hooked up to my

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.549 
actually but I haven't hooked up to my
eight<00:00:35.250> step<00:00:35.550> sequencer<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:37.440> I've

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
eight step sequencer here so what I've

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.479 
eight step sequencer here so what I've
done<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.850> taken<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.950> control<00:00:41.370> voltage

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
done is I have taken the control voltage

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
done is I have taken the control voltage
out<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.520> disconnected<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.590> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
out and I have disconnected the the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.660 
out and I have disconnected the the
power<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.800> power<00:00:49.950> cables<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.399> go<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
power the the power cables I go to the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180 
power the the power cables I go to the
battery<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.680> chassis

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
battery here from the chassis

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
battery here from the chassis
and<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.510> I've<00:00:54.629> done<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.960> found<00:00:55.320> those

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and and what I've done is I found those

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560 
and and what I've done is I found those
two<00:00:55.800> places<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.730> I've<00:00:57.180> actually<00:00:57.360> put

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
two places there and I've actually put

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.569 
two places there and I've actually put
my<00:00:57.690> control<00:00:58.140> voltage<00:00:58.590> into<00:00:59.190> where<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> power

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
my control voltage into where the power

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.790 
my control voltage into where the power
is<00:00:59.730> there's<00:01:00.270> only<00:01:00.420> uh<00:01:00.629> there's<00:01:01.590> only<00:01:01.620> about

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
is there's only uh there's only about

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
is there's only uh there's only about
three<00:01:01.890> volts<00:01:02.399> coming<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
three volts coming into this thing and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.850 
three volts coming into this thing and
this<00:01:03.359> thing<00:01:03.420> got<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.320> than<00:01:04.470> three

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this thing got a little more than three

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
this thing got a little more than three
or<00:01:05.369> right<00:01:05.580> around<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:06.090> there's<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
or right around there there's a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.390 
or right around there there's a
variation<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> voltage<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> control

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
variation of the voltage of the control

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
variation of the voltage of the control
voltage<00:01:08.490> obviously<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> ends<00:01:10.740> up

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
voltage obviously and so what it ends up

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.420 
voltage obviously and so what it ends up
doing<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.280> ends<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.700> giving<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.299> little

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
doing is ends up giving me a little

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.649 
doing is ends up giving me a little
synthesizer<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.420> sequence

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
synthesizer that I can actually sequence

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.920 
synthesizer that I can actually sequence
which<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> cool<00:01:16.560> um<00:01:17.570> what<00:01:18.570> I've<00:01:18.659> done

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
which is kind of cool um what I've done

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
which is kind of cool um what I've done
too<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:19.860> happens<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.369> like

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
too is that there happens to be like

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690 
too is that there happens to be like
right<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.009> open<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.490> maybe

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
right here if you if you open up maybe

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.950 
right here if you if you open up maybe
yours<00:01:23.970> whatever<00:01:24.180> there's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> little

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
yours whatever there's a little

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.480 
yours whatever there's a little
capacitor<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:25.979> next<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
capacitor right here next to this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.300 
capacitor right here next to this
transistor<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.240> some<00:01:27.420> sort<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.189> what<00:01:29.189> I've

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
transistor of some sort and what I've

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.749 
transistor of some sort and what I've
found<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> when<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> take<00:01:31.430> some<00:01:32.430> leads

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
found is that when I take some leads

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.319 
found is that when I take some leads
from<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.840> particular<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:36.180> particular

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
from that particular that particular

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.179 
from that particular that particular
capacitor<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:38.009> touch<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
capacitor and I touch it to the the the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
capacitor and I touch it to the the the
non-powered<00:01:41.970> lead<00:01:42.270> whatever<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.810> leading<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
non-powered lead whatever is leading to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
non-powered lead whatever is leading to
this<00:01:43.380> chip<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.890> these<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.790> feed

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
this chip here these little you feed

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.870 
this chip here these little you feed
chips<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.450> blow<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.930> easily

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
chips that you can blow up really easily

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
chips that you can blow up really easily
soldered<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> basically<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
soldered on there and basically it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
soldered on there and basically it
drones<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.909> sound

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
drones that sound

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.850 
drones that sound
and<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.590> sequencer<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.750> only

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
and because the sequencer is only

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.020 
and because the sequencer is only
kicking<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:55.950> voltage<00:01:56.430> at<00:01:56.670> particular

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
kicking out voltage at particular

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.760 
kicking out voltage at particular
intervals<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.930> only<00:01:58.049> kind<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> turning<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
intervals it's only kind of turning it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
intervals it's only kind of turning it
on<00:01:58.829> I've<00:01:59.399> got<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> couple<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.479> them<00:02:00.600> hooked<00:02:00.840> up

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
on I've got a couple of them hooked up

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.359 
on I've got a couple of them hooked up
to<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.170> same<00:02:01.380> capacitor<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:02.189> there's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to that same capacitor and then there's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.090 
to that same capacitor and then there's
also<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.759> connection<00:02:03.180> over<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> this

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
also this connection over here to this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.260 
also this connection over here to this
resistor<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.490> really<00:02:05.670> know<00:02:05.850> what

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
resistor that I don't really know what

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.429 
resistor that I don't really know what
it<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.479> I've<00:02:06.659> done<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> lot<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.990> research<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
it is I've done a lot of research on the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.320 
it is I've done a lot of research on the
circuit<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> allows<00:02:08.819> me<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.300> is

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
circuit but what that allows me to do is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.110 
circuit but what that allows me to do is
I've<00:02:10.110> also<00:02:10.259> moved<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> another<00:02:10.770> one<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.190> I've

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
I've also moved to another one so I've

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
I've also moved to another one so I've
got<00:02:12.390> three<00:02:12.840> different<00:02:12.870> contact

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
got three different contact

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
got three different contact
connected<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.910> kind<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.150> gives<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.720> like

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
connected and it kind of gives this like

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.410 
connected and it kind of gives this like
kind<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.500> oscillated<00:02:17.190> weird<00:02:17.790> sound<00:02:18.240> or

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
kind of oscillated weird sound or

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.900 
kind of oscillated weird sound or
whatever<00:02:18.540> um<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.380> also<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.860> put<00:02:20.010> back<00:02:20.250> I'm

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
whatever um you also can put back I'm

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.070 
whatever um you also can put back I'm
gonna<00:02:21.030> put<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.300> back<00:02:21.360> together<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.750> I'll<00:02:21.900> show

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
gonna put it back together and I'll show

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.960 
gonna put it back together and I'll show
it<00:02:22.110> looks<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.740> put<00:02:22.890> back<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.460> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it looks like we can put back on the the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.540 
it looks like we can put back on the the
touch<00:02:24.510> strip<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:25.560> each<00:02:25.680> key<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.340> what

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
touch strip here for each key and what

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.210 
touch strip here for each key and what
will<00:02:26.700> happen<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.510> it'll<00:02:28.200> also<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.770> make<00:02:29.040> some

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
will happen is it'll also like make some

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.650 
will happen is it'll also like make some
weird<00:02:29.340> noises<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.180> these<00:02:30.300> ones<00:02:30.480> that'll

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
weird noises and on these ones that'll

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.810 
weird noises and on these ones that'll
cancel<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.380> if<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.860> actually<00:02:32.010> hit<00:02:32.520> them<00:02:32.670> down

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
cancel out if you actually hit them down

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.640 
cancel out if you actually hit them down
so<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.660> actually<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:33.990> some<00:02:34.140> live<00:02:34.350> crap

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so you can actually do some live crap

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.890 
so you can actually do some live crap
I'm<00:02:35.340> sure<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.910> hook<00:02:36.060> up<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> lot<00:02:36.480> more<00:02:36.780> of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
I'm sure you can hook up a lot more of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.210 
I'm sure you can hook up a lot more of
them<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.170> may<00:02:37.290> even<00:02:37.530> make<00:02:37.650> your<00:02:37.830> own<00:02:37.980> weird

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
them and may even make your own weird

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.010 
them and may even make your own weird
thing<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.940> next<00:02:39.210> model<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.570> I'm<00:02:39.660> gonna<00:02:39.750> do

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
thing the next model that I'm gonna do

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.270 
thing the next model that I'm gonna do
on<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.380> video<00:02:40.560> after<00:02:40.830> I've<00:02:41.010> been<00:02:41.040> showing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
on this video after I've been showing

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.310 
on this video after I've been showing
you<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.670> I'm<00:02:41.760> actually<00:02:41.850> gonna<00:02:42.090> put<00:02:42.390> an<00:02:43.110> 8

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
you this is I'm actually gonna put an 8

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.560 
you this is I'm actually gonna put an 8
inch<00:02:43.560> audio<00:02:44.070> jack<00:02:44.490> out<00:02:44.670> instead<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.270> using<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
inch audio jack out instead of using the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.990 
inch audio jack out instead of using the
speaker<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.370> hook<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.970> my

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
speaker so that I can hook it up to my

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 
speaker so that I can hook it up to my
other<00:02:48.209> gear<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.780> use<00:02:49.350> other<00:02:49.470> effects<00:02:49.830> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
other gear and use other effects and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.740 
other gear and use other effects and
things<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.580> well<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.000> it'll<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.600> kind

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
things with it as well so it'll be kind

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.910 
things with it as well so it'll be kind
of<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.840> neat<00:02:51.989> little<00:02:52.020> synth<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.560> work<00:02:52.709> with

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
of a neat little synth to work with

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.590 
of a neat little synth to work with
these<00:02:53.430> things<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.730> cheap<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.180> probably

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
these things are cheap but probably

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.050 
these things are cheap but probably
everywhere<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.459> think<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.730> got<00:02:56.820> mine<00:02:56.970> for

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
everywhere so I think I got mine for

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.130 
everywhere so I think I got mine for
like<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.239> buck<00:02:57.450> anyway

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
like a buck anyway

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:09.110 
like a buck anyway
fun<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:59.100> here's<00:02:59.310> how<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.520> sounds<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:09.000> not

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
fun but here's how it sounds it's not

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.710 
fun but here's how it sounds it's not
super<00:03:09.360> loud<00:03:09.480> right<00:03:09.660> yet<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.270> turn<00:03:12.450> up<00:03:12.570> turn

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
super loud right yet but it turn up turn

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.350 
super loud right yet but it turn up turn
up<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:12.989> go<00:03:13.080> over<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> my<00:03:13.530> sequencer<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
up and go over here to my sequencer and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:26.330 
up and go over here to my sequencer and
increase<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.450> tempo<00:03:15.750> okay<00:03:24.920> I'm<00:03:25.920> finally

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
increase the tempo okay I'm finally

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.210 
increase the tempo okay I'm finally
soldered<00:03:27.080> all<00:03:28.080> my<00:03:28.260> little<00:03:28.410> modifications

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
soldered all my little modifications

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.840 
soldered all my little modifications
here<00:03:29.580> too<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.739> why<00:03:34.980> come<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.280> take<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.489> look<00:03:35.519> I've

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
here too so why come in take a look I've

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.140 
here too so why come in take a look I've
done<00:03:36.030> quite<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> few<00:03:36.330> things<00:03:36.510> here<00:03:36.959> actually

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
done quite a few things here actually

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.759 
done quite a few things here actually
what<00:03:39.150> first<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.540> all<00:03:39.660> what<00:03:39.810> I've<00:03:39.930> done<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.560> I

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
what first of all what I've done is I

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.039 
what first of all what I've done is I
have<00:03:41.489> because<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.269> detach<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.810> power

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
have because I detach the power

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.590 
have because I detach the power
essentially<00:03:43.980> from<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.880> battery<00:03:45.299> source

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
essentially from the battery source

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.280 
essentially from the battery source
really<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.650> only<00:03:46.980> power<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.489> this

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
really the only power that this

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.530 
really the only power that this
synthesizer<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.500> now<00:03:49.620> gonna<00:03:49.830> get<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:51.000> gonna<00:03:51.330> be

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
synthesizer is now gonna get is gonna be

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.259 
synthesizer is now gonna get is gonna be
from<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.680> 8<00:03:53.010> step<00:03:53.340> sequencer<00:03:53.820> or<00:03:53.910> any<00:03:54.060> kind<00:03:54.239> of

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
from the 8 step sequencer or any kind of

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.520 
from the 8 step sequencer or any kind of
sequencer<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.690> get<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.080> running<00:03:55.230> off

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
sequencer you get so it's running off

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.530 
sequencer you get so it's running off
the<00:03:55.799> voltage<00:03:56.190> coming<00:03:56.519> in<00:03:56.610> there<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.299> what<00:03:57.450> I've

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
the voltage coming in there so what I've

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.340 
the voltage coming in there so what I've
done<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.810> I've<00:03:58.320> connected<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:59.180> cord<00:04:00.180> up<00:04:00.870> here

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
done is I've connected a cord up here

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.070 
done is I've connected a cord up here
that<00:04:01.650> takes<00:04:02.190> my<00:04:02.670> control<00:04:03.209> voltage<00:04:03.570> out<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.900> my

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
that takes my control voltage out of my

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.680 
that takes my control voltage out of my
sequencer<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:04.920> runs<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.360> basically

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
sequencer here runs in and basically

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.729 
sequencer here runs in and basically
this<00:04:06.989> just<00:04:07.100> operates<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.730> same<00:04:09.320> black<00:04:10.320> and

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
this just operates on the same black and

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.539 
this just operates on the same black and
white<00:04:11.220> or<00:04:11.549> black<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.000> red<00:04:12.989> power<00:04:13.950> wires<00:04:14.250> that

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
white or black and red power wires that

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.340 
white or black and red power wires that
were<00:04:14.670> going<00:04:14.880> off<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.510> battery<00:04:15.810> jack<00:04:16.079> so

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
were going off to the battery jack so

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.050 
were going off to the battery jack so
basically<00:04:17.000> I'm<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:18.470> bypassing<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.620> with

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
basically I'm just bypassing that with

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.909 
basically I'm just bypassing that with
the<00:04:21.060> control<00:04:21.450> voltage<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:22.500> second<00:04:22.770> thing

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
the control voltage the second thing

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.010 
the control voltage the second thing
I've<00:04:23.099> done<00:04:23.250> here<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.820> I've<00:04:24.180> bypassed<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
I've done here is I've bypassed the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.190 
I've done here is I've bypassed the
speaker<00:04:25.410> here<00:04:25.710> by

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
speaker here by

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.330 
speaker here by
putting<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.740> jack<00:04:28.630> or<00:04:29.630> plug<00:04:29.960> excuse<00:04:30.290> me<00:04:30.440> here

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
putting in a jack or plug excuse me here

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.970 
putting in a jack or plug excuse me here
that<00:04:31.550> allows<00:04:32.120> me<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.390> bring<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:33.560> out<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.710> my

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
that allows me to bring it out to my

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.480 
that allows me to bring it out to my
amplifier<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:34.670> this<00:04:34.880> case<00:04:35.090> my<00:04:35.300> PD<00:04:35.690> rage<00:04:36.490> what

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
amplifier in this case my PD rage what

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.150 
amplifier in this case my PD rage what
I've<00:04:37.580> also<00:04:37.730> done<00:04:37.940> here<00:04:38.450> is<00:04:38.630> I've<00:04:38.870> added<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.320> 4.7

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
I've also done here is I've added a 4.7

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.390 
I've also done here is I've added a 4.7
micro<00:04:40.790> farad<00:04:41.150> capacitor<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:42.620> will<00:04:42.830> go

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
micro farad capacitor that will go

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.150 
micro farad capacitor that will go
that's<00:04:43.580> switched<00:04:43.970> in<00:04:44.600> line<00:04:45.020> here<00:04:45.830> with<00:04:46.010> this

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
that's switched in line here with this

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.980 
that's switched in line here with this
little<00:04:46.310> capacitor<00:04:46.940> right<00:04:47.120> here<00:04:47.450> hopefully

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
little capacitor right here hopefully

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.330 
little capacitor right here hopefully
you<00:04:48.050> can<00:04:48.140> check<00:04:48.350> that<00:04:48.380> little<00:04:48.770> capacitor<00:04:49.190> out

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
you can check that little capacitor out

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.040 
you can check that little capacitor out
here<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.530> I've<00:04:51.530> I've<00:04:52.370> I've<00:04:52.730> added<00:04:53.240> basically

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
here and I've I've I've added basically

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.950 
here and I've I've I've added basically
in<00:04:54.230> parallel<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:56.090> capacitor<00:04:56.750> this

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
in parallel to that capacitor this

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.720 
in parallel to that capacitor this
capacitor<00:04:57.590> on<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.800> switch<00:04:58.130> it<00:04:58.340> just<00:04:58.490> gives<00:04:58.670> a

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
capacitor on a switch it just gives a

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.280 
capacitor on a switch it just gives a
little<00:04:58.850> bit<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.060> different<00:04:59.360> sounds<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.840> then

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
little bit of different sounds and then

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.860 
little bit of different sounds and then
also<00:05:00.470> what<00:05:00.770> I've<00:05:00.860> done<00:05:01.100> is<00:05:01.670> in<00:05:01.970> I've<00:05:02.690> also

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
also what I've done is in I've also

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.790 
also what I've done is in I've also
added<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.470> switch<00:05:03.800> here<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.670> basically<00:05:05.800> just

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
added a switch here that basically just

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.700 
added a switch here that basically just
kind<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.580> shorts<00:05:07.940> out<00:05:08.090> that<00:05:08.600> resistor<00:05:09.500> there

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
kind of shorts out that resistor there

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.260 
kind of shorts out that resistor there
and<00:05:09.920> that<00:05:10.220> also<00:05:10.400> offers<00:05:10.850> a<00:05:10.910> different<00:05:11.000> sound

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
and that also offers a different sound

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.200 
and that also offers a different sound
I've<00:05:11.720> also<00:05:11.930> added<00:05:12.230> a<00:05:12.440> switch<00:05:12.860> for<00:05:13.610> gonna<00:05:14.120> be

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
I've also added a switch for gonna be

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.020 
I've also added a switch for gonna be
power<00:05:14.420> on<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.080> power<00:05:15.110> off<00:05:15.890> what<00:05:16.640> that<00:05:16.820> really

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
power on and power off what that really

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.790 
power on and power off what that really
allows<00:05:17.300> me<00:05:17.510> to<00:05:17.570> do<00:05:17.720> though<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:18.110> it<00:05:18.200> allows<00:05:18.470> me

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
allows me to do though is it allows me

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.820 
allows me to do though is it allows me
to<00:05:18.980> kind<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.280> do<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:19.970> like<00:05:20.420> dump<00:05:20.810> sound<00:05:21.260> and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
to kind of do this like dump sound and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.900 
to kind of do this like dump sound and
I'll<00:05:21.920> show<00:05:22.070> you<00:05:22.100> what<00:05:22.220> that<00:05:22.370> sounds<00:05:22.400> like<00:05:22.700> but

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
I'll show you what that sounds like but

00:05:22.910 --> 00:06:03.120 
I'll show you what that sounds like but
it<00:05:23.000> also<00:05:23.120> can<00:05:23.720> power<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.050> on<00:05:24.140> and<00:05:24.200> power<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.620> off

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:13.440 

on

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.460 

all<00:06:14.450> right<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:14.810> this<00:06:14.900> is<00:06:14.960> got<00:06:15.140> my<00:06:15.230> final

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
all right so this is got my final

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.890 
all right so this is got my final
version<00:06:15.980> of<00:06:16.100> my<00:06:16.430> music<00:06:16.850> maker<00:06:17.120> keyboard<00:06:17.630> like

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
version of my music maker keyboard like

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.090 
version of my music maker keyboard like
I<00:06:18.020> said<00:06:18.200> there's<00:06:18.350> plenty<00:06:18.410> of<00:06:18.710> these<00:06:18.860> little

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
I said there's plenty of these little

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.090 
I said there's plenty of these little
things<00:06:19.250> out<00:06:19.400> there<00:06:19.670> easy<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.450> find<00:06:20.740> I've<00:06:21.740> made

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
things out there easy to find I've made

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.980 
things out there easy to find I've made
this<00:06:22.280> so<00:06:22.550> can<00:06:22.760> actually<00:06:23.090> work<00:06:23.330> with<00:06:23.360> a

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
this so can actually work with a

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.760 
this so can actually work with a
sequencer<00:06:24.800> it's<00:06:25.730> I<00:06:25.940> would<00:06:26.060> say<00:06:26.180> circuit<00:06:26.570> bent

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
sequencer it's I would say circuit bent

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.620 
sequencer it's I would say circuit bent
obviously<00:06:27.770> a<00:06:27.800> bit<00:06:28.040> but<00:06:28.280> it's<00:06:28.400> not<00:06:28.630> necessarily

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
obviously a bit but it's not necessarily

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.090 
obviously a bit but it's not necessarily
just<00:06:29.930> kind<00:06:30.080> of<00:06:30.140> tweaked<00:06:30.380> to<00:06:30.530> mess<00:06:30.770> around<00:06:30.890> with

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
just kind of tweaked to mess around with

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.980 
just kind of tweaked to mess around with
normal<00:06:31.490> bolt<00:06:31.640> the<00:06:31.730> door<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:31.970> play<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.360> keys<00:06:32.660> so

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
normal bolt the door to play the keys so
