 week one of the most important fairs 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.920

 editorial circuits open 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.820

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.800
 that the publishing world has either the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.840
 literature either in scientific subjects 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.670
