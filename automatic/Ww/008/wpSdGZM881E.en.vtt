00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.800
For sufficient air, clean water,
and rich nutrients,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.400
a plant’s root continues
to grow and reach out.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:29.133
Roots can extend
as far as one meter underground,

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.600
paving new paths as they go along.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.266
When a root reaches a suitable spot,

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:50.400
it begins to grow root hair
to interact with its surroundings.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:55.900
Through these dense and delicate hair strands
do water and nutrients move.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.566
Thanks to these roots,

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.533
a new environment is formed
for the microbes living underground.

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:30.066
The water pumped up by roots
combines with air and sunlight

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.600
in the chlorophyll to create sugar.

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:39.400
A part of the sugar thus created
is sent back down to the roots.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.633
About one-half of the sugar
created by photosynthesis

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.000
is released into the soil
through the tips of the roots.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.266
Innumerable microbes flock
to the roots to get this sugar.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.800
Bound to a dark underground
world all life long,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.500
microbes meet sunlight
through the plants’ roots.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:23.800
In turn, microbes provide the roots
with over two dozen inorganic nutrients.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.133
The sphere of a root’s influence
is the number of microbes it attracts.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:40.533
Hardly any microbes are seen
in barren areas devoid of plants.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.433
Plants and microbes live
as if they were one.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.166
One of such microbes,
taking the form of a bead,

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.800
is a fungus named Mycorrhiza.
