this<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.210> still<00:04:56.419> pretty<00:04:56.450> big<00:04:57.430> as<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:58.610> can<00:04:58.729> see

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
this is still pretty big as you can see

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.029 
this is still pretty big as you can see
me<00:04:59.090> holding<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.750> slightly<00:05:00.410> less<00:05:00.680> than<00:05:00.710> 20

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
this one this connects to the USB mode

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.230 
this one this connects to the USB mode
USB<00:06:07.560> sorry<00:06:07.860> a<00:06:07.920> special<00:06:08.340> connect<00:06:08.640> port<00:06:08.940> on<00:06:09.150> the

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
USB sorry a special connect port on the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.230 
USB sorry a special connect port on the
back<00:06:09.390> of<00:06:09.450> the<00:06:09.630> unit<00:06:09.930> yeah<00:06:10.890> this<00:06:11.240> particular

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
back of the unit yeah this particular

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.850 
back of the unit yeah this particular
model<00:06:13.050> is<00:06:13.350> different<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.640> what<00:06:15.060> you'll<00:06:15.300> get<00:06:15.510> I

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
model is different to what you'll get I

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.680 
model is different to what you'll get I
think<00:06:16.860> if<00:06:17.100> you're<00:06:17.490> getting<00:06:18.120> it<00:06:18.210> separately

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
think if you're getting it separately

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.290 
think if you're getting it separately
and<00:06:19.190> that<00:06:20.190> one<00:06:20.400> will<00:06:20.610> come<00:06:20.850> with<00:06:21.090> another

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
and that one will come with another

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.110 
and that one will come with another
cable<00:06:21.840> for<00:06:22.080> power<00:06:22.440> I<00:06:22.800> think<00:06:23.100> you<00:06:23.730> don't<00:06:23.850> need

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
cable for power I think you don't need

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.800 
cable for power I think you don't need
let's<00:06:24.510> extract<00:06:25.230> pop<00:06:26.010> cable<00:06:26.490> power<00:06:26.700> for<00:06:27.120> power

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
let's extract pop cable power for power

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.590 
let's extract pop cable power for power
cable<00:06:28.140> sorry<00:06:28.350> so<00:06:29.070> if<00:06:29.370> you're<00:06:29.640> if<00:06:30.060> you<00:06:30.240> have<00:06:30.420> the

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
cable sorry so if you're if you have the

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.600 
cable sorry so if you're if you have the
new<00:06:30.720> Xbox<00:06:31.170> like<00:06:31.380> I<00:06:31.530> do<00:06:31.590> but<00:06:31.920> if<00:06:32.130> you<00:06:32.250> have<00:06:32.280> the

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
new Xbox like I do but if you have the

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.360 
new Xbox like I do but if you have the
old<00:06:32.790> one<00:06:33.260> you<00:06:34.260> actually<00:06:34.650> need<00:06:34.800> to<00:06:34.830> use<00:06:35.040> a<00:06:35.070> USB

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
old one you actually need to use a USB

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.360 
old one you actually need to use a USB
cable<00:06:36.000> I<00:06:36.330> think<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:36.900> connect<00:06:37.440> to<00:06:37.530> your<00:06:37.650> old

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
cable I think to connect to your old

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.640 
cable I think to connect to your old
Xbox<00:06:38.790> and<00:06:38.940> then<00:06:39.150> a<00:06:39.180> separate<00:06:39.570> cable<00:06:39.780> for<00:06:40.560> the

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
Xbox and then a separate cable for the

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.190 
Xbox and then a separate cable for the
power<00:06:40.830> this<00:06:41.580> one<00:06:41.760> does<00:06:41.940> both<00:06:42.180> data<00:06:42.660> and<00:06:42.960> power

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
power this one does both data and power

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.360 
power this one does both data and power
so<00:06:44.190> there<00:06:44.430> has<00:06:44.550> been<00:06:44.580> a<00:06:44.820> quick<00:06:45.420> look<00:06:45.630> on<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:46.370> on
