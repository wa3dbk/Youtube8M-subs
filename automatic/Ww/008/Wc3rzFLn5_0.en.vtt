MacBook Air and to discuss what might be

MacBook Air and to discuss what might be
better<00:00:37.660> for<00:00:37.870> your<00:00:37.989> needs<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.530> why<00:00:38.860> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
better for your needs and why the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.220 
better for your needs and why the
MacBook<00:00:39.489> Air<00:00:39.700> is<00:00:39.760> more<00:00:40.149> premium<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:40.840> costs

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
MacBook Air is more premium and costs
more

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.610 

first<00:00:46.480> let's<00:00:46.750> look<00:00:46.900> at<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.110> design<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.440> little

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
first let's look at the design a little

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.540 
first let's look at the design a little
bit<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:48.090> some<00:00:49.090> might<00:00:49.300> accuse<00:00:49.630> Sony<00:00:50.470> of<00:00:50.740> making

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
bit and some might accuse Sony of making

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.120 
bit and some might accuse Sony of making
a<00:00:51.670> macbook<00:00:52.120> air<00:00:52.300> knockoff<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:54.010> can

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
a macbook air knockoff and you can

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.040 
a macbook air knockoff and you can
probably<00:00:54.340> see<00:00:54.580> why<00:00:54.820> because<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.330> coloration

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
probably see why because the coloration

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.650 
probably see why because the coloration
is<00:00:56.230> almost<00:00:56.590> exactly<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.430> same<00:00:57.700> when<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.510> have

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
is almost exactly the same when you have

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.799 
is almost exactly the same when you have
silver<00:00:59.020> on<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.350> biote<00:00:59.830> and<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.239> shape<00:01:01.540> and

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
silver on the biote and the shape and

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.600 
silver on the biote and the shape and
just<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.080> overall<00:01:02.379> form<00:01:02.680> factor<00:01:03.100> is<00:01:03.129> kind<00:01:03.520> of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
just the overall form factor is kind of

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.850 
just the overall form factor is kind of
a<00:01:03.700> copy<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.960> chiclet<00:01:05.350> style<00:01:05.379> keyboard

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
a copy the chiclet style keyboard

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.830 
a copy the chiclet style keyboard
although<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.790> see<00:01:07.120> that<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.360> every<00:01:07.630> laptop

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
although you see that on every laptop

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.990 
although you see that on every laptop
today<00:01:08.410> this<00:01:08.680> further<00:01:09.190> just<00:01:09.550> makes<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.850> look

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
today this further just makes it look

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.390 
today this further just makes it look
like<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.300> MacBook<00:01:10.720> Air<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.140> one<00:01:11.680> thing<00:01:11.920> sony

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
like the MacBook Air and one thing sony

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.700 
like the MacBook Air and one thing sony
didn't<00:01:12.700> copy<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.210> they<00:01:13.930> don't<00:01:14.080> have<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.320> giant

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
didn't copy is they don't have a giant

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.310 
didn't copy is they don't have a giant
touchpad<00:01:15.220> like<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.940> MacBook<00:01:16.180> Air<00:01:16.540> it's<00:01:17.080> just

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
touchpad like the MacBook Air it's just

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.770 
touchpad like the MacBook Air it's just
kind<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.680> small<00:01:18.490> size<00:01:18.790> filter<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.750> that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
kind of a small size filter to that

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.389 
kind of a small size filter to that
touchpad<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.270> VOT<00:01:22.840> as<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.530> says<00:01:23.710> here<00:01:23.740> uses<00:01:24.280> an

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
touchpad the VOT as it says here uses an

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.020 
touchpad the VOT as it says here uses an
aluminum<00:01:24.640> clad<00:01:25.119> body<00:01:26.070> which<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.460> MacBook<00:01:27.880> Air

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
aluminum clad body which the MacBook Air

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.850 
aluminum clad body which the MacBook Air
also<00:01:28.420> does<00:01:28.600> however<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.080> MacBook<00:01:29.440> Air<00:01:29.619> is<00:01:29.680> a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
also does however the MacBook Air is a

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.790 
also does however the MacBook Air is a
more<00:01:30.820> premium<00:01:31.090> it's<00:01:32.020> hard<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.380> see<00:01:32.590> but

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
more premium it's hard to see but

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.940 
more premium it's hard to see but
unibody<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.390> it's<00:01:34.570> all<00:01:34.750> just<00:01:35.110> out<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.410> one<00:01:35.590> case

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
unibody so it's all just out of one case

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.900 
unibody so it's all just out of one case
whereas<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:37.509> VAIO<00:01:37.810> t<00:01:38.259> you'll<00:01:39.130> see<00:01:39.430> here<00:01:39.670> has

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
whereas the VAIO t you'll see here has

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.420 
whereas the VAIO t you'll see here has
has<00:01:40.840> separate<00:01:41.170> parts<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.800> actually<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.160> think

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
has separate parts and actually I think

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.609 
has separate parts and actually I think
on<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.640> side<00:01:42.910> here<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:44.020> feels<00:01:44.259> like<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.500> might

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
on the side here it feels like it might

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.230 
on the side here it feels like it might
be<00:01:44.740> plastic<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.520> that's<00:01:45.700> not<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.060> much

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
be plastic and that's not so much

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.880 
be plastic and that's not so much
aluminum<00:01:46.690> but<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.869> do<00:01:46.990> get<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.170> lemon<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.500> here

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
aluminum but you do get a lemon on here

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.779 
aluminum but you do get a lemon on here
and<00:01:48.070> on<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.390> lid<00:01:49.600> area<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.560> on<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.979> lid<00:01:51.610> of<00:01:51.729> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
and on the lid area so on the lid of the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.669 
and on the lid area so on the lid of the
biote<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.569> get<00:01:52.750> kind<00:01:52.959> of<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.140> hairline

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
biote you get kind of this hairline

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.100 
biote you get kind of this hairline
brush<00:01:54.069> metal<00:01:54.429> finish<00:01:54.789> on<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.979> MacBook<00:01:57.190> Air

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
brush metal finish on the MacBook Air

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.930 
brush metal finish on the MacBook Air
it's<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.200> more<00:01:59.410> industrial<00:01:59.679> with<00:02:00.250> just

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
it's a more industrial with just

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.150 
it's a more industrial with just
aluminum<00:02:01.360> finish<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:01.899> there's<00:02:02.110> no<00:02:02.259> hair<00:02:02.920> lines

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
aluminum finish so there's no hair lines

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.779 
aluminum finish so there's no hair lines
or<00:02:03.369> anything<00:02:03.580> like<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.250> put<00:02:06.429> these<00:02:06.550> next

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
or anything like that so put these next

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.400 
or anything like that so put these next
to<00:02:06.850> each<00:02:06.910> other<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.209> see<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.479> get<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.630> bio<00:02:07.899> logo

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
to each other you see you get a bio logo

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.169 
to each other you see you get a bio logo
with<00:02:08.560> some<00:02:08.709> chrome<00:02:08.920> accents<00:02:09.490> there<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:09.940> the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
with some chrome accents there on the

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.570 
with some chrome accents there on the
Sony<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.750> then<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.680> MacBook<00:02:12.069> Air<00:02:12.220> just<00:02:12.459> has

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
Sony and then the MacBook Air just has

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.059 
Sony and then the MacBook Air just has
the<00:02:12.790> Apple<00:02:13.450> logo<00:02:13.630> which<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:13.990> very<00:02:14.319> iconic<00:02:14.770> and

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
the Apple logo which is very iconic and

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.460 
the Apple logo which is very iconic and
just<00:02:15.490> about<00:02:15.670> anyone<00:02:15.910> recognized<00:02:16.599> it's<00:02:17.349> been

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
just about anyone recognized it's been

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.580 
just about anyone recognized it's been
raw<00:02:17.650> both<00:02:17.950> are<00:02:18.130> nicely<00:02:18.340> designed<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.599> think

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
raw both are nicely designed but I think

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.620 
raw both are nicely designed but I think
that<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.950> MacBook<00:02:21.520> Air<00:02:21.700> overall<00:02:22.209> looks<00:02:22.450> much

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
that the MacBook Air overall looks much

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.120 
that the MacBook Air overall looks much
cleaner<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.170> just<00:02:23.380> with<00:02:23.620> its<00:02:23.800> overall

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
cleaner and just with its overall

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.360 
cleaner and just with its overall
thinner<00:02:25.120> profile<00:02:25.840> than<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.349> biote<00:02:27.099> as<00:02:27.160> you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
thinner profile than the biote as you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.699 
thinner profile than the biote as you
can<00:02:27.520> see<00:02:27.760> here<00:02:28.150> it's<00:02:28.959> going<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.319> look<00:02:29.440> more

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
can see here it's going to look more

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.900 
can see here it's going to look more
sleek

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.220 

let's<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.060> look<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.360> port<00:02:37.630> selection<00:02:37.960> on

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
let's just look at the port selection on

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.070 
let's just look at the port selection on
both<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.620> these<00:02:38.770> laptops<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.600> MacBook<00:02:40.930> Air

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
both of these laptops so the MacBook Air

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.020 
both of these laptops so the MacBook Air
is<00:02:41.230> much<00:02:41.500> thinner<00:02:41.830> than<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.250> biote<00:02:42.730> as<00:02:42.880> you

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
is much thinner than the biote as you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.870 
is much thinner than the biote as you
can<00:02:43.210> see<00:02:43.420> from<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.840> profile<00:02:44.350> shot<00:02:44.620> here<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
can see from this profile shot here the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.940 
can see from this profile shot here the
MacBook<00:02:46.300> Air<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.540> thickest<00:02:47.500> point<00:02:47.710> is<00:02:47.800> around

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
MacBook Air is thickest point is around

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.660 
MacBook Air is thickest point is around
0.16<00:02:48.760> inches<00:02:49.120> whereas<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> biote<00:02:50.670> encroaches

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
0.16 inches whereas the biote encroaches

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.930 
0.16 inches whereas the biote encroaches
upon<00:02:51.700> probably<00:02:52.540> about<00:02:52.660> 0.9<00:02:53.560> maybe<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.760> under

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
upon probably about 0.9 maybe just under

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.570 
upon probably about 0.9 maybe just under
that<00:02:55.210> inches<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:55.870> at<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.320> back<00:02:56.470> there<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:57.010> you

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
that inches on at the back there so you

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.090 
that inches on at the back there so you
can<00:02:57.880> fit<00:02:58.000> more<00:02:58.150> ports<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.720> biote<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.980> on

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
can fit more ports on the biote so on

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.410 
can fit more ports on the biote so on
the<00:03:00.190> MacBook<00:03:00.370> Air<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.910> left<00:03:01.090> side<00:03:01.240> we<00:03:01.390> just

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
USB 3.0 and then a thunderbolt port so

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.380 
USB 3.0 and then a thunderbolt port so
you<00:03:35.620> do<00:03:35.890> have<00:03:36.100> more<00:03:36.310> port<00:03:36.880> suctions<00:03:37.210> on<00:03:37.270> the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
you do have more port suctions on the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.840 
you do have more port suctions on the
biote<00:03:37.870> because<00:03:38.770> it<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.010> thicker<00:03:39.280> but<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
biote because it is thicker but the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.479 
biote because it is thicker but the
thunderbolt<00:03:40.300> port<00:03:40.660> on<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.560> MacBook<00:03:41.950> Air<00:03:42.310> is

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
thunderbolt port on the MacBook Air is

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.330 
thunderbolt port on the MacBook Air is
really<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:43.180> nice<00:03:43.989> port<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.440> have<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.830> allows<00:03:45.100> for

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
really a nice port to have it allows for

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.820 
really a nice port to have it allows for
extremely<00:03:45.520> fast<00:03:46.090> file<00:03:46.750> transfers<00:03:47.320> it's<00:03:47.650> a

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
extremely fast file transfers it's a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.400 
extremely fast file transfers it's a
just<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.430> very<00:03:48.640> fast<00:03:48.910> port<00:03:49.450> it's<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.870> compatible

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
just a very fast port it's a compatible

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.789 
just a very fast port it's a compatible
with<00:03:50.560> DisplayPort

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.830 

just<00:03:57.799> wanted<00:03:58.099> to<00:03:58.250> compare<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.970> screens<00:03:59.299> here

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
just wanted to compare the screens here

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.399 
just wanted to compare the screens here
now<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:01.450> MacBook<00:04:02.450> Air<00:04:02.599> has<00:04:02.629> the<00:04:02.870> 13<00:04:03.230> inch

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
now so the MacBook Air has the 13 inch

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.690 
now so the MacBook Air has the 13 inch
screen<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.830> 1440<00:04:04.580> by<00:04:04.640> 900<00:04:04.940> resolution<00:04:05.810> the

biote has a 1366 by 768 resolution
13-inch<00:04:10.970> screen<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.480> you<00:04:12.349> get<00:04:12.470> slightly<00:04:12.709> more

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
13-inch screen so you get slightly more

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.050 
13-inch screen so you get slightly more

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
pickles on the MacBook Air now as far as

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.030 
pickles on the MacBook Air now as far as
you<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.359> angles<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.079> MacBook<00:04:18.470> Air<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.829> not

you and angles the MacBook Air is not

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.810 
you and angles the MacBook Air is not
IPS<00:04:19.579> screen<00:04:19.760> like<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.660> iPad<00:04:21.109> is<00:04:21.460> but<00:04:22.460> it<00:04:22.699> has

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
IPS screen like the iPad is but it has

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.250 
IPS screen like the iPad is but it has
pretty<00:04:23.000> good<00:04:23.120> viewing<00:04:23.479> angles<00:04:23.690> now<00:04:24.050> it's

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
pretty good viewing angles now it's

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.379 
pretty good viewing angles now it's
glossy<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:25.130> it's<00:04:25.400> going<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.790> reflect<00:04:25.910> the

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
glossy so it's going to reflect the

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.460 
glossy so it's going to reflect the
light<00:04:26.600> there<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:28.060> if<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.150> put<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.419> Sony<00:04:29.840> Vaio<00:04:29.930> T

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.950 
light there and if I put the Sony Vaio T
back<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.490> see<00:04:31.699> both<00:04:32.000> performed<00:04:32.750> pretty

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
back you can see both performed pretty

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.520 
back you can see both performed pretty
poorly<00:04:33.580> as<00:04:34.580> far<00:04:34.820> as<00:04:34.970> viewing<00:04:35.330> angles<00:04:35.840> in<00:04:36.020> this

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
poorly as far as viewing angles in this

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.409 
poorly as far as viewing angles in this
brightly<00:04:36.860> lit<00:04:37.220> room<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.729> they<00:04:37.850> reflect<00:04:38.300> the

brightly lit room and they reflect the

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.840 
brightly lit room and they reflect the
lights<00:04:38.720> I<00:04:38.870> have<00:04:38.900> up<00:04:39.169> above<00:04:39.320> me<00:04:39.650> which<00:04:39.800> is<00:04:40.010> kind

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
lights I have up above me which is kind

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.580 
lights I have up above me which is kind
of<00:04:40.940> annoying<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.600> that's<00:04:41.720> one<00:04:41.960> feature<00:04:42.289> about

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
of annoying and that's one feature about

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.040 
of annoying and that's one feature about
glossy<00:04:42.889> screens<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.460> don't<00:04:43.699> like<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.150> see<00:04:44.360> so

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
glossy screens I don't like to see so

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.629 
glossy screens I don't like to see so
let's<00:04:45.080> tilt<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.710> screens<00:04:46.010> forward<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.490> see

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
let's tilt the screens forward to see

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.430 
let's tilt the screens forward to see
which<00:04:46.820> performs<00:04:47.300> better<00:04:47.539> at<00:04:47.750> afford<00:04:48.139> viewing

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
which performs better at afford viewing

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.219 
which performs better at afford viewing
the<00:04:48.530> angle<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.880> here<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.240> MacBook<00:04:50.660> Air<00:04:50.840> does

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
the angle so here the MacBook Air does

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.770 
the angle so here the MacBook Air does
look<00:04:51.470> nicer<00:04:51.949> it's<00:04:52.639> just<00:04:53.000> holds<00:04:53.389> this<00:04:53.479> color

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
look nicer it's just holds this color

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.080 
look nicer it's just holds this color
better<00:04:54.050> overall<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.070> MacBook<00:04:55.430> Air<00:04:55.580> screen<00:04:55.970> is

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
better overall the MacBook Air screen is

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.420 
better overall the MacBook Air screen is
a<00:04:56.120> little<00:04:56.389> nicer<00:04:56.720> than<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.900> biote<00:04:57.470> slightly

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
a little nicer than the biote slightly

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.469 
a little nicer than the biote slightly
more<00:04:58.580> premium<00:04:59.090> but<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.810> biote<00:05:00.229> is<00:05:00.950> not<00:05:01.160> bad

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
more premium but the biote is not bad

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.879 
more premium but the biote is not bad
let's<00:05:02.479> talk<00:05:02.840> about<00:05:02.930> performance<00:05:03.169> a<00:05:03.590> bit<00:05:03.740> so

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
let's talk about performance a bit so

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.650 
let's talk about performance a bit so
the<00:05:04.010> MacBook<00:05:04.370> Air<00:05:04.550> has<00:05:04.580> an<00:05:05.000> Intel<00:05:05.330> Core<00:05:05.510> i5

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
the MacBook Air has an Intel Core i5

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.710 
the MacBook Air has an Intel Core i5
processor<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:07.340> biote<00:05:07.940> has<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.510> same

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
processor and the biote has the same

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.010 
processor and the biote has the same
Intel<00:05:09.050> Core<00:05:09.289> i5<00:05:09.380> processor<00:05:10.539> the<00:05:11.539> advantage

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
Intel Core i5 processor the advantage

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.629 
Intel Core i5 processor the advantage
the<00:05:12.229> MacBook<00:05:12.680> Air<00:05:12.860> has<00:05:12.889> is<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.610> has

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
the MacBook Air has is that it has

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.480 
the MacBook Air has is that it has
either<00:05:14.060> 128<00:05:14.930> gigabyte<00:05:15.349> SSD<00:05:15.680> or<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.340> can

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
either 128 gigabyte SSD or you can

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.770 
either 128 gigabyte SSD or you can
upgrade<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:16.789> 256<00:05:17.510> gigabyte<00:05:18.169> SSD<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.780> overall

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
upgrade to 256 gigabyte SSD so overall

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.870 
upgrade to 256 gigabyte SSD so overall
just<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.260> faster<00:05:21.740> performance<00:05:22.010> because<00:05:22.729> of

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
just a faster performance because of

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.439 
just a faster performance because of
that<00:05:22.970> SSD<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:24.020> biote<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:25.039> do<00:05:25.310> not<00:05:25.610> get<00:05:25.970> an<00:05:26.120> SSD

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
that SSD the biote you do not get an SSD

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.810 
that SSD the biote you do not get an SSD
you<00:05:26.690> just<00:05:27.139> get<00:05:27.289> a<00:05:27.320> regular<00:05:27.560> hard<00:05:28.039> drive<00:05:28.280> so

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
you just get a regular hard drive so

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.790 
you just get a regular hard drive so
that's<00:05:29.060> one<00:05:29.539> big<00:05:29.780> reason<00:05:29.810> that<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.410> MacBook

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
that's one big reason that the MacBook

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.450 
that's one big reason that the MacBook
Air<00:05:30.979> is<00:05:31.160> more<00:05:31.580> expensive<00:05:32.919> if<00:05:33.919> you<00:05:34.099> want<00:05:34.310> more

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
Air is more expensive if you want more

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.540 
Air is more expensive if you want more
storage<00:05:34.729> capacity<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:35.690> bio<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.949> bio<00:05:37.160> T<00:05:37.430> is

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
storage capacity the bio the bio T is

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.920 
storage capacity the bio the bio T is
good<00:05:37.760> for<00:05:37.910> that<00:05:37.970> because<00:05:38.120> you'd<00:05:38.419> like<00:05:38.570> in<00:05:38.810> my

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
good for that because you'd like in my

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.529 
good for that because you'd like in my
configuration<00:05:39.289> get<00:05:39.680> 500<00:05:40.190> gigabytes<00:05:40.610> or<00:05:40.820> as

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
configuration get 500 gigabytes or as

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.200 
configuration get 500 gigabytes or as
the<00:05:41.750> MacBook<00:05:42.139> Air<00:05:42.349> I<00:05:42.410> have<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.800> 256<00:05:43.699> gigabyte

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
the MacBook Air I have a 256 gigabyte

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.810 
the MacBook Air I have a 256 gigabyte
SSD<00:05:44.539> but<00:05:44.960> that's<00:05:45.169> a<00:05:45.289> pricey<00:05:45.919> upgrade<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.669> do

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
SSD but that's a pricey upgrade to do

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.939 
SSD but that's a pricey upgrade to do
and<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.539> still<00:05:47.780> don't<00:05:47.840> get<00:05:48.020> as<00:05:48.169> much<00:05:48.349> capacity

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
and you still don't get as much capacity

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.219 
and you still don't get as much capacity
but<00:05:49.220> I<00:05:49.460> think<00:05:49.940> those<00:05:50.120> that<00:05:50.300> are<00:05:50.539> looking<00:05:50.990> at

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
but I think those that are looking at

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.140 
but I think those that are looking at
ultra<00:05:51.500> portables<00:05:52.010> are<00:05:52.160> concerned<00:05:52.639> more<00:05:52.910> about

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
ultra portables are concerned more about

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.960 
ultra portables are concerned more about
just<00:05:53.660> performance<00:05:54.349> and<00:05:54.620> reliability<00:05:55.280> and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
just performance and reliability and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.360 
just performance and reliability and
that<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.599> SSD<00:05:57.080> certainly<00:05:57.650> delivers<00:05:58.130> in<00:05:58.250> that

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
that the SSD certainly delivers in that

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.140 
that the SSD certainly delivers in that
area<00:05:58.639> so<00:05:59.590> well<00:06:00.590> processor<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:01.639> memory<00:06:01.789> wise

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
area so well processor and memory wise

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.600 
area so well processor and memory wise
these<00:06:02.479> laptops<00:06:03.020> are<00:06:03.380> fairly<00:06:03.560> similar<00:06:03.860> the<00:06:04.130> SSD

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
these laptops are fairly similar the SSD

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.040 
these laptops are fairly similar the SSD
that<00:06:04.789> comes<00:06:04.969> with<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.210> MacBook<00:06:05.390> Air<00:06:05.750> does

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
that comes with the MacBook Air does

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.410 
that comes with the MacBook Air does
make<00:06:06.380> it<00:06:06.590> to<00:06:06.740> faster

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
make it to faster

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.140 
make it to faster
for<00:06:07.540> our<00:06:07.630> machine<00:06:07.810> to<00:06:08.200> have

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.580 

now<00:06:13.150> we're<00:06:13.360> going<00:06:13.480> to<00:06:13.570> do<00:06:13.690> the<00:06:13.840> all-important

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
now we're going to do the all-important

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.440 
now we're going to do the all-important
way<00:06:14.860> in<00:06:14.920> here<00:06:15.250> so<00:06:15.460> we<00:06:15.550> can<00:06:15.730> compare<00:06:16.060> the<00:06:16.240> weight

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
way in here so we can compare the weight

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.160 
way in here so we can compare the weight
of<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:16.750> MacBook<00:06:17.140> Air<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.560> the<00:06:18.460> biote<00:06:19.330> so<00:06:19.780> like

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
of the MacBook Air and the biote so like

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.600 
of the MacBook Air and the biote so like
I<00:06:20.200> said<00:06:20.350> the<00:06:20.530> MacBook<00:06:20.890> Air<00:06:21.010> is<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:21.190> more<00:06:21.370> premium

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
I said the MacBook Air is a more premium

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.730 
I said the MacBook Air is a more premium
machine<00:06:22.060> and<00:06:22.240> it<00:06:22.360> is<00:06:22.450> lighter<00:06:22.840> it's<00:06:23.500> under

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
machine and it is lighter it's under

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.170 
machine and it is lighter it's under
three<00:06:23.980> pounds<00:06:24.160> so<00:06:24.550> I'm<00:06:24.640> going<00:06:24.760> to<00:06:24.790> put<00:06:25.000> it<00:06:25.090> on

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
three pounds so I'm going to put it on

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.810 
three pounds so I'm going to put it on
the<00:06:25.300> scales<00:06:25.570> here<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:27.190> you'll<00:06:27.400> see<00:06:27.430> that<00:06:27.670> it

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
the scales here and you'll see that it

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.730 
the scales here and you'll see that it
comes<00:06:28.060> in<00:06:28.360> at<00:06:28.510> just<00:06:28.540> under<00:06:28.870> three<00:06:29.200> pounds<00:06:29.380> two

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
comes in at just under three pounds two

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.310 
comes in at just under three pounds two
pounds<00:06:30.070> 15<00:06:30.430> ounces<00:06:30.780> I'm<00:06:31.780> gonna<00:06:31.960> grab<00:06:32.140> our

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
biote put it on the scales and you just

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.140 
biote put it on the scales and you just
check<00:06:35.230> here<00:06:35.410> and<00:06:35.560> zeroed<00:06:35.920> out<00:06:38.640> and<00:06:39.640> then<00:06:40.030> you

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
check here and zeroed out and then you

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.670 
check here and zeroed out and then you
see<00:06:40.330> it's<00:06:40.480> over<00:06:40.810> three<00:06:40.990> pounds<00:06:41.290> three<00:06:41.410> pounds

six ounces so just shy of three and a
half<00:06:44.320> pounds<00:06:44.740> so<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:44.980> MacBook<00:06:45.400> Air<00:06:45.580> is<00:06:45.640> the

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
just to conclude to be fair I don't

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.440 
just to conclude to be fair I don't
think<00:06:58.170> anyone's<00:06:58.590> claiming<00:06:58.980> the<00:06:59.070> biote<00:06:59.580> is<00:06:59.940> an

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
think anyone's claiming the biote is an

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.330 
think anyone's claiming the biote is an

maybe<00:07:52.740> not<00:07:52.980> in<00:07:53.100> the<00:07:53.190> same<00:07:53.400> class<00:07:53.700> as<00:07:53.970> the

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 
maybe not in the same class as the

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.780 
maybe not in the same class as the
MacBook<00:07:54.630> Air<00:07:54.920> so<00:07:55.920> that's<00:07:56.220> just<00:07:56.340> why<00:07:56.490> I<00:07:56.550> wanted

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:56.790 
MacBook Air so that's just why I wanted

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.170 
MacBook Air so that's just why I wanted
to<00:07:56.850> compare<00:07:57.270> just<00:07:57.510> so<00:07:58.110> for<00:07:58.530> those<00:07:58.650> of<00:07:58.860> you<00:07:58.950> that

00:07:59.170 --> 00:07:59.180 
to compare just so for those of you that

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.730 
to compare just so for those of you that
like<00:08:00.180> the<00:08:00.360> MacBook<00:08:00.750> Air<00:08:00.900> but<00:08:01.169> can't<00:08:01.380> justify

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 
like the MacBook Air but can't justify

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.159 
like the MacBook Air but can't justify
the<00:08:01.919> cost<00:08:02.280> and<00:08:02.700> do<00:08:03.510> you<00:08:03.570> need<00:08:03.750> some<00:08:03.960> of<00:08:04.080> those

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:04.169 
the cost and do you need some of those

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:05.450 
the cost and do you need some of those
features<00:08:04.500> like<00:08:04.890> a<00:08:04.919> larger<00:08:05.340> capacity

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 
features like a larger capacity

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.300 
features like a larger capacity
harddrive<00:08:06.360> the<00:08:06.660> VAIO<00:08:06.840> t<00:08:07.110> offers<00:08:07.530> then

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.310 
harddrive the VAIO t offers then

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.700 
harddrive the VAIO t offers then
certainly<00:08:09.030> it<00:08:09.240> could<00:08:09.419> be<00:08:09.660> it<00:08:10.380> could<00:08:10.410> be<00:08:10.650> an

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:10.710 
certainly it could be it could be an

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.610 
certainly it could be it could be an
option<00:08:10.860> for<00:08:11.070> you<00:08:11.310> as<00:08:11.430> well
