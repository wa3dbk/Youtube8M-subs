00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
clearance even goes up a wee bit this

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060 
clearance even goes up a wee bit this
one's<00:01:47.159> pretty<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.360> basic<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.290> basic<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
one's pretty much as basic as basic and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.300 
one's pretty much as basic as basic and
get<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> only<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.700> options<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> has<00:01:51.270> are<00:01:51.600> the

373 gears which swapped out from the

373 gears which swapped out from the
factory<00:01:54.899> 321<00:01:55.740> gears<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> freedom

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
factory 321 gears and then the freedom

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.270 
factory 321 gears and then the freedom
top<00:01:57.810> which<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.200> great<00:01:58.590> feature<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.159> not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
top which is a great feature it's not

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.280 
top which is a great feature it's not
very<00:01:59.490> much<00:01:59.670> money<00:01:59.850> new<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:00.990> hard<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
very much money new but they are hard to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.709 
very much money new but they are hard to
find<00:02:01.560> used<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.610> they're<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.450> expensive

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
find used and the they're more expensive

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.139 
find used and the they're more expensive
than<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.770> got<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.189> hardtop<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
than if you just got the hardtop on the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.950 
than if you just got the hardtop on the
vehicle<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.659> begin

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that hold the hood down still probably

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
that hold the hood down still probably

the only car in the world that has such

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.380 
the only car in the world that has such
a<00:02:22.350> thing<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.550> take<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> look<00:02:24.000> big

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
a thing and then as we take a look big

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
a thing and then as we take a look big
exposed<00:02:24.900> fender<00:02:25.350> flares<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.610> course

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
exposed fender flares and then of course

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.940 
exposed fender flares and then of course
these<00:02:27.060> great<00:02:27.600> big<00:02:27.959> wheels<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.530> tires<00:02:28.770> the

these great big wheels and tires the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.100 
these great big wheels and tires the
wheels<00:02:29.130> themselves<00:02:29.340> are<00:02:29.730> only<00:02:29.760> 17<00:02:30.360> inches<00:02:30.720> but

wheels themselves are only 17 inches but
they're<00:02:31.350> 35<00:02:31.860> inch<00:02:32.640> tires<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.300> these<00:02:33.480> are

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
they're 35 inch tires so these are

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.750 
they're 35 inch tires so these are
really<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.230> huge<00:02:34.560> tires<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.430> has<00:02:35.550> such

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
really really huge tires and it has such

really really huge tires and it has such
a<00:02:35.790> short<00:02:36.209> wheelbase<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.290> gives<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
a short wheelbase that it gives the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.830 
a short wheelbase that it gives the
totally<00:02:38.550> different<00:02:38.880> personality<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
totally different personality to the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.330 
totally different personality to the
vehicle<00:02:40.200> when<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.590> big<00:02:40.890> tires<00:02:41.100> like

vehicle when you have big tires like

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.040 
vehicle when you have big tires like
this<00:02:41.520> sometimes<00:02:42.209> if<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.780> big

this sometimes if you have like a big

this sometimes if you have like a big
long<00:02:43.500> truck<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.340> big<00:02:44.520> Ford<00:02:44.820> doors<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.510> can

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
long truck with big Ford doors you can

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.240 
long truck with big Ford doors you can
put<00:02:45.750> giant<00:02:45.959> tires<00:02:46.320> on<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.860> doesn't<00:02:47.160> really

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
put giant tires on it and doesn't really

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.920 
put giant tires on it and doesn't really
change<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.850> driving<00:02:48.060> characteristics<00:02:48.450> all

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
change the driving characteristics all

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.290 
change the driving characteristics all
that<00:02:49.170> much<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.860> very<00:02:50.190> short<00:02:50.280> wheelbase<00:02:50.850> like

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
that much on a very short wheelbase like

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.120 
that much on a very short wheelbase like
this<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.810> percentage<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.530> tire<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
this just the percentage of tire to the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.040 
this just the percentage of tire to the
rest<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.550> vehicle<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.390> pronounced

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
rest of the vehicle is so pronounced

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.140 
rest of the vehicle is so pronounced
that<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.560> really<00:02:55.800> does<00:02:56.070> change<00:02:56.100> things<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:56.910> if

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that it really does change things so if

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.760 
that it really does change things so if
you<00:02:57.420> are<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.810> kind<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.020> person<00:02:58.170> who<00:02:58.410> likes<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
you are the kind of person who likes to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.160 
you are the kind of person who likes to
go<00:02:58.890> off-road<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.820> is<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.360> as<00:03:00.570> good<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:00.900> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
go off-road this is just as good as it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.960 
go off-road this is just as good as it
possibly<00:03:01.350> could<00:03:01.860> ever<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:03.920> inside

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.090 
possibly could ever get inside
SuperDuper<00:03:05.970> Spartan<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.720> that's<00:03:07.680> kind<00:03:07.980> of

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
SuperDuper Spartan and that's kind of

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.220 
SuperDuper Spartan and that's kind of
the<00:03:08.160> way<00:03:08.340> G<00:03:08.640> people<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.390> especially<00:03:09.570> true

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
the way G people like it especially true

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.080 
the way G people like it especially true
enthusiasts<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.100> then<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.700> course<00:03:11.910> you've

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
enthusiasts and then of course you've

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.660 
enthusiasts and then of course you've
got<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.709> ubiquitous<00:03:13.709> Jeep<00:03:13.950> Wrangler<00:03:14.340> straps

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
got the ubiquitous Jeep Wrangler straps

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.280 
got the ubiquitous Jeep Wrangler straps
right<00:03:14.910> there<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.330> reason<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:15.930> straps

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
right there and the reason there straps

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.140 
right there and the reason there straps
holding<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.769> door<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.580> door<00:03:17.700> comes

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
holding the door is that the door comes

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.330 
holding the door is that the door comes
off<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:18.989> both<00:03:19.260> doors<00:03:19.500> actually<00:03:19.769> come<00:03:20.310> up

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
off and so both doors actually come up

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.520 
off and so both doors actually come up
and<00:03:20.700> with<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> whole<00:03:21.450> lot<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.959> effort<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.320> can

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and with a whole lot of effort you can

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.289 
and with a whole lot of effort you can
actually<00:03:22.890> take<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.250> windshield<00:03:23.670> out<00:03:23.880> as<00:03:24.120> well

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
actually take the windshield out as well

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.570 
actually take the windshield out as well
and<00:03:24.570> then<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.080> freedom<00:03:25.440> top<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> three

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
and then the freedom top is a three

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.670 
and then the freedom top is a three
piece<00:03:26.850> top<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.019> more<00:03:28.290> convenient

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
piece top and so it's more convenient

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.350 
piece top and so it's more convenient
just<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.070> take<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.340> whole<00:03:29.519> thing<00:03:29.790> off<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:30.269> you

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
just to take the whole thing off but you

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.120 
just to take the whole thing off but you
can<00:03:30.390> actually<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:31.019> take<00:03:31.170> off<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.620> one<00:03:31.860> part

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
can actually just take off just one part

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.280 
can actually just take off just one part
of<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.370> or<00:03:32.519> up<00:03:33.060> two<00:03:33.269> parts<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.750> or<00:03:33.900> take<00:03:34.110> off

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
of it or up two parts of it or take off

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.600 
of it or up two parts of it or take off
the<00:03:34.320> whole<00:03:34.530> thing<00:03:34.590> whatever<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.160> please<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
so getting in and out well it's a little

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.090 
so getting in and out well it's a little
bit<00:03:38.220> cumbersome<00:03:39.500> but<00:03:40.500> again<00:03:40.769> creature

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
bit cumbersome but again creature

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.830 
bit cumbersome but again creature

back<00:03:54.410> again<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.530> one's<00:03:55.769> not<00:03:55.920> set<00:03:56.220> up<00:03:56.250> for

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400

back again this one's not set up for
trailer<00:03:56.910> tow<00:03:57.150> but<00:03:57.450> bear<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.720> mind<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:58.290> Jeep

dune rider then that wouldn't really
matter<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:45.090> much<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.950> soft<00:04:46.950> top<00:04:47.160> just

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
this little fancy device here and then

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.810 
this little fancy device here and then
this<00:05:03.000> opens<00:05:03.180> up<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.720> give<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.200> where<00:05:04.380> your

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
this opens up to give you where your

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.610 
this opens up to give you where your
extra<00:05:05.820> space<00:05:06.090> is<00:05:06.330> for<00:05:06.570> cameras<00:05:07.110> or<00:05:07.320> other

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
extra space is for cameras or other

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.450 
extra space is for cameras or other
outdoor<00:05:08.010> outdoor<00:05:08.820> gear<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:10.140> then<00:05:10.260> just<00:05:10.500> there

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
outdoor outdoor gear and then just there

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.870 
outdoor outdoor gear and then just there
you<00:05:11.580> go

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
you go

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.000 
you go
and<00:05:12.060> that's<00:05:12.930> their<00:05:13.140> idea<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.650> having<00:05:13.830> it

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
and that's their idea of having it

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.270 
and that's their idea of having it
locked<00:05:14.220> up<00:05:15.350> nice<00:05:16.350> thing<00:05:16.560> about<00:05:16.590> this<00:05:16.980> one<00:05:17.160> is

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
locked up nice thing about this one is

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.270 
locked up nice thing about this one is
it<00:05:17.430> does<00:05:17.610> have<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.090> fifth<00:05:18.900> full-size<00:05:19.560> tire<00:05:19.950> so

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
it does have the fifth full-size tire so

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.830 
it does have the fifth full-size tire so
again<00:05:20.580> if<00:05:20.790> you're<00:05:20.970> a<00:05:21.000> weekend<00:05:21.390> warrior<00:05:21.600> and

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
taking this way way way out of bounds

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.620 
taking this way way way out of bounds
and<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:26.220> blow<00:05:26.430> a<00:05:26.460> tire<00:05:26.730> it's<00:05:27.090> nice<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.510> know
