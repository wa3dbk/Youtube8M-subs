00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.949 

okay<00:00:01.439> so<00:00:01.500> in<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.190> next<00:00:02.429> video<00:00:02.929> we're<00:00:03.929> just

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay so in this next video we're just

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay so in this next video we're just
going<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.319> be<00:00:04.410> taking<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.980> quick<00:00:05.220> look<00:00:05.339> at

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
going to be taking a quick look at

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.790 
going to be taking a quick look at
drills<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.760> reaming<00:00:08.760> which<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.800> slightly

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
drills and reaming which is a slightly

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.410 
drills and reaming which is a slightly
different<00:00:11.040> process<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.910> drilling

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
different process to drilling

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.160 
different process to drilling
okay<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.290> drilling<00:00:14.900> hopefully<00:00:15.900> you've<00:00:16.049> all

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
okay so drilling hopefully you've all

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.529 
okay so drilling hopefully you've all
had<00:00:16.440> some<00:00:16.710> experience<00:00:16.880> doing<00:00:17.880> some<00:00:18.240> sort<00:00:18.420> of

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
had some experience doing some sort of

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.929 
had some experience doing some sort of
drilling<00:00:18.900> before<00:00:19.859> especially<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.640> say<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
drilling before especially on say a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.380 
drilling before especially on say a
Worman<00:00:21.449> project<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.820> start<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.150> have

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
Worman project so we start with we have

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.580 
Worman project so we start with we have
two<00:00:24.810> different<00:00:25.199> types<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:26.240> drills<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:28.199> drill

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
two different types of drills or drill

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.150 
two different types of drills or drill
bits<00:00:29.779> firstly<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.439> smaller<00:00:31.920> ones

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
bits firstly we have our smaller ones

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.330 
bits firstly we have our smaller ones
which<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.090> these<00:00:33.960> ones<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.469> where<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
which is these ones here where we have a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
which is these ones here where we have a
parallel<00:00:36.230> shank<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.680> fit<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
parallel shank and these fit in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.049 
parallel shank and these fit in
generally<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.149> handheld<00:00:39.870> power<00:00:40.410> drills

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
generally your handheld power drills

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.090 
generally your handheld power drills
using<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.300> three-jaw<00:00:42.809> chucks<00:00:44.930> usually

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
using the three-jaw chucks usually

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
using the three-jaw chucks usually
probably<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.340> biggest<00:00:47.730> size<00:00:48.030> drill<00:00:48.809> bit<00:00:48.840> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
probably the biggest size drill bit you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.610 
probably the biggest size drill bit you
can<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.980> around<00:00:50.340> 16<00:00:51.210> maybe<00:00:51.960> 18

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
can get for these is around 16 maybe 18

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
can get for these is around 16 maybe 18
millimeters<00:00:53.539> if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.690> go<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> hardware

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
millimeters if you go to a hardware

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.020 
millimeters if you go to a hardware
store<00:00:55.410> you'll<00:00:55.860> notice<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.340> probably<00:00:56.730> can't

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
store you'll notice you probably can't

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.110 
store you'll notice you probably can't
find<00:00:57.539> them<00:00:57.750> anywhere<00:00:58.170> above<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.879> for<00:00:59.879> bigger

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
find them anywhere above that for bigger

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.619 
find them anywhere above that for bigger
drill<00:01:00.449> bits<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:01.440> use<00:01:02.270> something<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> looks

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
drill bits we use something that looks

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.929 
drill bits we use something that looks
more<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.290> where<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.939> these

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
more like this where we have these

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
more like this where we have these
tapered<00:01:06.390> shanks<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.740> Tang<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.549> end

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
tapered shanks and is Tang here at end

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100 
tapered shanks and is Tang here at end
so<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.340> hold<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.450> drill<00:01:12.900> bit

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
so this is so we can hold the drill bit

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.640 
so this is so we can hold the drill bit
in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> bigger<00:01:13.680> drills<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.600> Center<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in the bigger drills in Center and so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.480 
in the bigger drills in Center and so
they<00:01:16.830> rotate<00:01:17.869> about<00:01:18.869> their<00:01:19.409> Center<00:01:19.860> more

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
they rotate about their Center more

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.730 
they rotate about their Center more
accurately<00:01:20.939> than<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.479> would<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.930> say<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
accurately than we would with say just a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.950 
accurately than we would with say just a
parallel<00:01:23.280> shank<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.840> an

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
parallel shank so here we just have an

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.190 
parallel shank so here we just have an
image<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:26.240> drill<00:01:27.240> press<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.990> might

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
image of a drill press that you might

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
image of a drill press that you might
find<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.280> home<00:01:29.670> workshop<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
find in you know a home workshop that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.830 
find in you know a home workshop that
sort<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.840> thing<00:01:31.369> relatively<00:01:32.369> small<00:01:32.729> I've<00:01:33.630> got

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
sort of thing relatively small I've got

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.580 
sort of thing relatively small I've got
this<00:01:33.990> handle<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.890> pulls<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.509> our

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
this handle here that pulls down our

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.140 
this handle here that pulls down our
drill<00:01:37.590> bit<00:01:37.619> into<00:01:38.009> our<00:01:38.310> material<00:01:38.820> which<00:01:38.970> we're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
drill bit into our material which we're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.469 
drill bit into our material which we're
drilling<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:41.430> course<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.299> get

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
drilling here and of course you can get

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.109 
drilling here and of course you can get
these<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:43.140> bigger<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.680> bigger<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
these get bigger and bigger and on the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.899 
these get bigger and bigger and on the
much<00:01:45.360> bigger<00:01:45.750> size<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.280> something<00:01:47.880> like

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
much bigger size we have something like

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.330 
much bigger size we have something like
this<00:01:48.240> which<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.020> start<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.560> drill<00:01:49.799> holes<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
this which can start to drill holes that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.990 
this which can start to drill holes that
are<00:01:50.399> several<00:01:50.909> meters<00:01:51.299> deep<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:53.000> quite

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
are several meters deep and of quite

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.899 
are several meters deep and of quite
large<00:01:54.329> diameter<00:01:55.140> another<00:01:56.100> process<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.610> be

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
large diameter another process to be

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.950 
large diameter another process to be
aware<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.210> when<00:01:57.810> drilling<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.939> countersinking

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
aware of when drilling is countersinking

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.600 
aware of when drilling is countersinking
so<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:02.130> produces<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.530> finish<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.189> top<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so this produces a finish at the top of

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.229 
so this produces a finish at the top of
your<00:02:05.640> hole<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.409> 90<00:02:07.890> degree<00:02:08.250> angle

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
your hole so we get this 90 degree angle

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.430 
your hole so we get this 90 degree angle
here<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.200> purpose<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:13.260> we

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
here and purpose of this is so when we

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.910 
here and purpose of this is so when we
put<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
put a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.300 
put a
grew<00:02:14.099> into<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> material<00:02:15.740> it<00:02:16.740> will<00:02:17.010> sit

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
grew into the material it will sit

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.150 
grew into the material it will sit
either<00:02:17.520> flush<00:02:18.209> with<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.810> surface<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
either flush with the surface of the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.520 
either flush with the surface of the
material<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.090> top<00:02:21.599> edge<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.170> screw

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.490 
material so this top edge of a screw
here<00:02:22.860> will<00:02:23.670> sit<00:02:23.970> flush<00:02:24.239> with<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.930> surface

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
here will sit flush with it this surface

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.300 
here will sit flush with it this surface
of<00:02:25.709> our<00:02:25.860> material<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:26.700> or<00:02:27.200> even<00:02:28.200> below<00:02:28.800> flush

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
of our material here or even below flush

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.910 
of our material here or even below flush
so<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.700> might<00:02:29.880> sit<00:02:30.510> below<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.260> surface<00:02:31.739> as

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
so it might sit below that surface as

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.309 
so it might sit below that surface as
well<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.910> depending<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.510> what<00:02:33.720> we're<00:02:33.870> after<00:02:34.020> we

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
well so depending on what we're after we

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.170 
well so depending on what we're after we
can<00:02:34.470> use<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> counter<00:02:35.250> sinking<00:02:35.640> tool<00:02:35.940> they're

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
can use a counter sinking tool they're

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.280 
can use a counter sinking tool they're
of<00:02:36.330> different<00:02:36.360> sizes<00:02:37.489> we<00:02:38.489> also<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.420> spot

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
of different sizes we also have a spot

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.650 
of different sizes we also have a spot
facing<00:02:40.739> tool<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.060> something<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.450> I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
facing tool and this is something that I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.020 
facing tool and this is something that I
think<00:02:42.720> might<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:43.230> come<00:02:43.410> up<00:02:43.580> briefly<00:02:44.580> when

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
think might have come up briefly when

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.780 
think might have come up briefly when
talking<00:02:45.420> about<00:02:45.780> some<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:47.190> detailed

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
talking about some of the detailed

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.380 
talking about some of the detailed
drawings<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.370> tool<00:02:50.790> as<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.840> see<00:02:52.080> it

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
drawings so this tool as you can see it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.240 
drawings so this tool as you can see it
cleans<00:02:54.390> up<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.840> surface<00:02:55.470> around<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.980> drill

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
cleans up a surface around the drill

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.240 
cleans up a surface around the drill
hole<00:02:56.489> at<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.850> certain<00:02:57.569> diameter<00:02:58.260> now<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
hole at a certain diameter now the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.009 
hole at a certain diameter now the
purpose<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.299> we've<00:03:00.450> got<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.810> image

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
purpose of this so we've got this image

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.979 
purpose of this so we've got this image
here<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.069> can<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.519> we've<00:03:03.060> got<00:03:03.360> these

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
here and you can see we've got these

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.110 
here and you can see we've got these
holes<00:03:04.650> where<00:03:05.130> we've<00:03:05.280> got<00:03:05.519> these<00:03:05.730> sort<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
holes where we've got these sort of

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.690 
holes where we've got these sort of
shiny<00:03:06.799> surfaces<00:03:07.799> around<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.250> hole<00:03:08.430> so

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
shiny surfaces around the hole so

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.020 
shiny surfaces around the hole so
they've<00:03:08.940> been<00:03:09.150> spot<00:03:09.600> faced<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.850> because<00:03:11.850> that

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
they've been spot faced and because that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.009 
they've been spot faced and because that
gives<00:03:12.239> us<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.480> nice<00:03:12.750> flat<00:03:13.410> surface<00:03:15.019> we

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
gives us a nice flat surface we

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.600 
gives us a nice flat surface we
generally<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:17.069> there's<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.549> to

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
generally do that if there's going to

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.680 
generally do that if there's going to
have<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.819> be<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.269> bolt<00:03:18.690> or<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> bolt<00:03:21.090> head<00:03:21.359> or

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
have to be a bolt or a so a bolt head or

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.039 
have to be a bolt or a so a bolt head or
a<00:03:22.290> nut<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.799> washer<00:03:23.660> going<00:03:24.660> onto<00:03:24.840> those

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
a nut and washer going onto those

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.630 
a nut and washer going onto those
surfaces<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.890> make<00:03:26.040> sure<00:03:26.250> they're<00:03:26.430> nice<00:03:26.579> and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
surfaces to make sure they're nice and

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640 
surfaces to make sure they're nice and
flat<00:03:27.000> they're<00:03:27.690> not<00:03:27.870> setting<00:03:28.170> on<00:03:28.380> anything

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
flat they're not setting on anything

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.590 
flat they're not setting on anything
that's<00:03:28.950> rounded<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:29.760> could<00:03:30.000> cause<00:03:30.239> some

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
that's rounded that could cause some

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.890 
that's rounded that could cause some
possible<00:03:31.049> bending<00:03:31.530> through<00:03:32.519> those<00:03:33.000> features

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
possible bending through those features

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.250 
possible bending through those features
as<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.799> can<00:03:35.130> see<00:03:35.310> here<00:03:35.609> this<00:03:36.480> hole<00:03:36.720> here<00:03:37.019> has

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
as you can see here this hole here has

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.990 
as you can see here this hole here has
not<00:03:37.440> necessarily<00:03:37.650> been<00:03:39.049> spot<00:03:40.049> faced<00:03:41.000> reason

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
not necessarily been spot faced reason

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.940 
not necessarily been spot faced reason
for<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.269> they<00:03:42.870> might<00:03:43.140> just<00:03:43.170> not<00:03:43.560> have<00:03:43.590> gotten

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
for that they might just not have gotten

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.789 
for that they might just not have gotten
around<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.370> yet<00:03:44.400> or<00:03:45.590> there<00:03:46.590> might<00:03:46.769> be

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
around to it yet or there might be

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.349 
around to it yet or there might be
something<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.579> through<00:03:47.970> there<00:03:48.150> that

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
something going through there that

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.390 
something going through there that
doesn't<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.109> feature<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.680> has<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.250> be

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
doesn't have a feature that has to be

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.140 
doesn't have a feature that has to be
flush<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.600> surface<00:03:51.900> here<00:03:52.609> okay<00:03:53.609> so<00:03:53.670> just

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
flush on this surface here okay so just

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.690 
flush on this surface here okay so just
the<00:03:54.570> last<00:03:54.780> bit<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.350> drilling<00:03:55.920> before<00:03:56.370> we<00:03:56.489> move

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
the last bit on drilling before we move

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.979 
the last bit on drilling before we move
on<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.060> reaming<00:03:59.060> so<00:04:00.060> with<00:04:00.299> our<00:04:00.480> drill<00:04:00.780> bits

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
on to reaming so with our drill bits

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.289 
on to reaming so with our drill bits
obviously<00:04:01.829> we<00:04:02.459> don't<00:04:02.609> just<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.319> flat<00:04:04.319> heads

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
obviously we don't just have flat heads

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.970 
obviously we don't just have flat heads
we've<00:04:06.299> got<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.720> slight<00:04:07.019> points<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.739> so

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
we've got these slight points to it so

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.370 
we've got these slight points to it so
this<00:04:08.730> stops<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.299> drill<00:04:09.750> bit<00:04:09.930> from<00:04:10.139> moving

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
this stops the drill bit from moving

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.259 
this stops the drill bit from moving
around<00:04:10.620> when<00:04:10.980> initially<00:04:11.400> trying<00:04:11.819> to<00:04:11.940> get<00:04:12.060> that

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
around when initially trying to get that

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.879 
around when initially trying to get that
hole<00:04:12.540> started<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:15.450> angle<00:04:15.900> here<00:04:16.229> on<00:04:16.440> these

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
hole started and the angle here on these

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.440 
hole started and the angle here on these
heads<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.840> generally<00:04:18.840> about<00:04:19.850> 120<00:04:20.850> degrees<00:04:20.970> and

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
heads is generally about 120 degrees and

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.659 
heads is generally about 120 degrees and
in<00:04:21.959> our<00:04:22.109> drawings<00:04:22.590> we<00:04:22.770> put<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.099> a<00:04:23.220> hundred<00:04:23.430> and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
in our drawings we put it a hundred and

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.779 
in our drawings we put it a hundred and
twenty<00:04:23.909> degrees<00:04:24.800> in<00:04:25.800> reality<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:26.580> actually

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
twenty degrees in reality it's actually

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.740 
twenty degrees in reality it's actually
a<00:04:27.060> hundred<00:04:27.240> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
a hundred and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.350 
a hundred and
eighteen<00:04:28.020> degrees<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.370> when<00:04:29.640> doing<00:04:30.090> our

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
eighteen degrees so when doing our

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.630 
eighteen degrees so when doing our
drawings<00:04:30.780> obviously<00:04:31.470> we<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:32.010> easily<00:04:32.220> draw

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
drawings obviously we can easily draw

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.580 
drawings obviously we can easily draw
this<00:04:32.790> in<00:04:33.030> knowing<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.540> angle<00:04:33.960> put<00:04:34.380> that

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
this in knowing that angle put that

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.620 
this in knowing that angle put that
little<00:04:34.950> hole<00:04:35.640> in<00:04:35.850> if<00:04:36.030> we're<00:04:36.210> not<00:04:36.300> drilling

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
little hole in if we're not drilling

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.330 
little hole in if we're not drilling
right<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.140> way<00:04:37.260> through<00:04:37.290> an<00:04:38.130> object<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:40.340> by

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
right the way through an object and by

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.310 
right the way through an object and by
putting<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.790> little<00:04:42.120> point<00:04:42.420> here<00:04:42.690> we're

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
putting this little point here we're

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.800 
putting this little point here we're
telling<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.770> person<00:04:43.980> that<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:45.210> obviously<00:04:45.690> a

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
telling the person that it's obviously a

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.890 
telling the person that it's obviously a
hole<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.380> doesn't<00:04:46.770> need<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.280> flat<00:04:48.180> bottom<00:04:48.540> to

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
hole that doesn't need a flat bottom to

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.170 
hole that doesn't need a flat bottom to
it<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.290> they<00:04:49.410> can<00:04:49.440> use<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.950> cheaper<00:04:50.400> drill

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
it so they can use the cheaper drill

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420 
it so they can use the cheaper drill
which<00:04:51.420> is<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.750> have<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.080> point<00:04:52.410> on<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.770> if<00:04:52.920> it

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
which is to have this point on it if it

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.380 
which is to have this point on it if it
needs<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:53.790> be<00:04:54.410> have<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> flattened<00:04:56.180> bottom<00:04:57.180> to

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
needs to be have a flattened bottom to

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.350 
needs to be have a flattened bottom to
our<00:04:57.570> hole<00:04:57.810> would<00:04:58.590> obviously<00:04:58.860> need<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.340> have<00:04:59.880> a

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
our hole would obviously need to have a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.080 
our hole would obviously need to have a
different<00:05:00.630> operation<00:05:01.200> there<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:02.090> it's

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
different operation there and it's

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.640 
different operation there and it's
obviously<00:05:03.540> going<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.780> be<00:05:03.870> more<00:05:04.169> costly

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
obviously going to be more costly

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.750 
obviously going to be more costly
operation<00:05:05.419> okay<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:07.040> now<00:05:08.040> just<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.340> quick<00:05:08.460> look

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
operation okay so now just a quick look

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.159 
operation okay so now just a quick look
at<00:05:08.910> reaming<00:05:09.390> so<00:05:10.550> similar<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.580> drilling<00:05:12.020> but<00:05:13.020> as

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
at reaming so similar to drilling but as

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.500 
at reaming so similar to drilling but as
you<00:05:13.320> can<00:05:13.440> see<00:05:13.500> here<00:05:14.100> slightly<00:05:14.669> different<00:05:15.210> tool

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
you can see here slightly different tool

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.170 
you can see here slightly different tool
we<00:05:15.780> use<00:05:16.250> we<00:05:17.250> have<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.960> flattened<00:05:18.960> off<00:05:19.200> end<00:05:20.180> here

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
we use we have a flattened off end here

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.020 
we use we have a flattened off end here
and<00:05:21.300> we<00:05:22.169> have<00:05:22.530> several<00:05:22.890> more<00:05:23.220> what<00:05:23.700> are<00:05:23.730> called

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
and we have several more what are called

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.500 
and we have several more what are called
flutes<00:05:24.590> coming<00:05:25.590> down<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.010> set<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.060> just<00:05:27.270> the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
flutes coming down and set of just the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.780 
flutes coming down and set of just the
sort<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:27.900> two<00:05:28.260> that<00:05:28.919> we<00:05:29.040> have<00:05:29.190> on<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.400> drill<00:05:29.640> bit

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
sort of two that we have on a drill bit

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.750 
sort of two that we have on a drill bit
so<00:05:30.390> it's<00:05:30.540> got<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.919> tape<00:05:31.919> it<00:05:32.100> end<00:05:32.250> here<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.640> be

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
so it's got a tape it end here to be

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.110 
so it's got a tape it end here to be
held<00:05:33.030> with<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.740> slightly<00:05:34.740> tapered<00:05:35.130> end<00:05:35.280> here

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
held with and slightly tapered end here

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.780 
held with and slightly tapered end here
it's<00:05:36.780> tapered<00:05:37.229> so<00:05:37.410> when<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:37.710> enters<00:05:38.100> so<00:05:38.520> I<00:05:38.550> can

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
it's tapered so when it enters so I can

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.020 
it's tapered so when it enters so I can
enter<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.500> pre-drilled<00:05:40.500> hole<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.250> then<00:05:41.669> we<00:05:41.850> can

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
enter a pre-drilled hole and then we can

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.570 
enter a pre-drilled hole and then we can
use<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.240> reaming<00:05:42.720> tool<00:05:42.990> to<00:05:43.950> bring<00:05:44.190> it<00:05:44.310> up<00:05:44.400> to

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
use a reaming tool to bring it up to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.370 
use a reaming tool to bring it up to
size<00:05:44.820> so<00:05:45.270> for<00:05:45.300> instance<00:05:45.840> if<00:05:46.020> I'm<00:05:46.169> driving

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
size so for instance if I'm driving

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.030 
size so for instance if I'm driving
drilling<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.250> ten<00:05:47.490> millimeter<00:05:47.729> hole<00:05:48.530> will<00:05:49.530> will

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
drilling a ten millimeter hole will will

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.250 
drilling a ten millimeter hole will will
drill<00:05:50.310> out<00:05:50.580> a<00:05:50.610> hole<00:05:50.760> that's<00:05:51.180> nine<00:05:51.570> millimeters

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
drill out a hole that's nine millimeters

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.040 
drill out a hole that's nine millimeters
you<00:05:52.290> know<00:05:52.590> just<00:05:53.220> maybe<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:54.090> tenth<00:05:54.390> or<00:05:54.630> so<00:05:54.810> off

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
you know just maybe a tenth or so off

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.530 
you know just maybe a tenth or so off
the<00:05:55.290> right<00:05:55.500> size<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:56.190> then<00:05:57.000> we'll<00:05:57.150> use<00:05:57.330> our

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
the right size and then we'll use our

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.320 
the right size and then we'll use our
reaming<00:05:57.990> tool<00:05:58.229> to<00:05:58.770> bring<00:05:59.310> that<00:05:59.550> up<00:05:59.850> to<00:06:00.150> our

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
reaming tool to bring that up to our

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.120 
reaming tool to bring that up to our
exact<00:06:00.690> ten<00:06:00.930> millimeter<00:06:01.410> size<00:06:01.710> that<00:06:01.979> we're

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
exact ten millimeter size that we're

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.730 
exact ten millimeter size that we're
after<00:06:02.330> we<00:06:03.330> can<00:06:03.479> also<00:06:03.630> use<00:06:03.960> little<00:06:04.410> hand

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
after we can also use little hand

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.380 
after we can also use little hand
reaming<00:06:05.160> tools<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.790> that's<00:06:06.030> for<00:06:06.240> making

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
reaming tools and that's for making

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.650 
reaming tools and that's for making
standard<00:06:07.080> tapered<00:06:07.680> holes<00:06:07.890> and<00:06:08.240> in<00:06:09.240> these<00:06:09.419> sort

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
standard tapered holes and in these sort

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.780 
standard tapered holes and in these sort
of<00:06:09.720> holes<00:06:09.930> we<00:06:10.200> might<00:06:10.380> be<00:06:10.530> putting<00:06:10.860> pins<00:06:11.400> and

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
of holes we might be putting pins and

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.300 
of holes we might be putting pins and
that<00:06:12.210> sort<00:06:12.510> of<00:06:12.570> thing<00:06:12.780> through<00:06:13.320> we<00:06:14.010> can<00:06:14.160> also

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
that sort of thing through we can also

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.040 
that sort of thing through we can also
get<00:06:15.229> adjustable<00:06:16.229> diameter<00:06:16.740> Reema's<00:06:18.050> they're

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
get adjustable diameter Reema's they're

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.830 
get adjustable diameter Reema's they're
not<00:06:19.229> quite<00:06:19.919> so<00:06:20.310> common<00:06:20.790> and<00:06:21.030> we'll<00:06:21.360> generally

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
not quite so common and we'll generally

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.590 
not quite so common and we'll generally
just<00:06:21.990> go<00:06:22.229> and<00:06:22.440> have<00:06:22.740> different<00:06:23.250> bits<00:06:24.240> for

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
just go and have different bits for

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.000 
just go and have different bits for
different<00:06:25.200> diameters<00:06:26.630> but<00:06:27.630> we<00:06:27.780> can<00:06:28.020> using

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
different diameters but we can using

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.870 
different diameters but we can using
this<00:06:29.160> tool<00:06:29.780> effectively<00:06:30.780> create<00:06:31.290> any<00:06:31.880> size

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
this tool effectively create any size

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.400 
this tool effectively create any size
that<00:06:33.150> we<00:06:33.270> need<00:06:33.419> so<00:06:33.720> we<00:06:33.870> can<00:06:33.900> use<00:06:34.290> this<00:06:35.930> nuts<00:06:36.930> to

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
that we need so we can use this nuts to

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.590 
that we need so we can use this nuts to
bring<00:06:37.830> this<00:06:38.070> up<00:06:38.340> and<00:06:38.490> down

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
bring this up and down

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.260 
bring this up and down
and<00:06:39.920> gradually<00:06:40.920> create<00:06:41.340> slightly<00:06:41.940> different

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
and gradually create slightly different

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.250 
and gradually create slightly different
sizes<00:06:43.430> and<00:06:44.430> get<00:06:44.910> that<00:06:45.150> tool<00:06:45.420> to<00:06:45.450> the<00:06:45.780> size<00:06:45.990> that

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
sizes and get that tool to the size that

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.130 
sizes and get that tool to the size that
we<00:06:46.320> need<00:06:46.740> so<00:06:47.670> that<00:06:47.700> concludes<00:06:48.420> everything<00:06:48.960> on
