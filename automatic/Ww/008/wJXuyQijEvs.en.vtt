00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello, I want to tell you today 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.490
 how to issue a contract of purchase 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.840
 car sales and recently 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.980
 moment in the traffic police pretty strong 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.800
 simplified the whole thing and you no longer need 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 will go another region there 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.140
 sets transit is not some 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.760
 there are such nuances you will need 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.420
 it is necessary to issue a contract 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.140
 purchase and sale between the buyer and the corner 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.140
 buyer and seller 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.870
 I want to start right here I want to show 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.329
 how do you really need to arrange all this 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.420
 a business 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.960
 it all starts with the date yes there they put 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.590
 date then where it all happens then 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.989
 there is Moscow and yes yes and data 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.289
 surname name patronymic let's say ivanov 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.289
 Ivan Ivanovich 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.860
 This is the seller's data 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.610
 that is, last name, first name, middle name 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:17.909
 Where is the passport data all and by whom? 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.650
 Now when the second issued by the buyer and the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.740
 there is a buyer such such and such 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.360
 Nikolaev Nikolay Nikolaevich 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.570
 let's say lives in Nizhny Novgorod there 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.759
 Lenina house 5 paintings 2 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.360
 I would also like to tell you that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.259
 such here 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.930
 blots and corrections are not allowed in 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.049
 contract of sale because its 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.689
 thinks not really 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.530
 yet you will not be able to fill for example 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:52.250
 one part of the contract on the computer second 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.329
 handwritten part of the contract 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.159
 this contract also count 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.909
 really have to redo 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.909
 renews 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.660
 so the seller sold and the buyer bought and 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.110
 Here is the data of the car that is already coming 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.380
 brand model skoda roomster 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.590
 let's say this is all a matter of wine that is 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.940
 these are 17 numbers there and a letter that is numbers and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.650
 the letters are all mixed up the place next year 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.959
 release 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.430
 who can have the engine as was 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.140
 engine room cubists can 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.660
 put now in principle it is not necessary 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.470
 can put can put chassis 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.110
 we are missing the number 2 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.580
 chassis number are missing from us therefore we 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:53.060
 it does not write the body here is already such 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:58.430
 same color farther and specified 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.980
 Vehicles for as if the PTS that is, 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.180
 how would the seller have to show 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.709
 PTS and data do not have to fill you here 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.930
 this TCP and by whom when issued further a 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:17.360
 the price here let's say agreed there 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.910
 640000 here and write 640000 if 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.650
 car over 11 years old 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:29.630
 there in my taxes are not taken so here 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.220
 640,000 law specified car is valuable and 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:40.040
 Here you paid for it all checked 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:43.890
 all clearly put on his signature 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:49.470
 seller and initial. 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:52.560
 Ivanov Ivan Ivanovich for let's say and here you are 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.210
 everything checked matches living matches 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.800
 engine number 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.090
 now of course the engine number is no longer 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.230
 need to look anyway farther all u 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.100
 check on the document all exactly clear 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.500
 no problem this is all original TCP then 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.600
 there is no copy no anything that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.170
 I mean you like a car on 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:20.100
 there was no pledge where there ucun 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.130
 bank you this is no unnecessary problems 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.660
 are needed 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.450
 want the seller can and say there 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.690
 a lot of things that's all right there 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.770
 trailing I lost better of course I do not believe 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.350
 and 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:40.740
 and then that you did not have to arise 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.510
 there are problems with banks there 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.390
 maybe this car is a credit 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.550
 then everything checked everything clearly everything is exactly 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.210
 not broken not painted there all signed 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:00.090
 put his painting 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:03.500
 handed the money signed on 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.270
 the order of your actions you must 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.500
 parade well, how would the seller have 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.550
 sign on the very bts bts he 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.610
 signs off 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.930
 about what he really sold 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.660
 the car is the former former owner 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.320
 enroll and you have to enter yourself as 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.660
 new host surname and patronymic 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.120
 passport data there karst passport 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.840
 data in TCP 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.490
 and go further and further and the contract 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.150
 the sale is made in three 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.460
 copies of one copy you give 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.160
 the seller 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.990
 the second copy you keep for yourself 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.990
 the third copy you give in gbdd 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:54.630
 for registration hybrids you just 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.449
 You will need this statement in the traffic police and 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:07.039
 for registration further agreement 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:09.800
 sale and purchase insurance TCP 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:14.760
 well, if you will of course 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:17.400
 set well as if new numbers 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.830
 you will have to pay 2000 if you 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 will stay on the old clock rooms 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.380
 Under the law, it is possible for them 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.180
 Now there is a single base and in principle 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.900
 nothing so terrible is not what you 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:37.200
 you will for example go lower 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:41.180
 Novgorod on a car with car numbers 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.710
 Moscow nothing wrong there and there 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.660
 Now we have a lot of principle 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.400
 cars that are driven from different 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.690
 regions 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.169
 for cost savings people 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:56.910
 simply do not install well not 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:07:00.449
 pay 2000 to change numbers 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.199
 This region of its permissible and goes 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.889
 on the region 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:08.250
 the volume that is so cheaper and easier 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.340
 it costs 500 rubles all with 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.020
 reissuance 2000 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.599
 if you will get new numbers 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:22.289
 if old leave it 500 rubles it 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:26.770
 everything will be all worth it if you like it 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:29.390

 Good luck to you if you decide to buy 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:39.350
 car 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:41.380

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.380
 mistakes
