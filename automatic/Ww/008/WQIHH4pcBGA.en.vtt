I still go up there first pitch swinging

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.790 
I still go up there first pitch swinging
because<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> winner<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.230> that's<00:00:40.590> what

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
because I'm a winner and that's what

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.319 
because I'm a winner and that's what
winners<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.430> winners<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.390> me<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.870> Jay<00:00:43.170> Bell

experience<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.610> particular<00:01:14.820> version

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
experience with this particular version

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
experience with this particular version
and<00:01:15.900> frankly<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> franchise<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and frankly with this franchise on a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.539 
and frankly with this franchise on a
16-bit<00:01:18.900> console<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.590> although<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
16-bit console and although it's the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179 
16-bit console and although it's the
same<00:01:20.790> awesome<00:01:21.479> baseball<00:01:22.020> game<00:01:22.259> at<00:01:22.409> its<00:01:22.530> core<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
same awesome baseball game at its core I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.700 
same awesome baseball game at its core I
actually<00:01:23.790> prefer<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.420> older<00:01:24.930> versions<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
actually prefer the older versions and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.289 
actually prefer the older versions and
there<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> few<00:01:26.340> reasons<00:01:26.580> why

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.990 

RBI<00:01:36.299> baseball<00:01:37.110> 94<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.130> second<00:01:38.670> game<00:01:38.850> in

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
RBI baseball 94 was the second game in

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
RBI baseball 94 was the second game in
the<00:01:39.030> series<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.750> use<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.290> year<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.920> its

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the series to use the year for its

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
the series to use the year for its
subtitle<00:01:41.670> having<00:01:42.150> dropped<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.690> numerical

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
subtitle having dropped the numerical

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.999 
subtitle having dropped the numerical
sequels<00:01:43.890> after<00:01:44.460> 1992<00:01:45.180> s<00:01:45.450> RBI<00:01:46.050> baseball<00:01:46.619> for

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
sequels after 1992 s RBI baseball for

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.389 
sequels after 1992 s RBI baseball for
but<00:01:47.670> there's<00:01:47.880> more<00:01:48.149> separating<00:01:48.899> RBI<00:01:49.350> 94<00:01:50.190> from

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
but there's more separating RBI 94 from

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.190 
but there's more separating RBI 94 from
the<00:01:50.520> games<00:01:50.700> preceding<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.170> most

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the games preceding it and for the most

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.399 
the games preceding it and for the most
parts<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.280> has<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:53.850> aesthetics<00:01:54.450> now

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
parts that has to do with aesthetics now

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.980 
parts that has to do with aesthetics now
in<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.770> opinion<00:01:55.920> games<00:01:56.610> from<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.970> 16-bit<00:01:57.720> era

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
in my opinion games from the 16-bit era

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
in my opinion games from the 16-bit era
have<00:01:58.500> aged<00:01:58.710> better<00:01:58.979> than<00:01:59.280> any<00:01:59.430> other<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.909> mean

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
have aged better than any other I mean

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.779 
have aged better than any other I mean
an<00:02:00.270> older<00:02:00.660> game<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.229> now<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.340> look<00:02:02.460> old

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
an older game can now can just look old

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.400 
an older game can now can just look old
and<00:02:03.090> frankly<00:02:03.509> there<00:02:03.690> are<00:02:03.780> plenty<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.110> newer

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
and frankly there are plenty of newer

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.109 
and frankly there are plenty of newer
games<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.490> don't<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.880> same

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
games that just don't have the same

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.830 
games that just don't have the same
visual<00:02:06.840> polish<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.649> timeless<00:02:08.610> charm<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:09.330> some

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
visual polish and timeless charm of some

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.190 
visual polish and timeless charm of some
16-bit<00:02:10.590> games<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:11.430> obviously<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.660> makes

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
16-bit games and so obviously it makes

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.130 
16-bit games and so obviously it makes
sense<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.769> RBI<00:02:14.160> Baseball<00:02:14.819> 94<00:02:15.540> would

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
sense that RBI Baseball 94 would

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.860 
sense that RBI Baseball 94 would
emphasize<00:02:16.709> those<00:02:17.040> unfortunately<00:02:18.000> that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
emphasize those unfortunately that

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.900 
emphasize those unfortunately that
emphasis<00:02:19.560> gets<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.100> way<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.430> gameplay

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
emphasis gets in the way of the gameplay

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.530 
emphasis gets in the way of the gameplay
just<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.660> bit<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:23.010> gone<00:02:23.340> are<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.610> basic<00:02:24.060> ones<00:02:24.269> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
just a bit so gone are the basic ones of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.570 
just a bit so gone are the basic ones of
earlier<00:02:24.870> games<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.620> their<00:02:25.769> place<00:02:26.100> are

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
earlier games and in their place are

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.850 
earlier games and in their place are
some<00:02:26.880> slick<00:02:27.269> new<00:02:27.300> player<00:02:27.840> sprites<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.739> also

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
some slick new player sprites you also

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.949 
some slick new player sprites you also
have<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> pixelated<00:02:30.060> portraits<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
have the pixelated portraits of the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.680 
have the pixelated portraits of the
actual<00:02:31.500> big<00:02:31.769> league<00:02:32.010> players<00:02:32.370> which<00:02:33.060> pop<00:02:33.480> up

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
actual big league players which pop up

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.390 
actual big league players which pop up
during<00:02:33.870> each<00:02:34.140> at-bat<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.920> were<00:02:35.070> probably

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
during each at-bat and were probably

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.750 
during each at-bat and were probably

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
can't run in zigzags in this game and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.979 
can't run in zigzags in this game and
frankly<00:02:46.410> he<00:02:46.560> looks<00:02:47.160> pissed<00:02:47.459> about<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.030> of

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
frankly he looks pissed about it of

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.350 
frankly he looks pissed about it of
course<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:49.590> such<00:02:49.769> fancy<00:02:50.400> new<00:02:50.549> graphics<00:02:51.150> you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
course with such fancy new graphics you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.850 
course with such fancy new graphics you
want<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.630> show<00:02:51.810> them<00:02:51.989> off<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.680> this

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
want to show them off and so this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.250 
want to show them off and so this
version<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.430> RBI<00:02:53.850> baseball<00:02:54.540> has<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.019> much

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
version of RBI baseball has a much

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.380 
version of RBI baseball has a much
tighter<00:02:55.620> camera<00:02:56.250> than<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.459> older<00:02:56.940> versions

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
tighter camera than the older versions

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.479 
tighter camera than the older versions
which<00:02:57.840> makes<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.380> players<00:02:58.650> look<00:02:58.980> bigger<00:02:59.340> and

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
which makes the players look bigger and

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.090 
which makes the players look bigger and
more<00:02:59.730> detailed<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.140> at<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.650> cost<00:03:01.890> of

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
more detailed but at the cost of

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:13.710 
more detailed but at the cost of
gameplay

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.450 

you<00:03:14.720> see<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.990> camera<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:15.590> tight<00:03:15.920> in<00:03:16.100> fact

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
you see the camera is so tight in fact

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.850 
you see the camera is so tight in fact
that<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:17.000> can't<00:03:17.330> really<00:03:17.450> play<00:03:17.780> defense<00:03:18.380> your

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
that you can't really play defense your

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.730 
that you can't really play defense your
team<00:03:19.100> just<00:03:19.750> automatically<00:03:20.750> plays<00:03:21.170> defense

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
team just automatically plays defense

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.950 
team just automatically plays defense
and<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.100> sort<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.490> just<00:03:22.760> throw<00:03:23.240> to<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.510> bases

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
and you sort of just throw to the bases

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.960 
and you sort of just throw to the bases
but<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.380> problem<00:03:24.830> is<00:03:25.010> when<00:03:25.550> there's<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.790> hit

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
but the problem is when there's a hit

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.230 
but the problem is when there's a hit
they<00:03:26.180> can't<00:03:26.510> play<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:28.040> can't<00:03:28.340> tell<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:28.970> you're

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
they can't play you can't tell so you're

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.790 
they can't play you can't tell so you're
you're<00:03:29.690> waiting<00:03:30.050> for<00:03:30.260> them<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.530> make<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
you're waiting for them to make the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.830 
you're waiting for them to make the
automatic<00:03:31.370> play<00:03:31.670> because<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.540> can't

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
automatic play because you can't

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.110 
automatic play because you can't
freaking<00:03:33.290> see<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.010> when<00:03:34.220> they<00:03:34.370> don't<00:03:34.670> that's

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
freaking see and when they don't that's

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.980 
freaking see and when they don't that's
an<00:03:35.300> automatic<00:03:35.480> double<00:03:36.380> for<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.710> opposition

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
an automatic double for the opposition

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.660 
an automatic double for the opposition
again<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.140> gameplay<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.770> basically<00:03:40.430> still

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
again the gameplay is basically still

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.240 
again the gameplay is basically still
the<00:03:40.790> same<00:03:41.000> as<00:03:41.180> prior<00:03:41.510> versions<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:43.010> still

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
the same as prior versions so it's still

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.790 
the same as prior versions so it's still
an<00:03:43.370> outstanding<00:03:43.790> game<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.690> retro<00:03:45.230> baseball

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
an outstanding game of retro baseball

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.820 
an outstanding game of retro baseball
but<00:03:46.280> these<00:03:46.460> changes<00:03:47.230> most<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.410> which<00:03:48.560> seem<00:03:48.800> to

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
but these changes most of which seem to

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.010 
but these changes most of which seem to
be<00:03:48.980> based<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.460> the<00:03:49.790> aesthetic<00:03:50.300> improvement<00:03:50.930> of

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
be based on the aesthetic improvement of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.650 
be based on the aesthetic improvement of
the<00:03:51.140> 16-bit<00:03:51.680> era<00:03:51.920> actually<00:03:52.550> get<00:03:53.300> in<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.510> way

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
the 16-bit era actually get in the way

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.720 
the 16-bit era actually get in the way
the<00:03:54.260> formula<00:03:54.500> for<00:03:54.860> this<00:03:54.950> franchise<00:03:55.250> was

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
the formula for this franchise was

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.170 
the formula for this franchise was
always<00:03:56.030> simplicity<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.870> as<00:03:57.200> RBI<00:03:57.710> baseball<00:03:58.430> 94

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
always simplicity and as RBI baseball 94

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.310 
always simplicity and as RBI baseball 94
proved<00:03:59.650> sometimes<00:04:00.650> simpler<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.160> better
