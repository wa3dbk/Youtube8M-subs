00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.690
 now he is right here 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.250
 safety conditions over the terrain 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.019
 What is the current status ? 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 actually everything prepared so 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.480
 Safety concept is indeed accepted 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 and now we will be the same 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.949
 See if we fulfill what we all do 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.199
 together the fire department police the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.410
 community and have come up with it 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.410
 it works 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.400
 what do you have to do now? 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.070
 especially worthy of security so 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.810
 right here in the freewheeling area is 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.440
 involved about how many people here 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.520
 allowed 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 The area is not even 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.040
 decisive there is space here without end 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.530
 It is about the fact that you also escape 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.480
 it has to prove that it has to be broad 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.400
 keep everything accurately documented in form 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.720
 this safety concept is and was there 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.010
 that's how much people approach 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.199
 we may on underneath fluchtweg 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.030
 weitrain leave and if we now 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.809
 taken the normal entrance gates 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 may have had would be in 2501 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.790
 but here is the community with 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.979
 supported by then just said 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.640
 to have 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.130
 we'll make another sound like that and 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.880
 now as 6300 people can go here 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.740
 and that is organized in that way 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.600
 we just count the numbers and once 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.240
 this number is reached then only 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.810
 then other visitors move up if 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:37.299
 again which are expected to go out 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.560
 always the same that is the weather of the 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.969
 Rest will be running 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.250
 quite simply i am looking forward to the 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.329
 other small community but i believe 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.329
 that will be really good 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.509
 yes the lipper days were unfortunately 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.350
 in between times through rain 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.789
 interrupted 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.380
 how annoying is that now so im 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.909
 in retrospect, looking back, too 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.770
 if I do not have coco right now 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.170
 more annoying the hour was over 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.609
 annoying only now it just feels 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.350
 everything is wonderful again 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.299
 That's what you got at the opening party 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.379
 this is exactly the resonance 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.410
 the tasks 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.849
 yes absolutely it was full many many many 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.530
 Children what we hoped for 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:28.459
 this end game so i find it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:29.989
 Great is also so slow now 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.390
 a little tense off if it is now 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.069
 so start now after the official 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.640
 opening is the first stone 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.670
 like 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.810
 Everything is fine to keep it dry 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.160
 had to do the stage again 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.109
 be specially equipped that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.800
 stefanie heinzmann of course she comes 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.820
 has a big one 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.830
 challenge or request 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.870
 As far as technology is concerned, that's it 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.310
 an order of magnitude yes that is not 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.380
 small maybe another message 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.510
 which order of magnitude is that one can 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.160
 do not say that's it 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.840
 bigger stars though they are not 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.790
 but quite as big is the stage 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.080
 requirements is already great what 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.390
 the light and the technology are concerned 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.340
 how great is the anticipation of the east 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.200
 we can go to the stage right now 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:16.600
 and can even look at what he still the same 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.760
 on the stage here is general 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.110
 very busy in the main deck of today 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.810
 evening then surely you in the stefanie 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.800
 heinzmann I net this very nice so 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.870
 I 've been short before 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.060
 and that is really 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.580
 super personable from Switzerland and 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.500
 that is really good on it here at 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.820
 The lipper days are now live 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.310
 situation that is a bit different 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.510
 as in the studio you are there again something 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.370
 tense than usual 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.110
 it's a bit tense because 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.640
 you do not know how are the people like that 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.920
 on the stand in front of the stage 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.750
 what do people expect from a man? 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.560
 yes has this direct contact 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.840
 to the audience 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.730
 radio yes you can see the people just 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 we are not alone most of the time 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.730
 maybe still the studio 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.200
 news editor but that 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.330
 it was then and here you have stop 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.830
 the direct reactions of the people 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.300
 any sayings on any 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.900
 text and that's something else again 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.940
 other 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.160
 how are you when you are or how is that 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.040
 if you spontaneously respond to the reactions of 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.920
 People have to react like they do now 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.390
 your question yes so someday you get 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.040
 yes yes i do not want to say routine though 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.630
 it is so we do not do it first 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.280
 Sometimes you have certain situations 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.940
 you know that already then you can 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.320
 react 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.600
 but you always have to be very individual 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.160
 So you have to look what 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.169
 Can I do something with them now? 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.120
 not how many people are there now and 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.620
 That is from situation to situation 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.400
 different things always do 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.140
 a lot of fun , of course, is called 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.400
 great joy for the effort you make yourself 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.110
 the whole month has done if you 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.120
 this looks like we have the same 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.120
 a big highlight in front of us 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.209
 Munich 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.600
 With 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.930
 No
