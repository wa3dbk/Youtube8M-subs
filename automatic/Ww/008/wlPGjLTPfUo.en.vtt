00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and you can see I make mine bigger at

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
and you can see I make mine bigger at
least<00:00:45.270> three<00:00:45.539> times<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.530> plants<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:46.980> not

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
going to be planned like this this was

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to be planned like this this was
just<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> could<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.770> size<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
just so that I could see the size of the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.660 
just so that I could see the size of the
hole<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.780> also<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.039> red<00:00:53.309> clay

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
hole you can also see all the red clay

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
hole you can also see all the red clay
this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> deal<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.050> when<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> garden

is<00:00:57.360> red<00:00:57.690> clay<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.649> bit

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
is red clay up here it's a little bit

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.500

here it's not rocket science and what

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.199 
here it's not rocket science and what
I'm<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> do<00:02:10.470> next<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.950> take<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
I'm going to do next is take all the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.610 
I'm going to do next is take all the
soil<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:12.959> here

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
soil that I have here

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.550 
soil that I have here
and<00:02:13.709> mix<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.519> about<00:02:14.760> 50%<00:02:15.090> peat<00:02:15.629> moss<00:02:15.780> fill

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and mix it in about 50% peat moss fill

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.729 
and mix it in about 50% peat moss fill
the<00:02:16.680> hole<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.280> then<00:02:17.370> I'll<00:02:17.519> show<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.819> how<00:02:18.629> I

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
the hole up and then I'll show you how I

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.839 
the hole up and then I'll show you how I
plant<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.860> blueberry<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.370> there<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.730> what

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
plant the blueberry in there to what

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.710 
plant the blueberry in there to what
depth<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.209> goes<00:02:22.940> now<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.000> fill<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.390> hole<00:02:24.540> up

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
depth it goes now I fill the hole up

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.930 
depth it goes now I fill the hole up
it's<00:02:25.170> about<00:02:25.409> 50%<00:02:25.769> peat<00:02:26.250> moss<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.459> again<00:02:26.819> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's about 50% peat moss and again the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.539 
it's about 50% peat moss and again the
peat<00:02:27.180> moss<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.659> acidic<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.830> blueberries<00:02:29.370> like

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
peat moss is acidic in blueberries like

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.369 
peat moss is acidic in blueberries like
acidity<00:02:30.420> that's<00:02:30.569> why<00:02:30.750> you're<00:02:30.870> using<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.260> much

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
acidity that's why you're using so much

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.589 
acidity that's why you're using so much
peat<00:02:31.680> moss<00:02:31.799> they<00:02:32.549> also<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:33.000> well-drained

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
peat moss they also like well-drained

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.530 
peat moss they also like well-drained
soil<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.170> part<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.730> my<00:02:35.730> strategy<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.209> planning

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
soil so part of my strategy in planning

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.509 
soil so part of my strategy in planning
this<00:02:36.599> is<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.260> hill<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.980> water<00:02:38.220> doesn't

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
this is on the hill the water doesn't

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.970 
this is on the hill the water doesn't
sit<00:02:38.849> here<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.480> peat<00:02:39.720> my<00:02:39.870> peat<00:02:40.409> moss<00:02:40.590> will<00:02:40.829> keep

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
sit here the peat my peat moss will keep

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.860 
sit here the peat my peat moss will keep
moisture<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.610> plant<00:02:41.879> but<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.599> will<00:02:42.690> get

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
moisture for the plant but it will get

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.039 
moisture for the plant but it will get
what<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.140> needs<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> filled<00:02:44.579> up<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> hole

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
what it needs so I filled up the hole

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:51.009 
what it needs so I filled up the hole
you<00:02:46.049> dig<00:02:46.260> out<00:02:46.410> enough<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:48.890> get<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> plant<00:02:50.280> ball

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
you dig out enough to get the plant ball

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.539 
you dig out enough to get the plant ball
into<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.290> earth<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.859> gently<00:02:53.190> want<00:02:53.459> to

you're going to plant it right to here

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.170 
you're going to plant it right to here
you<00:03:06.659> don't<00:03:06.870> want<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.319> plant<00:03:07.680> over<00:03:08.159> the<00:03:08.819> top<00:03:09.030> of

you don't want to plant over the top of
the<00:03:09.239> plant<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:10.560> can't<00:03:11.340> put<00:03:11.519> mulch<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:11.879> here

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
the plant I can't put mulch on here

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.000 
the plant I can't put mulch on here
because<00:03:12.180> when<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> rains<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.930> washes<00:03:13.319> out<00:03:13.500> but

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
because when it rains it washes out but

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.610 
because when it rains it washes out but
you<00:03:14.159> could<00:03:14.310> plant<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.970> maybe<00:03:15.440> another<00:03:16.440> this

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
you could plant this maybe another this

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.319 
you could plant this maybe another this
far<00:03:16.859> into<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.250> ground<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.760> then<00:03:17.910> mulch<00:03:18.150> over

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
far into the ground and then mulch over

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.390 
far into the ground and then mulch over
it<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.690> nature<00:03:18.989> too<00:03:19.169> but<00:03:19.980> I'm<00:03:20.069> just<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.370> to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
it for nature too but I'm just going to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.599 
it for nature too but I'm just going to
put<00:03:20.579> down<00:03:20.760> soil<00:03:21.299> so<00:03:21.900> once<00:03:22.079> it's<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.609> just

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
put down soil so once it's in just

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:35.869 
put down soil so once it's in just
backfill<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.599> plant<00:03:30.870> pack<00:03:31.859> it<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:34.879> and

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
backfill just the plant pack it in and

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.789 
backfill just the plant pack it in and
then<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.359> would<00:03:36.480> water<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:37.019> really<00:03:37.349> soak<00:03:37.650> it

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
then you would water this really soak it
