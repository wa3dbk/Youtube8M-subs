00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.310
I love the fact that all stitches can have
changes for their width and their length.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.130
When you pick a stitch depending on the fabric
you pick in the sewing advisor, the stitch

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.630
length will start at maybe 2, 2 1/2 or stitch
length of 3.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.580
This is the stitch length.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.750
When I pick a stitch for example a zigzag,
you'll notice that its length is 4.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.640
Now when you keep going with this, you are
going to notice that 4 is the length that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.851
it takes to get to the start of the next zigzag.

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:41.630
It is actually going to be 2mm this way and
2mm this way for a total of 4.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.120
When you start to change it, you are going
to notice that your numbers turn red.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.960
Red means that you have taken it off the default
setting.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.140
You can make it really long and you can change
this while you are sewing.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.280
It is really nice you can get it to be just
right just by touching it and looking at it

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.590
while you are sewing it out.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.299
Now the quickest way to clear this out is
to re-select the same stitch on your screen.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.680
Instead of me going minus minus, I can touch
stitch 11 and it will return me back to the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.780
solid color of black for that number and make
it go back to where the default setting is.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.329
Now another thing you can do for length is
also then change the width.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:27.219
Your machine can go up to a total of 7mm wide
for all these stitches and you can change

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.500
both length and width together.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.139
I have noticed that this screen here is actual
size.

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.929
If you wanted to make sure that was about,
if that is what you are going to get, how

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:38.929
big it is going to be.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.079
It is nice to know what you are going to get
before, if you are more visual this screen

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.159
is definitely for you.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.689
Once again returning it back or clearing it.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.200
Also let's go to a different stitch just for,
fine we will just randomly pick a stitch,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.090
how about a like a feather stitch here, and
this is from the quilt stitches.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.459
Once again 9mm is how long it takes to repeat
the stitch and we can go ahead and make it

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.459
longer.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.240
It is already at the widest, the only change
we'd be able to do would actually be to make

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.670
it narrower.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.379
I am always like bold is better, we'll leave
it at the width.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.530
Now keep in mind that some of these stitches,
let me get to some of the really big ones

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.409
here in the K menu.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.590
When you pick these stitches, you are going
to notice the stitch itself is wider than

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.040
the foot and it has you change to foot S.
S is that really big foot in your accessory

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.939
box, it is bigger than your standard A foot.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.879
With that bigger and then the stitch is bigger
than that foot, you are going to notice it's

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.930
23mm wide.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.319
Once again that is the widest.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.049
You can narrow it down and then it also gives
you the length that is 27mm long from pattern

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.719
begin to the end of the pattern.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:57.120
If you are planning out how many you need
within an area, that is how you are going

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.780
to gauge for your stitch length.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.340
You can make it a little longer, just spread
those out but you have that chance as well.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.129
Wow, that was getting really big, 36mm long
and 23mm wide.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.129
That is awesome.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.670
Now if you are not familiar with millimeters,
if you look right down along the bottom part

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.489
of your machine, there is an inches to millimeter
to metric kind of conversion down here and

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.689
you can kind of take a peek and get an idea
of how big that actually is going to be.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.250
Once again if you want to get back to a regular
stitch, your stitch length and width can be

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.729
changed at any time.
