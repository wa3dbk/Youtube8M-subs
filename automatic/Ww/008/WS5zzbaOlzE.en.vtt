new version includes advanced race

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
new version includes advanced race
controls<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.879> we've<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.179> added<00:00:48.359> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
controls and we've actually added the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
controls and we've actually added the
self-tuning<00:00:49.170> option<00:00:49.679> to<00:00:49.769> exit<00:00:50.010> by<00:00:50.129> 2<00:00:50.190> point<00:00:50.579> 0

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
engineers at the traxxas you're

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
engineers at the traxxas you're
gathering<00:00:54.210> information<00:00:54.690> listening<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
gathering information listening to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.919 
gathering information listening to
racers<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> we've<00:00:56.640> answered<00:00:56.879> their<00:00:57.210> their

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
racers and we've answered their their

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.259 
racers and we've answered their their
requests<00:00:58.710> let's<00:00:59.370> talk<00:00:59.519> about<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> software

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
requests let's talk about the software

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.000 
requests let's talk about the software
for<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> second<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.379> some<00:01:01.589> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.769> extra

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
for a second what are some of the extra

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
for a second what are some of the extra
parameters<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:02.909> totally<00:01:03.570> it's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
parameters that you can now totally it's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.870 
parameters that you can now totally it's
really<00:01:04.170> expanded<00:01:04.890> controls<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.670> boost

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
really expanded controls for the boost

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.450 
really expanded controls for the boost
and<00:01:06.360> staging<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.409> launching<00:01:07.860> application

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and staging and launching application

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
and staging and launching application
for<00:01:08.640> racing<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.480> lot<00:01:09.660> of<00:01:09.720> extra

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
for racing so there's a lot of extra

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.280 
for racing so there's a lot of extra
controls<00:01:10.560> there's<00:01:10.860> fine-tuned<00:01:11.520> controls

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
controls there's fine-tuned controls

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.450 
controls there's fine-tuned controls
basically<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.410> you're<00:01:13.560> running<00:01:13.710> boost<00:01:14.130> you're

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
basically if you're running boost you're

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640 
basically if you're running boost you're
running<00:01:14.730> a<00:01:14.990> nitrous<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.170> anything<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
running a nitrous or anything like that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.160 
running a nitrous or anything like that
this<00:01:17.490> would<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> way<00:01:18.120> to<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:19.050> what

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this would be the way to go and what

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.110 
this would be the way to go and what
about<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.440> hog<00:01:19.620> with<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.490> hardware<00:01:20.730> stays

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
about the hog with the hardware stays

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.970 
about the hog with the hardware stays
the<00:01:21.300> same<00:01:21.510> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.870> a<00:01:21.930> firmware<00:01:22.260> update<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
the same this is a firmware update so

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.190 
the same this is a firmware update so
it's<00:01:23.130> an<00:01:23.250> easy<00:01:23.340> thing<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> update<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.300> offer<00:01:24.480> a

it's an easy thing to update we offer a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.170 
it's an easy thing to update we offer a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.140 
will include the two point oh tell me
about<00:01:31.920> some<00:01:32.160> of<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.310> new<00:01:32.340> technology<00:01:32.970> that's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
about some of the new technology that's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
about some of the new technology that's
involved<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.870> one<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> most<00:01:34.380> important

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
involved but one of the most important

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.770 
involved but one of the most important
features<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.460> new<00:01:35.490> x-fi<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.630> this

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
features of the new x-fi is that this

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
features of the new x-fi is that this
one<00:01:36.960> will<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.080> control<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.800> variable

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
one will actually control the variable

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.400 
one will actually control the variable
valve<00:01:38.520> camshafts<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.900> believe<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
valve camshafts so that's I believe the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.020 
valve camshafts so that's I believe the
only<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> aftermarket<00:01:41.370> now<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.880> has

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
only one in the aftermarket now that has

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.490 
only one in the aftermarket now that has
the<00:01:42.270> tables<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> capabilities<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the tables and the capabilities to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.710 
the tables and the capabilities to
control<00:01:43.950> those<00:01:44.100> cams<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.420> another

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
control those cams you have another
