it<00:01:32.590> which<00:01:32.800> is<00:01:32.950> cutting<00:01:33.160> each<00:01:33.399> strip<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.700> I've

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
it which is cutting each strip so I've

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.160 
it which is cutting each strip so I've
cut<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.000> piece<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.330> cardboard<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.959> length
