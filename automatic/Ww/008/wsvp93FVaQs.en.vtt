00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 with helios is apple brought control 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.970
 center on your iphone and that gives that and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.589
 me with this video ben I will try 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.260
 to show you how to bring it on 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.790
 your mac and it gives that level 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.290
 design marks directly that it is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.240
 really very like control 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.529
 center that we find on ios but at 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.660
 level features we'll see that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.920
 it's very very good too 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.539
 so in fact this control center is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.920
 present in two parts there is that of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.210
 above that is more or less this one 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.980
 is the one from below that ends up 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.900
 so we'll start with the top 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.519
 here we can display the hard drives 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.669
 who are connected enable or disable 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.850
 the mode does not disturb the wifi the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.620
 bluetooth is here adjust the brightness 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.840
 or the sound we'll see right after that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.550
 we will talk about preferences 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.899
 below we have here music as 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 so you see it that's with all 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.059
 the small basic controls a referent 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.340
 previous following the breaks and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 company so here we have a small 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.600
 very very interesting feature 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.030
 which displays the cpu the ram as well as the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.410
 ip local and public and the speed of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 download and pads so that's 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.129
 really I find a very very good 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 weight then we have everything that is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 watchmaking sihh the world clocks 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.590
 so you can display multiple 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.369
 clocks following regions 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.500
 geographical 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 here we have an alarm clock so good because 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.439
 it's interesting or not to have a 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.890
 wake up on his mac it was a little to 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.990
 you to see 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.610
 and if we have a stopwatch that works 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 very very well so has everything that is 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.830
 here it's really functional and finally 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 we have here a timer can for example 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.570
 put the engine on five minutes 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.540
 and here we just have to click on start and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 this part we also have a lot of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.960
 little features here that we can 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.610
 turn on or off then what that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 does it just that it activates where 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.390
 it disables terminal commands via 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.180
 this interface 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.280
 on the other hand at that level it bug sometimes 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.810
 it can happen that the application starts 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.909
 to spit because of these little tricks 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.700
 so here it is necessary to arrive at doser a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.470
 little but otherwise it's nice enough and for 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.210
 finish here we have a little notebook or a 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 checkbook if you die you can 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.590
 write a little what you want 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.850
 for example that's what I propose to you 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.470
 now it's going to see at the level 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.940
 preferences you see that here we have 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.660
 a small icon that appears in the 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.310
 menu bar 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.860
 and if we click on it we have them 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 preferences that appears then there is 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.460
 a lot of small adjustments you can 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.760
 choose the location of the control 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.200
 center on the screen choose the top slider 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.520
 so for example has risen from what 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.500
 I was just talking to you here I told you 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.080
 we could put the brightness but 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.840
 if I choose volume here well that but 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.610
 the volume instead 1 here is also 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.720
 all the little classic settings by 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.060
 example start at startup 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.070
 we can choose here the keyboard shortcut 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.450
 allowing the display is like me 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.340
 in 2d but you can change it very 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.980
 just by clicking right here to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.780
 that checker for object and there we have the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.420
 consciousness does not kill where we can 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.360
 informs that we can display the control 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.500
 center with three fingers on the trackpad 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.910
 we also have a series of other 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 graphical preferences where one can choose 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.120
 the theme for example of the control center 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.780
 acquired at choosing the level of 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.790
 flakes in the shade so far we can 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.680
 also show or hide small 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.480
 round and if he choose different 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.380
 colors 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.209
 so you have to know that in fact it's 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.790
 a trial version that's free the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.950
 paid version costs $ 10 anyway and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.540
 by the way if you launch the application 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.340
 you will notice that at startup 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.860
 she will ask you if you want 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.140
 buy it or not and if you do not want 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.580
 you do not have to know that you have 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.739
 when you use it there is actually 7 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.480
 days of use in demo version 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.910
 there I am only ten days hence 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.209
 just click here so I can 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.290
 use my control center 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.910
 here I hope this little video 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.500
 you will have more than this little control 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.640

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.580
 previous video by clicking on the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.500
 thumbnail that appears 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.180
 I make you a big kiss in 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.950
 particular to jailbreak style that me 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.090
 allowed to discover this trick I you 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.570

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.110
 video 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.110
 Hi 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.110
 for those who would like to have a 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.360
 final control center on their mac 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.200
 so not just a trial version 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.460
 limited in time 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.410
 you have to know that there are others 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.810
 Pay alternatives but cheaper 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.550
 on the mac app store so if you type 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.850
 control center on the mac app store it 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.540
 are there control centers with a s here that 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.070
 cost 4 almost 4 euros good ago 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.750
 a lot less features you 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.549
 just have the music the brightness of 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.440
 stuff like that and if you also have 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.060
 stronger controls itunes and a 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.760
 controller die tunes for the bar of 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.930
 menus this time but with small 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.390
 more features like a 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.890
 stopwatch I think like that it's 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.020
 clear that it's a lot less complicated 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.980
 control center that I showed you my 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.980
 was also much cheaper
