00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.399 
banding or gastric bypass essentially
there<00:01:21.340> are<00:01:21.369> two<00:01:22.090> main<00:01:22.450> types<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.930> procedure

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
there are two main types of procedure

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.190 
there are two main types of procedure
you<00:01:23.710> can<00:01:23.950> have<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.490> improve<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.329> area<00:01:25.689> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
you can have to improve this area the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.649 
you can have to improve this area the
first<00:01:26.439> is<00:01:26.650> liposuction<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:28.119> second<00:01:28.509> is

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
first is liposuction and the second is

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.819 
first is liposuction and the second is
tightening<00:01:29.530> up<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.979> skin<00:01:31.259> via<00:01:32.259> some<00:01:32.590> type

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
tightening up of the skin via some type

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.630 
tightening up of the skin via some type
of<00:01:33.009> skin<00:01:33.850> removal<00:01:34.780> now<00:01:35.530> liposuction<00:01:36.399> is

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
of skin removal now liposuction is

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.730 
of skin removal now liposuction is
really<00:01:36.909> suitable<00:01:37.240> if<00:01:37.540> it's<00:01:37.780> mainly<00:01:38.200> fatty

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
really suitable if it's mainly fatty

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.090 
really suitable if it's mainly fatty
tissue<00:01:39.100> so<00:01:39.880> if<00:01:40.090> it's<00:01:40.299> sort<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.140> fat<00:01:41.710> fatty

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
tissue so if it's sort of fat fatty

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.510 
tissue so if it's sort of fat fatty
tissue<00:01:42.430> rather<00:01:42.880> than<00:01:43.210> skin<00:01:43.840> excess

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
tissue rather than skin excess

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.340 
tissue rather than skin excess
liposuction<00:01:45.520> may<00:01:45.670> well<00:01:45.880> be<00:01:46.030> for<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.360> if<00:01:47.020> its

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
liposuction may well be for you if its

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.800 
liposuction may well be for you if its
skin<00:01:47.680> excess<00:01:48.399> so<00:01:48.939> you<00:01:49.210> havin<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.630> much

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
skin excess so you havin got that much

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.069 
skin excess so you havin got that much
tissue<00:01:50.079> down<00:01:50.380> or<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.189> lost<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.509> fatty<00:01:52.719> air

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.279 
skin tightening procedure and I'm going
to<00:02:05.829> talk<00:02:05.979> about<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:07.030> different<00:02:07.750> types<00:02:07.930> of

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
to talk about the different types of

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.860 
to talk about the different types of
procedure<00:02:08.740> in<00:02:09.610> subsequent<00:02:10.330> videos<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:11.410> Miss

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
procedure in subsequent videos in Miss

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.040 
procedure in subsequent videos in Miss
so<00:02:13.870> essentially<00:02:14.370> arm<00:02:15.370> reduction<00:02:16.330> surgery<00:02:16.630> is

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
so essentially arm reduction surgery is

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.510 
so essentially arm reduction surgery is
normally<00:02:17.650> performed<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:18.070> people<00:02:18.310> with<00:02:18.430> either

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
normally performed of people with either

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.210 
normally performed of people with either
excess<00:02:19.030> skin<00:02:19.240> or<00:02:19.840> excess<00:02:20.230> fatty<00:02:20.470> tissue<00:02:20.770> in

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
excess skin or excess fatty tissue in

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.510 
excess skin or excess fatty tissue in
there<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.090> rural<00:02:22.240> areas<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.520> very

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
there in a rural areas it's very

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.210 
there in a rural areas it's very
difficult<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.150> wear<00:02:25.300> clothes<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.010> have

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
difficult to wear clothes so if you have

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.140 
difficult to wear clothes so if you have
got<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.420> be<00:02:28.720> corrected<00:02:29.350> with<00:02:29.620> surgery

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
got it it can be corrected with surgery

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.880 
got it it can be corrected with surgery
