00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.479
 uncertainties about where the

 children in the room by green angel 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.110

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.750
 feeling of being sloppy by their 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.550
 parents 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.600

 racist joke you will never hear me 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.310
 to make clichÃ©s about blacks and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.660
 Arab 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.540

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.209
 well represented but no I have nothing I 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.620
 nothing against blacks and arabs the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.340

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.570
