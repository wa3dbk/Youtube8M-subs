00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.130 

the<00:00:02.120> strategy<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.449> throws<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.740> based<00:00:05.580> on

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
the strategy the throws of based on

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:15.049 
the strategy the throws of based on
sword<00:00:07.140> sword<00:00:08.099> movement<00:00:13.460> so<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> lots<00:00:14.849> of

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
sword sword movement so the lots of

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.870 
sword sword movement so the lots of
throws<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.630> maneuver<00:00:16.049> strikes<00:00:16.920> back<00:00:17.580> then

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
throws and maneuver strikes back then

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.310 
throws and maneuver strikes back then
also<00:00:18.420> was<00:00:19.320> based<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:26.490> know<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> sword<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
also was based on you know the sword is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.600 
also was based on you know the sword is
straight<00:00:28.320> doesn't<00:00:28.680> Bend<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.929> strikes<00:00:31.610> in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
straight doesn't Bend and it strikes in

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.450 
straight doesn't Bend and it strikes in
a<00:00:32.700> straight<00:00:33.030> pattern

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
a straight pattern

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.110 
a straight pattern
so<00:00:35.460> whenever<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.660> samurai<00:00:37.020> struck<00:00:37.649> he<00:00:38.120> he

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so whenever the samurai struck he he

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.889 
so whenever the samurai struck he he
would<00:00:40.079> strike<00:00:40.969> he<00:00:41.969> would<00:00:42.149> strike<00:00:42.420> according

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
would strike he would strike according

00:00:42.899 --> 00:01:23.679 
would strike he would strike according
to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> pattern<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> his<00:01:13.070> striking<00:01:19.759> on<00:01:20.759> strike

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:36.770 

your<00:01:24.689> hand<00:01:33.259> should<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.520> rigid<00:01:35.520> enough<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
your hand should be rigid enough so that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.289 
your hand should be rigid enough so that
when<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.200> when<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:37.890> contact<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
when you when you make contact the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.310 
when you when you make contact the
impact<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.900> great<00:01:40.170> yeah<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.970> mostly

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
impact is great yeah and it's mostly

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.940 
impact is great yeah and it's mostly
destroying<00:01:43.320> beyond

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
destroying beyond

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.740 
destroying beyond
so<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.090> said<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.509> said

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so you see you see when I said now said

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
so you see you see when I said now said
natural<00:01:49.170> move<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> natural<00:01:51.180> move

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
natural move it's a natural move

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870 
natural move it's a natural move
remember<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.869> said<00:01:52.079> before<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.189> any

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
remember I said before you know any

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.010 
remember I said before you know any
digital<00:01:54.470> moves<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.950> natural<00:01:56.490> path<00:01:57.020> where

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
digital moves in a natural path where

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
digital moves in a natural path where
your<00:01:58.320> body<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> adapts<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> your

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
your body is there it adapts to your

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.950 
your body is there it adapts to your
body<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:01.409> coordinated<00:02:02.280> movements<00:02:02.960> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
body with coordinated movements and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.940 
body with coordinated movements and
adapts<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> body<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.430> cannon

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
adapts to the body for the cannon

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.949 
adapts to the body for the cannon
movements<00:02:06.549> here<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:08.110> here<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.149> force

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
movements here this here I have to force

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.800 
movements here this here I have to force
myself<00:02:11.019> to<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.879> position<00:02:13.060> I'm

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
myself to get in that position I'm

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.970 
myself to get in that position I'm
bending<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.470> arm<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.680> when<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.860> do

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
bending the arm here here but when I do

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.880 
bending the arm here here but when I do
strike<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.670> natural<00:02:19.180> because<00:02:19.930> like<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.680> said

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
strike it's natural because like I said

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.479 
strike it's natural because like I said
before<00:02:21.069> in<00:02:21.849> most<00:02:22.060> cases<00:02:22.330> your<00:02:23.230> arms<00:02:23.680> are<00:02:24.160> in

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
before in most cases your arms are in

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.410 
before in most cases your arms are in
elongated<00:02:25.030> position<00:02:26.519> down<00:02:27.519> by<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.880> shoulders

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
elongated position down by the shoulders

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.680 
elongated position down by the shoulders
here<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.709> should<00:02:29.800> be<00:02:30.130> able<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.489> move<00:02:30.730> from

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
here so I should be able to move from

00:02:31.690 --> 00:04:59.790 
here so I should be able to move from
this<00:02:31.870> position<00:03:07.950> outside

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:16.500 

rather<00:05:00.789> than<00:05:09.479> allows<00:05:10.479> me<00:05:12.510> to<00:05:13.510> manipulate<00:05:15.510> just

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
rather than allows me to manipulate just

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:27.879 
rather than allows me to manipulate just
slip<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:18.550> punch

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:06:04.990 

Oh

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.960 

take<00:06:05.690> him<00:06:05.810> out
