00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello guys and girls and welcome to 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.370
 recycle is we produce creative 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.290
 in this video I will show two ways 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.620
 to decorate a shirt by the track of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620
 wait 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.990
 we have our shirt ready and 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.110
 Our selected design 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.120
 the printed one folio now we need 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.510
 a scissor to cut the figure of the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.510
 heart 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.550
 and with a cutter I will cut the silhouette of the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 letter preserving the rest of the folio 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.550
 and now that we have our 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.700
 cut-out templates we will need a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.250
 hard waxes 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.110
 or a plaster 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.330
 a pencil row or if it does not fit our 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.050
 wax pencil in pencil row we can 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.970
 use a kitchen grater 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.880
 The first thing I will do is place a 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.829
 newspaper or something 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.790
 inside the shirt so that 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.350
 do not transfer 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.350
 towards the other side 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.020
 and now with the lyrics 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.299
 I will center it as much as possible 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.299
 and now I will be throwing little by little 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.100
 the sidewalk by inclusion that is inside 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.100
 Of the template 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.290
 I'm not going to take a lot because then 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 melts and 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.570
 and we would have to do the right to 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.010
 to cover as much as possible the white 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.350
 but 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.220
 but do not make too much lumps because 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.580
 I tell you that it melts and the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.580
 borders 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.390
 very carefully 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.540
 and now with any folio I'm going to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.540
 recycle that I had out there 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.340
 and an iron 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.319
 we spent a little time we see that it has 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:43.700
 stayed a little on the top sheet and 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:48.150
 very slowly we raise it we already have 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.220
 our letters and now we're going 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.220
 by our next template 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.290
 that we will do it by the technique of 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.990
 exclusion means that we will throw wax 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.670
 everywhere except for 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.670
 obviously where is the template 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.780
 I'm going to throw a lot of pink because it's a 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.080
 gift for my mother and she loves the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.080
 pink 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.130
 I will also throw a little yellow 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.130
 to illuminate 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.870
 so a little bit by the edges 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.040
 and now with more recycled folios 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.949
 I'm going to pass the iron with great care 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.949
 that the heart does not move 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:56.189
 and I do not go through where the lyrics for 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.189
 that does not melt anymore and expand 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.800
 Well, the time has come to see 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.800
 how it has been 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.790
 as here it seems that a 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.490
 I'm going to take a little bald 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.070
 over pink chip and repeat the same 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.320
 function 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.270
 and to finish I like to outline 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.740
 the edge of the letters with a marker 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.930
 textile because I think there are more 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.260
 sharp but if not too they are very 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.260
 cool 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.419
 if you liked the video you can subscribe 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.520

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.470
 upload a new video if you give likes what 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.810
 they share they will be encouraging me to go up 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.139
 videos with new things 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.070
