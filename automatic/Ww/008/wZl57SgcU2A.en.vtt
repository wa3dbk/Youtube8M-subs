 hello to you Olga Sergeevna and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.009
 new wargaming news release 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.799
 today in the program country of the ascendant 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.450
 the sun presents its armored vehicles 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 how will the team battle mode affect 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.840
 eSports for which they will fight 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.840
 best pilots after release 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.119
 world of tanks continues to evolve 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.190
 very soon japanese cars 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.710
 join the legendary technology already 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.960
 existing nations and how it was formed 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.640
 approach in tank building in japan in what 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.440
 feature of the new branch and why are we 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.840
 decided to add another flag around 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.760
 Qatar will tell 5 cap and yuri pasholok and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 use started borrowing 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.550
 foreign samples in this case with 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.280
 wife ft further was confusing one of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 English experienced tanks at its base 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 the Japanese have created their own tank school 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 which was like nothing else I 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.370
 Japanese tank building was characteristic 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 In general, the use of riveted 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.300
 hull structures original 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.020
 suspension system 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.580
 much attention was paid to terrain 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.580
 Basically, Japanese tanks turned out to be 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.410
 comfortable enough for the crew at these 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.649
 more accurate shooting machines and more 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.690
 high pointing angles in the game 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.410
 lungs average Japanese will be introduced 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.899
 tanks 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.250
 almost all of them were either 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.189
 mass production 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.950
 either made as experienced 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.990
 samples on this thread can be fine 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.710
 see the development path of the Japanese 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.290
 technology from light weight machine 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.130
 symptom they got to the 40 ton machine 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.810
 who here she is with american tanks 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.049
 let's say Pershing there would be enough 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.450
 equal conditions for wallpaper since the Japanese 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.030
 created quite a good car for 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.900
 the essence of the slave and make very interesting 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.460
 is prototype 2 serial japanese 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.140
 tank type sims 4 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.649
 which was created under the index stb-1 he 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.579
 possessed remarkable declination angles 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.920
 good mobility high precision and 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:16.620
 relatively good booking it 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.590
 branch will be somewhat specific 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.470
 the tanks will allow you to conduct aiming 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.470
 fire knocking out enemy tanks with big 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.100
 distance to the enemy 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.710
 serious damage on the other hand is a tank 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.290
 which will allow to sate historical 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.750
 the battles that we have planned and this 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.050
 The branch will be interesting, including 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.940
 gameplay for those who play on 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.680
 team tops any new mode and big 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.420
 some players are just starting 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.310
 recognize its features and invent 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.500
 new tactics but there are those who with 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.970
 a similar format is familiar for a long time 1000 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.440
 tankmen fight in a variety of 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.360
 championships is not the first year 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.100
 what does the appearance mean to them 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.860
 team battle as a separate mode 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.200
 out a team battle and us 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.190
 First of all, cybersportsmen 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.160
 all that 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.010
 on top increased the number of teams 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.180
 who play train this what 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.550
 mean it 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.910
 and a variety of tactics is what 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.190
 the number of interesting fights increases 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.560
 that give pleasure to both 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.160
 the players themselves and of course the viewers 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.740
 my fast enough saturated 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.739
 dynamic most important thing is that here i am 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.510
 much more influence the outcome of the battle than 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.580

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.070
 worst of all they just left the company 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.080
