 Oh , the 2011 Drift Master City individual is ahead of the last game 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.730

 In the end, it was updated and released version 3.0. 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.650
 Will feel the east of application skills of the participants did not follow the negative Update 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.630
 I think it 's growing really fast. 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.239
 This detail is also the detail when this update, but in contrast to 2012 and more 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.930
 I have organized interesting events . 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.930
 Focus . 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.830
 First in Korea, we established the Genesis Coupe Class. 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.730
 More splendid and better performance than just sharing weight 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.940
 In order 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.960
 In one god requires a high-power Li Suites 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.129
 It was established as a motive to create a Gimhae race. 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.809
 Up to now, the average number of participants in the Drift Master Preliminary Competition is 30 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.010
 It's chief. 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:11.450
 If you play 16 rounds, 14 people will be eliminated. 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.750
 However, by a fresh positive feelings aside to replace the quarterfinals Case 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.350
 Increase your chances of winning the best and winner is the main event 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.090
 It's a way to support tuning so that you can play big in the 16th round. 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:27.259
 The contestants who won the championship class are basically 18 cars 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.640
 Side technology to provide a competitive receives the ball drift in Merced based on it 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.590
 You can create 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.720
 It's good news for those who do not have tuning b. 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.130
 222 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.939
 Drift Master now has a 2.0 drift when it comes to budget 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.409
 3 points 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.470
 And Daming bosimyi of 10 points Scoring kind of pain, I would suggest a total of 5 points 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:53.720
 Pricing, we can establish a Qualifying c 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:58.880
 At this time, if a drift has pulrige there is assigned 3 points, regardless of the assessment 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.390
 Now is the process to zero also built with the referee and the audience can relate to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.159
 In order to produce a must have skill to solve 0 0 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:11.750
 By the way, if the driver in the 7th set was tweeting hard , 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.640
 If you do not get the alignment 0 , 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.630
 You can judge 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.790
 Knowing how to smoke is also very important because of the drift judgment 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:26.810
 Battle element is therefore the case when walking the vehicle is delayed more than the preceding Love 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.190
 In many cases, you should take the driving page of the driving vehicle and calculate the distance between the two 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.720
 Judge 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.950
 Of course, there are many follow-up vehicles 0 걍 promises, 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.370
 If it wakes 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.370
 You will not like it because you've been given Bud's land. 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.180
 The rules for entry have been further strengthened. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.260
 In order to give a better score to drift players 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.760
 is 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.430
 If the distance to the entry according to the existing claims of the budget entry Top entry 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.560
 You will get a positive driving advantage 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.300
 Here, if you add an entry to implement the inertia dips utilizing a clutch kick 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.650
 You can earn 1 point 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:13.150
 So the total preliminary score will be 11.2. 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.470
 Not only this, but also the tournament finals will affect this regulation 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.010
 If a match does not take place in the first nine games, 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.900
 If the trailing vehicle to enter the first bird Wendy enjoyed being 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.430
 Both teams judge the fall, and at this time, 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.060
 If you want to know for sure 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.900
 9 0 7 It would be a good idea to use plastic in water 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.180
 The same 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.040
 But I also forget that Chelsea is meaningless when things go awry. 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.730
 You drink. 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.480
 In the final round of 2011 , the new layout could be applied 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.220
 There is 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:53.050
 For the new course layout , 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.510
 The update will be heard on the day, and the 2011 season champion Akane Yuyu 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.220
 Two-School is scheduled to be updated . 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.030
 Everything in the Americas is ready to offend the last round of everything. 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.030
 Was it
