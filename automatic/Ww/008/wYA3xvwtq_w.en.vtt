00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.539
 let's make a cream donut 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.550
 rich for it you need two eggs 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.750
 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.020
 flour let yeast an envelope of 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.900
 yeast 200 grams of cream grated 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.440
 a lemon and nothing else 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.200
 we are in the beginning planting 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.740
 and we add the sugar 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.600
 and shakes 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.600
 we leave energetically 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.040
 then the yeast is put out and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.040
 another 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.710
 there are the two eggs 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060
 ah 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.200
 and the lemon zest 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.530
 you have to crack 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.350
 and after the flour upholstered little to 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.350
 little until with having a mass 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.790
 to see how well well I will go adding 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.790
 flour all the capital 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.420
 and then the dough goes working with 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.420
 the hands until a mass 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.410
 is adding to money and taking the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.410
 sand that you go putting 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.260
 he is taking 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.840
 little by little the one who is lying is going 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.120
 adding flour until it is 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.790
 take off the mass of the hands you work 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.010
 well and then you have to do the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.970
 little circles to make the donuts and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.970
 we proceed to fleitas 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.819
 and once the dough is made they are made 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.480
 the two crimes 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.459
 while you put the oil to heat for 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.359
 that is warming up to then go 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.359
 throwing the donuts 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.940
 and once the oil is warm 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.870
 they are throwing the donuts so that 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.870
 go brown 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.240
 you have to let them brown 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.640
 again a little bit so it does not stick 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.980
 and the end is this you can eat like this or 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.800
 If you want, you can have a little 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.480
 sugar when they are cold I hope that 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.480
 I tried them yes they are very delicious
