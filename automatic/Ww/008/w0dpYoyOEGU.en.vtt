probably<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> best<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.539> mean<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.560> can

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
probably one of the best I mean you can

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.339 
probably one of the best I mean you can
spawn<00:00:25.949> anything<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.789> good<00:00:27.090> graphics<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.869> um

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
spawn anything it's good graphics and um

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
spawn anything it's good graphics and um
I<00:00:28.680> mean<00:00:29.550> there's<00:00:29.730> hardly<00:00:29.970> any<00:00:30.210> lag<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.689> might<00:00:30.900> be

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
I mean there's hardly any lag I might be

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.389 
I mean there's hardly any lag I might be
lagging<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.380> bit<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.219> because

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
lagging a little bit but that's because

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.139 
lagging a little bit but that's because
i<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.600> um<00:00:34.190> i<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.850> screen

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
i have it on um i have the screen

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.660 
i have it on um i have the screen
recording<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> laptop<00:00:38.340> so

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
recording and this is on a laptop so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.369 
recording and this is on a laptop so
besides<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.969> mean<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:42.899> even<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
besides I mean it's not even that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.549 
besides I mean it's not even that
lagging<00:00:43.770> anyway<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.100> um<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.809> basics<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
lagging anyway so um the basics of it is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
lagging anyway so um the basics of it is
you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.010> spawn<00:00:47.250> whatever<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:47.940> outside

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you can spawn whatever you want outside

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.450 
you can spawn whatever you want outside
the<00:00:48.930> wilderness<00:00:49.710> except<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.960> virtus<00:00:52.219> you<00:00:53.219> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the wilderness except for virtus you can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.910 
the wilderness except for virtus you can
spawn<00:00:53.730> pernix<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.440> torva<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.620> don't<00:00:55.829> know

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
spawn pernix in torva so i don't know

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.150 
spawn pernix in torva so i don't know
why<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.100> can't<00:00:56.370> spawn<00:00:56.610> virtus<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.160> mean

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
why you can't spawn virtus but I mean

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680 
why you can't spawn virtus but I mean
it's<00:00:59.309> whatever<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.820> still<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.539> many
