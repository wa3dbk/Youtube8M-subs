different pieces of dragon bones that
come<00:01:19.710> together<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.130> make<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.490> new<00:01:20.610> weapon<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
come together to make the new weapon so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.969

the vanilla crossbows and the damage is
the<00:01:31.079> same<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> Dwarven<00:01:31.860> crossbow<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.369> the

you<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.830> see<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.130> distance<00:02:56.280> here<00:02:56.730> and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
you can see in the distance here and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.280 
you can see in the distance here and
will<00:02:57.300> even<00:02:57.420> detect<00:02:57.840> when<00:02:57.959> something<00:02:58.200> is

behind an object like this mud crab the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.360 
behind an object like this mud crab the
mud<00:03:01.019> also<00:03:01.380> works<00:03:01.590> well<00:03:01.830> with<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.069> darker

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
mud also works well with the darker

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.949 
mud also works well with the darker
nights<00:03:02.580> mud<00:03:02.790> installed<00:03:03.180> however<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.810> will

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
nights mud installed however you will

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.290 
nights mud installed however you will
get<00:03:04.110> slightly<00:03:04.319> different<00:03:04.500> results<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.280> as<00:03:06.120> we

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
get slightly different results so as we

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.820 
get slightly different results so as we
go<00:03:06.450> from<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.690> normal<00:03:06.840> darker<00:03:07.290> nights<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
go from a normal darker nights to the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.199 
go from a normal darker nights to the
standard<00:03:08.160> night<00:03:08.310> vision<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.819> can<00:03:08.970> clearly

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
standard night vision you can clearly

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.940 
standard night vision you can clearly
see<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.540> mod<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.840> action<00:03:10.170> there's<00:03:10.650> very

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
see the mod in action there's very

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.500 
see the mod in action there's very
little<00:03:11.130> blur<00:03:11.430> everything<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> lot<00:03:12.330> more

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
little blur everything is a lot more

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.120 
little blur everything is a lot more
clear<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.989> now<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.380> also<00:03:13.530> make<00:03:13.800> out<00:03:13.950> one

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
clear and now you can also make out one

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.340 
clear and now you can also make out one
of<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.280> guards<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.819> distance<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.390> now<00:03:16.200> as

of the guards in the distance and now as

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.900 
of the guards in the distance and now as
we<00:03:16.530> switch<00:03:16.769> onto<00:03:16.950> predator<00:03:17.400> vision<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.790> can

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
we switch onto predator vision you can

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.340 
we switch onto predator vision you can
see<00:03:18.030> everything<00:03:18.360> goes<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.570> lot<00:03:18.810> more<00:03:18.989> blue<00:03:19.200> and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
see everything goes a lot more blue and

now you can clearly see the two guards
and<00:03:21.180> other<00:03:21.299> life-forms<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.140> distance

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
and other life-forms in the distance

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.979 
and other life-forms in the distance
comparatively<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> two<00:03:24.420> modes<00:03:24.600> have<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.840> lot

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
comparatively the two modes have a lot

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.360 
comparatively the two modes have a lot
more<00:03:25.019> power<00:03:25.320> with<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.680> darker<00:03:26.010> nights<00:03:26.190> one

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
more power with the darker nights one

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.130 
more power with the darker nights one
installed<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.239> go<00:03:27.420> from<00:03:27.600> seeing<00:03:27.810> mostly

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
installed you go from seeing mostly

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.590 
installed you go from seeing mostly
nothing<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.920> seeing<00:03:29.130> something<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:30.060> detecting

nothing to seeing something to detecting

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.900 
nothing to seeing something to detecting
everything<00:03:31.079> but<00:03:32.010> really<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.519> works<00:03:32.640> well<00:03:32.880> with

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
everything but really it works well with

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.670 
everything but really it works well with
