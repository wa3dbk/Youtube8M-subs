00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:02.173
 Hello good Morning. 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.980
 Today is February 27, 2014. 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.640
 Today the carnival party begins, 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.320
 where we all dress up and go out on the street. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.500
 In many places in Spain, trouts are made to celebrate it. 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.280
 For example, in our house we always make French omelet. 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.520
 But today I want to explain how you make a potato omelette. 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.140
 Potato omelette 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.360
 It is a very famous dish, 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.860
 And how is it the first time I do it? I hope I do not do it wrong. 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.520
 Ingredients 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.080
 To prepare the omelette of potatoes, we will need some ingredients. 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.520
 3 potatoes 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.500
 5 eggs 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.860
 Half onion 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.353
 A bit of salt 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.320
 Olive oil 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.140
 Before beginning we will wash our hands and we will put the apron. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.900
 Ready. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.000
 We will start with the potatoes. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700
 Let's take a peeler. 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.800
 If you do not have it, take a sharp knife. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.300
 And we will start peeling the potatoes as well. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.900
 Now that they are already peeled, we will wash them again and we will make them dice. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.720
 Then we will do the same with the onion. 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.940
 Now we will cut it into small pieces. 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.980
 More or less so large. 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.914
 If you want to cut the potato in half and cut it, you can also do it. 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.980
 It's done. 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.040
 And now we will have the three cut potatoes. 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.980
 We start with onion. 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.180
 We will cut it to dice, you understand? 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.580
 Really good. Now we will put the oil. 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.080
 We will put a lot on it because they have to cook the potatoes. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.180
 More or less like that. 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.280
 And we will put the fire. 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.080
 We will put it on medium heat. 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.140
 Now we beat the eggs. 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.480
 We take the egg and we open it. 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.320
 We do the same with the other eggs. 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.240
 Well, now we take a fork and we'll beat everything. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.520
 Now we have it ready. 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.600
 As the heat is already hot we will put the potatoes and the onion. 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.120
 We start with the potatoes. Little by little, for not burning. 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.520
 And now the onion. 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.740
 We mix it well. 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.740
 A few minutes later 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.740
 Really good. It seems that this is already. 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.560
 Now a little salt. 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.880
 Let's take this mica and we spread it well. 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.340
 Now we will put the potatoes with the egg. Always with great care. 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.060
 Vigilant that the oil does not fall inside. 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.580
 We all get it safe. 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.340
 And we will turn on the fire again. 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.520
 Like this. 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.340
 A little, not so much. 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.620
 Once inside, the corners are watched so they do not stick. 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.640
 Let it be cooked. 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.000
 Well now we get to the toughest part. Turn the trout. 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.300
 How will we do it? 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.580
 We take a lid of pan with no holes and we take the paella to the sink. 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.380
 Attention: very careful! Do not over-cook. 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.880
 We pay close attention to it and take it around. 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.040
 We put it back in the pan. 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.200
 Well now we close the fire and that will be. 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.880
 Now we put it on the plate. 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.460
 Be careful, do not forget to get rid of it at the last minute. 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.600
 Really good. Well this is my omelette of potatoes. 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.600
 If you want, something we do here in Catalonia, is to serve it with bread with tomato. 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.853
 It's very tasty. 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.500
 He puts it around and will look great. 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.220

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.240
