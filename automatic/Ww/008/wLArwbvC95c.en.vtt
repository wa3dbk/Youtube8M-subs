injustice and when you put the two and
two<00:03:14.100> together<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.760> think<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.810> answer

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.630 
two together I think we have the answer
here<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.380> believe<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.769> they<00:03:17.070> think<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.400> we

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
here I believe that they think that we

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.130 
here I believe that they think that we
shouldn't<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.090> paying<00:03:18.300> for<00:03:18.540> internet<00:03:18.690> on
