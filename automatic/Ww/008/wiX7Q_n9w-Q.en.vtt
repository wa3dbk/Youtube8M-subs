to be asked to have enough power in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.660 
to be asked to have enough power in
order<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.650> do<00:00:42.770> this<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.130> that's<00:00:43.220> really<00:00:43.520> the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
order to do this and that's really the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.119 
order to do this and that's really the
big<00:00:43.940> challenge<00:00:44.469> what<00:00:45.469> we're<00:00:45.620> trying<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.920> do

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
big challenge what we're trying to do

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.700 
big challenge what we're trying to do
here<00:00:46.160> today<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:47.000> a<00:00:47.480> first<00:00:47.870> portion<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.590> that

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
here today is a first portion of that

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.430 
here today is a first portion of that
and<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.100> first<00:00:49.280> portion<00:00:49.579> of<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:49.910> is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
and the first portion of that is

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.349 
and the first portion of that is
actually<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.739> 60-second<00:00:52.519> hover<00:00:52.789> from<00:00:53.180> day

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
actually the 60-second hover from day

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.569 
actually the 60-second hover from day
one<00:00:53.620> we<00:00:54.620> started<00:00:54.949> designing<00:00:55.070> on<00:00:55.399> paper

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
one we started designing on paper

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.369 
one we started designing on paper
started<00:00:56.059> designing<00:00:56.180> with<00:00:56.660> equations<00:00:56.989> and

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
started designing with equations and

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.560 
started designing with equations and
just<00:00:57.559> our<00:00:57.710> basic<00:00:58.070> knowledge<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.640> helicopters

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
just our basic knowledge of helicopters

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.770 
just our basic knowledge of helicopters
this<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:00.289> a<00:01:00.320> fairly<00:01:01.219> unique<00:01:01.670> helicopter<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:02.629> we

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
this is a fairly unique helicopter so we

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.380 
this is a fairly unique helicopter so we
along<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.679> way<00:01:03.829> had<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.430> invent<00:01:05.150> some<00:01:05.360> new

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
along the way had to invent some new

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.020 
along the way had to invent some new
things<00:01:05.990> think<00:01:06.440> about<00:01:06.650> new<00:01:06.800> ideas<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.400> so

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
things think about new ideas and so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.780 
things think about new ideas and so
start<00:01:08.510> on<00:01:08.600> paper<00:01:08.890> start<00:01:09.890> designing<00:01:10.250> small

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
start on paper start designing small

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.160 
start on paper start designing small
components<00:01:11.330> for<00:01:11.420> example<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:11.870> started

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
components for example we started

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.480 
components for example we started
designing<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.650> wings<00:01:12.860> started<00:01:13.340> designing

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
designing the wings started designing

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.030 
designing the wings started designing
the<00:01:13.850> trust<00:01:14.270> structure<00:01:14.750> but<00:01:15.320> partially

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
the trust structure but partially

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.160 
the trust structure but partially
because<00:01:16.159> this<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.549> such<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.909> large<00:01:17.180> vehicle<00:01:17.750> we

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
because this is such a large vehicle we

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.359 
because this is such a large vehicle we
can<00:01:18.290> never<00:01:18.470> really<00:01:18.740> put<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.009> all<00:01:19.130> together

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
can never really put it all together

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.190 
can never really put it all together
except<00:01:19.880> for<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> special<00:01:20.390> situation<00:01:20.540> like<00:01:21.020> this

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
except for a special situation like this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.100 
except for a special situation like this
so<00:01:21.979> from<00:01:22.220> day<00:01:22.250> one<00:01:22.520> we've<00:01:22.729> been<00:01:22.759> designing

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
so from day one we've been designing

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.480 
so from day one we've been designing
testing<00:01:24.110> as<00:01:24.290> much<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:24.619> we<00:01:24.740> can<00:01:24.920> each<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.369> those

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
testing as much as we can each of those

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.730 
testing as much as we can each of those
individual<00:01:26.030> components<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.810> slowly

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
individual components and slowly

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.620 
individual components and slowly
starting<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.310> integrate<00:01:28.640> component<00:01:29.329> together

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
starting to integrate component together

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.660 
starting to integrate component together
and<00:01:29.960> make<00:01:30.079> sure<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.500> one<00:01:30.979> system<00:01:31.340> works<00:01:31.520> with

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
and make sure that one system works with

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.670 
and make sure that one system works with
another<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.210> here<00:01:32.899> what<00:01:33.229> you're<00:01:33.380> seeing<00:01:33.530> is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
another and here what you're seeing is

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.679 
another and here what you're seeing is
making<00:01:34.340> sure<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.579> all<00:01:34.610> systems<00:01:35.210> work<00:01:35.450> with

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
making sure that all systems work with

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.859 
making sure that all systems work with
all<00:01:35.899> other<00:01:36.200> systems<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:41.390> world<00:01:41.630> record

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
all other systems the world record

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.359 
all other systems the world record
flight<00:01:42.049> I'm<00:01:42.290> pretty<00:01:42.560> confident<00:01:43.009> on<00:01:43.159> these

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
flight I'm pretty confident on these

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.429 
flight I'm pretty confident on these
guys<00:01:43.610> have<00:01:43.759> been<00:01:43.790> working<00:01:44.210> all<00:01:44.420> night<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:45.290> is

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
guys have been working all night this is

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.899 
guys have been working all night this is
the<00:01:45.530> second<00:01:45.890> all<00:01:46.070> nighter<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.549> we've<00:01:46.670> pulled

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
the second all nighter that we've pulled

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.280 
the second all nighter that we've pulled
and<00:01:47.469> a<00:01:48.469> lot<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.189> interesting<00:01:49.640> things<00:01:49.850> have

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
and a lot of interesting things have

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.900 
and a lot of interesting things have
have<00:01:50.410> come<00:01:50.740> about<00:01:50.830> as<00:01:51.160> a<00:01:51.190> result<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.730> those

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
have come about as a result of those

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.910 
have come about as a result of those
overnight<00:01:52.720> late-night<00:01:53.320> sessions<00:01:53.770> of

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
overnight late-night sessions of

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.260 
overnight late-night sessions of
engineering<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:54.490> design<00:01:54.760> so<00:01:55.150> very<00:01:55.780> confident
