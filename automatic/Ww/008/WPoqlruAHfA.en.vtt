pedal let's talk about how easy it is to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.140 
pedal let's talk about how easy it is to
get<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.920> together<00:01:07.920> when<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
get that together when you get the

get that together when you get the
double<00:01:09.420> pedal<00:01:09.570> you'll<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.960> these<00:01:10.110> additional

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
double pedal you'll get these additional

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
double pedal you'll get these additional
pieces<00:01:10.650> obviously<00:01:10.950> you'll<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.210> second

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
pieces obviously you'll get the second

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.030 
pieces obviously you'll get the second
footboard<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.200> you'll<00:01:13.560> notice<00:01:13.799> this

footboard and you'll notice this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.550 
footboard and you'll notice this
assembly<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.360> same<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.960> yet<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
assembly is the same and yet a little

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.660 
assembly is the same and yet a little
bit<00:01:16.650> different<00:01:17.009> we'll<00:01:17.100> talk<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
bit different we'll talk about that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.480 
bit different we'll talk about that
piece<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> second<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.320> these<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
piece here in a second but these are the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
piece here in a second but these are the
pieces<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> turn<00:01:21.720> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
pieces that are going to turn this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.190 
pieces that are going to turn this
single<00:01:22.320> pedal<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.250> double<00:01:23.580> pedal<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
single pedal into a double pedal and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.590 
single pedal into a double pedal and
this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.670> look<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.299> look<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.479> this

I'm trying to say the loosening of these
you<00:01:43.470> joints<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.220> design<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you joints this design right here this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.010 
you joints this design right here this
Hilo<00:01:45.960> design<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:47.119> rock-solid<00:01:48.119> man<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.810> thing

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Hilo design is rock-solid man this thing

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.620 
Hilo design is rock-solid man this thing
does<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.320> move<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.939> had<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.329> particular

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
does not move I have had this particular

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.819 
does not move I have had this particular
driveshaft<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.799> years<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:54.799> solid

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
driveshaft for years and it's solid

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
driveshaft for years and it's solid
everything<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.909> trick<00:01:57.149> does<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
everything that trick does is

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.289 
everything that trick does is
manufactured<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> nth<00:01:59.340> degree<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:00.030> mean

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
manufactured to the nth degree I mean

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.929
