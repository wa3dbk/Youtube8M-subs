00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.329
 the seventh 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:14.449
 Jara 8 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.960
 the search 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.960
 4 percent 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.019
 as event venues and dates once the stone-therme attached yet 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.010
 the organizer 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.020
 and the artists have chosen the park behind the thermal bath 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.420
 and not just because the son is passing a construction site 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.320
 we are first 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.890
 satisfied that it is behind the camera at the CDU was in the spa something 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.809
 of course, the image would be ambience but acoustic 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.410
 that was pretty good 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.670
 Openair had this advantage you have no turning possibility animals you can 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.610
 the fence a dull child finally help several times a day 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.610
 improvement 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 That is why Munich is important for the sound experience 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.010
 60 musicians 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.300
 15 15 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.859
 and to win this song is in seventh place 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.320
 this is explained by Hermann 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.340
 around 22,000 of them can be heard here, from pro KÃ¶ln and Koblenz to film music 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 Phil will be heard 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.160
 they are open to all chances 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.870
 Definitely, and that's what the orchestra does that they've cashed out music 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.070
 give both classic and in the other 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.750
 I could play then 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.040
 and that was further on to this huge record 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.270
 we try our son Hans-Georg Pannwitz is glad 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 especially these parents have opener for the Boc Festival Week to have received 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.259
 but after the concert of the Symphonic Pop Orchestra the evening is still long 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.290
 not over 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.210
 belongs to the highlights 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.310
 meets classic 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.280
 there will be no party at the back but one at the Schofar 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.340
 Thiel so it will be played promt music of the Mediterranean perhaps 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.030
 times in the musical stars in the area so that can still sit drinking wine 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.640
 can just let that sink a bit and be able to refuel and of course 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.640
 Give feelings 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.929
 increased this late introduction of body scanners at airports 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.809
 Cheers solved zel
