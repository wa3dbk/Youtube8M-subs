00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.730
 so hello first now I'll show you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.000
 times the revised version of the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:14.639
 from the throttle or air flaps 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.980
 also to find under suction pipe the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.939
 whole problem because this particle is so 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.779
 Now I'll show you the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.779
 edited version 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.050
 that's how I am here 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.040
 We buy 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 this cover away 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 it works here 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.720
 the new throttle and her old me 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.040
 I have a completely new one here 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.280
 choke I have to buy since 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.239
 this intelligent thing for natural 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.560
 a ghost has given up or slightly 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.979
 had a game and of course more 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.220
 I made a complete mistake 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.140
 to say complete to do it all 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.650
 now even a video only me 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 I skip everything briefly and shows 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.340
 Guess how to build this out 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.969
 complete 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.200
 this complete butterfly valve is what 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.500
 me the whole problem was 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.700
 was rather expensive 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.240
 the front because we do it all here 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.469
 have to 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.469
 that means 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.920
 Here you can easily 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.119
 open or loosely screw 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.009
 that is enough and of course also and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.900
 the can snap it all away 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.690
 Everyone can already do that on the side 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.759
 vectron then you do here 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.960
 the screw on down here the screw 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:07.310
 on bottom of course the enro screws 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:19.160
 to keep the trophy 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:24.100
 that's what I think 23 does after that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:31.190
 this screw on this screw on 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:36.140
 this screw also these ones are here 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.690
 below of course this one on the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.090
 other throttle and of course 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.440
 below 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.800
 the throttle of the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.800
 other side 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.800
 then there are the two here 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.320
 unscrew and this one screw 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.740
 that was all I did 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.940
 and of course I have the turbocharger 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.850
 I here at the channel but 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.320
 of course , the spot on made 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.820
 here the place opened and the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.690
 put on the bell and the hose 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.690
 withdrawn 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.080
 and this screw opened here and 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.209
 then it happens to deduct and have 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.510
 actually everything free what their free 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.510
 wanted 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.860
 and then you can use the throttle 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.370
 reassuring to say nothing 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.370
 must pass on the track 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.739
 that you can not do that 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.730
 I then did the plug 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.540
 also because otherwise shows you the mistake 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.580
 that he has problems with glow plugs 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.550
 Of course, I have that with the 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.760
 to others he had such problems 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.760
 this here 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.950
 and yes that was it 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.840
 so now again at a glance 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.940
 best start ever forward the 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:23.229
 screw the place the place that 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.690
 dismantle the rear still the screw here 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:30.340
 could build the whole piece out 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.890
 do not screw the front then the screws 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.390
 Eight mothers from the pack had themselves 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:43.750
 the screw the screw the screw 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:45.520
 Here are the three of the four in Passau there 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.920
 of course, screw back from one 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.730
 other breed stairs and the 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.860
 i fix here yes and 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.430
 then you can just use the throttle 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.180
 dismantle and install the new one and that 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.180
 it was actually there 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.530
 I hope that goes a bit further 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.100
 helped because I'm actually there 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:13.860
 had some difficulties at the beginning 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.860
 i was scared to make moscow here 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.470
 yes, what is the fear of demolishing something and 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.230
 Of course I have something 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:27.270
 demolished is clear 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.270
 unfortunately god like some 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.209
 Of course, the thing where you never actually 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.729
 breaks off hit 

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:42.029
 that's why I have a cable tie 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.189
 moored but holds wonderful there 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:49.580
 Now we just buy the plug 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:53.339
 again, then everything fits again 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:56.909
 so and if you want you can 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:58.319
 watch another video there 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.990
 I'll show you the ones you actually 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:05.339
 Check how the engine breaks it 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.669
 from the stage and yes that is actually 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.669
 very easily
