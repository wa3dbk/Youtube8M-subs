your<00:01:06.640> time<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:06.969> new<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.240> believe<00:01:07.600> it's<00:01:07.780> a

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
your time is new I believe it's a

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.090 
your time is new I believe it's a
rehashed<00:01:08.320> map<00:01:08.740> from<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.210> shipment<00:01:10.210> from<00:01:10.390> cod4

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
rehashed map from a shipment from cod4

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.590 
rehashed map from a shipment from cod4
but<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.549> this<00:01:12.670> one<00:01:12.729> I'm<00:01:13.030> gonna<00:01:13.180> be<00:01:13.240> using<00:01:13.299> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
but in this one I'm gonna be using the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.300 
but in this one I'm gonna be using the
vulture<00:01:14.049> because<00:01:14.380> i<00:01:14.619> believe<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.130> had<00:01:15.280> a

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
vulture because i believe it's had a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.890 
vulture because i believe it's had a
buff<00:01:15.549> think<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.000> lasts<00:01:16.180> for<00:01:16.330> 30<00:01:16.450> seconds

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
buff think it lasts for 30 seconds

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.840 
buff think it lasts for 30 seconds
longer<00:01:17.110> now<00:01:17.320> which<00:01:17.799> isn't<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.280> bad<00:01:18.310> before<00:01:18.610> all

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
longer now which isn't a bad before all

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.120 
longer now which isn't a bad before all
I<00:01:19.690> think<00:01:20.260> it's<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.440> put<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.770> line<00:01:20.979> with<00:01:21.100> a

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
I think it's just put it in line with a

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.399 
I think it's just put it in line with a
sentry<00:01:21.520> gun<00:01:21.670> which<00:01:21.970> ones<00:01:22.390> for<00:01:22.479> about<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> minute

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
sentry gun which ones for about a minute

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.140 
sentry gun which ones for about a minute
and<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.590> half<00:01:23.650> I<00:01:23.890> think<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:24.700> remember<00:01:25.060> the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
and a half I think so I remember the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.210 
and a half I think so I remember the
vulture<00:01:25.420> being<00:01:25.570> crack<00:01:25.840> there<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.350> might<00:01:27.040> just

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
vulture being crack there so might just

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.490 
vulture being crack there so might just
be<00:01:27.310> 30<00:01:27.490> seconds<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:27.970> more<00:01:28.360> crap<00:01:28.600> but<00:01:28.930> couldn't

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
be 30 seconds of more crap but couldn't

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.870 
be 30 seconds of more crap but couldn't
kill<00:01:29.619> anyone<00:01:29.799> last<00:01:30.040> game<00:01:30.250> hopefully<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.670> come
