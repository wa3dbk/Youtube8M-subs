00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
to say that I figured this out quicker

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.799 
to say that I figured this out quicker
than<00:00:08.389> I<00:00:08.660> did<00:00:08.870> I<00:00:08.900> should<00:00:09.200> have<00:00:10.299> just<00:00:11.299> because<00:00:11.629> of

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
than I did I should have just because of

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.009 
than I did I should have just because of
training<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:12.709> stuff<00:00:12.889> I've<00:00:13.099> had<00:00:13.280> but<00:00:14.240> here's

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
training and stuff I've had but here's

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.260 
training and stuff I've had but here's
the<00:00:15.230> symptoms<00:00:15.709> you<00:00:16.010> got<00:00:16.160> Chevy<00:00:16.430> Malibu<00:00:16.970> and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
the symptoms you got Chevy Malibu and

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.230 
the symptoms you got Chevy Malibu and
it's<00:00:18.170> making<00:00:18.410> kind<00:00:19.250> of<00:00:19.370> a<00:00:19.460> banging<00:00:19.910> clanking

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
it's making kind of a banging clanking

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.620 
it's making kind of a banging clanking
noise<00:00:20.630> when<00:00:20.930> you<00:00:21.020> hit<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.200> bump<00:00:21.410> and<00:00:21.820> so<00:00:22.820> we<00:00:23.450> went

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
noise when you hit a bump and so we went

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.180 
noise when you hit a bump and so we went
through<00:00:23.720> all<00:00:23.930> these<00:00:24.200> different<00:00:24.620> things<00:00:24.680> I

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
through all these different things I

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.030 
through all these different things I
thought<00:00:26.150> that<00:00:26.420> was<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.600> strut<00:00:26.990> mount<00:00:27.260> I<00:00:27.620> thought

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
thought that was a strut mount I thought

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.830 
thought that was a strut mount I thought
it<00:00:28.190> might<00:00:28.370> be<00:00:28.490> this<00:00:28.640> draw<00:00:28.910> it<00:00:28.970> thought<00:00:29.690> it

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
it might be this draw it thought it

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.750 
it might be this draw it thought it
might<00:00:30.020> be<00:00:30.170> a<00:00:30.200> sway<00:00:30.440> bar<00:00:30.680> end<00:00:30.860> link<00:00:31.190> first<00:00:31.550> of

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
might be a sway bar end link first of

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.970 
might be a sway bar end link first of
all<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.780> it's<00:00:32.930> coming<00:00:33.230> from<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.440> rear<00:00:33.740> left

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
all and it's coming from the rear left

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.580 
all and it's coming from the rear left
of<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.280> car<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:34.870> so<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:36.200> checked<00:00:36.440> through

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
of the car and so we checked through

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.220 
of the car and so we checked through
everything<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:37.850> go<00:00:38.000> through<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.300> go<00:00:38.690> hit<00:00:38.960> bump

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
everything we go through a go hit bump

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.350 
everything we go through a go hit bump
so<00:00:39.530> like<00:00:39.739> oh<00:00:39.890> it's<00:00:40.130> definitely<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:40.760> rode<00:00:41.150> in<00:00:41.270> the

she's like it came on so suddenly and

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.220 
she's like it came on so suddenly and
she<00:00:55.579> doesn't<00:00:55.910> dare<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.180> drive<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.540> car<00:00:56.780> until

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
she doesn't dare to drive the car until

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.770 
she doesn't dare to drive the car until
after<00:00:57.590> it's<00:00:57.770> fixed<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:59.480> turns<00:00:59.750> out<00:01:01.300> this<00:01:02.300> is

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
after it's fixed it turns out this is

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.330 
after it's fixed it turns out this is
the<00:01:02.809> sway<00:01:03.200> bar<00:01:03.469> here<00:01:04.030> this<00:01:05.030> is<00:01:05.210> just<00:01:05.509> like<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
the sway bar here this is just like the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.980 
the sway bar here this is just like the
frame<00:01:07.340> component<00:01:07.970> all<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.210> suspension<00:01:08.630> stuff

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
frame component all the suspension stuff

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.740 
frame component all the suspension stuff
it's<00:01:09.260> on<00:01:09.470> I<00:01:09.710> grabbed<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.460> sway<00:01:10.670> bar<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.479> start

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
it's on I grabbed a sway bar and I start

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.230 
it's on I grabbed a sway bar and I start
to<00:01:11.870> wiggle<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.590> don't<00:01:13.460> know<00:01:13.610> if<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:13.850> can<00:01:14.000> see

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
to wiggle it I don't know if you can see

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.320 
to wiggle it I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:14.420> but<00:01:14.690> it<00:01:14.780> actually<00:01:15.229> snapped<00:01:15.850> it's<00:01:16.850> rusted

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
that but it actually snapped it's rusted

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.719 
that but it actually snapped it's rusted
for<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.570> little<00:01:17.810> bit<00:01:18.020> got<00:01:18.409> brittle<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.310> just

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
for a little bit got brittle and just

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.850 
for a little bit got brittle and just
broke<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:20.869> basically<00:01:21.380> what<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:21.710> does<00:01:22.510> is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
broke so basically what that does is

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.050 
broke so basically what that does is
when<00:01:24.860> you're<00:01:25.040> in<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.190> car<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:25.850> makes

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
when you're in the car it just makes

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.719 
when you're in the car it just makes
this<00:01:26.240> awful<00:01:26.840> nasty<00:01:27.049> noise<00:01:27.560> but<00:01:28.280> only<00:01:28.430> when<00:01:28.640> you

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
this awful nasty noise but only when you

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.120 
this awful nasty noise but only when you
hit<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.940> bump<00:01:29.119> just<00:01:29.360> right<00:01:29.570> we<00:01:30.439> press<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
hit the bump just right we press on the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.580 
hit the bump just right we press on the
bumper<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:32.390> know<00:01:32.540> we'd<00:01:32.689> rock<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.049> bumper<00:01:33.439> up

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
bumper you know we'd rock the bumper up

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.100 
bumper you know we'd rock the bumper up
and<00:01:33.770> down<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.520> try<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.299> get<00:01:35.510> it<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.689> make<00:01:35.840> noise

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
and down and try to get it to make noise

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.060 
and down and try to get it to make noise
that<00:01:36.320> wouldn't<00:01:36.590> make<00:01:36.740> it

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
that wouldn't make it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.700 
that wouldn't make it
you<00:01:37.580> know<00:01:37.700> we<00:01:38.000> grab<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.720> wheel<00:01:38.869> well<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.439> pull

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
you know we grab the wheel well and pull

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.050 
you know we grab the wheel well and pull
up<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.010> down<00:01:40.130> on<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.430> wheel<00:01:40.549> well<00:01:40.760> wouldn't

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
up and down on the wheel well wouldn't

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.000 
up and down on the wheel well wouldn't
make<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.360> noise<00:01:41.540> because<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.500> was<00:01:42.650> doing<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
make the noise because it was doing the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.100 
make the noise because it was doing the
whole<00:01:43.189> back<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.580> car<00:01:43.850> cutting<00:01:44.180> evenly<00:01:44.570> but

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
whole back of the car cutting evenly but

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.810 
whole back of the car cutting evenly but
if<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.710> one<00:01:45.830> side<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.400> car<00:01:46.610> go

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
if you have just one side of the car go

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.730 
if you have just one side of the car go
and<00:01:47.000> not<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.299> other<00:01:47.479> then<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.350> makes<00:01:48.560> that

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and not the other then it makes that

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.780 
and not the other then it makes that
noise<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:50.180> way<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.479> snapped<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.350> that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
noise and the way it snapped like that

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.440 
noise and the way it snapped like that
let's<00:01:52.790> see<00:01:52.880> if<00:01:52.939> we<00:01:53.000> can<00:01:53.090> give<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:53.210> something

interesting<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.710> look<00:01:54.860> at<00:01:55.100> as<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.420> look<00:01:56.630> up

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
interesting to look at as you look up

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.469 
interesting to look at as you look up
inside<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.350> there<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:59.030> way<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.360> these

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
inside of there is the way that these

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.690 
inside of there is the way that these
mount<00:01:59.810> is<00:02:00.049> they<00:02:00.259> just<00:02:00.380> tag<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.159> on<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.490> one

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
mount is they just tag in on the one

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.940 
mount is they just tag in on the one
side<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.390> then<00:02:02.780> they<00:02:02.960> bolt<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.680> see<00:02:03.829> the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
side and then they bolt in you see the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.039 
side and then they bolt in you see the
backside<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.549> bolt<00:02:04.790> there<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.900> know

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
backside of the bolt there you know

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.350 
backside of the bolt there you know
where<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.320> nut<00:02:06.500> goes<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:06.890> there's<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.250> stud<00:02:07.520> so

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
where the nut goes on there's a stud so

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.600 
where the nut goes on there's a stud so
it's<00:02:08.569> only<00:02:08.689> secured<00:02:09.229> by<00:02:09.439> one<00:02:09.679> side<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:10.459> it's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
it's only secured by one side so if it's

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.340 
it's only secured by one side so if it's
like<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.239> has<00:02:11.420> full<00:02:11.810> range<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.319> motion

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
like this it has full range of motion

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.220 
like this it has full range of motion
move<00:02:13.590> freely<00:02:14.310> as<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.790> would<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.660> wants<00:02:15.990> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
move freely as it would as it wants to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.890 
move freely as it would as it wants to
so<00:02:16.920> anyway<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:18.000> kind<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.240> interesting<00:02:18.810> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
so anyway it's kind of interesting I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.330 
so anyway it's kind of interesting I
wonder<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.230> anybody<00:02:19.590> else<00:02:19.680> has<00:02:19.860> run<00:02:20.040> into<00:02:20.220> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
wonder if anybody else has run into the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.830 
wonder if anybody else has run into the
same<00:02:20.610> thing<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:22.080> thought<00:02:22.200> I'd<00:02:22.350> post<00:02:22.590> that
