00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:05.140
 kirk and I will clarify before a detail that is important the movement of Cuba 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.960
 you have to try that purely first that the hand is the most 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.000
 possible private and that which moves alternately downwards and towards 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.019
 above 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.990
 I do not say that I have to do downstairs up or down that's why it depends on each one each 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.810
 one of such a different training the logical would be 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.749
 bottom up 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.179
 I particularly because one has an accentuated tendency upside down 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.919
 percent and then from strong upwards also depends on those of which 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.849
 I felt that 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.340
 try to control it 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.290
 personally but yes that lakua did not work all the time down if the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 topic would require it because or the pointer because the crushed phrase was a cradle 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.679
 with respect to the perfect body 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.889
 but when it comes to drawing the ml 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.479
 the test that moves up and down this fact 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.479
 the expensive but good let's see some exercises to do it 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.600
 good embargo some of which is injected traditional 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.060
 dt rocanrol 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.960
 chicago I do not say rocanroles previously the rocanrol and brussels are similar and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.590
 that was in order and some other 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.590
 percent things like playing strings 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.330
 that is, the same time and so on but fundamentally what there is 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 change speed we are on the same 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.260
 this is one 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.390
 what is stretching the third 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.050
 on the seventh fret 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.750
 i always talking in the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.990
 min 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.310
 i the first two 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.310
 it was in the fifth january 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.670
 but we could define for example 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 stretching in the second 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.380
 that is 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 ouch endo 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770
 to the place 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.770
 percent to the note that was sought collegiate efe 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.170
 another 20 first string and 2nd footsteps on the fifth fret 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.780
 the first 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
 the second is played in the eighth and seville 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.909
 now we are going to unite the teachers
