00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
what you bring to the league and in my

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.200 
what you bring to the league and in my

think<00:00:35.510> our<00:00:35.660> games<00:00:35.900> will<00:00:36.050> complement<00:00:36.470> each

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
think our games will complement each

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.400 
think our games will complement each
other<00:00:36.739> well<00:00:36.850> I'm<00:00:37.850> just<00:00:38.059> saying<00:00:38.180> we<00:00:39.110> could<00:00:39.140> take

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
other well I'm just saying we could take

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.729 
other well I'm just saying we could take

feeling<00:01:44.659> about<00:01:44.719> the<00:01:44.930> team<00:01:45.140> at<00:01:45.289> this<00:01:45.380> point<00:01:45.649> of

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
feeling about the team at this point of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.920 
feeling about the team at this point of
the<00:01:45.799> season<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:46.729> right<00:01:47.000> here<00:01:47.030> I'm<00:01:47.630> thinking

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
the season now right here I'm thinking

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.810 
the season now right here I'm thinking
this<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.380> where<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.649> LeBron<00:01:49.009> thing<00:01:49.310> kicks<00:01:49.609> in

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
this is where the LeBron thing kicks in

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.050 
this is where the LeBron thing kicks in
to<00:01:50.060> where<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.689> say<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:50.990> want<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.350> trade<00:01:51.850> maybe<00:01:52.850> so

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
to where I say I want to trade maybe so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.730 
to where I say I want to trade maybe so
we<00:01:53.180> could<00:01:53.299> play<00:01:53.420> together<00:01:53.500> but<00:01:54.500> I'm<00:01:54.590> not<00:01:54.710> sure

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
we could play together but I'm not sure

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.550 
we could play together but I'm not sure
so<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.729> mean<00:01:56.359> we<00:01:56.479> find<00:01:56.719> out<00:01:56.899> later<00:01:57.109> on<00:01:57.200> going

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
so I mean we find out later on going

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.800 
so I mean we find out later on going
