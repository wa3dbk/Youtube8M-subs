00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.630
 since then by the way a huge amount 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.320
 a cut occurs almost every 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.640
 three months who 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.580
 but the bank and promise that the hair will grow inna 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.900
 we will certainly grow literally 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.609

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.569
 after taking the drug unfortunately 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.980
 it doesn't happen what's the androgenic thing 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.739
 alopecia or that reason 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.780
 hair falls out in men and women 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.810
 and we are not diseases in 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.270
 Recently, we believe that this 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.480
 state 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420
 which is about 30 percent 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.600
 men at the age of thirty and and 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.660
 let's say the villa 40 age 45 50 to 150 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.210
 and in families and vision 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.140
 family 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.720
 this is very common 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.540
 problem 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.060
 why does hair fall out from known 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.330
 already literally the last 10 years it 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.200
 genetic predisposition 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.290
 that is, if your father figures 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.660
 rather than having hair loss then most likely 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.150
 you too will have hair loss 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.830
 because it is related to your ank 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.640
 genes 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.280
 but don't necessarily tell me both my 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.110
 grandfather brought out of a vein and I weigh 50 as a write-off 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.700

 aut ie genes can start working a 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.640
 may not start working in this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.980
 by the way, we can’t figure it out yet 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.490
 it is clear what we understand how 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.540
 treat it that is today 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.860
 known medicines which 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.790
 stop hair loss 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.360
 the woman knows the drugs that 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.210
 grow new hair 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.820
 growing new bands is engaged in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.600
 plastic areas 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.580
 surgery which is called surgery and 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.119
 hair transplant in an operation called 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.960
 follicular extraction when they 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 Sokolovsky take no cut no 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.759
 rf cutting tools on hand 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.650
 at the surgeon 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.729
 when it's time to throw out the maestro ment himself 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.579
 each onion is taken separately 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.530
 back of the head and then in the same 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.369
 lukewarm on transplants into 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.720
 problem area the advantage of this a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.909
 method was not only what he 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.110
 painlessly and without anything earlier 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.940
 practically but leaves no 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.910
 traces on the canaries as far as the patient has 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.949
 but also that he 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.749
 allows you to take hair from any part 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.299
 body it expanded the possibilities on 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.109
 hair transplant because if you 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.079
 just a little hair left 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.420
 Zade I have a place 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 reallocate for all our voices what 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.080
 hard now we can 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.200
 take hair not only from this zone but 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.180
 the judges also strayed from the back 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.960
 other measures 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.590
 I would like to add a couple more words 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.430
 the co-operation whose deal is for women 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.830
 women also suffer he radar but 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.160
 just falling out hair loss 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.740
 observed with the middle as it were 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.359
 parting expands 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.219
 these operations also allow us 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.619
 launch this legal act and when 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.289
 woman gets rid of this problem 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.989
 another other possibility is 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.059
 what some women don't like 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.729
 very high front growth 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.679
 hair we can let it 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.179
 others don't like side halls and links 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.769
 they want to have a television screen 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.079
 so leave like most women and 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.349
 too we make changes shape 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.789
 just the front cart by its very course 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.869
 interesting and in our clinic is 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.989
 what are they doing anuki by the way in from here 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.280
 and bordeaux

 uk is not a single clinic this 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.850
 that we transplant the lashes we can 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.079
 really transplant 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.129
 occipital area of ​​the court a to one hundred 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.219
