like that then you want to lift them up

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.280 
like that then you want to lift them up
rotate<00:02:57.570> up<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:59.450> that<00:03:00.450> fold<00:03:01.079> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.750 
rotate up here like that that fold the
arms<00:03:01.320> down<00:03:06.470> at<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.680> knee<00:03:07.890> joint<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.489> want<00:03:08.640> to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
arms down at the knee joint you want to

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.190 
arms down at the knee joint you want to
rotate<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:11.209> bottom<00:03:12.209> half<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.750> leg<00:03:12.959> down

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
rotate the bottom half of the leg down

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:23.539 
rotate the bottom half of the leg down
or<00:03:13.769> around<00:03:15.109> fold<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.320> feet<00:03:16.560> down<00:03:22.370> we'll<00:03:23.370> come

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
or around fold the feet down we'll come

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.410 
or around fold the feet down we'll come
back<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.239> then<00:03:24.480> fold<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> head<00:03:26.420> and

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
back here and then fold up the head and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.690 
back here and then fold up the head and
then<00:03:28.130> take<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:30.980> fold<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.100> up<00:03:32.190> against<00:03:32.489> this

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
then take this fold it up against this

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.479 
then take this fold it up against this
back<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.989> then<00:03:34.200> take<00:03:34.440> these<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.950> rotate<00:03:35.370> them

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
back and then take these and rotate them

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.380 
back and then take these and rotate them
down<00:03:38.090> alright<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.390> there<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.320> have<00:03:41.390> sentinel

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
down alright so there you have sentinel

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
prime cyberverse in robot mode this is a

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.540 
prime cyberverse in robot mode this is a
pretty<00:03:48.300> cool<00:03:48.540> fitter<00:03:48.870> and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550

actually<00:04:51.330> be<00:04:51.630> Battle<00:04:52.020> Damage<00:04:52.080> I'm<00:04:53.040> not<00:04:53.220> sure

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
actually be Battle Damage I'm not sure

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.180 
actually be Battle Damage I'm not sure
what<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:54.320> it's<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.560> actual<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:56.010> the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
what that is it's the actual is the

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.159 
what that is it's the actual is the
sword<00:04:58.100> on<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.160> leader<00:05:00.150> class<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.840> sword<00:05:01.080> has

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
sword on the leader class the sword has

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.650 
sword on the leader class the sword has
got<00:05:01.440> Cybertronian<00:05:02.190> symbols<00:05:02.640> on<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.840> yeah

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
got Cybertronian symbols on it so yeah

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.020 
got Cybertronian symbols on it so yeah
but<00:05:06.660> yeah<00:05:06.870> very<00:05:07.200> very<00:05:07.500> cool<00:05:07.830> his<00:05:08.580> knee<00:05:08.820> can

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
but yeah very very cool his knee can

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.130 
but yeah very very cool his knee can
bend<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.630> do<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.470> transformation<00:05:12.140> although

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
bend and do the transformation although

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.110 
bend and do the transformation although
I<00:05:13.440> suppose<00:05:13.680> actually<00:05:14.340> they<00:05:14.490> put<00:05:14.730> them<00:05:14.880> on<00:05:14.970> the

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
I suppose actually they put them on the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.360 
I suppose actually they put them on the
ball<00:05:15.419> joint<00:05:15.780> so<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:16.740> can<00:05:16.950> bend<00:05:17.250> the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
ball joint so that you can bend the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.690 
ball joint so that you can bend the
knees<00:05:18.650> because<00:05:19.650> they<00:05:20.070> could<00:05:20.220> have<00:05:20.310> just<00:05:20.340> put<00:05:20.640> a

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
knees because they could have just put a

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.750 
knees because they could have just put a
bucket<00:05:21.240> joint<00:05:21.840> in<00:05:22.020> there<00:05:22.260> so<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.530> can<00:05:22.770> turn<00:05:23.010> and

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
bucket joint in there so it can turn and

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.540 
bucket joint in there so it can turn and
not<00:05:23.970> then<00:05:24.180> boy<00:05:24.630> can<00:05:24.930> actually<00:05:25.350> bend<00:05:25.620> see

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
not then boy can actually bend see

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.010 
not then boy can actually bend see
you've<00:05:26.730> got<00:05:26.910> articulation<00:05:27.630> due<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:27.960> the

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
you've got articulation due to the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.460 
you've got articulation due to the
transformation<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:31.169> can<00:05:31.470> move<00:05:32.010> about

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
transformation and that can move about

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.260 
transformation and that can move about
360<00:05:34.470> they're<00:05:34.790> open<00:05:35.790> down<00:05:36.030> bend<00:05:36.510> at<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.690> elbow

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
360 they're open down bend at the elbow

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.300 
360 they're open down bend at the elbow
there<00:05:39.590> put<00:05:40.590> down<00:05:40.890> bend<00:05:41.160> at<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.340> elbow<00:05:41.700> there

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
there put down bend at the elbow there

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.960 
there put down bend at the elbow there
so<00:05:44.310> yeah<00:05:44.640> this<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.450> a<00:05:45.480> pretty<00:05:45.720> cool<00:05:46.970> cyberverse

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
so yeah this is a pretty cool cyberverse

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.580 
so yeah this is a pretty cool cyberverse
figure<00:05:48.510> I<00:05:49.260> don't<00:05:50.220> have<00:05:50.400> any<00:05:51.350> commanders<00:05:52.350> or

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
figure I don't have any commanders or

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.360 
figure I don't have any commanders or
lead<00:05:53.280> your<00:05:53.460> class<00:05:54.290> figures<00:05:55.290> in<00:05:55.530> robot<00:05:56.040> mode<00:05:56.070> to

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
lead your class figures in robot mode to

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.850 
lead your class figures in robot mode to
compare<00:05:56.760> them<00:05:56.850> with<00:05:56.880> but<00:05:57.660> we<00:05:57.780> can<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.800> fact

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
compare them with but we can in fact

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.500 
compare them with but we can in fact
i'll<00:05:59.220> quickly<00:05:59.460> transform<00:06:00.180> sideswipe<00:06:02.419> so<00:06:03.419> you

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
i'll quickly transform sideswipe so you

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.320 
i'll quickly transform sideswipe so you
can<00:06:03.780> see

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:18.770 

shouldn't<00:06:09.330> take<00:06:09.360> too<00:06:09.540> long<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.960> they're<00:06:17.780> so

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
shouldn't take too long and they're so

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.350 
shouldn't take too long and they're so
there<00:06:18.930> is<00:06:19.140> with<00:06:19.320> the<00:06:19.410> middle<00:06:19.830> class<00:06:20.100> figure<00:06:20.400> so

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
there is with the middle class figure so

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.970 
there is with the middle class figure so
yeah<00:06:22.580> pretty<00:06:23.580> cool<00:06:24.020> so<00:06:25.020> yeah<00:06:25.290> I<00:06:25.590> definitely
