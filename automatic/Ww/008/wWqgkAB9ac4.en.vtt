Britishness<00:00:09.360> as<00:00:09.840> for<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.800> story<00:00:11.130> itself<00:00:11.820> it's

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
Britishness as for the story itself it's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.660 
Britishness as for the story itself it's
so<00:00:12.570> unlike<00:00:12.990> anything<00:00:13.410> I've<00:00:14.009> read<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.490> long

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
so unlike anything I've read in a long

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730 
so unlike anything I've read in a long
time<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.030> because<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.870> was<00:00:15.960> written<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.470> long

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
time just because it was written so long

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.099 
time just because it was written so long
ago<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.400> also<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.359> its<00:00:18.480> style<00:00:18.840> I

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
ago and also because of its style I

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.300 
ago and also because of its style I
didn't<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.619> know<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.100> this

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
didn't really know what to make of this

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.340 
didn't really know what to make of this
book<00:00:20.550> when<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.820> first<00:00:21.210> started<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> preface

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
book when I first started the preface

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.800 
book when I first started the preface
which<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.680> basically<00:00:23.130> about<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.789> read<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
which is basically about how to read and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.929 
which is basically about how to read and
respond<00:00:25.320> critically<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.039> art<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
respond critically to art some of the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.779 
respond critically to art some of the
lines<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.570> loved<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.250> didn't

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
lines I loved in some of them I didn't

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.849 
lines I loved in some of them I didn't
as<00:00:29.970> much<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.660> started<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.170> wonder<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
as much and I started to wonder is this

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.310 
as much and I started to wonder is this
satire<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.120> turns<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.930> story

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
satire it turns out that when the story

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.100 
satire it turns out that when the story
was<00:00:34.590> first<00:00:34.829> published<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> serialized

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
was first published as a serialized

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.569 
was first published as a serialized
magazine<00:00:37.110> piece<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.649> received<00:00:37.980> very<00:00:38.280> harsh

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
magazine piece it received very harsh

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
magazine piece it received very harsh
criticism<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> preface<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
criticism and so the preface is a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
criticism and so the preface is a
response<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.610> criticism<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.450> main

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
response to that criticism the main

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.600 
response to that criticism the main
point<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> preface<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.430> quote

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
point of the preface and I will quote

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.299 
point of the preface and I will quote
from<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> directly<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> no<00:00:47.070> such

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
from it directly is there is no such

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
from it directly is there is no such
thing<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> moral<00:00:48.539> or<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:48.899> immoral<00:00:49.350> book

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
thing as a moral or an immoral book

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
thing as a moral or an immoral book
books<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.190> well<00:00:50.430> written<00:00:50.700> or<00:00:50.940> badly<00:00:51.300> written

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
books are well written or badly written

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.610

that<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.289> all

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that is all

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
that is all
I<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.860> actually<00:00:53.039> already<00:00:53.489> thinking<00:00:53.969> about

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
I was actually already thinking about

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180 
I was actually already thinking about
this<00:00:54.360> question<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:55.079> whether<00:00:55.440> books<00:00:55.860> need

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this question about whether books need

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
this question about whether books need
to<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.520> moral<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> read<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> line<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
to be moral when I read that line and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
to be moral when I read that line and
even<00:00:59.190> though<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> complex<00:01:00.000> issue<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.539> would

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
even though it's a complex issue I would

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930 
even though it's a complex issue I would
have<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> say<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.620> agree<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.219> Oscar<00:01:02.609> Wilde

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
have to say I agree with Oscar Wilde

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.369 
have to say I agree with Oscar Wilde
there's<00:01:03.239> another<00:01:03.510> great<00:01:03.780> line<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
there's another great line from the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
there's another great line from the
preface<00:01:04.739> about<00:01:05.129> how<00:01:05.400> when<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.850> piece<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.360> art

preface about how when a piece of art
elicits<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.350> variety<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.250> different<00:01:08.729> responses

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
elicits a variety of different responses

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.140 
elicits a variety of different responses
that<00:01:09.810> means<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.650> new<00:01:10.950> complex<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that means that it's new complex and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.750 
that means that it's new complex and
vital<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.409> would<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.830> say<00:01:14.070> remember<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760

and what they really are the Dorian and
the<00:03:51.840> portrait<00:03:52.350> represent<00:03:53.250> pretty<00:03:53.549> clearly<00:03:54.030> I

though<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.799> think<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.340> sometimes<00:03:59.760> we<00:04:00.329> act

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
though I think that sometimes we act

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.259 
though I think that sometimes we act
like<00:04:01.079> people<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> past<00:04:02.280> we're<00:04:03.030> not

like people in the past we're not

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
pretending and faking the way that we do

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.479 
pretending and faking the way that we do
when<00:04:05.730> we<00:04:05.940> have<00:04:06.120> all<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.630> these<00:04:06.890> filters<00:04:07.890> and

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
when we have all of these filters and

when we have all of these filters and
ways<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:09.170> not<00:04:10.170> really<00:04:10.470> show<00:04:10.739> our<00:04:10.980> true<00:04:11.220> selves

ways to not really show our true selves

themselves hiding in their attic but
there's<00:04:46.320> always<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.860> gap<00:04:47.250> between<00:04:47.550> how<00:04:48.000> things

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
there's always a gap between how things

appear and what they really are and you

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.330 
appear and what they really are and you
do<00:04:51.210> have<00:04:51.389> some<00:04:51.720> responsibility<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.620> think<00:04:52.770> for

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
do have some responsibility I think for

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.420 
do have some responsibility I think for
assuming<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.410> complexity<00:04:55.410> about<00:04:55.620> everything

assuming a complexity about everything

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.900 
assuming a complexity about everything
rather<00:04:56.910> than<00:04:57.210> just<00:04:57.539> accepting<00:04:58.530> whatever

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
rather than just accepting whatever

rather than just accepting whatever
simple<00:04:59.910> thing<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.660> being<00:05:00.960> presented<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.680> you

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
simple thing is being presented to you

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.740 
simple thing is being presented to you
but<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.190> do<00:05:02.250> think<00:05:02.520> there<00:05:02.729> is<00:05:02.850> always<00:05:03.120> room<00:05:03.510> to

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
but I do think there is always room to

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.080 
but I do think there is always room to
be<00:05:03.870> critical<00:05:04.410> especially<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:05.160> a<00:05:05.250> society<00:05:05.850> that

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
be critical especially of a society that

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.140 
be critical especially of a society that
puts<00:05:06.660> this<00:05:06.840> idea<00:05:07.229> forward<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:08.160> some<00:05:08.760> people

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
puts this idea forward that some people

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.600 
puts this idea forward that some people
are<00:05:09.300> perfect<00:05:09.810> or<00:05:10.080> things<00:05:10.470> really<00:05:10.650> are<00:05:11.039> exactly

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
are perfect or things really are exactly

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.300 
are perfect or things really are exactly
as<00:05:11.850> they<00:05:12.090> seem<00:05:12.389> or<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:13.350> we're<00:05:13.530> not<00:05:13.710> all<00:05:14.070> the

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
the references but I didn't feel like

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.839 
the references but I didn't feel like
that<00:06:13.020> really<00:06:13.470> took<00:06:13.770> away<00:06:14.070> from<00:06:14.099> my<00:06:14.550> experience

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
that really took away from my experience

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.240 
that really took away from my experience
of<00:06:15.360> the<00:06:15.479> book<00:06:15.660> I<00:06:15.900> mentioned<00:06:16.470> really<00:06:16.680> enjoying

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
of the book I mentioned really enjoying

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.219 
of the book I mentioned really enjoying
this<00:06:17.490> style<00:06:17.760> of<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.180> Picture<00:06:18.510> of<00:06:18.539> Dorian<00:06:18.690> Gray

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
this style of the Picture of Dorian Gray

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.140 
this style of the Picture of Dorian Gray
and<00:06:19.260> I<00:06:19.590> think<00:06:19.830> that's<00:06:19.979> because<00:06:20.310> I'm<00:06:20.580> so<00:06:20.880> used

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
and I think that's because I'm so used

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.570 
and I think that's because I'm so used
to<00:06:21.300> reading<00:06:21.599> literary<00:06:22.560> fiction<00:06:22.860> where<00:06:23.400> the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
to reading literary fiction where the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.570 
to reading literary fiction where the
plot<00:06:23.760> is<00:06:24.090> just<00:06:24.300> kind<00:06:24.570> of<00:06:24.889> meandering<00:06:25.889> and<00:06:26.430> then

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
plot is just kind of meandering and then

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.939 
plot is just kind of meandering and then
eventually<00:06:26.940> kind<00:06:27.479> of<00:06:27.630> fades<00:06:27.930> out<00:06:28.229> as<00:06:28.560> people's

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
eventually kind of fades out as people's

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.220 
eventually kind of fades out as people's
lives<00:06:29.280> continue<00:06:30.090> to<00:06:30.240> go<00:06:30.389> on

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
lives continue to go on

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.870 
lives continue to go on
the<00:06:31.320> Picture<00:06:31.620> of<00:06:31.650> Dorian<00:06:31.770> Gray<00:06:32.160> from<00:06:32.700> the

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
beginning to the last scene seemed so

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.660 
beginning to the last scene seemed so
carefully<00:06:36.330> plotted<00:06:36.870> and<00:06:37.110> I<00:06:37.710> felt<00:06:38.040> more<00:06:38.220> like<00:06:38.280> I

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
carefully plotted and I felt more like I

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.820 
carefully plotted and I felt more like I
was<00:06:38.970> just<00:06:39.240> along<00:06:39.600> for<00:06:39.630> the<00:06:39.990> ride<00:06:40.170> I<00:06:40.410> really
