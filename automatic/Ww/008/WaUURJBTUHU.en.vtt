00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.580
 avatar of a slide design not only will 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.010
 to work 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.740
 I had the new jobs and we understand 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.690
 that the market does not work in the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.219
 offered what we we have a 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.260
 little cousin and does not offer us 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.750
 that we define we want to have 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 the time to create something new however 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.310
 aromatic plants 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.529
 is this initially had a dimension 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.529
 more reduced and we opted for and already 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.750
 that we started to gain a taste for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 plants that we choose to think about 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 In this but the series we launched into it 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.160
 however, the jobs 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.899
 we had ceased to be already in the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 that we were with the project launched 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 we launched the project was a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 simple decision to take says no no 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 looking for alternatives to employment can 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.219
 we work together we have 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.960
 passion for what we do and that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.780
 allow it with some goals and with 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 some worked was cut up 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 all at once with this story that the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.740
 economy starts to grow 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.689
 and these are our assets ie 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.320
 I need here we make the plants that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.320
 we go later we choose the production 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
 add it apart and see a little to 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.350
 control the costs of our 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 become not see me profession 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.909
 needed while automatic 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.990
 we good at this time the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.960
 ability to fight the top 50 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.780
 aromatic plants is and where 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.610
 we do all the propagation of the material 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.610
 to go outside 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.909
 first it was necessary to use the whole 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.649
 terrain work all terrain may 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.479
 it was necessary to install all 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.299
 irrigation system and place a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 itself gives this kind of production a 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.229
 screen to control enough of the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.060
 weeds that allows my 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.009
 voice and lets get water also allows 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.049
 a water saving we understand that the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.100
 agriculture could be much more than 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.110
 that what is the traditional 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.780
 we could break with some with 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.489
 some things in terms of structure in 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.170
 terms of the area and created a structure 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.819
 profitable and showed everything that was 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.800
 sustainable development over time and saw 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.110
 cultures that were incompatible with 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.880
 is with this area in the Northern Newspaper 23 a 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.770
 rate is between us we also have a 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.450
 opportunity at the end of the market the 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.960
 of the business to make productions 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.690
 intensive lime clitoris odor are plants 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:33.390
 which occurs naturally in all of these 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.160
 two territories taken for both 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.200
 our new scheme does not happen here in the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.930
 avaÃ­ ie the plants are imported 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.240
 come way out go to camera dialing 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.130
 are in the chamber acting the time 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.810
 necessary for what children want 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.280
 that this process takes place in such a way that 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.800
 create any problem with the plant 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.310
 how many dried leaves are crushed 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.040
 worry - - - in a later time the plants 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.320
 were the lavas one of the products was 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.810
 but in bulk water it makes it possible 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.150
 the newest galley a warehouse one 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.530
 small part of the project will 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.220
 products that are accessories at this stage 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.220
 infusions and condiments 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.420
 there is an option I start small think 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.220
 always great and this is what we are already 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.860
 With us, at this moment, we 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.760
 we are showing the installation is this is 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.290
 the year that we can year between 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.540
 quotation marks that we can not was all gain 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.370
 prizes not reinstall but above all 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.690
 learn and at a stage that is always 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.820
 learning and learning 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.010
 the goal is always that what is 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.930
 installed in recent months we always have 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.300
 the goal to create more and more and more more 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.220
 more differentiated customer customer 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.489
 more differentiated products 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.780
 new products new plants very 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.780
 was among our goals
