00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.029
 Now we will knit this 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.490
 flower small from postal columns 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.360
 so that he has a smooth edge and not visible 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.120
 there were streaks of broach 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.630
 for this we need the testicular needle 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.430
 without a pen with a pen tried and not 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.789
 it turns out the edge still prevents the bug 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 getting smooth glue and ordinary 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.680
 hook 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.630
 which can use reverse 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.640
 side can be taken thicker and thinner 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.619
 depending on what thickness in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 I have one or two posts in this case 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.059
 flower small very small and Abel 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.550
 crochet hook 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.489
 we knit a chain of 4 5 air 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.329
 loops to get a ring ring 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.590
 there must be a small ring closure 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.309
 34 I have in this case 4 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.180
 I closed their ring and tied 3 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.210
 lifting air loops 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 then I remove my hook 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 looking for a reed corner here in this loop 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.510
 the loop must be tightened so that it is 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 tight only then the edge is obtained 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.400
 smooth and next I put next to no 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 getting into the loop here this auxiliary 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.909
 hook back and do navi you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.320
 8 upstairs me three four five six 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.479
 seven eight 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.460
 but if you flower more you can 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.950
 do on viva more I remove the hook 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 My needle holding the thread looking for some we 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.009
 in the ring of air loops 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.450
 picking up the thread and pulling everything for 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.380
 once here got a column i have it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.689
 knitted tightened again loop next 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.220
 I put the hook and again do navi you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.770
 two three four five six seven eight 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.420
 I remove the hook again and in the same ring 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.860
 looking for a needle 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:07.140
 pulling the thread over and tying 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.569
 hook again 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.390
 the main thing is to ensure that the eyelet 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:20.390
 was tight scored 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.810
 put the hook away again 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.360
 ring picked up no stretched here 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.330
 I'm already the 3rd peace. 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.440
 on one ring of air loops 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.230
 tied a hook maybe it seems 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.540
 long but with skills to do it very much 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400
 quickly for a smooth edge 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.220
 flower can be inserted anywhere already 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:55.860
 without additional strapping three four 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:58.340
 five six seven eight I don't know these 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.060
 I see flowers quickly 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:08.910
 but they are all neat on us to tie 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:12.000
 89 well at least 10 petals 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:18.269
 so that they were tight to each other then 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:25.769
 This is what I showed. 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:27.030
 First we pick up the thread 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:33.090
 principle, everything can be done 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:35.280
 with a needle until the very end as soon as 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.900
 tied a chain of loops and connect in 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.209
 ring on the date moved to the needle 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.880
 auxiliary hook 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.920
 Well, instead of the hook, you can take any knitting needle 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.920
 whatever diameter you need 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.210
 why 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:59.470
 I already have 99 petals enough 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:06.760
 I have them here picks up as the very first 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.760
 thread and connect cut the thread and 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:18.320
 I'm dragging on a flower 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.300
 this is the right side this is the left broach 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.040
 all on the left side to the right and not visible 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.530
 and see what a smooth edge 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:30.230
 it turns out to tie up nothing 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:32.600
 just get the vision in there wherever you are 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.390
 I need two flowers for this I have 10 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.900
 petals on this 9 slightly smaller 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.480
 van but visually not even visible here 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:46.370
 flowers can be tied up with the usual 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:50.240
 reed games games are different thinner 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.450
 toni it is thicker it is from knitting machines 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.390
 I bought in-store boutiques not 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.600
 the beach they give such needles give 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:03.170
 I did have a pen with one pen 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.710
 but uncomfortable pen bothers me because 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.440
 Attach hook with handle unevenly 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.820
 therefore it is applied 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.820
 such devices to bind
