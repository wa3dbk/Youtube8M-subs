do do you see any difference when you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.620 
do do you see any difference when you
look<00:00:26.189> at<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> tape<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.790> year<00:00:27.060> maybe<00:00:27.390> with

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
look at the tape this year maybe with

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.359 
look at the tape this year maybe with
the<00:00:27.720> doc<00:00:27.930> rivers<00:00:28.349> led<00:00:28.590> squad<00:00:28.919> I<00:00:28.950> really<00:00:29.250> do

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the doc rivers led squad I really do

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.240 
the doc rivers led squad I really do
anything<00:00:29.550> differently<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.239> you<00:00:30.329> can<00:00:30.509> see<00:00:31.250> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
anything differently that you can see I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.139 
anything differently that you can see I
think<00:00:33.829> they<00:00:34.829> became<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> little<00:00:35.820> bit<00:00:35.910> stronger

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
think they became a little bit stronger

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.530 
think they became a little bit stronger
now<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.520> great<00:00:38.520> coach<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.390> have

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
now they have a great coach they have

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.360 
now they have a great coach they have
good<00:00:39.870> coach<00:00:40.079> last<00:00:40.350> year<00:00:40.500> too<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
good coach last year too but you know I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.510 
good coach last year too but you know I
think<00:00:42.320> they<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.470> championship<00:00:44.010> coach<00:00:44.190> now

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
think they have a championship coach now

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.540 
think they have a championship coach now
I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.540> they<00:00:45.720> give<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.170> something<00:00:46.950> extra<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I think they give up something extra I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.110 
I think they give up something extra I
think<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.180> more<00:00:48.750> confidence<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:50.120> they

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
think they have more confidence and they

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.410 
think they have more confidence and they
are<00:00:51.180> playing<00:00:51.890> pretty<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.760> start
