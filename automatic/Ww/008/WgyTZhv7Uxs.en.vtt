gonna look like when you gain weight I'm
gonna<00:02:49.580> take<00:02:49.670> an<00:02:49.760> example<00:02:50.090> here<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.240> an<00:02:50.360> apple

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
gonna take an example here of an apple

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.840 
gonna take an example here of an apple
she's<00:02:51.530> thirty<00:02:52.160> eight<00:02:52.310> twenty<00:02:52.550> nine<00:02:52.730> thirty

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
she's thirty eight twenty nine thirty

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.809 
she's thirty eight twenty nine thirty
four<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.470> she's<00:02:55.010> an<00:02:55.130> apple<00:02:55.370> because<00:02:55.490> she<00:02:55.730> has

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
four so she's an apple because she has

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.250 
four so she's an apple because she has
the<00:02:55.940> minimum<00:02:56.270> for<00:02:56.510> its<00:02:56.690> difference<00:02:57.020> between

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
the minimum for its difference between

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.140 
the minimum for its difference between
her<00:02:57.470> bust<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.100> her<00:02:58.280> hip<00:02:58.430> size<00:02:58.670> obviously<00:02:58.880> she

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
her bust and her hip size obviously she

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.520 
her bust and her hip size obviously she
could<00:02:59.270> be<00:02:59.360> larger<00:02:59.690> five<00:02:59.900> six<00:03:00.170> seven<00:03:00.410> inch

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
could be larger five six seven inch

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.289 
could be larger five six seven inch
difference<00:03:00.680> pears<00:03:01.670> are<00:03:01.849> exactly<00:03:02.209> the

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
difference pears are exactly the

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.270 
difference pears are exactly the
opposite

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
opposite

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.020 
opposite
so<00:03:03.610> she<00:03:03.670> she<00:03:04.180> goes<00:03:04.360> from<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.690> 34<00:03:05.520> hip<00:03:06.520> size<00:03:06.820> to

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
so she she goes from the 34 hip size to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.110 
so she she goes from the 34 hip size to
a<00:03:07.060> 38<00:03:07.480> hip<00:03:07.630> size<00:03:08.490> her<00:03:09.490> bust<00:03:09.730> size<00:03:09.910> also

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
a 38 hip size her bust size also

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.600 
a 38 hip size her bust size also
increases<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.720> 42<00:03:11.200> but<00:03:11.800> her<00:03:11.980> waist<00:03:12.280> also

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
increases to 42 but her waist also

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.090 
increases to 42 but her waist also
increases<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.390> 32<00:03:14.020> because<00:03:14.410> she's<00:03:14.740> not<00:03:14.920> an

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
increases to 32 because she's not an

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.320 
increases to 32 because she's not an
hourglass<00:03:15.520> she<00:03:15.700> wants<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.970> look<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.150> an

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.860 
29 if they were to get bigger they could
have<00:03:24.070> maintained<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.550> 29<00:03:24.880> waist<00:03:25.120> but<00:03:25.690> she's

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
have maintained that 29 waist but she's

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.510 
have maintained that 29 waist but she's
an<00:03:26.020> apple<00:03:26.410> she<00:03:26.590> can't<00:03:26.860> maintain<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.400> because

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
an apple she can't maintain it because

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520 
an apple she can't maintain it because
that's<00:03:28.030> not<00:03:28.150> why<00:03:28.330> her<00:03:28.450> genetics<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:28.959> her<00:03:29.050> body

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
that's not why her genetics in her body

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.910 
that's not why her genetics in her body
works<00:03:30.490> so<00:03:31.209> she's<00:03:31.540> gonna<00:03:31.720> go<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.080> 40<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.470> 30<00:03:32.740> to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
works so she's gonna go to a 40 to 30 to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.180 
works so she's gonna go to a 40 to 30 to
40<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.850> 30<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.300> 38<00:03:34.690> measurements<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.130> she

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
40 to 30 to 38 measurements and so she

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.580 
40 to 30 to 38 measurements and so she
has<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.520> unwanted<00:03:36.970> waste<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.330> 32<00:03:37.780> now<00:03:37.989> at<00:03:38.230> an

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
has the unwanted waste of 32 now at an

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.880 
has the unwanted waste of 32 now at an
average<00:03:38.739> height<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.250> female<00:03:39.580> 5<00:03:39.850> 5<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:41.110> that's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
average height of female 5 5 so that's

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.020 
average height of female 5 5 so that's
why<00:03:42.100> it's<00:03:42.280> important<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.790> know<00:03:42.880> your
