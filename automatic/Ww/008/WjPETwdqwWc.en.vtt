00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 we will think 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.250
 that a race like strangers or the cousin 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.840
 your book is very good in this person 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.200
 I come to bring a tutorial of gestha 5 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.100
 Online mode of how to remove the hood 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.740
 your vehicle whether it's a canopy or some 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.680
 r tourism for example like this that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.490
 I have here as you can see it looks 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 fantastic what is the vehicle me 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.660
 he liked very much very much and when I 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 I was scaling what is the normal vehicle 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 feels with a chingo speed 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
 nano but when you remove the hood 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 I know why I feel that the vehicle 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 run more I do not know if it's my imagination 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 but I feel that more runs what is 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.470
 the vehicle but good then it takes like 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.360
 take off the first thing they're going to have 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.100
 obviously what your vehicle and you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.510
 they have to put what is a sniper and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.010
 Well, you're going to shoot the part of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.370
 behind what is your vehicle where you 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.350
 raise what is the hood of what is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.910
 the engine as you can see here has some 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 how many shots three on the side 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.719
 right now let's use the side 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.610
 left and I'll keep shooting him and 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.680
 this will make you every time you shot him 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.710
 with the air by rises what is the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.900
 hood now since it got up what is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.119
 the engine cap as good only 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.030
 I'm going to grab a bit of speed and the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.380
 lid will be pulled off then this is how 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.909
 it takes away many races has 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.190
 asked if they fart as the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.509
 removed all this but well then that's right 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.250
 as it is done without damaging the vehicle 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.950
 because a lot of people touch it until it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.670
 the attack is disrupted and is torn 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.899
 it covered such or the hood but of that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.180
 So, what is your vehicle? 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.970
 the shock all this and this way not 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.619
 this way then you leave it that way impeccable 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.530
 what the vehicle is for you 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.539
