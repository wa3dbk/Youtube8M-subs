00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 started thinking about recording end of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.190
 March had to deliver in July so 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.640
 it took less than two months to do everything 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.280

 I had to take pictures of the cd cover everything 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 swollen thinkers is that you do not

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.760
 I'm telling you that the key is missing. 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.560
 corticosteroids to take pictures had a day 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.320
 I was with a triple eye so you do not have 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 photoshop solve but fla flu is very 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.409
 good and we managed to find a way 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.970
 doing sports was cover but with exception 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.150
 Strong as this worst in all my 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.939
 life and I can not speak my 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.680
 curiosity 4 people realize that I 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.659
 I recorded the fastest voice of all 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 types of vide I recorded three songs 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.560
 in one day I thought I knew the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.689
 music and this is well accustomed to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 singing and it was super quiet so went 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.710
 good 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.180
 curiosity and five times have already noticed 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.070
 I have carioca accent I 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.079
 I'm from rio de janeiro but I'm singing 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.990
 this kind of god is not so understand 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.460
 Like I learned to sing like this but in that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 cd I pulled my carioca accent 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.570
 because because I already knew the songs 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.280
 like my brother singing the carioca site 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.840
 so I can not sing with 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.100
 s various parts 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.619
 then you will see that you are missing a 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.229
 little bit different on cd curiosity 6 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.719
 it was a cd that suzane again 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.660
 produced clear but in the middle he co 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.460
 produced together with suzane 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.770
 his were talking about what he wanted then 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.650
 I think this is a curiosity because my 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.480
 brother and my brother and only produces and from where 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.050

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.240
 and to close the seventh curiosity in the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.220
 true the name of a curiosity is the 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.350
 difference to be to others 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.880
 This is a cd that I'm in love with. 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.820
 he because I think he says that people 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.920
 you need to hear it on the ground but it's a 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.110
 entertainment something for you to hear if 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.390

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.550
 he is strong has very strong lyrics that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.800
 They talk like this about things that we 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.510

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.870
 traditions about how we should 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.000
