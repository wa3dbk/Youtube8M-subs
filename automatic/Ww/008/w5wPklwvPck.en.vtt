00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:03.770 

the<00:00:02.159> next<00:00:02.399> job<00:00:02.610> that<00:00:02.850> we<00:00:02.970> have<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.300> do<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.629> our

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
the next job that we have to do in our

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.690 
the next job that we have to do in our
game<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.560> make<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.890> turret<00:00:05.250> dumber<00:00:05.549> and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
game is to make the turret dumber and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.020 
game is to make the turret dumber and
smarter<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.839> same<00:00:07.080> time<00:00:07.410> so<00:00:08.099> right<00:00:08.490> now<00:00:08.519> it

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
smarter at the same time so right now it

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.570 
smarter at the same time so right now it
is<00:00:09.420> really<00:00:09.900> smart<00:00:10.200> because<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.800> can<00:00:11.010> see<00:00:11.370> us

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
is really smart because it can see us

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.600 
is really smart because it can see us
directly<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.540> it's<00:00:12.929> constantly<00:00:13.530> focused<00:00:14.340> on

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
directly and it's constantly focused on

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.689 
directly and it's constantly focused on
us<00:00:15.240> which<00:00:15.540> gives<00:00:15.900> deterred<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.949> advantage<00:00:17.490> of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
us which gives deterred the advantage of

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.790 
us which gives deterred the advantage of
basically<00:00:18.240> having<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.690> perfect<00:00:19.289> shot<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
basically having a perfect shot that I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.010 
basically having a perfect shot that I
was<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.189> entire<00:00:20.490> time<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.119> that's<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.810> course

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
was the entire time and that's of course

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.220 
was the entire time and that's of course
not<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.949> want<00:00:23.029> so<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
not really what we want so we need to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.439 
not really what we want so we need to
make<00:00:25.410> him<00:00:25.619> Dumber<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.029> he<00:00:27.180> needs<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
make him Dumber as in that he needs to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.620 
make him Dumber as in that he needs to
rotate<00:00:27.720> slower<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.949> outrun<00:00:29.429> him<00:00:29.730> he<00:00:30.420> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
rotate slower so if we outrun him he is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.470 
rotate slower so if we outrun him he is
not<00:00:31.109> aiming<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.830> us<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.070> whole<00:00:32.099> time<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.059> also

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
not aiming at us the whole time and also

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.540 
not aiming at us the whole time and also
we<00:00:33.930> need<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> make<00:00:34.380> him<00:00:34.590> dumber<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.190> sense

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
we need to make him dumber in the sense

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.510 
we need to make him dumber in the sense
of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.360> fact<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.750> we're<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.590> range<00:00:37.829> that

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
of the fact that we're out of range that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.119 
of the fact that we're out of range that
he<00:00:38.640> cannot<00:00:38.940> detect<00:00:39.390> us<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.469> otherwise

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
he cannot detect us so otherwise

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.580 
he cannot detect us so otherwise
deterrent<00:00:41.879> would<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.140> other<00:00:43.230> side<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
deterrent would be on the other side of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.350 
deterrent would be on the other side of
the<00:00:43.739> level<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> he'd<00:00:44.460> still<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.879> shooting<00:00:45.239> at

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the level and he'd still be shooting at

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 
the level and he'd still be shooting at
us<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.989> course<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.500> don't<00:00:46.620> want<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
us and of course we don't want that to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.090 
us and of course we don't want that to
happen<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.559> need<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.739> change

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
happen so to do that we need to change

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.459 
happen so to do that we need to change
our<00:00:50.309> script<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.879> course<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> we're

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
our script of course but now that we're

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.040 
our script of course but now that we're
going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.520> deeper<00:00:53.969> level<00:00:54.420> scripting

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
going to do some deeper level scripting

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.979 
going to do some deeper level scripting
or<00:00:55.230> coding<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.129> our<00:00:56.730> turret<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> good

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
or coding on our turret it is a good

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.500 
or coding on our turret it is a good
idea<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> use<00:00:59.129> our<00:00:59.370> turd<00:00:59.640> model<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.359> now

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
idea not to use our turd model for now

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
idea not to use our turd model for now
now<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> might<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.800> asking<00:01:01.829> why<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.430> turret

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
now you might be asking why the turret

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
now you might be asking why the turret
is<00:01:03.000> looking<00:01:03.359> great<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.989> wanted<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
is looking great and we wanted to see it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
is looking great and we wanted to see it
work<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.810> usually<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.260> creating

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
work but usually when you're creating

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.340 
work but usually when you're creating
your<00:01:08.520> game<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.930> into<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
your game and you're going into a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
your game and you're going into a
somewhat<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.070> deeper<00:01:11.580> level<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> scripting

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
somewhat more deeper level of scripting

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.249 
somewhat more deeper level of scripting
then<00:01:13.380> there's<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> lot<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> things<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.659> 3d

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
then there's a lot of things about a 3d

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.830 
then there's a lot of things about a 3d
model<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.310> give<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> headaches<00:01:18.060> for

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
model that can give you headaches for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.690 
model that can give you headaches for
example<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.340> turret<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:21.240> has<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:22.670> lot<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
example the turret here has a lot of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.929 
example the turret here has a lot of
arms<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.960> body<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> quite<00:01:25.710> big<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.759> we

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
arms and the body is quite big so if we

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.810 
arms and the body is quite big so if we
start<00:01:27.110> attaching<00:01:28.110> script<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> inside

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
start attaching script from the inside

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.289 
start attaching script from the inside
or<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.210> origin<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:32.009> turret<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> will

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
or the origin of this turret it will

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.160 
or the origin of this turret it will
most<00:01:33.810> likely<00:01:34.110> collide<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.930> arms<00:01:36.930> or

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
most likely collide with the arms or

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
most likely collide with the arms or
something<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.850> make

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
something like that and that will make

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
something like that and that will make
our<00:01:39.150> script<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.720> stable<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.189> really

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
our script and stable so if we really

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
our script and stable so if we really
want<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.119> our<00:01:42.210> script<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.659> working<00:01:43.079> or

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
want to know of our script is working or

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.859 
want to know of our script is working or
not<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.710> easier<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.909> apply<00:01:45.600> your

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
not it is easier to just apply your

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
not it is easier to just apply your
script<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> simple<00:01:46.710> primitives<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.549> then<00:01:48.210> go

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
script to simple primitives and then go

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
script to simple primitives and then go
from<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.290> soon<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> script<00:01:50.070> works

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
from there as soon as the script works

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.789 
from there as soon as the script works
attach<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.180> turret<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:52.049> notice

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
attach it to your turret and then notice

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.530 
attach it to your turret and then notice
what<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> flaws<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.759> model<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
what the flaws of your model are and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
what the flaws of your model are and
then<00:01:54.899> adjusting<00:01:55.409> from<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
then adjusting from there so in this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510 
then adjusting from there so in this
case<00:01:57.090> let's<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.630> grab<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> turret<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.890> move

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
case let's just grab the turret and move

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.319 
case let's just grab the turret and move
it<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> way<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:01.640> also<00:02:02.640> let<00:02:03.030> me<00:02:03.060> turn

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
it out of the way here also let me turn

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.600 
it out of the way here also let me turn
off<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.930> GUI<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.340> need<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
off the GUI because we don't need that

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.639 
off the GUI because we don't need that
in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> scene<00:02:06.119> view<00:02:06.180> right<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:06.780> let<00:02:07.350> me<00:02:07.469> make

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
in the scene view right now let me make

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.059 
in the scene view right now let me make
the<00:02:08.450> platform<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.929> bigger<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.830> we

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the platform a little bigger so that we

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.960 
the platform a little bigger so that we
have<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.520> room<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.760> play

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
have some room to play

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.940 
have some room to play
so<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> would<00:02:14.050> go<00:02:14.200> with<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.410> 40<00:02:15.130> 40<00:02:16.090> sighs<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so I would go with a 40 40 sighs and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.270 
so I would go with a 40 40 sighs and
then<00:02:17.950> move<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.610> over<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.940> little<00:02:19.090> bit<00:02:20.280> perfect

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
then move it over a little bit perfect

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.620 
then move it over a little bit perfect
that<00:02:21.400> will<00:02:21.520> do<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.700> trick<00:02:21.820> just<00:02:22.090> fine<00:02:24.630> all

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
that will do the trick just fine all

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.860 
that will do the trick just fine all
right<00:02:25.870> next<00:02:26.650> what<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.160> could<00:02:27.370> do<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.820> add<00:02:28.510> some

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
right next what we could do is add some

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.110 
right next what we could do is add some
walls<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.770> also<00:02:29.920> want<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.580> add<00:02:30.820> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
walls because we also want to add the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.690 
walls because we also want to add the
ability<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:32.260> make<00:02:32.620> sure<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.220> if<00:02:33.370> there's<00:02:33.610> a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
ability to make sure that if there's a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.180 
ability to make sure that if there's a
wall<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.240> between<00:02:34.360> us<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.050> deterred<00:02:35.410> he<00:02:35.980> won't

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
wall in between us and deterred he won't

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.850 
wall in between us and deterred he won't
notice<00:02:36.550> us<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.600> let's<00:02:37.750> create<00:02:38.050> another<00:02:38.230> game

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
notice us so let's create another game

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.660 
notice us so let's create another game
object<00:02:40.530> let's<00:02:41.530> go<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.040> look<00:02:42.160> at<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.490> from

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
object let's go and look at this from

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.100 
object let's go and look at this from
the<00:02:42.760> side<00:02:43.120> view<00:02:44.280> make<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.490> little<00:02:45.670> bigger<00:02:45.940> so

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.020 

I'm<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.320> making<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.010> ridiculously<00:02:51.580> large

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
I'm just making a ridiculously large

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.720 
I'm just making a ridiculously large
cube<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.470> if<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.709> hide<00:02:53.950> behind<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.459> cube

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
cube so that if we hide behind the cube

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.040 
cube so that if we hide behind the cube
we<00:02:54.940> have<00:02:55.120> some<00:02:55.420> cover<00:02:55.750> basically<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:58.050> then

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
we have some cover basically and then

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.860 
we have some cover basically and then
next<00:02:59.290> let's<00:02:59.620> add<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.370> object<00:03:01.270> that<00:03:01.420> will<00:03:01.570> pose

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
next let's add the object that will pose

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.910 
next let's add the object that will pose
as<00:03:02.170> our<00:03:02.320> temporary<00:03:02.740> Kurt<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.340> that's<00:03:03.490> also<00:03:03.790> a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
as our temporary Kurt and that's also a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.170 
as our temporary Kurt and that's also a
cube<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.760> create<00:03:07.209> other<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.840> then<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.350> cube<00:03:08.650> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
cube so create other and then a cube and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.720 
cube so create other and then a cube and
let's<00:03:10.180> move<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:11.500> front<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.430> cube

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
let's move that in front of the cube

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.780 
let's move that in front of the cube
here<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.500> when<00:03:14.709> we<00:03:14.860> start<00:03:15.370> when<00:03:15.670> we

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
here so that when we start when we

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.420 
here so that when we start when we
launched<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.510> will<00:03:17.050> notice<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.560> player<00:03:17.800> but

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
launched it will notice the player but

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.040 
launched it will notice the player but
as<00:03:18.550> soon<00:03:18.700> as<00:03:18.820> we<00:03:18.970> hide<00:03:19.150> behind<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.630> cube<00:03:19.870> it

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
as soon as we hide behind the cube it

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.310 
as soon as we hide behind the cube it
will<00:03:20.230> not<00:03:20.440> okay<00:03:21.430> make<00:03:22.120> sure<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.930> cube

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
will not okay make sure that this cube

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.070 
will not okay make sure that this cube
has<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.530> box<00:03:23.890> Collider<00:03:24.340> attached<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.330> we'll

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
has a box Collider attached it and we'll

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.800 
has a box Collider attached it and we'll
go<00:03:26.320> from<00:03:26.350> there<00:03:26.620> all<00:03:27.519> right<00:03:27.700> let's<00:03:28.090> attach<00:03:28.510> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
go from there all right let's attach the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.430 
go from there all right let's attach the
third<00:03:29.110> control<00:03:29.650> script<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.250> our<00:03:30.790> cube<00:03:31.440> also

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
third control script on our cube also

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.650 
third control script on our cube also
let's<00:03:32.650> go<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:32.890> our<00:03:33.130> other<00:03:33.430> turret<00:03:33.940> body<00:03:34.300> and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
let's go to our other turret body and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.710 
let's go to our other turret body and
then<00:03:35.530> get<00:03:36.489> rid<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.120> script<00:03:37.510> or<00:03:37.690> a

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
then get rid of the script or a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.759 
then get rid of the script or a
basically<00:03:38.380> temporary<00:03:39.420> deactivated<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.769> then

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
basically temporary deactivated and then

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.009 
basically temporary deactivated and then
we<00:03:41.950> can<00:03:42.100> make<00:03:42.280> sure<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:42.850> when<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.540> script<00:03:43.870> is

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
we can make sure that when the script is

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.680 
we can make sure that when the script is
sending<00:03:44.350> us<00:03:44.470> commands<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:45.310> our<00:03:45.820> console

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
sending us commands in our console

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.259 
sending us commands in our console
window<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:47.650> we<00:03:47.799> can<00:03:48.220> be<00:03:48.340> sure<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.760> comes<00:03:48.970> from

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
window that we can be sure it comes from

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.050 
window that we can be sure it comes from
this<00:03:49.420> cube<00:03:49.810> instead<00:03:50.380> of<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:51.010> turret<00:03:51.280> we

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
this cube instead of the turret we

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.580 
this cube instead of the turret we
really<00:03:52.390> need<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.570> forget<00:03:52.959> about<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.350> Tauri

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
really need to forget about the Tauri

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.250 
really need to forget about the Tauri
right<00:03:53.830> now<00:03:54.010> basically<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.090> let's<00:03:55.840> rename

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
right now basically and let's rename

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.250 
right now basically and let's rename
this<00:03:56.620> cube<00:03:58.170> tamp<00:03:59.400> turret<00:04:00.400> now<00:04:01.239> notice<00:04:01.570> I'm<00:04:01.900> not

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
this cube tamp turret now notice I'm not

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.680 
this cube tamp turret now notice I'm not
setting<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.709> look<00:04:03.010> at<00:04:03.160> target<00:04:03.580> yet<00:04:03.790> because<00:04:04.510> I

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
setting the look at target yet because I

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.750 
setting the look at target yet because I
want<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:04.959> coat<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.500> script<00:04:05.860> in<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.100> way<00:04:06.250> that

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
want to coat this script in a way that

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.449 
want to coat this script in a way that
it<00:04:06.880> doesn't<00:04:07.330> really<00:04:07.600> need<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.410> target<00:04:08.950> even

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
it doesn't really need the target even

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.720 
it doesn't really need the target even
if<00:04:09.580> it's<00:04:09.730> not<00:04:10.000> there<00:04:10.330> it<00:04:10.540> should<00:04:11.080> work<00:04:11.730> okay

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
if it's not there it should work okay

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.360 
if it's not there it should work okay
now<00:04:13.180> let's<00:04:13.450> open<00:04:13.930> up<00:04:14.200> our<00:04:14.380> turret<00:04:14.830> control

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
now let's open up our turret control

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.969 
now let's open up our turret control
script<00:04:15.989> let's<00:04:16.989> make<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.229> a<00:04:17.380> little<00:04:17.530> smaller<00:04:17.620> so

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
script let's make it a little smaller so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.740 
script let's make it a little smaller so
we<00:04:18.250> could<00:04:18.400> see<00:04:18.609> things

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
we could see things

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.030 
we could see things
and<00:04:19.870> let's<00:04:20.739> start<00:04:21.010> coding<00:04:21.579> from<00:04:21.730> here
