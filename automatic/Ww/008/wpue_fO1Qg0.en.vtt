vertical cross model that is used in
game<00:02:25.610> brought<00:02:26.360> into<00:02:26.600> my<00:02:26.660> craft<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.620> looks

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
game brought into my craft and it looks

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.090 
game brought into my craft and it looks
pretty<00:02:27.950> freaking<00:02:28.430> awesome<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.959> think<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.170> it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
pretty freaking awesome I think and it

legs texture is a bit Balkan and I will

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.500 
legs texture is a bit Balkan and I will
fix<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.500> later<00:02:36.830> but<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.150> for

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
fix that later but it is like that for

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.140

is here system it is quite a lot of uses
I'm<00:03:10.910> not<00:03:11.299> sure<00:03:11.600> what<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.140> number<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.440> right

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
I'm not sure what the number is right

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.310 
I'm not sure what the number is right
now<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:13.130> will<00:03:13.820> check<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.720> will<00:03:14.900> be<00:03:15.049> right

with an approach to get the go sign gems
they're<00:04:35.110> really<00:04:35.349> expensive<00:04:35.770> but<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:36.880> think<00:04:37.120> it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
they're really expensive but I think it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.050 
they're really expensive but I think it
pays<00:04:37.810> out<00:04:38.050> if<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.680> get<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.069> armor<00:04:39.400> because<00:04:39.610> I

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
pays out if you get the armor because I

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:49.230 
pays out if you get the armor because I
mean<00:04:40.960> it's<00:04:41.770> pretty<00:04:41.979> epic<00:04:42.160> government
