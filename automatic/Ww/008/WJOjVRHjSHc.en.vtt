cases<00:01:50.720> guys<00:01:51.140> he<00:01:51.620> is<00:01:51.740> going<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.130> wipe<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.520> floor

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
cases guys he is going to wipe the floor

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.040 
cases guys he is going to wipe the floor
with<00:01:52.760> these<00:01:53.030> guys<00:01:53.180> he's<00:01:53.420> even<00:01:53.570> go<00:01:53.660> on<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.840> pretty

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
with these guys he's even go on a pretty

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.600 
with these guys he's even go on a pretty
good<00:01:54.140> streak<00:01:54.620> especially<00:01:55.130> considering<00:01:55.580> that

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
good streak especially considering that

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.830 
good streak especially considering that
he's<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:55.970> middle<00:01:56.240> he's<00:01:56.450> running<00:01:56.750> around

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
he's in the middle he's running around

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.240 
he's in the middle he's running around
he's<00:01:57.170> probably<00:01:57.590> playing<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.920> little<00:01:58.130> bit

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
he's probably playing a little bit

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.710 
he's probably playing a little bit
aggressive<00:01:58.760> because<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.270> kind<00:01:59.480> of<00:01:59.540> have<00:01:59.690> to

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
aggressive because you kind of have to

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.330 
aggressive because you kind of have to
play<00:01:59.990> aggressive<00:02:00.440> it's<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.710> defibrillators

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
play aggressive it's the defibrillators

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.160 
play aggressive it's the defibrillators
you<00:02:01.460> can't<00:02:01.700> exactly<00:02:02.000> zap<00:02:02.390> people<00:02:02.540> across<00:02:02.900> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
you can't exactly zap people across the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.020 
you can't exactly zap people across the
map<00:02:03.350> because<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:04.430> just<00:02:04.460> wouldn't<00:02:04.790> be

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
map because that just wouldn't be

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.510 
map because that just wouldn't be
realistic<00:02:05.600> in<00:02:05.690> many<00:02:05.870> cases<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:06.560> overall<00:02:07.250> I

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
realistic in many cases but overall I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.770 
realistic in many cases but overall I
really<00:02:07.550> enjoyed<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> clip<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.450> thought<00:02:08.570> it<00:02:08.690> was

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
really enjoyed the clip I thought it was

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.120 
really enjoyed the clip I thought it was
very<00:02:08.840> different<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.560> I

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
very different and I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.860 
very different and I
appreciate<00:02:10.760> people<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.240> are<00:02:11.360> willing<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.660> do

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
appreciate people that are willing to do

that battlefield 3 issued on its release
overall<00:02:33.350> he's<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.100> just<00:02:34.250> dropping

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
overall he's going to be just dropping

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.130 
overall he's going to be just dropping
debris<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.270> opposition<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
debris on the opposition and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.200 
debris on the opposition and
unfortunately<00:02:36.710> their<00:02:36.890> medics<00:02:37.190> are<00:02:37.460> worrying

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
unfortunately their medics are worrying

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.520 
unfortunately their medics are worrying
about<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.570> points<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.990> are<00:02:39.140> laying<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
about the points that are laying on the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.870 
about the points that are laying on the
ground<00:02:39.740> instead<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.280> destroying<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
ground instead of destroying the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.340 
ground instead of destroying the
opposition<00:02:41.450> that's<00:02:41.600> up<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.930> buildings

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
opposition that's up in the buildings

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.170 
opposition that's up in the buildings
within<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.770> spawn<00:02:43.070> as<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.640> guys<00:02:43.820> can<00:02:44.000> pretty

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
within the spawn as you guys can pretty

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.250 
within the spawn as you guys can pretty
much<00:02:44.270> see<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.660> looks<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:44.990> they've<00:02:45.170> been

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
much see it looks like they've been

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.900 
much see it looks like they've been
spawn<00:02:45.560> trap<00:02:45.830> for<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.070> sufficient<00:02:46.280> amount<00:02:46.670> of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
spawn trap for a sufficient amount of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.570 
spawn trap for a sufficient amount of
time<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.390> don't<00:02:47.630> feel<00:02:47.780> too<00:02:47.960> bad<00:02:48.170> about<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
time so I don't feel too bad about the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.470 
time so I don't feel too bad about the
defending<00:02:49.580> team<00:02:49.760> that<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.300> getting

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
defending team that is just getting

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.630 
defending team that is just getting
rubble<00:02:50.870> killed<00:02:51.110> over<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.590> over<00:02:51.680> again<00:02:51.890> but

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
rubble killed over and over again but

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.950 
rubble killed over and over again but
overall<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.030> thought<00:02:53.270> this<00:02:53.390> clip<00:02:53.600> was<00:02:53.780> very

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
overall I thought this clip was very

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.690 
overall I thought this clip was very
creative<00:02:54.290> because<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:55.010> didn't<00:02:55.430> even<00:02:55.520> know<00:02:55.640> you

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
creative because I didn't even know you

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.100 
creative because I didn't even know you
could<00:02:55.790> bring<00:02:56.060> down<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:56.270> side<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.870> wall<00:02:57.080> I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
could bring down that side of the wall I

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.290 
could bring down that side of the wall I
know<00:02:57.260> sin<00:02:57.950> crossing<00:02:58.370> has<00:02:58.550> some<00:02:58.850> walls<00:02:59.060> that

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
know sin crossing has some walls that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.910 
know sin crossing has some walls that
can<00:02:59.480> collapse<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.080> not<00:03:00.170> every<00:03:00.410> single<00:03:00.620> one

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
can collapse but not every single one

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.920 
can collapse but not every single one
and<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.190> lot<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.340> battlefield<00:03:01.850> 3<00:03:02.090> has<00:03:02.660> the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
and a lot of battlefield 3 has the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.390 
and a lot of battlefield 3 has the
rubble<00:03:03.200> effect<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:03.710> it's<00:03:03.890> not<00:03:04.040> for<00:03:04.190> every

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
rubble effect but it's not for every

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.070 
rubble effect but it's not for every
centralized<00:03:04.910> wall<00:03:05.180> which<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.600> kind<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.900> suck

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
centralized wall which can kind of suck

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.990 
centralized wall which can kind of suck
at<00:03:06.260> certain<00:03:06.650> circumstances<00:03:07.310> if<00:03:07.460> you<00:03:07.520> are

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
at certain circumstances if you are

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.030 
at certain circumstances if you are
being<00:03:08.180> spawn<00:03:08.540> trap<00:03:08.840> however<00:03:09.500> i<00:03:09.710> would<00:03:09.890> highly

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
being spawn trap however i would highly

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.920 
being spawn trap however i would highly
recommend<00:03:10.190> using<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.060> particular<00:03:11.390> spot

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
recommend using this particular spot

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.900 
recommend using this particular spot
because<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.920> know<00:03:12.980> i'm<00:03:13.130> going<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.400> agree<00:03:13.640> i

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
because you know i'm going to agree i

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.670 
because you know i'm going to agree i
stand<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.630> spot<00:03:14.870> quite<00:03:15.170> often<00:03:15.350> and

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
stand on that spot quite often and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.810 
stand on that spot quite often and
overall<00:03:16.130> i<00:03:16.160> don't<00:03:16.340> think<00:03:16.490> i've<00:03:16.550> ever<00:03:16.610> been

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
overall i don't think i've ever been

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.670 
overall i don't think i've ever been
killed<00:03:17.120> by<00:03:17.240> rubble<00:03:17.630> but<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.350> always<00:03:18.500> an

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
killed by rubble but it's always an

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.770
