00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.209
 hello to all guys 66 and welcome 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.250
 this new blog I am there if it is yes 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:12.670
 this is a blog with light because it is 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.610
 a fantastic thing and gigi too 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.580
 recording this blog on the laptop 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.380
 because the only webcam came for the 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.760
 my landline so for now there is therefore 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.180
 in clear I hope it goes well more or 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.010
 less should be a 4 80 15 anyway 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.480
 now very often he said he did 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.119
 this blog that with this reference from 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.239
 about two weeks I know and it's one thing 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.960
 very bad I know this too and so 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.180
 then we talk about the points that afflict 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.270
 afflict chievo during these two 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.520
 weeks that have passed then have 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.000
 all where survival croft is then 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:54.090
 survival kart and for now disappeared in 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.239
 meaning that it has stopped since I have not had 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.829
 way of thinking about new structures 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.070
 this has led to a slowdown 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.899
 of the episodes and therefore to the fact that not 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.700
 I knew how to continue the series then 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.950
 I have sincerely preferred I am speaking for 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.619
 the moment until I have my own 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.990
 of free time to complete the 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.590
 so all for now nada 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.689
 in addition to this, however, the series 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.049
 survival folder series we say to say 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:32.409
 but rie text because I am not much 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:37.810
 good at vanilla in the sense that I know 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.970
 will play minecraft but the vanilla does not 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 I can do it no more than too much 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.390
 because they are not so good at creating 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.600
 minecraft buildings if I don't have a good one 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.909
 use of mode and therefore for that in 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.860
 some problems however one said 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.920
 I hope to be able to continue this 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.310
 this is possible and therefore you will also have 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.159
 this little one 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.880
 finally acknowledging the fact 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.310
 where it went from survival kraft ok 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.959
 second point lauri scart sta 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.520
 continuing to be updated every 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:17.200
 tech week i know however as mentioned above 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.830
 facebook was something however 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.640
 which it made that happened to 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.970
 weeks have been two weeks 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.330
 hell with the fact that I had a lot 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.269
 a lot of school checks so me 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.769
 you understand, I also have to study something 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.610
 more or less something 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:44.239
 ok what else is that getting more and more 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:47.319
 increasing the beauty of this way 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.290
 faq that one of the first 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.370
 that place online officially indeed 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.230
 as you know it is also its staff and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.359
 just want one thing as next 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.280
 bit that will actually be in 1.1.5 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.920
 will succeed next week you will say 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.870
 this video on Sunday 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.870
 try for next Sunday there will be 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.480
 there was the town kraft that after years 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.629
 has decided to leave the rights to the mod 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 parker so we can now insert it 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:23.319
 normally in our pack 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.859
 in short, then this is just what else 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.260
 I'm thinking of making a series a 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.620
 little technical but very very technical of the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.389
 spotlight sense of all fashions as well e 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.620
 imaginable of what he know 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.769
 because then those who do not know 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.139
 effects is not that I can do them and they are not 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.980
 take it if you do it this month 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:48.250
 or send it back for the end of month 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.169
 March beginning of April so let me know 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.189
 what do you think of this thing 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:57.280
 in any case this is the last latest update 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.590
 video everywhere will not say so much wanted 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.299
 advise you that I am like you is a little 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.810
 Too still a little ill, however 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:09.189
 I am however resumed 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.819
 I will try to do more vlog within 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.889
 this month 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:19.720
 I think I 'll do one every week and 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:21.759
 besides this, what else will continue 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.380
 always the two main series that they are 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.680
 survival kraft 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.590
 no they are ulisse kraft and adventure kart 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.240
 then 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.220
 those who will continue with two young people 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.710
 every day two then an episode of 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.120
 one that I belong to the other except when 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.920
 it can happen that I do need him 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.630
 a series then the next day as it is 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.760
 happened yesterday 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.450
 I make the same episodes of the 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.430
 so this series if you have questions for 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.960
 the next blog and I advise you to do 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.980
 well because i am not sure what to say 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.570
 centrally 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.120
 I know I am doing small news though 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.880
 generally also something 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.440
 important you could ask if you have 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.090
 questions the estimates are put below 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.930
