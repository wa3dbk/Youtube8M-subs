the back of the fridge I reconfigure
this<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:12.990> many<00:01:13.049> different<00:01:13.409> ways<00:01:13.760> makes<00:01:14.760> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this in so many different ways makes it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.350 
this in so many different ways makes it
really<00:01:15.090> convenient<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.900> flexible<00:01:17.360> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
really convenient and flexible the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.260 
really convenient and flexible the
icemaker<00:01:19.100> actually<00:01:20.100> makes<00:01:20.340> crushed<00:01:20.759> ice<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
icemaker actually makes crushed ice and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
icemaker actually makes crushed ice and
my<00:01:21.390> daughter<00:01:21.600> likes<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> make<00:01:22.170> smoothies<00:01:22.590> we

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
my daughter likes to make smoothies we

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.580 
my daughter likes to make smoothies we
found<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.549> using<00:01:23.820> crushed<00:01:24.240> ice<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.380> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
found that using crushed ice to put in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.130 
found that using crushed ice to put in
the<00:01:25.710> blender<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.220> create<00:01:26.520> smoothies<00:01:27.119> makes<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the blender to create smoothies makes it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.190 
the blender to create smoothies makes it
so<00:01:28.350> much<00:01:28.590> easier<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:30.150> freezer<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> cool<00:01:30.960> too

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
so much easier the freezer is cool too

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.060 
so much easier the freezer is cool too
because<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:32.189> top<00:01:32.549> shelf<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.780> long<00:01:34.350> shelf

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
because the top shelf is one long shelf

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.640 
because the top shelf is one long shelf
yet<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.880> fit<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> lot<00:01:36.720> even<00:01:36.960> height-wise

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
yet you can fit a lot even height-wise

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.090 
yet you can fit a lot even height-wise
in<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> bottom<00:01:39.090> shelf<00:01:39.390> actually

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
in it then the bottom shelf actually

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.639 
in it then the bottom shelf actually
adjusts<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> divider<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.500> want<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
adjusts with the divider you want the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
adjusts with the divider you want the
fridge<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.189> look<00:01:44.369> good<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:45.000> people<00:01:45.030> come

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
over I like the new finish on it because

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.889 
over I like the new finish on it because
it<00:01:48.689> doesn't<00:01:49.049> show<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.350> fingerprints
