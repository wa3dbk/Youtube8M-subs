00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello, welcome to another class of 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.439
 mathematics 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.039
 good this module so we'll give 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.079
 power are with rational numbers nÃ© 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.349
 Just before I talk a little bit about 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.910
 the power is one enter then let's go 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.390
 to make a review upon the sets 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.540
 of the set of rational numbers that 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.270
 would be rational numbers all over the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.390
 number that can be entered in the form 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.519
 fractional with denominator and numerator 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.429
 integer and non-zero denominator 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.280
 So what do we go there? 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.429
 a classic example here of some 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.499
 numbers that are rational 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.749
 please note that our set 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:58.479
 rational and always denominated symbolized 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.569
 with the letter here ok and reminding you 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.500
 you have seen this in another chapter of ours 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:07.690
 then for example - 14 out of 31 -14 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.600
 thirds less 3.2 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:16.600
 - 2 - 0.44 444 remembering that this is 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.340
 periodic tithing that it is also 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.700
 0 0.002 rational is that evil exact one 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.870
 2.8 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.930
 twenty-five sixths 10 etc 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.300
 remembering that only in the case of tithe 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.480
 only the same periodic ones 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.180
 they can be rational tithe 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.640
 periodic is all that decimal number 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.430
 that we can turn inflation is 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.510
 This is what we have seen in other 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.050
 videos we then come on powers 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.330
 natural point , this is where we are is a 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.030
 new focus then factor products 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.090
 fractions and how negative they are 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.030
 They may be registered in this way 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.420
 in case we have the repetition of at least two 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.500
 fifths three times then we have three 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.080
 factors 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 here our base will be less two 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.670
 and the exponent will be 3 which was the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.410
 number of times the base was repeated 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.629
 in this other example here we have a 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.360
 product of equal inflationary factors 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.239
 only they are positive right? 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.670
 look 37 years here he is se 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.370
 repeating four times then we have 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.000
 four factors the picture here will be the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.069
 exponent and 37 years will be the basis and 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.590
 remembering that always exponent goes 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.310
 indicate how many times the base goes 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.310
 repeat in this other example we 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.840
 we put this more negative equals 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.030
 look there minus 0.4 multiply twice 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.660
 so we have two factors here 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.829
 then we have less than 0.4 base and the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.829
 two will be our exponent 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:09.060
 in this other example here we can have 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:11.610
 this more equals only positive 1,2 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.590
 he is repeating himself three times we 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.299
 we have three factors here 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.459
 So you can see that it's going 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.650
 the base is 1.2 and the exponent is 3 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.389
 good it is used for 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.370
 represent the multiplication of factors 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.010
 Equal inflation is like us 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.489
 we started with an example here plus some 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.400
 examples in the case of positive 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.840
 here you see that the middle it is se 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.489
 repeating three times then we have 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.620
 half taken 3 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.989
 If you do this calculation, you have to 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.030
 remember that the sport he's taking 3 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.760
 both the numerator and the top 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.280
 as denominator that the lower part 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.349
 so just think of a times a times a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.799
 which is 12 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:00.209
 so you think of 2 leading to cool is 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:02.880
 22 times 2 times 2008 in the next example 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.609
 here we have a negative employee 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.669
 He is repeating it four times, right? 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.160
 we'll put 24 links and the base - 34 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:15.450
 remembering also here we have to 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.880
 think that the 4 is taking neither the 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.019
 numerator with the denominator 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.180
 another thing we have to 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.610
 Remember the rule we have here is a 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.620
 negative number elevated to exponent pa 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.280
 then we will have as a result a 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.640
 positive number 3 taken to 4th 81 and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.570
 four levadas 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.820
 256 bit other here we go too 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.650
 emphasize factors of this more equal 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.610
 seek a little more 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.160
 knowledge 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.530
 we have here the 0.5 repeating a 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.490
 explanation three times then we have 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:55.740
 0.5 taken 3 or to the cube do this 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.960
 multiplication we will have 0.125 here we 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.000
 we have one of these bad, but only 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.030
 negative he is repeating himself two 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.820
 times then representing we have 2.1 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.790
 high 2 doing this calculation that we 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.440
 we will have 4.41 important emphasizing 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.520
 enough this rule-of-law story 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.290
 signals 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.000
 when we have an explanation of the 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.260
 same signs - * - we will always have 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.930
 positive 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.350
 the positive number x positive we will have 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.270
 a positive result then 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.060
 multiplication of the same signals always 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.920
 result you will get positive 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.200
 now when you have multiplication 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.340
 of different signs of numbers with 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.130
 different signs 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.880
 the result will always be negative this 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.880
 it's very important 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.980
 another thing also important to emphasize 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.410
 is that when it is high negative and if 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.060
 can stop your result will always be 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.830
 positive 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.570
 pa could be 2468 is so on 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.980
 now when the negative number is taken 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:08.370
 this comb inpa 135 and so on the 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.600
 your result will always be negative 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.870
 I'm going to do the interpretation of 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.820
 some fractional powers here by 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.720
 example we have a third 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.940
 square 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.880
 so here you will think about a third 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.400
 or explain twice remembering again 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.800
 Are you going to explain here in numerator? 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.160
 numerator 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.530
 we have a ninth here we have less 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.360
 three media high to the cube then we 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.420
 Let's repeat your explanation three times. 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.780
 decide this fraction and we will have 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.440
 result looks there number negative ne 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.350
 hi odd exponent of a negative number 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:52.000
 three times three times 3 27 2 times 2 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.740
 times 28 - twenty-seven eighths 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.900
 in this other one here you have a number 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:00.610
 positive number is elevated to a pair nec 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.170
 here we do not have to worry 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.960
 because when he is positive it is always 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.180
 will be positive here then understanding 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.620
 would be the following 1 times a times once 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:14.500
 1 4 time we'll have one now 10 Dec 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:19.450
 times ten times ten times 10 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.920
 we have with the result 10,000 we go 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.930
 interpret to see now a little bit 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.770
 of the powers that be 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.110
 here we have 3.5 squared 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:33.370
 so he will repeat it twice 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:36.790
 we have 12.25 result in this 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.350
 other here we have in high negative 

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.940
 to the odd exponent 

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.160
 so sure in the end we will have 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.360
 a negative result 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.260
 here you will explain 0.07 three times 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.180
 huh 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.910
 if I repeat three times then we 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.199
 we will result in the month of this evil 

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:57.060
 negative 

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:59.430
 reminding you that you can 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.130
