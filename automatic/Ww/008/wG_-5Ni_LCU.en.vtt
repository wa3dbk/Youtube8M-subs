00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.400
 the time within the weekend of the 21st and 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.840
 July 22 was nothing exciting 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.280
 too much to go for a swim and yet 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.720
 many curious people found themselves 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.700
 around the intercommunal water 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 courtavon to attend an exhibition 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.900
 naval model 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.120
 so it's the firemen the friendly of 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.800
 firefighters from the idof and with a 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.140
 partnership so I'm mobilized a 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 Swiss frame and with them we mounted 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.640
 this model making operation of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.150
 initiation to show people what 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.890
 that we can do 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.170
 so this year we managed to have a 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.950
 forty quarantine boats 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.540
 boats last year and wins and we have to 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.040
 less than September our big 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.780
 manifestation with paws alain pharmacy 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.660
 where there are about 450 boats 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.410
 they come from austria switzerland 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.260
 luxembourg 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.770
 holland germany everywhere and we 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.670
 gets to do in the big pool 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.180
 among the boat owners 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.310
 miniature 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.049
 difficult to miss out on one of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.030
 more passionate of them come 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.520
 especially low countries with its more 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.110
 beautiful craft in suitcases like 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.720
 for example this boat reproduced at 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.320
 the identical to the bolt near thanks to 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.320
 very precise plans 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:45.700
 so john rae this for pompom cons 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:49.690
 I put work chickly contracted 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.500
 the star alcohol for these devotees who do not 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.750
 do not count their hours of work 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.370
 spent in a vault in the garage there 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 there are different techniques for 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.750
 achieve such a result 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.140
 kits small wood we buy 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.790
 git 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.250
 we build them then after it's in 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.170
 function it starts at 250 euros here goes 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.450
 thousand two thousand euros depending on what 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.709
 we want to do and after or 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.479
 second solution is buy a 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.090
 plan or as the pass is there in 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.590
 holland he bought plans to oslo and 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 art builds the boat so the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.880
 sailboat identical to scale 1 15th 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.280
 so there are the plans he made four 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.510
 hundred 400 pictures and he reproduced the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.520
 boat completely so it's a 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.900
 boat that does not exist in the trade 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.570
 so it's wood of tears she 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.860
 stuck to failure so that's a 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.190
 boat that has three four years of work 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.570
 above before the metal powers the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.980
 visitors who went for a walk 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.950
 to the water have had the opportunity to 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.239
 discover a very curious rowboat 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.670
 because in modelism there are no limits 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.330
 and do-it-yourselfers have plenty of time to 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.330
 let their imagination speak 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.260
 there is first the fire engine for 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.700
 to overcome fires on 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.739
 different types of watercraft 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.720
 oil platforms or more 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.720
 spectacular yet the speed boat 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.739
 and this speed the least bit 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.510
 vagueness can be fatal on 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.510
 look dad but could not go back 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.239
 But do not panic 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.239
 a good shot of gas and back there afloat 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.700
 in another register there as a boat 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.290
 who lets himself be carried by the breeze more 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.290
 discreet but equally remarkable 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.270
 otherwise there are also these reproductions of 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.880
 monsters of the seas that remains 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.900
 impressive but my model reduced 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.950
 to achieve such a result the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.270
 hours of work are counted by 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.270
 hundreds or even thousands 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.130
 it's up to our customers three elements the 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.359
 attached to each other until the end 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.359
 it makes a boat that thinks itself 

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:44.989
 q 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.450
 no 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.040
 follow not 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.560
 Yes 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.730
 the 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.120
 Yes 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.120
 I do not know 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.950
 m 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.240
