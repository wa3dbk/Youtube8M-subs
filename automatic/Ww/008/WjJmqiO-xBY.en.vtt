00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
time they used for the game and as you

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.770 
time they used for the game and as you
scroll<00:04:06.340> back<00:04:06.609> up<00:04:06.640> there's<00:04:07.359> a<00:04:07.450> lot<00:04:07.660> of

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
scroll back up there's a lot of

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.670 
citations where it's where the notes
came<00:04:09.579> from<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.660> just<00:04:10.840> depends<00:04:11.230> on<00:04:11.530> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
came from so it just depends on the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.170 
came from so it just depends on the
contents<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.430> game<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:12.850> what<00:04:13.060> it's

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
contents of the game but what it's

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.789 
contents of the game but what it's
looking<00:04:13.450> for<00:04:13.480> is<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> whole<00:04:14.019> lot<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.410> text

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799

here's<00:04:15.220> where<00:04:15.489> some<00:04:16.229> symbolic<00:04:17.229> notation<00:04:17.380> was

here's where some symbolic notation was
put<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.220> in<00:04:18.430> text<00:04:18.789> form<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.900> that's<00:04:20.320> what<00:04:20.530> it

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
put in in text form so that's what it

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.779 
put in in text form so that's what it
does<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:20.979> goes<00:04:21.070> through<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.370> game<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.700> it

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
that's basically what you can do with

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.420 
that's basically what you can do with
the<00:05:56.110> annotation<00:05:56.710> tab<00:05:56.890> there's<00:05:57.160> some<00:05:57.280> other

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
the annotation tab there's some other

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.040 
the annotation tab there's some other
tweaks<00:05:57.730> and<00:05:57.970> toggles<00:05:58.390> to<00:05:58.420> it<00:05:58.600> you<00:05:58.720> can<00:05:58.870> take<00:05:59.020> a

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
tweaks and toggles to it you can take a

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.840 
tweaks and toggles to it you can take a
look<00:05:59.200> in<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.410> help<00:05:59.530> files<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.100> find<00:06:00.340> all<00:06:00.670> the

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
look in the help files and find all the

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.210 
look in the help files and find all the
specifics<00:06:01.420> but<00:06:01.930> it's<00:06:02.110> very<00:06:02.230> very<00:06:02.710> simple<00:06:03.070> you

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
specifics but it's very very simple you

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.980 
specifics but it's very very simple you
just<00:06:03.340> look<00:06:03.580> for<00:06:03.790> different<00:06:04.060> annotation<00:06:04.660> forms

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
just look for different annotation forms

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.280 
just look for different annotation forms
as<00:06:05.110> well<00:06:05.560> as<00:06:05.740> text<00:06:06.100> within<00:06:06.640> the<00:06:07.140> notation<00:06:08.140> of

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
as well as text within the notation of

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.530 
as well as text within the notation of
the<00:06:08.560> database<00:06:08.980> good<00:06:09.430> way<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.670> find<00:06:09.940> games<00:06:10.240> and

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
the database good way to find games and

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.840 
the database good way to find games and
again<00:06:11.320> a<00:06:11.350> neat<00:06:11.590> little<00:06:11.740> trick<00:06:12.040> I'll<00:06:12.610> show<00:06:12.790> you

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
again a neat little trick I'll show you

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.880 
again a neat little trick I'll show you
once<00:06:13.120> again<00:06:13.210> is<00:06:13.630> just<00:06:13.660> hit<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.140> spacebar<00:06:14.410> in

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
once again is just hit the spacebar in

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.610 
once again is just hit the spacebar in
one<00:06:15.400> of<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.550> text<00:06:15.850> boxes<00:06:16.270> click<00:06:16.720> OK<00:06:17.140> and<00:06:17.380> it'll

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
one of the text boxes click OK and it'll

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.170 
one of the text boxes click OK and it'll
just<00:06:17.740> pull<00:06:17.950> up<00:06:17.980> games<00:06:18.340> in<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.610> database<00:06:19.000> and

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
just pull up games in the database and

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.180 
just pull up games in the database and
have<00:06:19.270> a<00:06:19.330> lot<00:06:19.600> of<00:06:19.780> text<00:06:20.170> in<00:06:20.320> them<00:06:20.620> so<00:06:21.100> that's

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
have a lot of text in them so that's

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.060 
have a lot of text in them so that's
basically<00:06:21.610> how<00:06:21.730> you<00:06:21.880> use<00:06:22.300> this<00:06:22.680> very<00:06:23.680> simple

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
basically how you use this very simple

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.650 
basically how you use this very simple
just<00:06:24.250> a<00:06:24.340> way<00:06:24.430> to<00:06:24.490> search<00:06:24.700> for<00:06:24.730> annotations

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
just a way to search for annotations

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.120 
just a way to search for annotations
within<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.140> games<00:06:26.320> in<00:06:26.590> your<00:06:26.740> chest<00:06:26.920> base

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
database does not contain annotations so

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.210 
database does not contain annotations so
generally<00:06:32.350> you're<00:06:32.470> not<00:06:32.590> going<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.800> find<00:06:32.980> much

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
generally you're not going to find much
