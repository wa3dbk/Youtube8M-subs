00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the skelly would do the same thing just

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
the skelly would do the same thing just
to<00:02:25.260> show<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.769> how<00:02:26.069> we<00:02:26.130> gonna<00:02:26.370> test<00:02:26.640> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
to show you how we gonna test the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.940 
to show you how we gonna test the
scalese<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.300> course<00:02:27.569> they're<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.900> gonna<00:02:28.140> come

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
scalese of course they're not gonna come

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.000 
scalese of course they're not gonna come
charging<00:02:29.580> 20<00:02:29.760> Watts<00:02:30.630> us<00:02:30.870> infinitely<00:02:31.680> they're

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
charging 20 Watts us infinitely they're

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.120 
charging 20 Watts us infinitely they're
gonna<00:02:32.160> stand<00:02:33.090> still<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.739> go<00:02:34.980> around

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
gonna stand still but if we go around

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.770 
gonna stand still but if we go around
the<00:02:35.459> corner<00:02:35.850> they<00:02:35.970> would<00:02:36.180> want<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.480> try<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the corner they would want to try to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.470 
the corner they would want to try to
track<00:02:37.170> us<00:02:37.440> down<00:02:37.470> hunt<00:02:38.459> us<00:02:38.730> down<00:02:38.760> around<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
track us down hunt us down around the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.090 
track us down hunt us down around the
corner<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:39.900> what's<00:02:40.170> them<00:02:40.380> up<00:02:40.530> hey<00:02:41.069> I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
corner that's what's them up hey I

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.039 
corner that's what's them up hey I
escaped<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> bluff<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.630> there<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.019> a

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
escaped the bluff but as there is a

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.210 
escaped the bluff but as there is a
whole<00:02:43.730> start<00:02:44.730> doing<00:02:44.970> anything<00:02:45.209> stand<00:02:45.780> still

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
whole start doing anything stand still

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.650 
whole start doing anything stand still
so<00:02:49.250> they're<00:02:50.250> smart<00:02:50.640> enough<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.299> commit

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
so they're smart enough to not commit

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.600 
so they're smart enough to not commit
suicide<00:02:52.200> let's<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:52.860> if<00:02:52.950> we<00:02:53.099> can<00:02:53.280> trick<00:02:53.519> them

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
suicide let's see if we can trick them

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.610 
suicide let's see if we can trick them
first<00:02:56.610> test<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.090> want<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.330> do<00:02:57.480> science<00:02:58.319> let's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
first test I want to do science let's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.140 
first test I want to do science let's
see<00:02:58.860> if<00:02:59.040> science<00:02:59.489> work<00:03:00.060> again<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:01.110> was<00:03:01.349> nerfed

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
see if science work again it was nerfed

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.849 
see if science work again it was nerfed
the<00:03:03.150> mops<00:03:03.359> don't<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:03.930> science<00:03:04.290> as<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> full

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
the mops don't see science as a full

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.970 
the mops don't see science as a full
block<00:03:05.130> anymore<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.760> thus<00:03:05.940> cannot<00:03:06.359> be<00:03:06.540> tricked

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980

just really helpful next test wanted to

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.830 
just really helpful next test wanted to
test<00:04:07.750> tripwire<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:09.280> let's<00:04:09.580> throw<00:04:09.850> some<00:04:10.120> trip

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
test tripwire so let's throw some trip

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.200 
test tripwire so let's throw some trip
wire<00:04:11.080> in<00:04:11.290> there<00:04:11.550> see<00:04:12.550> it's<00:04:12.670> in<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.880> middle<00:04:13.120> of

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
wire in there see it's in the middle of

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.420 
wire in there see it's in the middle of
the<00:04:13.270> Emerald<00:04:13.810> block<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.590> they<00:04:14.800> would<00:04:15.400> see

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
the Emerald block so if they would see

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.520 
the Emerald block so if they would see
it<00:04:15.730> as<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.850> block<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.210> step<00:04:16.660> on<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.830> would<00:04:17.980> do<00:04:18.250> it

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
it as a block to step on it would do it

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.300 
it as a block to step on it would do it
tripwire<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.800> zombie<00:04:21.340> come<00:04:22.090> on<00:04:22.270> man<00:04:23.310> there's

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
tripwire and zombie come on man there's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
tripwire and zombie come on man there's
nothing<00:04:27.450> all<00:04:28.450> right<00:04:28.860> trip<00:04:29.860> wires<00:04:30.130> don't<00:04:31.000> do

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
nothing all right trip wires don't do

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.410 
nothing all right trip wires don't do
the<00:04:31.450> trick<00:04:32.400> stopped<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.640> his<00:04:33.730> tracks<00:04:33.790> let's

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
the trick stopped in his tracks let's

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.460 
the trick stopped in his tracks let's
get<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.630> creeper

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.600 

yeah<00:04:41.570> tripwire<00:04:42.570> doesn't<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.080> anything<00:04:43.680> with

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
yeah tripwire doesn't do anything with

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.980 
yeah tripwire doesn't do anything with
another<00:04:44.940> one<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:45.240> top<00:04:47.030> doesn't<00:04:48.030> help<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.870> we

another one on top doesn't help so we

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.340 
another one on top doesn't help so we
don't<00:04:49.200> have<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.530> test<00:04:50.840> don't<00:04:51.840> have<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.080> test

don't have to test don't have to test

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.920 
don't have to test don't have to test
the<00:04:52.620> scalese<00:04:53.160> they<00:04:53.490> will<00:04:53.700> not<00:04:53.880> be<00:04:54.630> able<00:04:54.720> to

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
the scalese they will not be able to
