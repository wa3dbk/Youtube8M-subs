00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.340
 steffi cullen what is that anyway 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.500
 Steffi fishing until a method with the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.879
 one or fish exactly on one 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.410
 certain job offer 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.170
 this requires very long routes 7 89 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.340
 There are even officers for one meter 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.309
 Model of the seven meter class 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.780
 decided and want the same with the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.420
 cooler for pinpoint on one 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.530
 offer specific job 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.840
 There are not really any to assemble 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.120
 We have a lot to say here 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.829
 normally a break here with a time 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.399
 50 grams of load is therefore a stop 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.990
 with a rubber pearl as before a tray with two 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.030
 drilling freewheel role where many string 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.369
 Here we are once there 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.440
 possibility then with open roll 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.030
 we can fish the bow string 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 here and there a rubber band pinch or how 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.470
 as well as here I did that with 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.100
 simple toothpick or such a game 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.250
 stuck with tesa film that is enough 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.250
 completely 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.590
 specially commented on hectic this 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.840
 now for slightly larger red eyes 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.220
 decided only 12 15 cm 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.569
 Of course it is bigger but have 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.450
 I do not have to get that one 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.569
 take what is there to the other but how 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.970
 said here stole two triplets 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.849
 turn and then here is one 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 So-called pageflex is normal to 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:55.560
 extra to attract and should also the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.840
 keep parking in the fish 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.710
 i can do the first drilling here 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.540
 in the head 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.789
 with the second behind in the tail 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.789
 muscles and then so finished 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.330
 Of course it is also important that you have the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.800
 place explored exactly 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.700
 I actually do it every time 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.830
 new exactly what and then offers the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.780
 cooler than a hand's breadth or 20-30 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.920
 centimeters over then founders 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.130
 However again the chance that one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.410
 rather my father's war than world after that 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:38.920
 just fathom the bait fish 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.920
 then hangs up and then lay 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.250
 important in such long routes of 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.320
 seven eight or even nine meters the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.340
 of course hard and are natural 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.750
 scary windy are important 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.020
 Stable good stop there with us 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.630
 normal made with a meter 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.580
 but you can only do two-tone state 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.680
 Use if you are right on the water 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.410
 Bank has where to shoot the pure 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:17.060
 can 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:19.310
 Enough of the 14 then you can get the dogs 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.130
 tuck in 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.630
 hello variant would be behind again 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.330
 where the other routes can go 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.090
 we'll show you right now 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.160
 wants to go further or easier in one 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.580
 You must be able to use something like that 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.620
 you have the normal routes of age and 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.190
 right, of course, forget the freewheeling 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.830
 pure or just the study under stuck 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.830
 and bid on 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.450
 against the other model good stop 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.400
 you can walk pretty stable 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.040
 Press in the ground is soft enough 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.320
 otherwise you have to have a look 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.420
 use a bit rough tool or 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.590
 stones to fold in properly 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.780
 you can adjust here in the height and 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.700
 imagine now had as here but then 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.590
 the edge wants to reach the edge 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.350
 so from here not the route 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.300
 That would certainly achieve one more 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.530
 waders where you can have two more 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.160
 can win three meter by 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.160
 go into 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:42.889
 Having a tea and drinking 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.990
 Do what you did when you thought 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.280
 ezb is the much asked question 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.340
 How long should I wait until the first go? 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.170
 I always do that depending on the situation 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.840
 what kind of feeling do I have 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.980
 I had the fish in stock 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.389
 are up to date 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.670
 probably not so careful 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.020
 I can strike immediately 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.330
 could highway what i would for an assembly 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.350
 for shop with single or with two 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.380
 drilling i say 10 10 15 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.270
 Seconds should usually be enough 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.340
 So in my opinion, this is the piece 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.590
 Good fishing is an effective thing 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.640
 So you really can if you have the 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.620
 places knows where to fish 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.660
 At some point they lose patience and 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.580
 then you save the cooler and the 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.610
 there for several hours back and forth 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.360
 dangles I once such a 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.940
 Sternstunden day with my friend 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:42.100
 christian experienced there we had four 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:44.800
 had fish caught by 85 cm know 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.030
 we meters 12 meters 24 and last but not least 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.830
 still at 27 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.420
 Of course you do not live for every day 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.370
 but you can not just do that with the 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.540
 ruth gets caught but also with 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.310
 the mare 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.940
 then it is for Klaus once 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.160
 waiting 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.560
 the december day with milder 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.810
 southwest current, however, promises good 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.650
 van outlook so that it is up to the first 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.990
 It should not take too long 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.260
 then it's time for the first pose 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.180
 dived klaus takes the route on the 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.720
 Hecht should pull cord without hindrance 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.480
 can 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.770
 The roll bar is opened after all 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.770
 apparently gives a problem 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:32.180
 she was able to deduct us for a show 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.180
 are probably up somehow 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.030
 but a lot of time to annoy remains claus 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.100
 not a short time later, it already starts 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.080
 again a pike at the just now 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.080
 attacked bait to create fish 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:13.300
 no, that was not the way to war 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.720
 a bowl right out today 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.400
 but what's the name of it all? 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:26.990
 Good things are three and Klaus gets 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.990
 actually another chance 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.380
 who provide a supply 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.170
 quite right 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.600
 stay back still worked better 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:00.210
 thicker behind , the cooler 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:04.880
 fish taken 70 centimeters probably 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.880
 have caught a lot of fish
