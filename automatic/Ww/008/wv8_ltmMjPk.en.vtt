00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello my name is andrew bought in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.410
 this video i want to show you how you can 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.480
 at home make qualities 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.300
 column for your goods online 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.059
 store the very beginning of the video I want to note 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.100
 one very nice soda is she 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.439
 in that for such a photo you can 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.050
 use ordinary 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.740
 also we will need our white goods 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.539
 just a minimum of the game table lamps 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.939
 so let's try to create some 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.239
 selling photos for this first 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.309
 we need to prepare work areas 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.070
 grind white just and bridge center 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.410
 the table put our goods welland and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 need to be placed in such a way that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 the shadow of the subject was as low as possible 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.360
 less noticeable whichever 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 how far will we shoot down a given 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.969
 the light we see changes by itself 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.309
 shadow our purpose is to make 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 the subject was consecrated on all sides 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.579
 evenly very important nuance in order 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.470
 to make the photos bright 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.799
 table lamp bulbs should be 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.810
 as powerful as possible i used 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.030
 energy saving over 32 water it 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.820
 equivalent to 162 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.619
 incandescent lamp can now be 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.960
 start the photofilming 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.810
 most cases will be quite 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.720
 enough automatic shooting mode 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 if the object is small you can turn on 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 macro mode 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.500
 he's on any in that marriage is denoted by dina 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.380
 by the form of a flower, nothing else to change 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.950
 you don't just need to aim objectively 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.509
 press the button to take a picture of goods 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 angle you need to choose about 100 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.490
 a clone of 45 degrees to the table if we 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.310
 forcing a very small object 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.180
 example earrings best to do 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.520
 photos upright not 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.990
 if the photo turns yellow you need 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.300
 change white balance 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.210
 do it automatically 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.820
 shooting is impossible for that you need 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.360
 switch to program mode assigned 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.920

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.720
 auto white balance 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.240

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.820
 the lighting will be on the icon accordingly 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.920
 Here is such a feast photos taken in 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.800
 This mode will correctly transmit 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.140
 colors if we take photos more 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.750

 several photos from different angles 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.700
 also very important near the very number 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.150
 put another phone to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.680
