00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.410
 It is 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.480
 ToDay 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.110
 Though it is story of swing of serve 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.830
 We will described with reference to FIG say the swing using the pronation 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.190
 Well , I think you all know you know that pronation 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.900
 is not it 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.680
 Pronation cay 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.680
 It is such a movement 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 A little like twisting here 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 I'm talking about such movements 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.340
 I think I will remember 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.190
 Serve 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.789
 ou It's not a swing 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.789
 Not big 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.760
 Come in 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.570
 Because I will explain that in response to this movement 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.829
 so 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.829
 It is hard 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.420
 I'm not thinking about twisting 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.620
 I can not but twist 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.070
 Form 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:11.780
 It is if you are set with nature in the form 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.159
 It will be like this in nature with only the feeling of a literary capital tower 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 In it and says that what it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.990
 First of all 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.830
 I will strike it over there 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:30.740
 I'll Hold the looks sideways for the next body is 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.750
 When the racket bar set toss up and the same person ray 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 This hand 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.810
 It is the palm of the person who holds the racket 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.810
 I will direct the light in the direction to strike 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.530
 Against the other side 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 Certified who hit firmly rather than from being toward the day of there is beyond body 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.250
 I will aim for the palm 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.690
 From that state 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.690
 Keep that state 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.180
 Rip and keep 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.900
 It is a vector with the commander tower 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.920
 I'm going to root 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.650
 that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.650
 It is this side that is well in the posture that there is often 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:18.190
 Utsuho reported but are you facing the palm of the hand 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:23.210
 Put away What time is it once 交戻 Tteyuu'll hit a pinch Well 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.270
 Such people are quite welcome, but don't put back the shape of this wrist 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.470
 While aiming for protection 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.470
 Received it was something the shape of the wrist to keep to keep this 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.069
 I think let's sell Te Zu' and it keep 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.840
 It will remain or stand 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:47.730
 I think it's ok I probably haven't seen it until now 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.880
 It is a feeling to keep the person who is directed to Wood here and keep it until this point 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.440
 Ne 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.210
 Is it keep until just before the strike 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.620
 After that 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.620
 This referred to as natural If we hit well abandon it is if we shook big time 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.830
 Because it will be used how to go to Australia 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.989
 It is without Iunja I try to pronation use 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.950
 How very important that I mean to make firm the shape that compelled to pronation 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.950
 It has become a 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.910
 Even if it is sweet or not 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.560
 Not towards the palm of the hand firmly good here for the one-way 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.590
 Listen to it at 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.780
 Eggapurafu think wonder if I there the of being a little consciousness 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.590
 It is Taguchi knitting. 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.590
 Also the front end 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.780
 If you give the tip a bit 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.680
 Communicating a reaction 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.799
 I will be in shape 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.599
 Please try using the combined technique 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.599
 Yes or more
