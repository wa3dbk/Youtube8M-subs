00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
won by 10 points so we're beginning to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.060 
won by 10 points so we're beginning to
see<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> difference<00:00:28.230> unlike<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> Olympic

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
see a difference unlike the Olympic

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.500 
see a difference unlike the Olympic
Games<00:00:29.310> where<00:00:29.519> once<00:00:29.730> again<00:00:29.970> she<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> only

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
Games where once again she was the only

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.880 
Games where once again she was the only
horse<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.990> was<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.289> relaxed<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
horse that was really relaxed and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.740 
horse that was really relaxed and
fulfilling<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> requirements<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> test

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
fulfilling the requirements of the test

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
fulfilling the requirements of the test
but<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> scores<00:00:34.800> were<00:00:34.950> only<00:00:35.219> quarter<00:00:35.579> point

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
but the scores were only quarter point

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.940 
but the scores were only quarter point
support<00:00:36.149> part<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.960> time<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.350> least<00:00:37.380> we

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
support part so this time at least we

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.100 
support part so this time at least we
were<00:00:38.070> able<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> real<00:00:39.540> difference<00:00:39.989> in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
I thought it was going to be getting

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.950 
I thought it was going to be getting
better<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:09.090> charlotte<00:01:09.450> winning<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:09.869> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
better with charlotte winning but it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.240 
better with charlotte winning but it
actually<00:01:10.110> seemed<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> rest<00:01:11.130> of

actually seemed like all the rest of
them<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.460> getting<00:01:11.640> much<00:01:11.790> worse<00:01:12.000> we're<00:01:12.240> seeing

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
them are getting much worse we're seeing

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.969

and pulling the neck back in so it's so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
and pulling the neck back in so it's so
tight<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.490> shoulder<00:01:23.970> gets<00:01:24.450> pressed

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
tight that the shoulder gets pressed

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.749 
tight that the shoulder gets pressed
against<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> neck<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> horse<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
against the neck of the horse so it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
against the neck of the horse so it
flips<00:01:27.090> its<00:01:27.360> front<00:01:27.630> end<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.200> once<00:01:28.350> again

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
flips its front end out but once again

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.289 
flips its front end out but once again
if<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.670> anything<00:01:30.210> about

if you if you know anything about

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.240 
if you if you know anything about
dressage<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> hind<00:01:31.799> leg<00:01:31.979> must

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
dressage you know that the hind leg must

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
dressage you know that the hind leg must
always<00:01:32.490> come<00:01:32.939> through<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.299> same<00:01:33.479> degree<00:01:33.630> as

always come through the same degree as
the<00:01:33.960> front<00:01:34.200> end<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.430> we're

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the front end so this is what we're

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.649 
the front end so this is what we're
seeing<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:35.939> these<00:01:36.030> horses<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.570> this

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
seeing all these horses to have this

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.270 
seeing all these horses to have this
pretty<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.079> flip<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.890> their<00:01:38.009> front

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pretty little flip out in their front

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
pretty little flip out in their front
legs<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.850> people<00:01:39.090> think<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> something<00:01:39.720> but

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
legs that people think of something but

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.480 
legs that people think of something but
if<00:01:39.960> you'll<00:01:40.079> notice<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.100> there's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
if you'll notice when they do it there's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
if you'll notice when they do it there's
always<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.060> shaking<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> end<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
always a bit of shaking at the end of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
always a bit of shaking at the end of
the<00:01:43.079> leg<00:01:43.259> that's<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> horse<00:01:44.250> can't

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the leg that's because the horse can't

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
the leg that's because the horse can't
put<00:01:44.880> its<00:01:45.000> foot<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> ground<00:01:45.810> because<00:01:46.110> every

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
time the horse extends more in front

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
time the horse extends more in front
than<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> doesn't<00:01:48.420> back<00:01:48.600> you're<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:49.439> flexing

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
than it doesn't back you're over flexing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.859 
than it doesn't back you're over flexing
all<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> tendons<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.939> those<00:01:51.119> legs<00:01:51.390> which

all of the tendons in those legs which
is<00:01:51.990> why<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> course<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.680> these<00:01:52.829> horses<00:01:53.040> are

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
is why of course all these horses are

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.410 
is why of course all these horses are
