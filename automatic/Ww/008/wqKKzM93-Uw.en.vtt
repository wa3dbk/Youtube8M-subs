00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
just use them all year round and so now

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.340 
just use them all year round and so now
they've<00:02:40.330> got<00:02:40.360> me<00:02:40.510> thinking<00:02:40.840> about<00:02:40.870> some<00:02:41.200> all

out below a certain temperature because

out below a certain temperature because

the<00:02:59.900> tire<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.830> it's<00:03:00.980> one<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.190> questions<00:03:01.460> I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
the tire so it's one of the questions I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.890 
the tire so it's one of the questions I
actually<00:03:01.640> asked<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.090> how<00:03:02.210> did<00:03:02.330> they<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.570> it<00:03:02.600> I

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
actually asked is how did they do it I

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.840 
actually asked is how did they do it I
don't<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.650> switch<00:03:03.890> out<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.310> winter<00:03:04.520> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
don't like to switch out the winter and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.780 
don't like to switch out the winter and
the<00:03:04.970> winter<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.870> summer<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.500> all<00:03:06.830> of<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.010> it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
the winter and summer and all of that it

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.490 
the winter and summer and all of that it
makes<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.240> more<00:03:08.390> cumbersome<00:03:08.930> know<00:03:09.230> where<00:03:09.380> to

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
makes it more cumbersome know where to
