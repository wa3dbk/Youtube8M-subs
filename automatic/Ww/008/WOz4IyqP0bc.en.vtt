00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
and then the bottom would be a ribbon

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.110 
and then the bottom would be a ribbon
curl<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> then<00:02:18.460> you're<00:02:18.550> gonna<00:02:18.610> take<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:18.940> out

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
curl so then you're gonna take it out

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.060 
curl so then you're gonna take it out
you<00:02:19.330> can<00:02:19.420> spray<00:02:19.810> some<00:02:20.080> hairspray<00:02:20.380> or

you can spray some hairspray or
something<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.640> want<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.240> then<00:02:22.930> hold

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
something if you want on this then hold

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.070 
something if you want on this then hold
it<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.500> for<00:02:23.770> about<00:02:23.890> 30<00:02:24.160> seconds<00:02:24.670> until<00:02:25.080> it's

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
it in for about 30 seconds until it's

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.310 
it in for about 30 seconds until it's
halfway<00:02:26.440> set<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:28.180> pin<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.690> your<00:02:28.870> head

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
halfway set then pin it to your head

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.980 
halfway set then pin it to your head
so<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.740> completely<00:02:30.100> sets<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:31.270> after<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:31.780> done

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
so it completely sets so after it's done

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.520 
so it completely sets so after it's done
it's<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.940> hot<00:02:33.940> anymore<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:35.110> completely

it's not hot anymore and it's completely
cooled<00:02:35.890> you're<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.430> take<00:02:36.700> them<00:02:36.910> all

a<00:03:33.070> little<00:03:33.430> curl<00:03:33.700> at<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.060> front<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.420> my<00:03:34.480> face

and I'm going to do the same kind of

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.840 
and I'm going to do the same kind of
curl<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.730> did<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.690> extensions

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
curl I did in the extensions

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.640 
curl I did in the extensions

forward so then I'm gonna smush it
between<00:03:51.450> my<00:03:51.660> hands<00:03:51.900> again<00:03:52.230> until<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.340> gets

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.870 
pin to my head I'm just gonna let them
go<00:03:58.050> because<00:03:58.590> my<00:03:58.620> hair<00:03:59.010> holds<00:03:59.370> curl<00:03:59.640> pretty

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880

well and then I'm just gonna kind of
blend<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.739> with<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.920> extension<00:04:02.580> below<00:04:03.860> and

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
blend it with the extension below and

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.960 
blend it with the extension below and
then<00:04:05.040> I'm<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.250> gonna<00:04:05.430> take<00:04:05.580> some<00:04:05.610> hairspray

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
hair and then I let it out and to be

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.870 
hair and then I let it out and to be
honest<00:04:49.919> I<00:04:50.010> didn't<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:50.370> how<00:04:50.520> there's<00:04:50.729> like<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
honest I didn't like how there's like a

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.190 
honest I didn't like how there's like a
little<00:04:51.150> crimp<00:04:51.450> right<00:04:51.600> there<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.810> should<00:04:51.960> have

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
little crimp right there I should have

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.409 
little crimp right there I should have
maybe<00:04:52.620> did<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.010> little<00:04:53.250> bit<00:04:53.460> lower<00:04:53.669> so<00:04:53.880> I

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
maybe did it a little bit lower so I

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.180 
maybe did it a little bit lower so I
decided<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:55.020> do<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.260> top<00:04:55.470> part<00:04:55.500> piece<00:04:56.160> a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
decided to do the top part piece a

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.900 
decided to do the top part piece a
little<00:04:56.490> bit<00:04:56.669> differently<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:58.169> did<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
little bit differently so I did the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.900 
little bit differently so I did the
front<00:04:59.910> piece<00:05:00.300> as<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.690> can<00:05:00.990> see<00:05:01.200> here<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.789> did<00:05:02.789> it

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
front piece as you can see here I did it

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.460 
front piece as you can see here I did it
the<00:05:03.030> same<00:05:03.210> kind<00:05:03.600> of<00:05:03.660> as<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.930> other<00:05:04.080> side<00:05:04.350> so

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
the same kind of as the other side so

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.230 
the same kind of as the other side so
I'm<00:05:04.560> curling<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.070> under<00:05:05.520> instead<00:05:05.850> of<00:05:05.940> away

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
I'm curling it under instead of away

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.230 
I'm curling it under instead of away

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
looks at the top how it's like rounded

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.679 
looks at the top how it's like rounded
at<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.620> top<00:06:11.740> but<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.759> bottom<00:06:13.120> of<00:06:13.240> it<00:06:13.389> didn't

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:13.689 
at the top but the bottom of it didn't

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.170 
at the top but the bottom of it didn't
really<00:06:13.840> blend<00:06:14.259> that<00:06:14.740> well<00:06:15.129> it<00:06:15.669> doesn't<00:06:16.000> blend

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
really blend that well it doesn't blend

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.779 
really blend that well it doesn't blend
with<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.509> rest<00:06:16.750> of<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.020> hair<00:06:17.279> so<00:06:18.279> since<00:06:18.639> it's

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
with the rest of the hair so since it's

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.790 
with the rest of the hair so since it's
sticking<00:06:19.060> out<00:06:19.300> I'm<00:06:19.539> just<00:06:19.960> taking<00:06:20.349> it<00:06:20.439> and<00:06:20.589> I'm

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
sticking out I'm just taking it and I'm

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.649 
sticking out I'm just taking it and I'm
going<00:06:21.039> to<00:06:21.189> curl<00:06:21.580> it<00:06:21.789> backwards<00:06:22.330> so<00:06:22.509> the

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
going to curl it backwards so the

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.929 
going to curl it backwards so the
opposite<00:06:23.080> of<00:06:23.229> what<00:06:23.439> it<00:06:23.650> was<00:06:23.830> curled<00:06:24.159> but<00:06:24.669> I

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
opposite of what it was curled but I

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.529 
opposite of what it was curled but I
like<00:06:25.330> how<00:06:25.539> the<00:06:25.599> top<00:06:25.900> of<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.229> went<00:06:27.150> high<00:06:28.150> and

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
like how the top of it went high and

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.890 
like how the top of it went high and
then<00:06:28.719> the<00:06:28.839> Bott<00:06:29.050> bottom<00:06:29.319> will<00:06:29.889> now<00:06:30.039> be

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
then the Bott bottom will now be

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.240 
then the Bott bottom will now be
matching<00:06:31.900> with<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.229> rest<00:06:32.409> of<00:06:32.560> the<00:06:32.650> hair<00:06:32.860> so

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
matching with the rest of the hair so

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.070 
matching with the rest of the hair so
we're<00:06:33.339> just<00:06:33.370> gonna<00:06:33.580> finger<00:06:33.969> through<00:06:34.270> it<00:06:34.300> kind

we're just gonna finger through it kind
of<00:06:35.139> blend<00:06:35.409> it<00:06:35.529> all<00:06:35.620> together<00:06:35.879> I'm<00:06:36.879> gonna<00:06:37.029> just
