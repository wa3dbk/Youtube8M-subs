00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.369 
hundred aircraft a year so depending on
market<00:02:09.310> demand<00:02:09.429> will<00:02:10.360> respond<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.110> know<00:02:11.170> in

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
market demand will respond you know in

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:12.690 
market demand will respond you know in
our<00:02:11.500> production<00:02:11.709> rate<00:02:12.159> so<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.489> whole

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
our production rate so the whole

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.299 
our production rate so the whole
investment<00:02:13.299> is<00:02:13.419> for<00:02:13.629> for<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.959> capacity<00:02:14.590> once

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:15.309 
investment is for for that capacity once

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.320 
investment is for for that capacity once
we<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.609> this<00:02:15.760> industrial<00:02:16.120> footprint<00:02:16.779> here

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
we have this industrial footprint here

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.300 
we have this industrial footprint here
this<00:02:17.840> becomes<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.380> very<00:02:18.560> important<00:02:19.040> part<00:02:19.220> in

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
this becomes a very important part in

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.970 
this becomes a very important part in
our<00:02:19.490> long-term<00:02:19.820> planning<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.990> we<00:02:21.650> have<00:02:21.800> access

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
our long-term planning so we have access

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.220 
our long-term planning so we have access
to<00:02:22.340> land<00:02:22.550> here<00:02:22.820> this<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> great<00:02:23.570> place<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.900> be

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
to land here this is a great place to be

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.590 
to land here this is a great place to be
known<00:02:24.470> as<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:25.280> have<00:02:25.310> an<00:02:25.610> infrastructure<00:02:26.270> have

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
known as you have an infrastructure have

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.740 
known as you have an infrastructure have
access<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> very<00:02:27.380> skilled<00:02:27.560> labor<00:02:28.750> we've

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
access to a very skilled labor we've

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.060 
access to a very skilled labor we've
been<00:02:29.930> here<00:02:30.050> analysis<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:30.680> 32<00:02:31.220> years<00:02:31.460> so

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
been here analysis for 32 years so

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.680 
been here analysis for 32 years so
whilst<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:34.490> have<00:02:34.700> any<00:02:34.940> any<00:02:35.180> firm

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
whilst I do not have any any firm

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.500 
whilst I do not have any any firm
decision<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.230> anything<00:02:36.440> else<00:02:36.740> today<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.760> think

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
decision on anything else today I think

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.840 
decision on anything else today I think
it's<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.740> it's<00:02:39.920> great<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.700> have

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
it's it's it's a it's it's great to have

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.760 
it's it's it's a it's it's great to have
the<00:02:41.000> flexibility<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.810> also<00:02:42.260> use<00:02:42.440> this

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
the flexibility to also use this

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.100 
the flexibility to also use this
footprint<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:44.090> potential<00:02:44.630> growth<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
footprint to potential growth in the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.890 
footprint to potential growth in the
future<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.710> it<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.460> is<00:02:46.730> up<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.090> our<00:02:47.210> ability<00:02:47.480> to

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
future so it is is up to our ability to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.660 
future so it is is up to our ability to
find<00:02:48.200> new<00:02:48.500> programs<00:02:49.430> new<00:02:49.520> markets<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.360> invest
