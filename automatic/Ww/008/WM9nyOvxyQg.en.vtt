on<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:12.150> we<00:00:12.210> set<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.599> up<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:12.960> got

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
on this one how we set it up is we got

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.690 
on this one how we set it up is we got
three<00:00:13.380> cones<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.860> what<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.190> called<00:00:14.460> here

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
three cones just what it's called here

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.790 
three cones just what it's called here
so<00:00:15.360> you're<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> pick<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> line<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.529> start

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
so you're going to pick a line to start

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.019 
so you're going to pick a line to start
on<00:00:16.949> because<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.310> always<00:00:17.550> nice<00:00:17.730> when<00:00:17.760> you

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
on because it's always nice when you

on because it's always nice when you
come<00:00:18.210> back<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.930> want<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> touch<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> line<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
come back we want to touch on a line and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.400 
come back we want to touch on a line and
go<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.000> five<00:00:21.359> yards<00:00:21.869> straight<00:00:22.050> ahead

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
go so we go five yards straight ahead

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.099 
go so we go five yards straight ahead
and<00:00:23.000> then<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.240> either<00:00:24.390> go<00:00:24.570> left<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.050> right

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
and then you can either go left or right

reps on the other but either way you're
going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> take<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> vertical<00:00:34.710> line<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.510> five

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
going to take a vertical line here five

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.639 
going to take a vertical line here five
yards<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:36.960> we're<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.350> come<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
yards and we're going to come to the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
yards and we're going to come to the
left<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.850> five<00:00:39.149> yards

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
left and it's going to be five yards

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.750 
left and it's going to be five yards
over<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.649> an<00:00:40.800> L<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.460> three

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
over so it's going to be an L with three

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
over so it's going to be an L with three
cones<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.329> five<00:00:42.629> yards<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.200> between<00:00:43.530> each

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
cones with five yards in between each

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880 
cones with five yards in between each
one<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.329> start<00:00:45.739> if<00:00:46.739> you're

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
one now the way that we start if you're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.220 
one now the way that we start if you're
lined<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> cone<00:00:48.140> there's<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
lined up here on the cone there's a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.810 
lined up here on the cone there's a
couple<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.590> different<00:00:49.890> sprint<00:00:50.190> sections<00:00:50.640> here

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
couple of different sprint sections here

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.299 
couple of different sprint sections here
so<00:00:51.059> at<00:00:51.570> first<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.920> we're<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so at first when you go we're going to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.479 
so at first when you go we're going to
sprint<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> cone<00:00:54.920> sprint<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> second

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sprint to the cone sprint to the second

sprint to the cone sprint to the second
cone<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> touch<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> line

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
cone you're going to touch the line

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.279 
cone you're going to touch the line
you're<00:00:58.079> coming<00:00:58.440> back<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> first<00:00:59.250> cone

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
you're coming back to the first cone

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.260 
you're coming back to the first cone
when<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.440> get<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.039> touch<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.030> go

when you get there we touch there we go
back<00:01:03.600> you're<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.409> around<00:01:04.739> cone<00:01:05.129> two<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
back you're going around cone two you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.719 
back you're going around cone two you
have<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> inside<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> cone<00:01:08.189> three

have to get to the inside of cone three

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.649 
have to get to the inside of cone three
okay<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.630> loop<00:01:09.930> around<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:12.510> we

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
okay we loop around and this is when we

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
okay we loop around and this is when we
turn<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.439> soon<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> this

to<00:01:33.420> touch<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> cone<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to touch the cone so you can get up and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.730 
to touch the cone so you can get up and
go<00:01:35.579> okay<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.810> our<00:01:36.900> first<00:01:37.140> movement<00:01:37.590> let's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
go okay so our first movement let's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.520 
go okay so our first movement let's
simulated<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.840> he's<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.290> off

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
simulated here he's going to take off

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
simulated here he's going to take off
he's<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> stay<00:01:41.220> low<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.000> gets<00:01:42.210> here

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
he's going to stay low when he gets here

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
he's going to stay low when he gets here
hold<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.720> centered<00:01:43.200> position<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:44.189> he<00:01:44.220> gets

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
hold that centered position when he gets

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.249 
hold that centered position when he gets
here<00:01:44.640> he's<00:01:44.850> centered<00:01:45.240> his<00:01:45.570> body's<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
here he's centered his body's in the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.020 
here he's centered his body's in the
center<00:01:46.530> position<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.159> he<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.399> take<00:01:47.610> off<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
center position so he can take off and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.899 
center position so he can take off and
go<00:01:48.210> his<00:01:48.750> weight<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> inside<00:01:49.979> foot<00:01:50.340> spin

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
go his weight is on the inside foot spin

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.780 
go his weight is on the inside foot spin
around<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.360> let's<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.840> angle<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.439> us

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
around here let's get this angle for us

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.190 
around here let's get this angle for us
when<00:01:53.790> he's<00:01:53.970> centered<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.689> he's<00:01:54.899> ready<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
when he's centered here he's ready to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.830 
when he's centered here he's ready to
touch<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.710> his<00:01:55.920> foot<00:01:56.280> his<00:01:57.119> weight<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
touch in his foot his weight is on the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.350 
touch in his foot his weight is on the
outside<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.590> foot<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.189> he<00:01:59.369> turns<00:01:59.700> he

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
outside of this foot so when he turns he

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.350 
outside of this foot so when he turns he
can<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.110> gain<00:02:01.649> ground<00:02:02.070> okay<00:02:02.909> if

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
can go and actually gain ground okay if

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.899 
can go and actually gain ground okay if
your<00:02:03.750> weight<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.740> foot<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.369> your

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
your weight is on this foot and your

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.290 
your weight is on this foot and your
first<00:02:06.270> movement<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:08.640> did<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.030> go

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
first movement is this you did not go

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.380 
first movement is this you did not go
anywhere<00:02:09.750> okay<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.950> when<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.940> you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
anywhere okay so when you get here you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
anywhere okay so when you get here you
need<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> shift<00:02:12.959> your<00:02:13.290> weight<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
need to shift your weight to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.309 
need to shift your weight to
this<00:02:14.159> foot<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:14.879> you<00:02:15.030> go<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.870> actually

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
this foot so when you go you actually

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.410 
this foot so when you go you actually
gain<00:02:16.560> grout<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.430> let's<00:02:17.580> simulate<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.150> little

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
gain grout so let's simulate that little

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.809 
gain grout so let's simulate that little
section<00:02:18.870> half-speed<00:02:19.560> not<00:02:19.980> very<00:02:20.190> fast

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
section half-speed not very fast

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.199 
section half-speed not very fast
he's<00:02:21.269> centered<00:02:21.690> shifts<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.590> he<00:02:23.010> goes<00:02:23.220> okay

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
he's centered shifts and he goes okay

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.500 
he's centered shifts and he goes okay
same<00:02:24.750> concept<00:02:25.409> when<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.099> line

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
same concept when you get to this line

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.580 
same concept when you get to this line
you're<00:02:27.510> switching<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:28.170> foot

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you're switching your foot

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
he's centered here now his weights on

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.360 
he's centered here now his weights on
his<00:02:30.660> right<00:02:30.900> foot<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.410> he's<00:02:31.830> ready<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.129> go
