can honestly say that if it wasn't for
the<00:05:52.939> all<00:05:53.089> the<00:05:53.779> BS<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.559> was<00:05:54.769> in<00:05:55.099> modern

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:55.399 
the all the BS that was in modern

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:57.589 
warfare 2 that they honestly feel it

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:58.689 
warfare 2 that they honestly feel it
could<00:05:57.709> have<00:05:57.800> probably<00:05:57.919> been<00:05:58.159> taken<00:05:58.429> away<00:05:58.519> with

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
could have probably been taken away with

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.149 
could have probably been taken away with
a<00:05:58.789> patch<00:05:58.969> or<00:05:59.149> maybe<00:05:59.329> it<00:05:59.449> was<00:05:59.479> too<00:05:59.659> late<00:05:59.809> but<00:06:00.469> it

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
a patch or maybe it was too late but it

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.100 
a patch or maybe it was too late but it
would<00:06:01.279> have<00:06:01.429> definitely<00:06:01.699> been<00:06:02.209> the<00:06:02.509> best<00:06:02.779> Call

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
would have definitely been the best Call

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.049 
would have definitely been the best Call
