your<00:01:01.170> hand<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:03.830> when<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> put<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> finger

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
your hand so when you put the finger

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
your hand so when you put the finger
ring<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.180> goes<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.570> middle<00:01:06.900> finger

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
ring on it goes on your middle finger

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
ring on it goes on your middle finger
and<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.040> still<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> good<00:01:08.729> amount<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and you still have a good amount of the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
and you still have a good amount of the
end<00:01:09.720> coming<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.530> where<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.890> spike<00:01:11.250> or

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
end coming out to where you can spike or

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
end coming out to where you can spike or
scrape<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> pressure<00:01:12.930> points<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.590> press<00:01:13.830> on

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
scrape the pressure points or press on

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.490 
scrape the pressure points or press on
points<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.560> much<00:01:16.799> more<00:01:16.830> versatile<00:01:17.820> than

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
points so it's much more versatile than

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.120 
points so it's much more versatile than
the<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.650> self<00:01:20.009> defense<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.390> or

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
the other self defense you are as or

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
the other self defense you are as or
kubaton<00:01:23.130> type<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.880> sticks<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.259> used<00:01:25.560> for

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
kubaton type of sticks that are used for

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
kubaton type of sticks that are used for
self-defense<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.030> like

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
self-defense because it's just like

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.069 
self-defense because it's just like
those<00:01:28.369> except<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> can't<00:01:29.790> drop<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
those except you can't drop them the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
those except you can't drop them the
finger<00:01:31.290> ring<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.829> designed<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> manner

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
finger ring was designed in a manner

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.679 
finger ring was designed in a manner
that<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:34.140> someone<00:01:34.890> pulls<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.850> there's<00:01:36.479> no

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that if someone pulls on this there's no

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960 
that if someone pulls on this there's no
pressure<00:01:37.020> put<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> finger<00:01:38.009> ring<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
pressure put on the finger ring and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
pressure put on the finger ring and
that's<00:01:39.180> because<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.840> independent<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that's because it's independent of the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.230 
that's because it's independent of the
shaft<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.200> device<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> Sharpshooter

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
shaft of the device of the Sharpshooter

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.100 
shaft of the device of the Sharpshooter
so<00:01:46.130> because<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.820> also<00:01:48.299> takes<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
so because of this it also takes the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
so because of this it also takes the
pressure<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.460> finger<00:01:51.000> while<00:01:51.780> you're

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
pressure off the finger while you're

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.920 
pressure off the finger while you're
spinning<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.680> around<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.340> using<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.930> for

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
spinning this around are using this for

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.719 
spinning this around are using this for
swing<00:01:55.290> side<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.680> side<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.610> down

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
swing side to side or up and down

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.330 
swing side to side or up and down
technique<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:58.110> no<00:01:58.320> pressure<00:01:58.619> put<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
technique there's no pressure put on the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670 
technique there's no pressure put on the
fingering<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:01.049> long<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.380> you're

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
fingering at all as long as you're

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
fingering at all as long as you're
gripping<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:02.909> hand<00:02:03.590> there's<00:02:04.590> no

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
gripping this in your hand there's no

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
gripping this in your hand there's no
pressure<00:02:05.130> foot<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> finger<00:02:06.000> ring<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
pressure foot on the finger ring so it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:18.350 
pressure foot on the finger ring so it
makes<00:02:06.960> an<00:02:07.170> excellent<00:02:07.700> self-defense<00:02:08.700> device

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.570
