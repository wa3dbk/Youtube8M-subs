a it's a more expensive option here so
let's<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:47.820> rid<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.930> okay<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.369> here's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
let's get rid of this and okay so here's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.149 
let's get rid of this and okay so here's
the<00:01:50.850> analysis<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.750> we've<00:01:51.899> done<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.920> euro

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the analysis that we've done the euro

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
the analysis that we've done the euro
has<00:01:53.280> squeezed<00:01:53.880> significantly<00:01:54.720> higher<00:01:55.020> okay

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
has squeezed significantly higher okay

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
has squeezed significantly higher okay
and<00:01:55.829> whatever<00:01:56.610> happens<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> outcome<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and whatever happens with the outcome of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.929 
and whatever happens with the outcome of
Greece<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.350> looks<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.759> have

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
Greece it looks like we have a we have

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.899 
Greece it looks like we have a we have
some<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.630> security<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.549> more<00:02:02.850> I

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
some some security there it's more I

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.389 
some some security there it's more I
think<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.350> side<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> pond<00:02:05.009> which<00:02:05.219> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
think to this side of the pond which is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.330 
think to this side of the pond which is
the<00:02:05.700> dollar<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.799> likely<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.829> remain<00:02:08.069> under

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the dollar is likely to remain under

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.589 
the dollar is likely to remain under
pressure<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> Fed<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
pressure because the Fed is going to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.530 
pressure because the Fed is going to
push<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.989> rate<00:02:10.200> hike<00:02:10.349> back<00:02:10.649> if<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.819> so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
push that rate hike back if at all so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.790 
push that rate hike back if at all so
the<00:02:12.660> euro<00:02:12.930> should<00:02:13.230> move<00:02:13.379> hi

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the euro should move hi

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.460 
the euro should move hi
okay<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.000> what<00:02:15.210> we've<00:02:15.360> done<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.930> we've<00:02:16.260> looked

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
okay so what we've done is we've looked

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
okay so what we've done is we've looked
at<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.830> first<00:02:17.130> advance<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.210> we've

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
at this first advance and we we've

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.990 
at this first advance and we we've

weights in the weekly series I think
that's<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.790> good<00:03:38.970> bet<00:03:39.209> because<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.660> near

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
that's a good bet because in the near

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.479 
that's a good bet because in the near
term<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.140> think<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.440> 110<00:03:40.800> levels<00:03:41.130> going<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.310> go

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
term I think that 110 levels going to go

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.860 
term I think that 110 levels going to go
