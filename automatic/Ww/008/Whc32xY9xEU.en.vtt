00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.929
 Hello, I decided to make a video by 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.370
 but using mod cosplay for chrome 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.000
 run 500 up until the photo is knocked out 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:22.350
 let's start the fate of an arbitrary place we will start 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.970
 it is necessary to reduce the enrollment 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.000
 believe that the height of the moment is already 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 more or less rate of marks 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.120
 it means we drive up we drive it any 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.520
 not stupid if I raised that fell on the cape 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 so I have this video skewed 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.660
 machine we are the main essence of creating a point. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.770
 waiting waiting here he'll break it down 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:01.579
 shish kebabs and Kenske work is carried away from here 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.579
 further we follow if we moved 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:13.290
 work the main thing here you remember that to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.890
 do not catch a screw on objects or 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.080
 an ice cream object here we create 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.909
 point expect here it will develop us 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:32.420
 find turn off the company 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.420
 and we can go further. 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:42.780
 starting point or finish the vlog out 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.759
 course we choose while working in 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.020
 general loader policy does not cheat on 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:57.979
 the moment is more suitable 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:01.680
 suitable because other faces like 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.630
 It is running at me well, actually 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.630
 you can save the name 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:27.660
 mission 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:36.300
 we can start mowing start 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:39.210
 decompose and you accordingly 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.250
 you can try anyway 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.890
 use 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.310
 experiment with different 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.490
 equipped either try 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.030
 use this mod for distribution 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.760
 she may be easier for him 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.610
 navigate by size 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.650
 recognize the stairs understood these trees 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:10.790
 from and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:14.390
 but actually thrown help we can 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.390
 finish our 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.850
 but it's all the same 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.850
 call him 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:43.400
 next two trees 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:43.400
 and after that he writes work vertex 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:57.930
 actually all for some reason when you click 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:04:02.090
 finish the route he finishes his 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.090
 work you can click the end point and 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.790
 finish the route 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.940
 but actually all if someone 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.769
 have any corrections comments 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.769
 leave you happy to meet you.
