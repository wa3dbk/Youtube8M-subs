00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.549
 pretty much schierack companies successfully advise in 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.450
 change processes 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.629
 that the director has a loss what to note IZ 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.450
 Changes the inflation 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.950
 I have to be aware of this and to keep it important 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.670
 then also make the employees aware of the four-seated positive aspects 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.279
 for the strong companies and only if we have the current round 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.910
 Influences on our company adapt about this change and 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.669
 Lena we will also be able to do this too much 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.119
 Rule number two changes definitely with employees in common 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.610
 So this is the case 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.070
 To make affected persons involved 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.630
 Rule number three is work has to be fun 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.730
 the art is to demand 90 percent and to keep it constant 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
 90 per cent demand means that the employees do not end their lives 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.430
 Reserves did not exhaust summer team team over a course always 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.040
 there is still a residual bank so that he can run again and the second 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.370
 Factor a factor of frequently companies very much neglected 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.990
 is celebrated successes 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.790
 Kramer four carefully handle the quality of life of employees 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.630
 People who work for their business spend a large part of their lives 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 Day in these companies their weapons and their lives in total 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.710
 and that's why it's very important that the destination feels good and that it does 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.200
 like Karben 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.890
 The fifth rule is to focus on the positive and change process 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.440
 it's about moving away from the error culture towards a divorce sculptures rule 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.670
 Number six is ​​now quite concretely about decisions, it is said that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 Decisions always take place and even if I do not mean to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.220
 decide then I decide for the status quo 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.440
 So one should be stopped in change processes 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.530
 Really make decisions actively because only then can I take a step 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.860
 Forward 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.120
 in Zinal rational uncomfortable properties the the advisory team 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.159
 But it's not just that 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.549
 they also stand for it like the two managing partners and 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.509
 Brothers Marcello and occasions Year Companies in change processes in 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.770
 have successfully advised the past what exactly they are 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.910
 Has keywords and why it matters sometimes too 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.969
 Being both emotional and rational at the same time explains Acocella every year 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.590
 new opinion is that in our job what in the consultation 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.560
 and in the company of companies in change processes that one there 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.440
 must be rational because of course it is also about hard facts 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.590
 and in addition one dares to see people doing and having to deal with people 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.730
 Of course you can also see him in Motion Ahlen with the sense and the team 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.110
 Should be able to think of them Jandt and 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.670
 But to be successful in dealing with change processes is often necessary 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.479
 Help from the outside which sometimes can be quite uncomfortable 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.619
 why the decisive half of the year is expected to complement that 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.279
 Besides, our household needs to be local with passion 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.019
 reinzuhängen in the project 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.909
 while the mud or already said 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.489
 Keep the facts in focus 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.450
 Above all, we are no longer touched and, secondly, we are special 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.950
 important because I sat in jail with father much of my job Jana question 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.879
 Apparently Lesjak 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.590
 That's why many people in companies really feel so heavy 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.280
 To accept change and to face it 2 skepticism is in 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.429
 Usually the focus is on a change process 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:12.239
 Frequently Needed Wrong Wheel Of Corporate Management Dr 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.980
 with executives the company does not count is the human factor 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.290
 Man is a habit animal mens-season track I want to ca 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.519
 and how big is the range of problems faced by entrepreneurs 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.259
 and employees often face in practice at this point 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.500
 again, of course, yes 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.590
 It may be that the expansion is a relatively small business 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.569
 big contract to land pulls and from the states must be new 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.839
 Employees can be hired that means it can now be used by Sion 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.429

 within the last four years from 17 to 9 50 Peter Hauk has now expanded 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.059
 it can also be the implementation of a new leadership culture yes and how it works 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.149
 With so many things in life is crucial too, the mutual 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:03.049
 Confidence if this is not true between employees and executives 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.059
 then change processes can ever express the tedious 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.439
 Matters are therefore recommended considering the general following 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.150
 Executives have to make their employees in the league clear 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.790
 that the change comes whether they want it or not will prevent it 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.039
 we funds in the group 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.459

 attacks the 9

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.790
 Managers to be aware that this change process is interrupted 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.830

 or relevant to Dirk SKRZYPCZAK Bianca companies are either changing 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.889

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.690
 especially wealthy employees too

 Often, however, that does not work out by itself entrepreneurs and executives
