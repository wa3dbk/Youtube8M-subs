00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
I have the upper LED blinking and the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.930 
I have the upper LED blinking and the
lower<00:00:48.870> LED<00:00:49.410> blinking<00:00:49.829> over<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
lower LED blinking over here to the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
lower LED blinking over here to the
right<00:00:51.920> before<00:00:52.920> those<00:00:53.820> would<00:00:54.690> normally<00:00:55.110> show

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
right before those would normally show

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.090 
right before those would normally show
you<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.129> phone<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.770> you<00:00:58.770> were

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
you if the phone was on or if you were

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340 
you if the phone was on or if you were
on<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> Bluetooth<00:00:59.670> connection<00:01:00.329> or<00:01:00.539> even<00:01:00.840> Wi-Fi

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
on a Bluetooth connection or even Wi-Fi

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.770 
on a Bluetooth connection or even Wi-Fi
I<00:01:01.379> believe<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> thought<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I believe but I thought that all that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190 
I believe but I thought that all that
was<00:01:03.809> quite<00:01:04.229> useless<00:01:04.670> or<00:01:05.670> maybe<00:01:06.299> maybe<00:01:07.049> not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
was quite useless or maybe maybe not

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.719 
was quite useless or maybe maybe not
useless<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.890> maybe<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> could<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> little

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
useless but maybe I could do a little

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.649 
useless but maybe I could do a little
bit<00:01:08.880> more<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.159> well<00:01:11.159> someone<00:01:11.659> made

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
bit more with that and well someone made

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
bit more with that and well someone made
up<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.900> tweak<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.280> neat

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
up this tweak here and it's really neat

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.429 
up this tweak here and it's really neat
so<00:01:14.850> let's<00:01:15.060> turn<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> phone<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:16.110> because

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so let's turn the phone back on because

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.749 
so let's turn the phone back on because
that's<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.330> would<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.450> neater<00:01:19.610> about<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that's that would be neater about the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.310 
that's that would be neater about the
rear<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.580> tweak<00:01:23.850> has<00:01:24.030> done<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
rear so what this tweak has done is you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
rear so what this tweak has done is you
see<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.619> there's<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> red<00:01:26.130> light<00:01:26.390> flashing

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
see that there's a red light flashing

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
see that there's a red light flashing
there<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.140> means<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> missed

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
there that means that i have a missed

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.490 
there that means that i have a missed
phone<00:01:30.420> call<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.909> bottom<00:01:33.270> LEDs<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
phone call and the bottom LEDs here you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.929 
phone call and the bottom LEDs here you
can<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> blue<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
can see that there is a blue and that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.630 
can see that there is a blue and that
just<00:01:36.119> flashed<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.500> shows<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.280> have

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
just flashed and that shows that i have

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.870 
just flashed and that shows that i have
a<00:01:38.880> text<00:01:39.180> message<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.220> then<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
a text message and then you can see that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.300 
a text message and then you can see that
there's<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> green<00:01:42.479> flash<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:43.860> well<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
there's a green flash there as well and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.649 
there's a green flash there as well and
that<00:01:45.000> shows<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.649> an<00:01:46.950> email<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:48.240> i

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that shows that i have an email now i

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.969 
that shows that i have an email now i
think<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.770> neat<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:51.979> when

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
think this is really neat because when

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.580 
think this is really neat because when
the<00:01:53.340> phone<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.790> standby<00:01:54.060> mode<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.930> screen

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the phone is in standby mode the screen

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
the phone is in standby mode the screen
is<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.860> obviously<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.149> buttons<00:01:57.479> are

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
is off obviously and the buttons are

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.240 
is off obviously and the buttons are
somewhat<00:01:58.020> locked<00:01:58.259> except<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> power

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
somewhat locked except for the power

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.230 
somewhat locked except for the power
button<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.229> now<00:02:01.229> normally<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:02.969> any

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
button and now normally if you get any

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
button and now normally if you get any
notification<00:02:04.079> such<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.850> text<00:02:05.850> message<00:02:05.880> or

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
notification such as a text message or

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.070 
notification such as a text message or
an<00:02:06.240> email<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.590> screen<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.099> pop<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.080> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
an email the screen would pop on and the

we go that is what I wrote indeed I
italicized<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.269> did<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.200> bold<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.769> with<00:03:10.250> an

and I think I did the font extra because
I<00:03:25.560> thought<00:03:25.770> perhaps<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.700> D<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.980> would<00:03:29.160> look

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
I thought perhaps that D it would look

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.790 
I thought perhaps that D it would look

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
the zooming in and we can read some of

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:28.910 
the zooming in and we can read some of
the<00:05:19.520> text

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.040

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:56.890 

that's<00:05:50.960> basically<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.800> way<00:05:52.670> that<00:05:52.910> works<00:05:55.900> that

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
that's basically the way that works that
