comfortable with the game and the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
comfortable with the game and the
mechanics<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.390> when<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
mechanics of it then that's when you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
mechanics of it then that's when you
start<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> become<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.579> run

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
start to become more you know you run

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.060 
start to become more you know you run
around<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.119> bit<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.170> really<00:02:01.649> got<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
around a bit more but you really got to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.969 
around a bit more but you really got to
know<00:02:02.100> about<00:02:02.430> map<00:02:02.909> knowledge<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.680> try<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.710> go

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
know about map knowledge so try to go

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.580 
know about map knowledge so try to go
into<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:06.119> know<00:02:06.210> either<00:02:06.390> take<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> slow<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.439> if

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
into you know either take a slow but if

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.080 
into you know either take a slow but if
you<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.099> patience<00:02:08.610> try<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.879> get

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you do have the patience try to get

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.080 
you do have the patience try to get
others<00:02:09.450> silly<00:02:09.810> mistake<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.910> have

where everything is that's the probably

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.589 
where everything is that's the probably

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
got to do and also you you know you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.990 
got to do and also you you know you
should<00:02:35.040> really<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.500> know<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.730> can

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
should really be you know if you can

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.319 
should really be you know if you can
choose<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.719> strike<00:02:40.439> package<00:02:40.829> that<00:02:41.159> you<00:02:41.370> use<00:02:42.090> I

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
choose the strike package that you use I

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.119 
choose the strike package that you use I
recommend<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.049> use<00:02:43.139> support<00:02:43.889> at<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
recommend that you use support at the

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.789 
recommend that you use support at the
start<00:02:44.370> because<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:45.599> point<00:02:45.989> streaks<00:02:46.379> don't

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
start because the point streaks don't

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.129 
start because the point streaks don't
actually<00:02:47.220> reset<00:02:47.879> when<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.629> die<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.109> that

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
actually reset when you die so that

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.409 
actually reset when you die so that
means<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.799> keep<00:02:50.099> pumping<00:02:50.519> out<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:51.299> know

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
means you can keep pumping out you know

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.750 
means you can keep pumping out you know
these<00:02:51.659> point<00:02:52.169> streaks<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.739> UAVs<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.430> stuff

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
these point streaks like UAVs and stuff

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.610 
these point streaks like UAVs and stuff
which<00:02:53.909> are<00:02:54.060> really<00:02:54.269> helpful<00:02:54.569> which<00:02:55.319> helps
