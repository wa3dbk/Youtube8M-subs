00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello friends karabash 74 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 today as I promised you show 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.539
 Kamaz 4911 here created a small 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.109
 field racer because a place for it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.390
 really need a lot now you will see 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.840
 what do i still have to say that is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 Kamaz himself is made as if 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 perfect here but i'm here a little bit 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 let's ride 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.520
 and perezalil I'm sitting in the editor created 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.140
 polygon here you see already dashed off then 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.570
 there is 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.539
 the ground for the whole razvoroshil me already 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.809
 rolled over a few times plus 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:53.280
 quite patted grass 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.239
 That is, the production is Dmitry 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 Romanenko 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.809
 Here is KAMAZ this announced as he me 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.900
 said he won't be this kamaz he 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.500
 made as if only for himself and him 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.250
 Well, in short, that is somehow so 4911 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.119
 Kamaz 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.890
 why he is so yellow I do not know 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.540
 Well, actually for this is not about this 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.540
 we include overdrive 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.110
 turn off the handbrake in principle and let's 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.619
 behind him on him is he really 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.960
 turns over that is 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.049
 rolls over reins i'm here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.750
 probably already know half an hour chasing him 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.750
 all this is just a plague and not a car 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.409
 it's crazy just speed on it 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.899
 that is, it is really fun that is 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.580
 drift on 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.909
 but it needs some kind of even 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.080
 polygon here this road here gouging 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:04.100
 you are almost all his about women feet 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.100
 let's turn on all-wheel drive or something 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.430
 locking wheels from seen on he 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.690
 jumped on you wouldn't 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.209
 i mean i say it fun 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.100
 really let us unhook from 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.980
 This KAMAZ and now turn on 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.110
 to the great of our 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.959
 two testicles and let the UN rolls on 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.650
 let's see what he will be 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.650
 do on it 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 yes he is well of course he arrived 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.640
 Well, the twin is of course stupid, I donâ€™t know what 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.599
 he is trying by and large to call in 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.140
 wall but because speed is on 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.140
 just this 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.819
 so that's exactly what I said that 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.250
 there he is now and will go 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:12.700
 let me take it well, that's basically random 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:17.579
 now he will drive off and we turn on 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.900
 sharply passing and he stops 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.180
 because he thinks it is wrong 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.790
 ride but we'll turn it off 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.129
 successful and still come back because 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.680
 he mutilated us Kamaz now 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:37.359
 let's repair it and let's we on it 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:44.500
 gas him so push the engine forward 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:48.790
 almost stalls just such a kamaz 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.920
 the plague is it really fun so 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.099
 Here you know create seems so to me 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.530
 polygon smooth create some kind of track 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.590
 that is, it will be fun like this 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.940
 it is enough even 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.940
 will be cool 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.350
 I already found all this here and us 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.240
 it is necessary and 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:26.100
 exactly like guys who came to me 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.660
 know in the comments asked by 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:36.720
 about keyboard layouts 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:39.180
 quarrel, I will not lay it out anywhere 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.840
 the more I comment on what keys I 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.060
 I click that is, and in one of my first 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.700
 videos I commented on what keys 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.300
 pressing and for which they are responsible only such 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:55.290
 the combination of pressing that is who has not seen 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.260
 guys look by the way back to 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.980
 our team when he stands on 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.060
 automatic machine that is, it accelerates like 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.790
 legs are not particularly so perky but if we 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.710
 cut in here it is enhanced 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.710
 turns into demons of some kind 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:25.069
 that is, I really turned upside down 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:26.780
 on it so to speak so control if 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.219
 rolled over press the shortcut 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.069
 kontrol mm 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:33.729
 English dictates all combinations on 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:38.680
 English language 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.680
 yes let's accelerate immediately than 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.060
 forever already sort of killed 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.660
 entire polygon 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.020
 well not all street polygons I have 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.570
 called the card but it is di carta that is 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.190
 I literally have a hat for a minute 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.440
 to test ie developer 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.300
 this fashion warned me that 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:15.450
 overdrive he is such a thing 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:17.670
 get up that horror is fun true to me 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.760
 it seems it will never get bored 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.480
 in general, so and so somehow you were 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.420
