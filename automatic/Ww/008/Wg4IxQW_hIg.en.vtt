00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
maths let's say four Edexcel and that

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.869 
maths let's say four Edexcel and that
will<00:02:33.440> give<00:02:33.650> me<00:02:33.769> courses<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.579> while<00:02:34.730> I'm

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.110 
more work on it and similarly throughout
the<00:03:39.799> whole<00:03:39.950> course<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.579> do<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.849> so<00:03:41.030> you

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the whole course you can do that so you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.270 
the whole course you can do that so you
go<00:03:41.269> back<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.630> your<00:03:41.720> profile<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.410> now<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.040> can

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
go back to your profile and now you can

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.520 
go back to your profile and now you can
see<00:03:43.459> your<00:03:43.609> decision<00:03:44.120> maths<00:03:44.410> checklist<00:03:45.410> is

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
see your decision maths checklist is

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.190 
see your decision maths checklist is
updated<00:03:46.069> there's<00:03:46.609> one<00:03:46.849> topic<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.480> know<00:03:47.660> one

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
updated there's one topic you know one

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.960 
updated there's one topic you know one
topic<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.680> need<00:03:48.799> a<00:03:48.859> bit<00:03:49.069> more<00:03:49.099> work<00:03:49.430> on<00:03:49.669> one

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
topic you need a bit more work on one

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.970 
topic you need a bit more work on one
topic<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.389> don't<00:03:50.569> get<00:03:50.810> loads<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.560> topics

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
topic you don't get loads of topics

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.789 
topic you don't get loads of topics
still<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.400> do<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:53.480> works<00:03:53.720> for<00:03:53.930> all<00:03:54.169> your

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
still to do and it works for all your

still to do and it works for all your
courses<00:03:55.669> there<00:03:56.030> just<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:56.599> that

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
courses there just like that

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.349 
courses there just like that
so<00:03:57.440> let's<00:03:57.650> look<00:03:57.769> at<00:03:57.889> a<00:03:57.950> GCSE<00:03:58.489> one<00:03:58.669> this<00:03:59.090> one's

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
so let's look at a GCSE one this one's

this one will if you master everything

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.819 
this one will if you master everything
in<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.060> should<00:04:05.389> guarantee<00:04:05.629> you<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.109> C<00:04:06.470> in<00:04:06.709> the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
new feature and Hegarty maths there's

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.409 
new feature and Hegarty maths there's
some<00:04:43.650> really<00:04:43.830> cool<00:04:44.129> things<00:04:44.430> as<00:04:44.580> well<00:04:44.759> in<00:04:44.940> GCC
