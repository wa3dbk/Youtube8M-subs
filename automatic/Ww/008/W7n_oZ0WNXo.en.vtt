00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.529 

this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.430> something<00:01:44.789> that's<00:01:44.910> a<00:01:45.060> very<00:01:45.300> you<00:01:45.479> know

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
and stuff I think of lines up being a
deal<00:01:49.680> them<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.190> far<00:01:50.580> divorced<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.270> nature

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.470 
kind of I think that's a lot of reasons
its<00:02:13.290> popular<00:02:13.799> Western<00:02:14.430> civilization<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.330> it's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
a way for us to get back to that kind of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660 
a way for us to get back to that kind of
struggle<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.330> suffering<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.380> was<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.580> know
