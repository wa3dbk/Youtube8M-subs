00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.040
 so that friends are friends 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.439
 based on this occasion I'm going to 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.810
 show how a mixer is connected 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.300
 mixers 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.809
 in this component is piecita 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.370
 is an English mixer knows him as a 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:43.930
 mixer so it's to combine the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 elevator and aileron movements 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:53.829
 yes and how it works 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.829
 here the mixer is connected to all of them 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.280
 connects with the collections 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.409
 receiver for us two connections 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.189
 that one is the one that is 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.189
 the ailerons 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.360
 they are going to wonder what it is for 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.090
 the mixer especially to make a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.940
 Delta wing shows where the ailerons 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.610
 they work like spoilers and as 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.850
 elevators 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 many of them may have a 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.030
 control of these 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.100
 this control is 6 having them is 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 programmable and it can be stolen and it was 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.950
 do not use the mixer very well your 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.950
 normal on a plane like 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.200
 etcetera some elevators the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.190
 ailerons and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.330
 channel 2 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.080
 It is the elevator 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.070
 in the model of 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.070
 delta wing 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.040
 using a 4- channel radio 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.040
 the movements are mixed 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.409
 and the verbs do the movements of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.409
 the ailerons 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.849
 in such a way that they can raise the looks 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.099
 then this is how a wing works 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.780
 true delta with the mixer and a radio 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.810
 four channels this 4 channel radio 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.130
 it's not programmable precisely because of that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.110
 the mix is used 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.110
 Well now we are going to show you 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.030
 detail how the mixer is connected 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.710
 then let's see 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.940
 this is our mix he has 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:09.090
 for two servos has the polarity 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.930
 then we will properly connect the 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.120
 first servo 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.980
 if always taking into account the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.670
 polarity 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.670
 61 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.800
 yes right away 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.300
 let's connect 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:33.480
 and mixer the mixer on channel 1 and 2 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:40.440
 of your receiver since channel 1 are the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.440
 ailerons and channel 2 is the elevator 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.290
 Here I am going to show you 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.290
 in the hang glider 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.620
 here comes I have it enabled 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.260
 As I said let the subtle mixer 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.360
 to use when we have radios that are 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.210
 of 4 channels and that are not formal that 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.720
 they only have the switches 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:15.130
 normal and reverse if in this case 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.970
 let's connect the battery to the delta wing 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.769
 and the components are already here 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.130
 previously connected here and what 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.130
 I put together well then if they set 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.680
 our work is already working 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:37.320
 our the east is channel 1 wanted 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.320
 get the movement of the spoiler 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.939
 with all correctly 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:48.449
 and the servos themselves do the functions 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:50.039
 of the elevator if you look here 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.949
 is doing the lifting function 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.319
 that one moves in a manner contrary to 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.939
 another one and when we do the function of 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:04.020
 elevator the two ailerons are lowered or 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:07.710
 rise in the same direction and logically 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.309
 this channel here from the radio has been 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.939
 disabled because we only have 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:16.559
 using three channels or two that are between 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.979
 the two pigs because they are their 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:25.159
 functions the elevator spoiler and the 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.159
 which is the speed that is 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.970
 then later we will approve him 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.540
 is for sale to see to see how 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.540
 we
