00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
spot but uh let's see we'll figure it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.709 
spot but uh let's see we'll figure it
out<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> gotta<00:00:43.950> learn<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> Matt<00:00:44.460> Moore

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719

still<00:00:45.719> some<00:00:45.989> mistakes<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.500> make<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.039> map

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
still some mistakes I make because a map

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.380 
still some mistakes I make because a map
lack<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.200> map<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.399> recognition

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
lack of map you know recognition

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
lack of map you know recognition
awareness<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> stuff<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
awareness and stuff like that so I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.040 
awareness and stuff like that so I
didn't<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> guy<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.360> indoors<00:00:54.750> i

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

thought<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.350> below<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.219> slowed<00:00:56.460> me

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
thought it was below me so it slowed me

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.299 
thought it was below me so it slowed me
up<00:00:56.670> right<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.800> catches<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.920> coming<00:00:59.219> up

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
doing but like there I just anticipated

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.440 
doing but like there I just anticipated
to<00:04:33.010> spawn<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.550> know<00:04:33.640> people<00:04:33.850> spawning<00:04:34.210> back

there<00:04:34.690> that's<00:04:34.870> why<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> chose<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.500> go<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.770> way

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
there that's why I chose to go that way

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.070 
there that's why I chose to go that way
rather<00:04:36.669> than<00:04:36.850> just<00:04:37.240> could<00:04:37.660> stay<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:37.960> this

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
rather than just could stay in this

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.230 
rather than just could stay in this
middle<00:04:38.320> area<00:04:38.470> because<00:04:38.800> my<00:04:38.919> whole<00:04:39.040> team<00:04:39.340> you

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
middle area because my whole team you

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.210 
middle area because my whole team you
know<00:04:40.360> it's<00:04:40.660> posted<00:04:41.050> up<00:04:41.169> in<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.440> building<00:04:41.919> so

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
know it's posted up in that building so

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.520 
know it's posted up in that building so
obviously<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.940> other<00:04:43.120> team<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.960> not<00:04:44.200> in<00:04:44.410> that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
obviously the other team is not in that

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.100 
obviously the other team is not in that
building<00:04:45.840> common<00:04:46.840> sense<00:04:46.960> actually<00:04:47.620> but

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
building common sense actually but

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.010 
building common sense actually but
anyway<00:04:50.110> so<00:04:50.169> rather<00:04:50.860> than<00:04:51.070> keep<00:04:51.250> dragging<00:04:51.700> on

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
anyway so rather than keep dragging on

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.060 
anyway so rather than keep dragging on
what<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.050> wanted<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.410> talk<00:04:53.650> about<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:54.010> this

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
bad situations so what I did with this

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.250 
bad situations so what I did with this
class<00:07:05.099> was<00:07:05.460> I<00:07:05.789> added<00:07:05.940> everything<00:07:06.300> for<00:07:06.810> aiming

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
class was I added everything for aiming

down the sights shooting I had it

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.390 
down the sights shooting I had it
whatever<00:07:09.690> reduces<00:07:10.380> the<00:07:10.440> recoil<00:07:10.590> when<00:07:10.950> aiming

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
whatever reduces the recoil when aiming

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.760 
whatever reduces the recoil when aiming
I<00:07:11.580> put<00:07:11.940> the<00:07:12.090> thing<00:07:12.810> to<00:07:12.990> pull<00:07:13.320> up<00:07:13.440> my<00:07:13.530> site

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770

faster<00:07:13.979> and<00:07:14.310> I<00:07:14.370> got<00:07:14.490> the<00:07:14.610> silencer<00:07:15.030> of<00:07:15.150> course

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389 
faster and I got the silencer of course

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.200 
faster and I got the silencer of course
to<00:07:16.229> stay<00:07:16.440> low<00:07:16.650> profile<00:07:17.400> on<00:07:17.580> the<00:07:17.669> radar<00:07:17.849> as

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210
