you know I think a pretty cool lick I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.130 
you know I think a pretty cool lick I
like<00:01:27.110> doing<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:27.410> kind<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.740> stuff<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:29.140> that's

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
like doing this kind of stuff and that's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.880 
like doing this kind of stuff and that's
basically<00:01:30.620> what<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:30.950> is<00:01:31.010> key<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.550> G<00:01:31.820> sharp<00:01:34.810> and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
basically what it is key of G sharp and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.410 
basically what it is key of G sharp and
I'll<00:01:36.890> run<00:01:37.130> through<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.430> number<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.210> notes

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
I'll run through the number of the notes

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.840 
I'll run through the number of the notes
as<00:01:38.660> well<00:01:38.780> for<00:01:39.410> you<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:40.280> can<00:01:40.400> really<00:01:40.640> break

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
as well for you so we can really break

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.960 
as well for you so we can really break
this<00:01:41.060> sucker<00:01:41.300> down<00:01:41.830> so<00:01:42.830> basically<00:01:43.400> on<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
this sucker down so basically on the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.450 
this sucker down so basically on the
third<00:01:44.180> string<00:01:44.479> it's<00:01:44.720> three<00:01:45.110> four<00:01:45.890> six<00:01:48.460> and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
third string it's three four six and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.870 
third string it's three four six and
then<00:01:50.000> for<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.240> four<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.630> second<00:01:52.509> four<00:01:53.509> times

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.550 

and<00:01:57.880> then<00:01:58.300> actually<00:01:58.480> fifth<00:01:58.930> on<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.290> fifth

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
and then actually fifth on the fifth

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.960 
and then actually fifth on the fifth
time<00:01:59.740> we<00:01:59.920> do<00:02:00.010> it<00:02:00.100> one<00:02:00.310> more<00:02:00.430> time<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.850> where

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
time we do it one more time this where

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.150 
time we do it one more time this where
we<00:02:01.060> start<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.360> s<00:02:01.570> end<00:02:04.260> so<00:02:05.260> we<00:02:05.350> got<00:02:05.500> three<00:02:05.800> four

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
we start the s end so we got three four

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.590 
we start the s end so we got three four
six<00:02:06.430> on<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.729> third<00:02:06.910> string<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.360> on<00:02:07.510> the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
six on the third string and on the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.150 
six on the third string and on the
second<00:02:07.960> string<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.289> going<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.500> be<00:02:08.560> four<00:02:08.890> five

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
second string it's going to be four five

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.510 
second string it's going to be four five
seven<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.869> then<00:02:10.960> on<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.140> first<00:02:11.680> string<00:02:11.950> it's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
seven and then on the first string it's

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.600 
seven and then on the first string it's
going<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.730> be<00:02:12.850> four<00:02:13.660> six<00:02:14.260> seven<00:02:17.430> that's<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
going to be four six seven that's the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.190 
going to be four six seven that's the
first<00:02:18.880> shape<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.480> whole<00:02:19.660> ascending

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
first shape of this whole ascending

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.810

thing<00:02:20.590> going<00:02:20.860> up<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.070> neck<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:21.459> these<00:02:21.610> two

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
thing going up the neck with these two

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.940 
thing going up the neck with these two
again<00:02:22.720> three<00:02:22.990> note<00:02:23.140> per<00:02:23.170> string<00:02:23.260> alternate

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950
