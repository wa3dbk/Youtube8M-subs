 the only problem is the world of tennis already in the hands 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.219
 in German 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.589
 earth pipe 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.679
 but it is not 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.919
 nuts 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.689
 these mahogany nuts 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.689
 what is a bad joke power of tender 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.600
 so today my reward will they continue 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 mahogany cr 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 so to five of the mahogany nut subjects for moman 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 and to this strong family welded 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.490
 unlike what just happened there 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.760
 then mansaré in the ranks 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.600
 alcohol who put match 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.190
 he gets himself reindeer so 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.230
 in e 4th 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.040
 because titus mapaq the game the young sister so that's chasing by markit is 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.090
 Shiite these wrinkles 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.430
 strong tomorrow 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.770
 inflated even if I wanted you all have 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.350
 ebay who had on the face of this moment of truth in the code 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.420
 ethical 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 map wait for me to approach why here 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.170
 you may have seen in the kamikaze 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.190
 e ourselves 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.100
 everybody was basically seeing béchard 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.620
 big difference the color 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.830
 I see that it has changed ahead a little later to Hungary 1 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.340
 the time of day at berne even 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.340
 the colors of the German team are a little further north 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 as long as it comes 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 here we go then I play pale pal 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.350
 it's not she who should go through my because 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.970
 not simply 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.960
 they do not follow 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 before losing foot tom's guide 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.680
 waiting 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.780
 we take note 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.470
 I was told he was very tired because just bullet is a 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 one-shot tip that will increase this morning 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.980
 automatic 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 easy to play 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.249
 and then here it is to kotor objects stop a word to be sure and 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.969
 certain to see a hot 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.069
 from villiers 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.949
 as for even for all 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.949
 and then about it is improv I do not know if I'm the only one 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.699
 but the fan with 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.789
 with these same two charles feats was quickly lovers 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.499
 am I the only one to find that 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:37.979
 the noise 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.409
 what not to do it the teacher 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.129
 it is really very pleasant to the ear 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.009
 so be careful 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.309
 wide open ears all women you the tournament tension 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.010
 do you want you can not that little by little li like that he is I know 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.469
 I do not hear it every time 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.269
 it's good for my ears 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.019
 short this today 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.019
 she's playing the brink of things so first thing 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.279
 2 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.739
 we will start by year however the rain 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.739
 the least interesting 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.149
 the semester the austerity 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.039
 I have a question 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.249
 which I surely would not have the answer 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.829
 Why 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.459
 where does this quest come from? 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.810
 maybe before this morning head 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.890
 why what everybody shout all wish everyone thinks that a good 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.890
 leading player must thematically reached this morning 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:41.419
 the fritz body friend to be like that at the time 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.249
 pacheco what you want a nice show but I do not know but 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.549
 so guess 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.009
 in my head my little instinct is made to be witnesses so 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.509
 obviously in the background 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.889
 why not have been able to defensively have finally taken the nose 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.449
 the team 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.449
 not already there it's not for my aunt 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.579
 six tenths 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.899
 the goal of this match may be better 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.669
 I do it anyway but hey 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.669
 it seems to me that one game is not made to darken 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.859
 in France and Italy then 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.840
 these to do some seco stuff 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.849
 or of herself stone denounces corp 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.529
 dell announces that people 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.479
 for those who are not aware of time 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.139
 I find that 6 0 what's the name that's totally lucky 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.490
 by the only part of style 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.490
 and then techniques and in others as if to see it 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.580
 it's like we do not see often because we give them 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.309
 not where it is huge 8 6% 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.169
 pray god for the ball to go where to go 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.860
 ap already society modibo I know I do not talk much about enemies in France without 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.830
 this video but hey 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.860
 I said it myself and after all it's this gift 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.999
 if it's enough of that that's the goal 2-2 couderc 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.999
 or still not him a little less seen on things I think 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.289
 hen to 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.459
 high-tech kilos and coal the second point of design 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.589
 that's why all the fixtures are possible 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.219
 affluence has passed just down his peppery note I appear in one 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.400
 from our two miles from the goal I think about talking 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.620
 why are flat soles considered to be necessarily 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.620
 good players one would not spend 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.849
 I will tell you why 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.680
 firstly because it is 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.040
 obviously 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.460
 in fact can lie it's harder that he has someone that can 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.870
 sometimes have break exactly on him 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.860
 and then wish - builder 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.400
 since the balls in addition to washington not necessarily all in so 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.819
 it's sophie to divide 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.030
 But the respondent I think is totally wrong 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.379
 to think that 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:52.669
 because 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.430
 a player 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.460
 very good 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.449
 without necessarily playing this morning example me 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.669
 I am a pro 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.159
 philipp lahm north 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.479
 not me but other people 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.710
 we can be good playing well 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.460
 marange the end of the season 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.719
 it's a little ghana but we can be good I think with his friends 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.909
 keep it looks like everyone says sca with its range of new bedford r 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.159
 that's going to get us to the next dangerous point by the turmoil say that the 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:23.169
 sca rugby 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.110
 that of us 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.220
 salem 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.620
 like the others since boralex city which makes the objectives 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.949
 if you were a small magazine ap 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.610
 he was a good player 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.560
 no need to make a 360 moscow potenza match on a grand round be 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.059
 necessarily at the oratory 

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:40.889
 So this is it 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.210
 but small his friends that those who think that I'm sorry 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.219
 I was completely in the west 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:50.669
 in my grand-aunt I will tell you - for me what is a good choice a good 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.669
 player cited card who makes the goals 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.830
 and who pays so well that it stung days 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:57.909
 finally my teams 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.909
 Caesar who is not made 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:07.409
 I feel it's really here it's a minefield in this 91st street corner 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:09.119
 finally 

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.119
 in this department 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.649
 as said 

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:19.029
 me a good player is someone who does work on antibes and then that the 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:21.110
 goals 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.300
 do what you want by a party 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.840

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.249
 alcove 

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:32.369
 for ordinary citizens injured other point 

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.759
 the others 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.520
 the new rates 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.490
 I'm sorry I do not know so I ask if you want 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.680
 t my opinion on the bnp 45 turn requests from the 14 by going to the party all 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.659
 things that nobody likes 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.539
 the package on the second 

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:50.789
 video that's precisely you know where you directly protect the beginning 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:51.689
 August 

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:54.159
 go go the tickets hurry up 

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.449
 who said that 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:57.419
 quickly click away 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:58.280
 no matter 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.729
 now i knew i'm going to leave but 

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:03.419
 I do not have that to say and to do 

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:06.339
 so yesterday 

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:08.759
 kiel for six years 

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.620
 currently I have a little break
