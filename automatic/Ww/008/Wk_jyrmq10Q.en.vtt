00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.859
 hello everyone here we are again with 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.140
 new video on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.019
 teach them how to perform a hat response 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.300
 software set to your blackberry device 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.070
 in this case return it to its state of 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.589
 factory by this issue we have already done 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.689
 video but a long time ago but due to the 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.999
 comments we receive from several 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.820
 users who do not see the information or who 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.770
 the video is also made of bad 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.560
 quality is made with a camera 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.680
 little resolution and you do not see everything right by 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.390
 what in principle we advise that if 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.400
 they will perform what is the hard reset 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.170
 airsoft the reset or format the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.480
 Gift or repair device 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.160
 some mistakes you have to make a 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.530
 backup of all content 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.960
 through the software director manager 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.000
 because it's going to be erased with that process 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.010
 will erase all the content of your 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.050
 device so to perform the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.630
 hard reset is very easy simply we 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.970
 we put on the main screen we go to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.370
 go as you can see here options 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.950
 we enter the click options screen 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.860
 and I call here on the middle wheel we're going 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.260
 to go to what they are once and it looks better 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.750
 where it says here the options of 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.010
 security and where on the screen 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.350
 security options of the first 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.510
 option that appears says deleted from 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.760
 Safety remember that these options 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.200
 can change independence of what it is 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.500
 the system system version 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.210
 operative you have in your / device 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.890
 blackberry but in general they are all 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.290
 the only difference is that you can 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.479
 change what is the term of the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.000
 option so if we're already sure that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.970
 we want to erase what the device is 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.250
 formatting we're going to tell you ok to what 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.530
 is erased from security as they can 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.619
 appreciate here and here they put all the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.470
 options that if you want to erase you're going 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.080
 deleting you're throwing apps 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.350
 installed if you want to erase card 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.060
 also in this case remember that 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.920
 previously they must have made a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.080
 backup of what is photo or 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.280
 the multimedia files that you have in the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.150
 sd card and once this is done you have 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.280
 put what is the term blackberry in 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.890
 this text box to ensure that 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.560
 is doing it consciously or 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.290
 a person is doing it and I do not know 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.510
 that has been done by accident so you 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.790
 we breed what is the word blackberry 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.300
 here once typed what is the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.739
 Blackberry word we accept and deleting 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.410
 what is the information and once 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.600
 information is erased from the device 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.000
 it will restart and when it restarts 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.220
 you have to redo the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.400
 first configurations or 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.220
 basic configurations like the account 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.519
 email to reuse 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.510
 what is the desktop manager to be able 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.610
 retrieve what is the copy of the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.340
 content and not have to go back to 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.760
 download the applications from the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.239
 blackberry store again and thus save 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.519
 and also the multimedia content already 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.980
 be photos videos that I had in the 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.590
 sd card can recover it too 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.140
 by what is the disk 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.530
 or if not already once you do the deletion 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.360
 by formatting, if you are going to give it to 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 another person will no longer have that 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.760
 personal information that you had in what 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.250
 which is the device remember that the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.099
 erase time the time it takes 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.260
 in restarting the device depends on 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.849
 the amount of content you have in 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.790
 a device once and has deleted 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.709
 Remember also that you are going to restart 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.980
 as you can see here they are seeing what 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.880
 is the bar that indicates the course of 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.540
 the time it will take 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.220
 erase everything and restart as they can 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.040
 see here once it has already been done 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.290
 what is the deletion the device is 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.660
 restarting until the end of the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.020
 bar that indicates the course of 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.520
 restart is not going to restart at all and 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.290
 as you can see here on the screen already 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.290
 be the ring has restarted the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.670
 device we accept and this is all 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.680
 I hope you like this trial on 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.239
 everything that is useful to them and does not 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.470
