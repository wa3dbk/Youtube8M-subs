00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.830 
really need the spark shot right now
probably<00:05:22.430> not<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:23.150> don't<00:05:23.419> know<00:05:23.479> what<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.690> fuck

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
probably not I don't know what the fuck

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.100 
probably not I don't know what the fuck
it<00:05:23.900> even<00:05:24.169> does<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:25.300> don't<00:05:26.300> need<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.479> liner<00:05:26.720> the

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
it even does I don't need the liner the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.620 
it even does I don't need the liner the
key<00:05:27.800> i<00:05:27.830> don't<00:05:28.100> think<00:05:28.250> i<00:05:28.310> use<00:05:28.520> yet<00:05:28.850> you<00:05:29.360> know<00:05:29.479> I'm

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
key i don't think i use yet you know I'm

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.020 
key i don't think i use yet you know I'm
gonna<00:05:29.750> keep<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.080> key<00:05:30.229> on<00:05:30.259> me<00:05:30.650> as<00:05:30.919> a<00:05:31.250> precaution

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
gonna keep the key on me as a precaution

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.180 
gonna keep the key on me as a precaution
so<00:05:33.020> I<00:05:33.050> guess<00:05:33.229> that's<00:05:33.380> it<00:05:33.620> she<00:05:33.889> can't<00:05:34.039> gun

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
so I guess that's it she can't gun

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.980 
so I guess that's it she can't gun
bullets<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.639> acid<00:05:35.000> shots<00:05:35.240> until<00:05:35.570> I<00:05:35.750> run<00:05:35.930> out
