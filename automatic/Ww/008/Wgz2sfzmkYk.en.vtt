our<00:00:31.380> part<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.309> our<00:00:32.430> game<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.850> probably<00:00:33.750> been

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.130 

my<00:00:38.100> beckons<00:00:38.820> engineers<00:00:39.300> oh<00:00:39.629> okay

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I think this it's kind of are we

comfortable<00:00:43.070> now<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> business<00:00:44.519> in<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
comfortable now in the business in a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:58.930 
comfortable now in the business in a
marketing<00:00:45.329> there's<00:00:46.670> you<00:00:47.670> know

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.370 

these<00:00:59.120> are<00:00:59.329> my<00:00:59.450> Tigre<00:01:00.230> David<00:01:01.010> from<00:01:01.220> chronic<00:01:01.640> oh

okay

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.720 

so<00:01:07.780> it's<00:01:07.930> maybe<00:01:08.530> we're<00:01:08.980> talking<00:01:09.160> spear

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
so it's maybe we're talking spear

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.510 
so it's maybe we're talking spear
engineers<00:01:10.210> that's<00:01:10.510> really<00:01:10.810> that's<00:01:10.990> right<00:01:11.520> but

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
engineers that's really that's right but

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:28.060 
engineers that's really that's right but
we<00:01:15.960> trying<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.020> step<00:01:17.230> up<00:01:17.410> get<00:01:18.250> into<00:01:18.370> new<00:01:18.550> areas

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:41.810 

at<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.250> time<00:01:39.290> 47:31<00:01:40.290> chose<00:01:41.280> terms<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
at that time 47:31 chose terms of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.240 
at that time 47:31 chose terms of
departments

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.190 

that's<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.370> huge<00:01:47.580> Sun<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.690> probably<00:01:48.960> never

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's a huge Sun here I probably never

00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:00.310 
that's a huge Sun here I probably never
been<00:01:49.470> done<00:01:49.650> before<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:53.300> hang<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.480> in<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.810> world

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.390 

so<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.620> think<00:02:01.950> that's<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.670> our<00:02:02.910> sorry<00:02:04.400> I
