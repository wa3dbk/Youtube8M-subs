it for a second he said a nootropic I'd

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.820 
it for a second he said a nootropic I'd
like<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> cognitive<00:00:18.000> enhancer<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.600> said<00:00:19.080> okay

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830

then some six to eight months later we
had<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> sample<00:00:32.790> batch<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
had a sample batch of what was going to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.310 
had a sample batch of what was going to
be<00:00:34.769> alpha<00:00:34.980> brain<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.519> it's<00:00:36.120> been<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> really

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
be alpha brain and it's been a really

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
be alpha brain and it's been a really
wild<00:00:37.530> ride<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.129> an<00:00:38.219> interesting<00:00:38.699> story<00:00:38.999> since

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
wild ride and an interesting story since

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.239 
wild ride and an interesting story since
then<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.019> take<00:00:40.620> us<00:00:40.649> through<00:00:40.800> some<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> your

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249

then so take us through some of your
perspective<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.239> very<00:00:42.570> first<00:00:42.690> sample

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
perspective from that very first sample

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
perspective from that very first sample
of<00:00:43.440> alpha<00:00:43.739> brain<00:00:43.949> to<00:00:44.219> kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.999> now<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.359> it's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of alpha brain to kind of now what it's

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.849 
of alpha brain to kind of now what it's
become<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.019> how<00:00:46.109> it's<00:00:46.320> been<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.499> part<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.769> your

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
life well I got into nootropics because

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
life well I got into nootropics because
of<00:00:50.280> bill<00:00:50.579> Romanowski<00:00:50.899> formula<00:00:51.899> he<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.319> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of bill Romanowski formula he had a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.079 
of bill Romanowski formula he had a
thing<00:00:52.589> called<00:00:52.620> neuro<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> believe

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
thing called neuro one that I believe

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.880 
thing called neuro one that I believe
had<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> little<00:00:54.569> caffeine<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.409> well<00:00:55.589> and

had a little caffeine in it as well and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.799 
had a little caffeine in it as well and
he<00:00:56.640> had<00:00:56.730> developed<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.600> he<00:00:57.690> was

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
he had developed it because he was

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.329 
he had developed it because he was
having<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:58.170> problems<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.649> concussions

having some problems with concussions

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.389 
having some problems with concussions
and<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.420> tried<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.229> and<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.620> introduced<00:01:02.219> me<00:01:02.309> to

and I tried it and that introduced me to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.369 
and I tried it and that introduced me to
the<00:01:02.579> world<00:01:02.609> nootropics<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.050> started

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the world nootropics and then I started

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.310 
the world nootropics and then I started
dabbling<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.460> different

called Hooper's EO Sarada which is an

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.449 
called Hooper's EO Sarada which is an
acetylcholine<00:03:32.690> esterase<00:03:32.799> inhibitor<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.190> it

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
acetylcholine esterase inhibitor so it

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.979 
acetylcholine esterase inhibitor so it
prevents<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.120> breakdown<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.600> acetylcholine

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.530 
prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
it was naturally growing and of course

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.050 
it was naturally growing and of course
they<00:03:51.680> did<00:03:51.890> find<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.579> they<00:03:52.640> found<00:03:52.850> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
they did find that and they found the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.759 
they did find that and they found the
way<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.450> had<00:03:53.630> these<00:03:54.140> compounds

which actually helped give the brain the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.600 
which actually helped give the brain the
ability<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.930> have<00:04:00.230> more<00:04:00.560> ready<00:04:01.070> available

to focus the memory some of the things
you're<00:04:07.640> talking<00:04:07.790> about<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:08.570> one<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.720> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
interesting things that we didn't really

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.310 
interesting things that we didn't really
realize<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.850> it<00:04:11.180> affects<00:04:11.480> your<00:04:11.630> dreams<00:04:11.930> too

you<00:04:15.709> know<00:04:15.799> what<00:04:16.250> we<00:04:16.370> would<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:16.640> be<00:04:16.760> like<00:04:17.000> hey

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
you know what we would just be like hey

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.199 
you know what we would just be like hey
do<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:17.900> have<00:04:18.019> crazy<00:04:18.260> dreams<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:19.519> then<00:04:20.030> we

do you have crazy dreams and then we

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.909 
do you have crazy dreams and then we
started<00:04:20.600> looking<00:04:20.750> cuz<00:04:21.109> we<00:04:21.229> weren't<00:04:21.440> targeting

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
started looking cuz we weren't targeting

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.529 
started looking cuz we weren't targeting
dreams<00:04:22.220> no<00:04:22.700> but<00:04:22.910> it's<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.150> something<00:04:23.390> that

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
dreams no but it's just something that

dreams no but it's just something that
kind<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:23.870> came

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
kind of came

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.770 
kind of came
out<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.610> then<00:04:24.760> everybody<00:04:25.270> we<00:04:25.420> gave<00:04:25.570> it<00:04:25.690> to

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
out and then everybody we gave it to

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.950 
out and then everybody we gave it to
it's<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.040> my<00:04:27.040> dreams<00:04:27.430> are<00:04:27.820> insane<00:04:28.210> if<00:04:28.690> we

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
it's like my dreams are insane if we

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.140 
it's like my dreams are insane if we
sold<00:04:29.260> alpha<00:04:29.740> brain<00:04:29.950> not<00:04:30.280> as<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.520> cognitive

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
sold alpha brain not as a cognitive

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.230

they're like a child's bubble like when

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.430 
they're like a child's bubble like when
they<00:04:45.880> blow<00:04:46.090> bubbles<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:46.750> touch<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.140> bubble

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
they blow bubbles you touch the bubble

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.980 
they blow bubbles you touch the bubble
they<00:04:47.620> pop<00:04:47.860> instantly<00:04:48.460> but<00:04:49.180> this<00:04:49.390> one<00:04:49.600> was<00:04:49.810> made

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
they pop instantly but this one was made

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.980 
they pop instantly but this one was made
out<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.370> basketball<00:04:51.370> material<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.780> like

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
out of basketball material it's like

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.450

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
to try to learn how to lucid dream but

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.410 
to try to learn how to lucid dream but
taking<00:05:09.010> out<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.130> brain<00:05:09.490> I've<00:05:09.700> been<00:05:10.000> able<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.210> do

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
taking out a brain I've been able to do

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.960 
taking out a brain I've been able to do
it<00:05:10.570> just<00:05:10.780> on<00:05:11.020> an<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.770> natural<00:05:12.220> way<00:05:12.370> which<00:05:12.820> is

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
it just on an in a natural way which is

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.060 
it just on an in a natural way which is
kind<00:05:13.390> of<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.540> freak<00:05:13.750> out<00:05:13.930> yeah<00:05:14.590> it's<00:05:14.920> an

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
kind of a freak out yeah it's an

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.590 
kind of a freak out yeah it's an
interesting<00:05:15.280> phenomenon<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:16.090> what<00:05:16.300> we<00:05:16.419> found

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
interesting phenomenon and what we found

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.930 
interesting phenomenon and what we found
is<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:17.080> alpha<00:05:17.650> brain<00:05:17.860> which<00:05:18.070> helps<00:05:18.550> in<00:05:18.700> you

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
is that alpha brain which helps in you

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.250 
is that alpha brain which helps in you
know<00:05:19.030> nourish<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.630> body<00:05:19.660> is<00:05:19.930> acetylcholine

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
know nourish the body is acetylcholine

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.830 
know nourish the body is acetylcholine
by<00:05:20.950> providing<00:05:21.400> raw<00:05:21.760> alpha<00:05:22.270> cholesterol<00:05:22.630> frost

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
by providing raw alpha cholesterol frost

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.540 
by providing raw alpha cholesterol frost
for<00:05:23.050> choline<00:05:23.410> one<00:05:23.590> of<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.740> raw<00:05:23.890> nutrients<00:05:24.430> and

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
for choline one of the raw nutrients and

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.520 
for choline one of the raw nutrients and
the<00:05:25.030> acetylcholine<00:05:25.510> esterase<00:05:25.720> inhibitor<00:05:26.380> so

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor so

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.830 
the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor so
it's<00:05:26.650> getting<00:05:26.919> it<00:05:27.010> two<00:05:27.160> ways<00:05:27.370> by<00:05:28.330> having<00:05:28.720> more

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
it's getting it two ways by having more

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.540 
it's getting it two ways by having more
acetylcholine<00:05:29.470> acetylcholine<00:05:29.830> helps

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
acetylcholine acetylcholine helps

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.850 
acetylcholine acetylcholine helps
regulate<00:05:30.850> the<00:05:31.030> REM<00:05:31.540> state<00:05:31.840> in<00:05:31.990> your<00:05:32.140> sleep<00:05:32.380> so

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
regulate the REM state in your sleep so

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.740 
regulate the REM state in your sleep so
the<00:05:32.980> more<00:05:33.160> acetylcholine<00:05:33.700> you<00:05:33.940> have<00:05:34.150> the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
the more acetylcholine you have the

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.780 
the more acetylcholine you have the
deeper<00:05:35.140> and<00:05:35.320> broader<00:05:35.440> your<00:05:35.830> REM<00:05:36.220> State<00:05:36.580> is

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
deeper and broader your REM State is

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.090 
deeper and broader your REM State is
going<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.240> be<00:05:37.390> from<00:05:37.900> people<00:05:38.560> doing<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.830> latest

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
going to be from people doing the latest

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.570 
going to be from people doing the latest
research<00:05:39.250> in<00:05:39.640> the<00:05:40.390> dreamworld<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.580> what

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
research in the dreamworld and so what

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.640 
research in the dreamworld and so what
we<00:05:42.700> end<00:05:42.850> up<00:05:42.970> getting<00:05:43.030> is<00:05:43.540> exactly<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.350> this

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
we end up getting is exactly that this

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.460 
we end up getting is exactly that this
broader<00:05:45.070> tougher<00:05:45.880> more<00:05:46.479> like<00:05:46.900> you<00:05:47.080> said<00:05:47.290> like

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
broader tougher more like you said like

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.850 
broader tougher more like you said like

a basketball thick REM state which is a

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.320 
a basketball thick REM state which is a
state<00:05:51.010> in<00:05:51.250> which<00:05:51.340> you're<00:05:51.520> dreaming<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.030> it

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
state in which you're dreaming and it

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.270 
state in which you're dreaming and it
allows<00:05:52.570> you<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.900> really<00:05:53.080> play<00:05:53.410> around<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.950> do

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
allows you to really play around and do

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.710 
allows you to really play around and do
some<00:05:54.460> cool<00:05:54.640> stuff<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.090> there's<00:05:55.330> certainly

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
some cool stuff and there's certainly

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.440 
some cool stuff and there's certainly
benefit<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.560> having<00:05:56.830> a<00:05:57.280> deeper<00:05:57.760> REM<00:05:58.090> state

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
benefit to having a deeper REM state

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.510 
benefit to having a deeper REM state
there's<00:05:58.780> benefit<00:05:59.260> to<00:05:59.440> getting<00:05:59.680> deeper<00:06:00.310> more

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
there's benefit to getting deeper more

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.240 
there's benefit to getting deeper more
restful<00:06:01.000> sleep<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.570> I've<00:06:02.229> felt<00:06:02.620> that<00:06:02.860> as<00:06:03.040> well

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
restful sleep and I've felt that as well
