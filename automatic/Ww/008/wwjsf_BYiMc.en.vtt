-<00:02:07.899> if<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.110> think<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.679> military<00:02:09.830> preys

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
- if you think that the military preys

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.510

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
on the poor and the weak then you have

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.340 
on the poor and the weak then you have
to<00:02:13.640> think<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.970> you're<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:15.200> that's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
to think of you're the one that's

excluding them from Columbia University
I<00:02:17.810> think<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:18.110> can<00:02:18.260> all<00:02:18.350> agree<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:18.950> a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
I think we can all agree that this is a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.250 
I think we can all agree that this is a
very<00:02:19.340> expensive<00:02:19.819> place<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.060> go<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.569> when<00:02:21.140> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
very expensive place to go and when you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
very expensive place to go and when you
exclude<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.830> ROTC<00:02:22.430> from<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:23.120> area<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.390> are

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
exclude the ROTC from this area you are

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750 
exclude the ROTC from this area you are
forcing<00:02:23.989> them<00:02:24.080> into<00:02:24.410> those<00:02:24.500> poor<00:02:24.830> areas<00:02:25.220> so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
forcing them into those poor areas so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.370 
forcing them into those poor areas so
that<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.000> not<00:02:26.180> just<00:02:26.480> military's<00:02:26.930> fault<00:02:27.140> that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
that is not just military's fault that
