00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that was allowed by evasion so our

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.520 
that was allowed by evasion so our
advice<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.480> upgrade<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.230> iOS

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
advice to you is do not upgrade to iOS

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.280 
advice to you is do not upgrade to iOS
6.1<00:00:38.190> point<00:00:38.610> three<00:00:38.910> until<00:00:39.510> evasion<00:00:40.079> gets

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
6.1 point three until evasion gets

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.369

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the galaxy note 3 which actually is not

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.090 
the galaxy note 3 which actually is not
good<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.289> still<00:01:01.680> more<00:01:01.920> than

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
good because there are still more than

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.590

idea is that instead of having the whole

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
idea is that instead of having the whole
keyboard<00:01:42.630> block<00:01:43.110> half<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> display<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
keyboard block half the display you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.249 
keyboard block half the display you
would<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> bottom<00:01:45.990> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
would actually have it at the bottom of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.690 
would actually have it at the bottom of
your<00:01:46.290> display<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.009> actually<00:01:47.159> move<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
your display you can actually move it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.310 
your display you can actually move it
around<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.600> would<00:01:48.750> actually<00:01:48.899> just

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
around and it would actually just

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560 
around and it would actually just
scatter<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.310> keys<00:01:50.640> around<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.450> would

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
scatter all the keys around and it would

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.660 
scatter all the keys around and it would
still<00:01:51.869> continue<00:01:52.079> keeping<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.920> curity<00:01:53.280> layout

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
still continue keeping the curity layout

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.670 
still continue keeping the curity layout
meaning<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.390> will<00:01:54.570> still<00:01:54.840> predict<00:01:55.140> text<00:01:55.470> just

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
meaning it will still predict text just

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.959 
meaning it will still predict text just
like<00:01:55.799> pretty<00:01:55.979> much<00:01:56.159> any<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.490> curity

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
like pretty much any other curity

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.060 
like pretty much any other curity
keyboard<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.500> project<00:01:58.950> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
keyboard out there now the project is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
keyboard out there now the project is
still<00:01:59.310> not<00:01:59.579> even<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.909> beta<00:02:00.210> they're<00:02:00.420> still

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
still not even in beta they're still

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.480 
still not even in beta they're still
trying<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.930> gain<00:02:01.049> money<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.619> obviously<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
trying to gain money but obviously it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
trying to gain money but obviously it
bitch<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.909> wonder<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.780> need<00:02:04.229> a

bitch to wonder if we really need a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.050 
bitch to wonder if we really need a
