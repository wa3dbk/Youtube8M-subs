00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.029
 And do not cook us something delicious? 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.459
 Today I will make chocolate and nut paste. 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.729
 Sweet for kids and adults. 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:23.279
 We take hazelnuts (walnuts, earthy ones - some people like them). 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.060
 We will grind them. 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.180
 Turn on. 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.000
 We are closing. 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.969
 Grind very, very finely. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.080
 Probably everything. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.200
 It turns out such nut flour. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.420
 Now you need to pour it. 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.200
 And just grind the remaining nuts. 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.410
 Pour flour into a cold pan. 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.390
 For thickening. 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.020
 Cocoa powder. 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.130
 Sugar or fructose. 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 Stir. 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.330
 Egg. 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 We do not need a shell. 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.949
 Now you need a whisk. 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:19.700
 Add a little boiled, but cooled milk. 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.899
 Stir once again. 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:30.100
 It should be a homogeneous mass. Thick as sour cream. 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:44.939
 Or like melted chocolate. 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.899
 Mix all lumps. 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.949
 Add all the remaining milk. 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:03:00.019
 Milk use everything. 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.019
 Stir once again. 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.699
 Add the nuts. 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.919
 Grind. 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:27.419
 More nuts from the blender. 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.979
 Turn on the heat. 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.489
 Average. 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.139
 Quickly mix everything and bring to a boil. 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.179
 It should make a thick mass. The first bubbles should appear on it. 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.319
 While stirring, bring to a boil. 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.449
 Appear here such volcanic bubbles. 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.539
 Turning off the heat. 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:10.099
 Add the butter. 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.989
 A little vanilla. 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.709
 A little bit. 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.500
 All again mix. 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.270
 The oil melted. Basically, pasta is ready. 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.920
 You can cool and eat it. 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.710
 Little lumps of nuts remain. 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.169
 You can crush them and make them smaller. 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.999
 Take the blender. 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:49.309
 Multifunctional nozzle. 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:54.169
 We make a homogeneous, beautiful mass. 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:09.320
 That's enough. 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.620
 Take a beautiful jar. 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.360
 We shift our chocolate and nut paste into it. 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.629
 We transfuse. 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.430
 Leave the paste to cool. 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.830
 Although hot, it is very tasty. 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.400
 Enjoy your meal!
