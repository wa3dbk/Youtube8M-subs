priorities of riding to stay the same

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.400 
priorities of riding to stay the same
first<00:01:18.820> priorities<00:01:19.330> direction<00:01:19.810> second

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
priority speed then rhythm and balance

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.530 
priority speed then rhythm and balance
and<00:01:23.110> then<00:01:23.590> we<00:01:23.740> get<00:01:23.860> into<00:01:24.070> timing<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.180> now<00:01:25.360> we're

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
and then we get into timing so now we're

different speed she's going to come in
at<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.750> different<00:01:29.080> speed<00:01:29.230> and<00:01:29.290> see<00:01:29.650> if<00:01:29.710> she<00:01:29.830> can

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
at a different speed and see if she can

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.900 
at a different speed and see if she can
get<00:01:30.010> six<00:01:30.340> rides<00:01:30.580> one<00:01:30.940> two<00:01:31.330> three<00:01:31.810> four<00:01:32.290> five

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.370 
the yellow and see where you come out so
again<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.269> more<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.720> can<00:03:34.900> get<00:03:35.049> my<00:03:35.170> horse

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
again the more that I can get my horse

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.430 
again the more that I can get my horse
to<00:03:35.590> land<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.280> be<00:03:36.519> adjustable<00:03:37.030> all<00:03:37.600> jumping<00:03:38.260> is

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
to land and be adjustable all jumping is

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.370 
to land and be adjustable all jumping is
going<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.799> be<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.220> much<00:03:39.430> easier<00:03:40.110> when<00:03:41.110> you<00:03:41.230> have

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
going to be so much easier when you have

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.310 
going to be so much easier when you have
that<00:03:41.709> type<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.010> communication<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.200> we're

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
that type of communication so we're

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.420 
that type of communication so we're
going<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.500> come<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:45.570> jump<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.720> block<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:50.430> a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
going to come in jump the block and a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:00.610 
going to come in jump the block and a
circle

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.570 

and<00:04:01.620> jump<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.010> yellow<00:04:02.280> perfect<00:04:03.650> okay<00:04:04.650> so

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
and jump the yellow perfect okay so

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.880 
and jump the yellow perfect okay so
that's<00:04:05.790> again<00:04:06.210> a<00:04:06.240> great<00:04:06.630> way<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.870> start<00:04:07.380> turns

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
that's again a great way to start turns

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.040 
that's again a great way to start turns
so<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.910> next<00:04:09.090> time<00:04:09.330> what<00:04:09.630> we're<00:04:09.750> gonna<00:04:09.840> do

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
so the next time what we're gonna do

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.380 
so the next time what we're gonna do
jump<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.740> block<00:04:10.950> directly<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.180> yellow

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
jump the block directly to the yellow

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.720 
jump the block directly to the yellow
now<00:04:12.960> this<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.380> set<00:04:13.620> up<00:04:13.650> kind<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.130> on<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.310> bending

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
now this is set up kind of on a bending

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.849 
now this is set up kind of on a bending
line<00:04:14.910> at<00:04:15.180> 60<00:04:15.630> feet<00:04:15.870> which<00:04:16.260> would<00:04:16.380> be<00:04:16.500> normal

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
line at 60 feet which would be normal

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.099 
line at 60 feet which would be normal
for<00:04:16.890> strides<00:04:17.510> 12-foot<00:04:18.510> strides

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109

six foot for takeoff and landing that

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.010 
six foot for takeoff and landing that
ends<00:04:21.600> up<00:04:21.660> four<00:04:21.959> strides<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.850> direct<00:04:24.240> one<00:04:24.540> two

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
ends up four strides and direct one two

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.260 
ends up four strides and direct one two
three<00:04:25.710> four<00:04:26.450> perfect<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:29.250> exercise<00:04:29.910> on<00:04:30.150> our

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
three four perfect this exercise on our

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.970 
three four perfect this exercise on our
left<00:04:30.480> from<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> black<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.290> blue<00:04:31.590> is

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
left from the black to the blue is

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.470 
left from the black to the blue is
actually<00:04:32.430> set<00:04:32.640> up<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.820> little<00:04:32.970> bit<00:04:33.090> shorter

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
actually set up a little bit shorter

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.110 
actually set up a little bit shorter
it's<00:04:33.840> set<00:04:34.050> up<00:04:34.080> at<00:04:34.320> 45<00:04:34.860> feet<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:35.970> play

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
it's set up at 45 feet and you can play

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.180 
it's set up at 45 feet and you can play
a<00:04:36.150> game<00:04:36.240> with<00:04:36.720> Lauren<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.110> Danny<00:04:37.290> now<00:04:37.560> because

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
a game with Lauren and Danny now because

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.820 
a game with Lauren and Danny now because
maybe<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.610> could<00:04:38.880> do<00:04:39.030> these<00:04:39.180> two<00:04:39.480> fences<00:04:39.930> one<00:04:40.560> in

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
maybe I could do these two fences one in

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.590 
maybe I could do these two fences one in
four<00:04:41.070> strides<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.700> one<00:04:42.000> in<00:04:42.150> three<00:04:42.300> strides

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
four strides and one in three strides

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.750 
four strides and one in three strides
this<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.530> little<00:04:43.860> bit<00:04:43.980> more<00:04:44.190> advanced

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
this is a little bit more advanced

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.090 
this is a little bit more advanced
because<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:46.380> fences<00:04:46.740> are<00:04:46.890> closer

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
because it's the fences are closer

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.760 
because it's the fences are closer
together<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.790> wouldn't<00:04:48.270> start<00:04:48.630> here<00:04:49.050> but<00:04:49.560> this

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
together I wouldn't start here but this

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.530 
together I wouldn't start here but this
is<00:04:49.950> an<00:04:50.070> exercise<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.880> notice<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.210> we<00:04:51.330> didn't

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
is an exercise and notice that we didn't

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.120 
is an exercise and notice that we didn't
even<00:04:51.660> start<00:04:51.900> there<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:52.470> it's<00:04:52.620> an<00:04:52.710> exercise

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
even start there but it's an exercise

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.890 
even start there but it's an exercise
that<00:04:53.160> everybody<00:04:53.610> should<00:04:53.730> practice<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.690> come

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
that everybody should practice to come

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.970 
that everybody should practice to come
in<00:04:55.050> straight<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.880> hold<00:04:56.880> out<00:04:57.060> one<00:04:57.420> two<00:04:58.290> three

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
in straight and hold out one two three

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.740 
in straight and hold out one two three
four<00:05:00.290> come<00:05:01.290> around<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:03.060> next<00:05:03.210> time<00:05:03.450> let's

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
four come around and the next time let's

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.470 
four come around and the next time let's
do<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.169> three<00:05:04.760> Danny's<00:05:05.760> been<00:05:05.970> with<00:05:06.150> us<00:05:06.180> for

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
do it in three Danny's been with us for

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.030 
do it in three Danny's been with us for
a<00:05:06.510> while<00:05:06.600> Lauren's<00:05:07.080> been<00:05:07.290> with<00:05:07.410> us<00:05:07.440> while<00:05:07.770> she

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
a while Lauren's been with us while she

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.370 
a while Lauren's been with us while she
makes<00:05:08.190> this<00:05:08.340> look<00:05:08.580> easy<00:05:08.930> well<00:05:09.930> we<00:05:10.020> come<00:05:10.230> down

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
makes this look easy well we come down

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.810 
makes this look easy well we come down
here<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.650> do<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.830> in<00:05:11.040> three<00:05:11.250> which<00:05:11.430> is<00:05:11.460> pretty

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
here and do it in three which is pretty

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.710 
here and do it in three which is pretty
direct<00:05:13.190> one<00:05:14.190> two<00:05:14.820> three

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
direct one two three

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.210 
direct one two three
very<00:05:16.620> good<00:05:17.900> one<00:05:18.900> important<00:05:19.530> thing<00:05:19.590> through

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
very good one important thing through

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.430 
very good one important thing through
this<00:05:20.340> whole<00:05:20.580> type<00:05:20.790> of<00:05:20.970> exercises<00:05:21.690> is<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.080> the

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
this whole type of exercises is that the

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.350 
this whole type of exercises is that the
speed<00:05:22.710> stays<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.310> same<00:05:23.340> off<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:24.060> what<00:05:24.180> you

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
speed stays the same off of what you

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.330 
speed stays the same off of what you
have<00:05:24.510> dictated<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:25.410> when<00:05:25.590> you're<00:05:25.770> seven<00:05:26.250> or

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
have dictated so when you're seven or

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.430 
have dictated so when you're seven or
eight<00:05:26.430> strides<00:05:26.730> away<00:05:26.910> from<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.300> fence<00:05:27.540> we're

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
eight strides away from the fence we're

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.810 
eight strides away from the fence we're
kind<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.710> from<00:05:28.919> here<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.340> yellow<00:05:29.520> fence

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
kind of from here to the yellow fence

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.690 
kind of from here to the yellow fence
from<00:05:30.300> that<00:05:30.450> kind<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:30.780> distance<00:05:31.220> then<00:05:32.220> that's

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
from that kind of distance then that's

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.760 
from that kind of distance then that's
where<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.150> want<00:05:33.390> to<00:05:33.600> have<00:05:33.690> picked<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.470> speed

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
where you want to have picked the speed

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.159 
where you want to have picked the speed
that<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.250> want<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.520> do<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.760> exercise<00:05:36.210> if<00:05:36.960> you

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
that you want to do the exercise if you

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.990 
that you want to do the exercise if you
have<00:05:37.290> picked<00:05:37.530> that<00:05:37.620> speed<00:05:37.980> maintain<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.760> then
