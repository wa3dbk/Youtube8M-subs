all<00:00:00.089> right<00:00:00.210> here<00:00:01.110> we<00:00:01.140> have<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.680> circuit<00:00:02.280> bent

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
all right here we have a circuit bent

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.630 
all right here we have a circuit bent
toy<00:00:02.730> um<00:00:03.710> explain<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.830> controls<00:00:05.190> real<00:00:05.400> quick

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
toy um explain the controls real quick

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.200 
toy um explain the controls real quick
this<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.259> volume<00:00:07.259> knob<00:00:07.670> you<00:00:08.670> crank<00:00:09.000> it

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
this is a volume knob you crank it

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.660 
this is a volume knob you crank it
further<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.620> actually<00:00:10.740> does<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> nice<00:00:11.400> kind

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
further up it actually does a nice kind

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.780 
further up it actually does a nice kind
of<00:00:12.259> over<00:00:13.259> driven<00:00:13.590> distorted<00:00:14.190> kind<00:00:14.670> of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
of over driven distorted kind of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.210 
of over driven distorted kind of
slightly<00:00:14.969> distorted<00:00:15.450> sound<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
slightly distorted sound this is the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.910 
slightly distorted sound this is the
looping<00:00:17.609> switch<00:00:18.060> it'll<00:00:18.570> play<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.050> same<00:00:19.680> loop

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
looping switch it'll play the same loop

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.220 
looping switch it'll play the same loop
over<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.520> over<00:00:20.640> again<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.420> worry

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
over and over again so you do not worry

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.529 
over and over again so you do not worry
about<00:00:22.580> keep<00:00:23.580> hitting<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.970> button<00:00:24.180> every

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
about keep hitting this button every

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
about keep hitting this button every
time<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> loop<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> done<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.140> two-way

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
time the loop is done this is a two-way

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.970 
time the loop is done this is a two-way
toggle<00:00:29.550> switch<00:00:29.789> either<00:00:30.090> left<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.170> way

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
toggle switch either left or right way

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.729 
toggle switch either left or right way
and<00:00:33.500> these<00:00:34.500> control<00:00:36.320> whichever<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.649> have

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and these control whichever one you have

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.940 
and these control whichever one you have
it<00:00:37.860> set<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.489> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.940> uh<00:00:39.590> some<00:00:40.590> pretty

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it set on they do kind of uh some pretty

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.900 
it set on they do kind of uh some pretty
cool<00:00:41.160> modulated<00:00:41.910> kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> sounds<00:00:43.489> this<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
cool modulated kind of sounds this and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
cool modulated kind of sounds this and
this<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.890> some<00:00:46.890> kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.160> distorted<00:00:48.739> bit

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
this are some kind of distorted bit

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
this are some kind of distorted bit
reduction<00:00:50.250> sometimes<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> ring<00:00:51.510> ma<00:00:51.690> sort

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
reduction sometimes kind of ring ma sort

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
reduction sometimes kind of ring ma sort
of<00:00:52.350> sounds<00:00:53.010> depending<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of sounds depending on how you have the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.869 
of sounds depending on how you have the
settings<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.780> together<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.760> play

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
settings all together so it will play

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
settings all together so it will play
the<00:00:57.059> little<00:00:57.570> clean<00:00:57.989> first<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the little clean first and I'm going to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.200 
the little clean first and I'm going to
go<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:01.430> showing<00:01:02.430> kind<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
go into just showing kind of what the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:26.500 
go into just showing kind of what the
different<00:01:03.480> things<00:01:03.629> do

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.810 

okay<00:01:27.510> wait<00:01:27.920> one<00:01:28.920> more<00:01:29.070> thing<00:01:29.130> before<00:01:29.370> I<00:01:29.580> forget

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
okay wait one more thing before I forget

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.190 
okay wait one more thing before I forget
this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.030> straight<00:01:30.510> into<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> mixer<00:01:31.080> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
this is straight into a mixer and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.290 
this is straight into a mixer and
straight<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> PA<00:01:32.370> system<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.030> there's<00:01:33.180> no

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
straight into a PA system so there's no

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.990 
straight into a PA system so there's no
effects<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.810> anything<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.550> so<00:01:35.550> then<00:01:35.880> we're

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
effects or anything on it so then we're

00:01:36.000 --> 00:02:40.110 
effects or anything on it so then we're
going<00:01:36.120> to<00:01:36.180> loop<00:01:37.170> around

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:04:32.610 

Oh

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.650 

Oh
