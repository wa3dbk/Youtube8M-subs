00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone we meet for the 6th 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.299
 coop missions video 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.700
 how to recover the points of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.380
 synchronization that are hidden here on 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.570
 is in remission raids against 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.839
 Jacobins and the first point is 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.140
 near the start it is located on the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:24.900
 roof of the buildings of lola honda on 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.640
 then begins the building the simple ones to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.070
 operate if the one that includes a scale 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 have decency there is a second to take 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.309
 we learn it and near the bed is what 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.670
 recover normally there is an enemy 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.010
 who will wait for you I explain to you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.710
 why in two three seconds the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.570
 time to show you the next point 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:58.640
 the next point he's here we're going to do 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.660
 enter between shop and point 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.039
 so why are there no friends because 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.600
 that simply the mission for the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.580
 to lie to be able to recover the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.420
 last two points 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.770
 so I did run run killing 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.590
 all enemies 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.900
 renan we feel that the strong points 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 that I had finished the mission elsewhere 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.420
 you see well I'm on the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.570
 catacomb 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.939
 i finished the mission well i got 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.320
 preview that video take it or three times 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.140
 less time just under three 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.240
 times less time I said to myself 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 I gained a little more in age upload and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.070
 I can post my videos a little more 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.200
 quick 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.040
 and then those who want to watch the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.570
 just videos for my receives the points 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.220
 it's obvious that typing eight minutes of 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.500
 fight where I do not necessarily have much 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 in wax I you the rope 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.649
 so the second point it was easy to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:56.030
 recover 1 was in the window very 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.030
 near there we will be at the starting point 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.039
 at the starting point of the mission there 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.549
 had three enemies in the room where from 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.750
 second point then for both 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.580
 next low point 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.220
 suffered the mission simply 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.080
 because the mission consists of three 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.170
 steps 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.420
 first step kill the Jacobins for 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.420
 to access the underground second state 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.140
 kill all three sites in 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.240
 underground then 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.430
 me or act me I have so I have everything 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.170
 play and the last two points rather 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.880
 forgiveness and at the 1 which lies after the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.290
 first target is the second he gets 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.180
 located in the room where there are both 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.010
 last targets 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.840
 so we'll be in the room to open 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.590
 the first target is that here where he 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.000
 is the eighth so once past this 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.730
 room on access to two hours two 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.489
 points that are due to both to both 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.410
 skill points next so the 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:09.820
 first it is here we continue everything 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:14.350
 right after last year in the room the 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.360
 behind the weird headstone there 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.220
 they wear to crochet level 1 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.110
 I did not crochet to make a 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.989
 little landmark so here we go 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.180
 at the boss's hall do where there are the 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.680
 last two targets 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.870
 I call that the boss because it ends 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.220
 the mission makes it a fake that killing 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.000
 of targeted ground all the guys who 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.980
 the encircling that you protect no longer 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.730
 nothing to do you have to leave the teams 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.940
 so there the second the last point the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.970
 fourth point he is high he 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.320
 have to do some climbing then this 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.620
 what I did was called an ejection 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.320
 wall you have to press a while 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.970
 now the key to run and 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.269
 here are picked up in the points with 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.610
 most rarely but I hope this 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.459
 video will have pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.560
 let go of one as if you are disappointed 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.410
 who did the combat phases if you 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.959
 prefer like that loose 1 inch bleuse 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.700
 this video would have it and I tell you to 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.000
 a next thank you for keeping at 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.000
 meet again
