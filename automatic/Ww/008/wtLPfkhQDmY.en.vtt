00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
go here I'm going to go positive 48 and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
go here I'm going to go positive 48 and
you<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> 48<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.770> too

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you want to make it 48 so it's not too

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:35.810 
you want to make it 48 so it's not too
sensitive

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
sensitive

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.600 
sensitive
so<00:01:36.210> once<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.460> with

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
so once you do that you can do that with

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.359 
so once you do that you can do that with
this<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.270> also<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.159> one's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this one also but it's it but this one's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
this one also but it's it but this one's
for<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.970> downs<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:42.930> gonna

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
for the up and downs so you're gonna

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.289 
for the up and downs so you're gonna
make<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> negative<00:01:43.500> 48<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.850> y-axis<00:01:45.079> and

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
make it negative 48 on the y-axis and

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.499 
make it negative 48 on the y-axis and
positive<00:01:48.299> 48<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> other<00:01:49.740> axis<00:01:50.159> okay<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
positive 48 on the other axis okay so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.730 
positive 48 on the other axis okay so
once<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.500> full

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
once you have that then you have full
