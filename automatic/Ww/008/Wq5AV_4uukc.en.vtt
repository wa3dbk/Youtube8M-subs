00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
coming out in October I was actually

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.740 
coming out in October I was actually
surprised<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> budget<00:00:34.880> yeah<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.630> like

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
surprised at the budget yeah I was like

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
surprised at the budget yeah I was like
okay<00:00:36.989> maybe<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> fifty<00:00:37.710> sixty<00:00:38.040> million

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219

transforming into thousands of bats and
attacking<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> army<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> hundred

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
attacking the army but for a hundred

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
attacking the army but for a hundred
million<00:00:46.530> we're<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:47.039> expect<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.640> lot<00:00:47.850> more

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
really really bad guy and so they're

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
really really bad guy and so they're
definitely<00:01:28.920> taking<00:01:29.400> half<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.939> history<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
definitely taking half of history and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.179

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
making it that way which I think a lot

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.719 
making it that way which I think a lot
of<00:01:33.689> people<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> disappointed<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:34.829> but

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
of people will be disappointed about but

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
of people will be disappointed about but
it<00:01:35.970> does<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.540> cool<00:01:36.900> tone<00:01:37.110> I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it does have a really cool tone I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.899 
it does have a really cool tone I
actually<00:01:37.740> did<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
actually did not like that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
actually did not like that
turning<00:01:39.390> bat<00:01:39.570> fist<00:01:39.990> part<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.380> thought<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.650> was

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
turning bat fist part I thought it was

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.330

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
can't continue that conversation but I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.580 
can't continue that conversation but I
also<00:02:49.150> thought<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.450> was<00:02:49.540> weird<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:49.989> we<00:02:50.410> heard

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
also thought it was weird that we heard

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.770 
also thought it was weird that we heard
another<00:02:51.069> Aussie<00:02:51.640> abbie<00:02:52.150> cornish<00:02:52.269> was

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
another Aussie abbie cornish was

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.940 
another Aussie abbie cornish was
supposed<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:52.989> be<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.170> love<00:02:53.319> interest<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.799> it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
supposed to be the love interest in it

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.130 
supposed to be the love interest in it
and<00:02:54.190> she's<00:02:54.670> no<00:02:54.879> longer<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.510> maybe<00:02:55.660> it's

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
and she's no longer in it so maybe it's

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.080 
and she's no longer in it so maybe it's
just<00:02:56.319> an<00:02:56.620> Australian<00:02:57.099> thing<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.459> not<00:02:57.700> like
