00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
go through that as well and let's jump

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.929 
go through that as well and let's jump
into<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> game<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> choose

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
into the game so you get to choose

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.959 
into the game so you get to choose
between<00:01:18.299> any<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.079> these<00:01:19.229> levels<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
between any one of these levels and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.569 
between any one of these levels and
after<00:01:20.969> you<00:01:21.149> finish<00:01:21.990> five<00:01:22.259> wave<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.890> any<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.430> or

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
after you finish five wave in any one or

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.580 
after you finish five wave in any one or
the<00:01:23.670> level<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.240> next<00:01:24.539> level<00:01:24.869> gets<00:01:25.259> unlocked

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the level the next level gets unlocked

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.560 
the level the next level gets unlocked
and<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> let's<00:01:28.079> start<00:01:28.350> off<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.979> first<00:01:29.219> level

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
and so let's start off the first level

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.149 
and so let's start off the first level
which<00:01:30.570> should<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.810> fairly<00:01:30.960> easy<00:01:31.170> compared<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
which should be fairly easy compared to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.590 
which should be fairly easy compared to
the<00:01:32.250> later<00:01:32.430> ones<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.030> dual<00:01:36.270> stick

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the later ones so this is a dual stick

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.249 
the later ones so this is a dual stick
shooters<00:01:37.049> show<00:01:37.289> you<00:01:38.039> use<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> left<00:01:38.789> side<00:01:39.259> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
shooters show you use the left side to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.399 
shooters show you use the left side to
move<00:01:40.469> around<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.880> side<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.509> shoot

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
move around and the right side to shoot

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.060 
move around and the right side to shoot
in<00:01:43.619> different<00:01:43.950> directions<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:45.859> it<00:01:46.859> will<00:01:46.950> show

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
in different directions and it will show

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.480 
in different directions and it will show
you<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> small<00:01:47.490> arrow<00:01:47.729> were<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.210> bosses<00:01:48.450> off

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.719 

and<00:01:54.320> like<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.469> most<00:01:55.619> games<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.219> get<00:01:56.340> crates

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and like in most games you get crates

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.279 
and like in most games you get crates
that<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> break<00:01:57.420> open<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:57.990> power-ups

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
that you can break open to get power-ups

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.419 
that you can break open to get power-ups
to<00:02:03.259> choose<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.289> different<00:02:04.560> weapon<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.189> just

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
to choose a different weapon you just

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.559 
to choose a different weapon you just
choose<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.179> icon<00:02:06.600> from<00:02:06.990> top

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
choose the icon from top

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.209 
choose the icon from top
and<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:10.549> bombs<00:02:10.729> are<00:02:10.879> quite<00:02:11.090> good<00:02:11.269> because

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.219 
and the bombs are quite good because

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.339 
and the bombs are quite good because
that<00:02:13.219> will<00:02:13.430> just<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:14.299> know<00:02:14.450> attract<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
that will just you know attract the

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.670 
that will just you know attract the
aliens<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.769> go<00:02:15.920> towards<00:02:16.249> that<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.499> you<00:02:18.499> get

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
aliens to go towards that and you get

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.929 
aliens to go towards that and you get
extra<00:02:18.889> weapons<00:02:19.280> when<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.519> kill<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
extra weapons when you kill the

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:43.360 
extra weapons when you kill the
minibosses<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.409> levels<00:02:42.680> are<00:02:42.829> quite<00:02:42.950> huge

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
minibosses so the levels are quite huge

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.699 
minibosses so the levels are quite huge
show<00:02:43.609> you<00:02:43.669> can<00:02:44.239> move<00:02:44.480> around<00:02:44.599> quite<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.290> bit<00:02:45.379> and

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
show you can move around quite a bit and

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.039 
show you can move around quite a bit and
it's<00:02:46.699> always<00:02:46.879> handy<00:02:47.120> dream<00:02:47.419> about<00:02:47.540> what<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
it's always handy dream about what the

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:57.459 
it's always handy dream about what the
crates<00:02:48.349> will<00:02:48.590> spawn<00:02:48.919> so<00:02:49.189> these<00:02:49.370> pots<00:02:49.669> here<00:02:56.469> so

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
crates will spawn so these pots here so

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.520 
crates will spawn so these pots here so
in<00:02:57.769> level<00:02:58.069> five<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.639> will<00:02:58.760> get<00:02:59.060> a<00:03:00.049> bigger

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
in level five you will get a bigger

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:54.480 
in level five you will get a bigger
monster<00:03:00.859> that<00:03:01.159> comes<00:03:01.370> up

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.240 

so<00:03:55.490> once<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.150> beat<00:03:56.510> all<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.530> five<00:03:57.680> levels<00:03:58.100> you

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
so once you beat all the five levels you

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:08.910 
so once you beat all the five levels you
can<00:03:58.280> either<00:03:58.550> continue<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.270> game<00:03:59.480> or<00:04:00.460> restart

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.680 

so<00:04:09.920> one<00:04:10.100> different<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.550> five<00:04:10.730> levels<00:04:11.180> you

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
so one different is the five levels you

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.160 
so one different is the five levels you
can<00:04:11.720> either<00:04:12.020> continue<00:04:12.320> with<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.070> particular

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
can either continue with that particular

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.450 
can either continue with that particular
stage<00:04:15.170> or<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:15.770> go<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.100> next<00:04:16.280> stage

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:39.030 

and<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:24.020> get<00:04:24.170> extra<00:04:24.500> points<00:04:24.710> for<00:04:25.570> multi<00:04:26.570> kills

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.770 

and<00:04:40.040> you'll<00:04:40.970> also<00:04:41.120> see<00:04:41.390> that<00:04:41.420> there<00:04:41.750> are

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
and you'll also see that there are

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.300 
and you'll also see that there are
different<00:04:42.140> kind<00:04:42.320> of<00:04:42.380> monsters<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:42.920> come<00:04:43.100> up

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
different kind of monsters that come up

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.880 
different kind of monsters that come up
times

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.580 

and<00:04:52.890> you<00:04:53.340> get<00:04:53.490> different<00:04:53.640> weapons<00:04:54.180> like<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
and you get different weapons like the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:08.129 
and you get different weapons like the
rocket<00:04:55.890> launcher

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.920 

and<00:05:08.849> the<00:05:09.849> levels<00:05:10.120> are<00:05:10.270> quite<00:05:10.389> different<00:05:10.840> as

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
and the levels are quite different as

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.450 
and the levels are quite different as
well<00:05:11.110> so<00:05:11.289> you've<00:05:11.409> got<00:05:11.439> different<00:05:11.919> settings

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
well so you've got different settings

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.700 
well so you've got different settings
for<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.669> background<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.479> you<00:05:14.349> can<00:05:14.530> move

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
for the background and you can move

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.189 
for the background and you can move
around<00:05:14.800> in<00:05:15.129> different<00:05:15.219> ways<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.849> some<00:05:16.449> caves

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
around in different ways in some caves

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.080 
around in different ways in some caves
there<00:05:17.800> are<00:05:17.949> some<00:05:18.099> narrow<00:05:18.340> corridors<00:05:18.849> where

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
there are some narrow corridors where

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.869 
there are some narrow corridors where
you<00:05:19.210> can<00:05:20.249> plant<00:05:21.249> a<00:05:21.340> bomb<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:21.789> drop<00:05:22.509> the<00:05:22.840> aliens

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879 
you can plant a bomb and drop the aliens

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.820 
you can plant a bomb and drop the aliens
while<00:05:24.879> some<00:05:25.360> of<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.569> other<00:05:25.719> levels<00:05:26.110> it's<00:05:26.439> much

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
while some of the other levels it's much

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:35.250 
while some of the other levels it's much
more<00:05:27.009> open<00:05:27.069> space

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:47.790 

ah

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.679 

and<00:05:48.800> as<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.430> level<00:05:49.759> goes<00:05:49.909> by<00:05:50.120> you'll<00:05:50.330> see<00:05:50.509> that

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:50.689 
and as a level goes by you'll see that

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.619 
and as a level goes by you'll see that
more<00:05:50.930> aliens<00:05:51.550> will<00:05:52.550> come<00:05:52.580> in<00:05:52.939> each<00:05:53.059> round<00:05:53.300> and

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
more aliens will come in each round and

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.010 
more aliens will come in each round and
it<00:05:54.379> can<00:05:54.620> be<00:05:54.650> really<00:05:54.860> hard<00:05:55.279> as<00:05:55.490> well<00:05:55.839> so<00:05:56.839> for

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
it can be really hard as well so for

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.230 
it can be really hard as well so for
example<00:05:57.080> in<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:58.009> mothership<00:05:58.430> level<00:05:58.789> you'll

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
example in the mothership level you'll

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.489 
example in the mothership level you'll
see<00:05:59.419> that<00:05:59.569> there<00:05:59.809> are<00:05:59.839> insane<00:06:00.199> number<00:06:00.439> of

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:00.499 
see that there are insane number of

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.670 
see that there are insane number of
aliens<00:06:00.860> that<00:06:01.129> spawn<00:06:01.490> from<00:06:01.699> each<00:06:01.849> chip<00:06:02.089> and

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
aliens that spawn from each chip and

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:11.790 
aliens that spawn from each chip and
it's<00:06:03.680> really<00:06:04.099> hard<00:06:04.249> to<00:06:04.550> get<00:06:04.699> past<00:06:04.990> each<00:06:05.990> letter

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:07:46.559 

so<00:06:12.800> that<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:13.189> shotgun

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:46.569 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:48.629 

you
