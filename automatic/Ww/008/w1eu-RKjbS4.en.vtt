not<00:01:54.930> super<00:01:55.439> uncomfortable<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.850> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
not super uncomfortable but it that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.389 
not super uncomfortable but it that
dryness<00:01:57.899> could<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.409> uncomfortable<00:01:59.250> for

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
not patchy you may have to go over an

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.590 
not patchy you may have to go over an
area<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.290> more<00:03:23.010> than<00:03:23.130> once<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:24.360> not

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
area to more than once but it's not

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.449

unlike<00:03:24.780> any<00:03:25.170> other<00:03:25.410> lips<00:03:25.590> liquid<00:03:26.130> lipstick

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
unlike any other lips liquid lipstick

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.670 
unlike any other lips liquid lipstick
that<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.730> own<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.750> applicator<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.290> these<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
that I own the applicator on these is a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.770 
that I own the applicator on these is a
little<00:03:28.890> hard<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.640> think<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> works<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.510> our

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
little hard but I think it works in our

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.750 
little hard but I think it works in our
favorites<00:03:31.230> because<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.890> allows<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.519> trace

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
favorites because it allows you to trace

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.780 
favorites because it allows you to trace
your<00:03:32.940> lips<00:03:33.150> really<00:03:33.660> easily<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:35.340> don't<00:03:35.519> find

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
your lips really easily so I don't find

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.780 
your lips really easily so I don't find
the<00:03:35.940> applicator<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.510> be<00:03:36.630> an<00:03:36.750> issue<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the applicator to be an issue and the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.199 
the applicator to be an issue and the
drying<00:03:39.120> time<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:40.019> these<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.760> pretty<00:03:41.760> decent

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
drying time on these is pretty decent

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.940 
drying time on these is pretty decent
they<00:03:42.359> drop<00:03:42.660> down<00:03:42.900> pretty<00:03:43.200> fast<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.739> doesn't

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
they drop down pretty fast it doesn't

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.990 
they drop down pretty fast it doesn't
take<00:03:44.070> very<00:03:44.100> long<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:45.140> yeah<00:03:46.140> these<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:47.010> do<00:03:47.100> like<00:03:47.670> I

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
take very long so yeah these I do like I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.900 
take very long so yeah these I do like I
do<00:03:48.390> recommend<00:03:49.109> them<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.799> also<00:03:50.070> think<00:03:50.850> that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
do recommend them but I also think that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.750 
do recommend them but I also think that
you<00:03:51.150> should<00:03:51.299> look<00:03:51.390> at<00:03:51.540> other<00:03:51.720> reviews<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.760> see

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
you should look at other reviews and see

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.190 
you should look at other reviews and see
what<00:03:53.910> other<00:03:54.030> people<00:03:54.269> think<00:03:54.840> about<00:03:54.989> these

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
what other people think about these

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.840 
what other people think about these
because<00:03:55.739> some<00:03:55.769> people<00:03:56.160> like<00:03:56.190> them<00:03:56.519> some

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
because some people like them some

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.590 
because some people like them some
people<00:03:56.970> don't

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
people don't

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.910 
people don't
I<00:03:57.690> think<00:03:58.170> they<00:03:58.260> should<00:03:58.470> really<00:03:58.620> do<00:03:58.799> your

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
I think they should really do your

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.170 
I think they should really do your
research<00:03:58.980> before<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.609> decide<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.000> purchase

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
research before you decide to purchase

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.920 
research before you decide to purchase
these<00:04:00.739> yeah<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:03.090> guys<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.660> hope
