moving the pretty chapter a little bit
each<00:00:59.510> frame<00:01:00.050> this<00:01:00.920> took<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.309> long<00:01:01.640> time<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.329> was

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
each frame this took a long time and was

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.889 
each frame this took a long time and was
a<00:01:02.780> great<00:01:03.140> pain<00:01:03.379> in<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.649> arse<00:01:03.829> but<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.479> final

up<00:01:11.240> after<00:01:11.780> three<00:01:12.619> takes<00:01:13.030> two<00:01:14.030> hours<00:01:14.090> of

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
up after three takes two hours of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.540 
up after three takes two hours of
animating<00:01:15.350> for<00:01:16.040> five<00:01:16.759> seconds<00:01:17.509> of<00:01:17.630> movie

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
animating for five seconds of movie

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.020 
animating for five seconds of movie
after<00:01:19.550> animating<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.390> put<00:01:20.929> it<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.490> iStopMotion

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.290 

there<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.210> go<00:01:27.159> actually<00:01:28.159> I've<00:01:28.429> got<00:01:28.970> a

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
there we go actually I've got a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.760 
there we go actually I've got a
customized<00:01:30.020> Oh<00:01:32.740> customized<00:01:34.030> figure<00:01:35.030> here<00:01:35.450> and

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
customized Oh customized figure here and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.559 
customized Oh customized figure here and
so<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:37.159> it's<00:01:37.610> kind<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.240> highest

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
so it's it's kind of the highest

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.859 
so it's it's kind of the highest
resolution<00:01:39.819> that<00:01:40.819> I<00:01:40.880> know<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:42.340> um<00:01:43.690> yeah<00:01:44.690> I

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
resolution that I know of and um yeah I

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.309 
resolution that I know of and um yeah I
put<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:45.409> in<00:01:45.590> 20<00:01:46.069> frames<00:01:46.550> per<00:01:46.700> second<00:01:47.210> for<00:01:47.479> this

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
put it in 20 frames per second for this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.039 
put it in 20 frames per second for this
shot<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:50.509> just<00:01:51.079> create<00:01:51.829> but<00:01:52.790> first<00:01:53.299> let<00:01:54.020> me

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
shot and I just create but first let me

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.480 
shot and I just create but first let me
give<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.560> name<00:01:54.790> Fred<00:01:55.790> dick<00:01:56.950> there<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.130> go

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
give it a name Fred dick there we go

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:09.080 
give it a name Fred dick there we go
and<00:01:58.579> then<00:01:59.509> I'll<00:01:59.780> just<00:02:00.409> import<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:00.920> pictures

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.380 

and<00:02:10.090> bang<00:02:12.660> now<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.500> wait<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:15.390> few

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and bang now we just have to wait a few

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.130 
and bang now we just have to wait a few
moments<00:02:17.350> later<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.000> got<00:02:19.270> my<00:02:19.510> shot

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
moments later and then I got my shot

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.990 
moments later and then I got my shot
now<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.400> time<00:02:21.880> for<00:02:23.010> doing<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.370> chroma<00:02:24.819> key

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
now it's time for doing the chroma key

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.170 
now it's time for doing the chroma key
which<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.140> little<00:02:26.530> bit<00:02:26.709> complicated<00:02:27.180> but

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
which is a little bit complicated but

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.450 
which is a little bit complicated but
not<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.870> program<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.560> I'm<00:02:29.770> going<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.130> use

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
not in the program that I'm going to use

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.390 
not in the program that I'm going to use
I'm<00:02:33.460> using<00:02:33.910> motion<00:02:34.630> 5<00:02:34.930> its<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.830> Mac<00:02:36.100> only

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
I'm using motion 5 its a Mac only

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.920 
I'm using motion 5 its a Mac only
program<00:02:37.120> but<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.020> really<00:02:38.350> good<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:40.750> like

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
program but it's really good it's like

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.340 
program but it's really good it's like
After<00:02:41.770> Effects<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:43.180> at<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.510> much<00:02:44.050> cheaper

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
After Effects but at a much cheaper

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.080 
After Effects but at a much cheaper
price<00:02:46.410> here<00:02:47.410> I'm<00:02:47.650> adjusting<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.550> picture

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
price here I'm adjusting the picture

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.820 
price here I'm adjusting the picture
which<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> very<00:02:50.650> exciting<00:02:51.550> activity<00:02:52.800> then<00:02:53.800> I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
which is a very exciting activity then I

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.630 
which is a very exciting activity then I
find<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.700> keyer<00:02:55.380> aka<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.620> thingy<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.340> can

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
find the keyer aka the thingy that can

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.440 
find the keyer aka the thingy that can
chroma<00:02:58.150> key<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:59.370> apply<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.880> picture<00:03:02.280> yes

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
chroma key and apply to the picture yes

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.440 
chroma key and apply to the picture yes
the<00:03:04.450> key<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:04.990> automatically<00:03:05.950> set<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.670> key<00:03:07.180> out

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the key is automatically set to key out

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.510 
the key is automatically set to key out
green<00:03:07.900> stuff<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:10.410> found<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.500> little<00:03:11.710> spot<00:03:12.010> here

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
green stuff I found a little spot here

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.830 
green stuff I found a little spot here
that<00:03:12.760> has<00:03:13.360> been<00:03:14.220> keyed<00:03:15.220> out<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:16.270> don't<00:03:16.330> want

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
that has been keyed out and I don't want

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.230 
that has been keyed out and I don't want
that<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.950> I'll<00:03:18.340> adjust<00:03:19.030> lit<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:20.940> what<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.090> it

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
that so I'll adjust lit in what is it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.660 
that so I'll adjust lit in what is it
called<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:24.480> key<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:26.040> inspector<00:03:27.040> maybe<00:03:27.370> I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
called the key you inspector maybe I

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.460 
called the key you inspector maybe I
don't<00:03:27.880> know<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:28.480> it's<00:03:28.750> there<00:03:29.140> where<00:03:29.440> I

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
don't know but it's there where I

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.850 
don't know but it's there where I
control<00:03:30.160> all<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:31.390> things<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.900> are<00:03:32.290> part<00:03:32.710> of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
control all the things that are part of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.720 
control all the things that are part of
the<00:03:33.010> keyer<00:03:34.830> then<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:35.950> had<00:03:36.130> some<00:03:36.370> color

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
the keyer then I had some color

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.710 
the keyer then I had some color
adjustments<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.780> some<00:03:38.440> effects<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.730> bang
