00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
always face a tree image like that so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.479 
always face a tree image like that so
it's<00:02:59.840> pointing<00:03:00.440> inside<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.070> painting

doing then we get the sticky game and
you<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.430> scrape<00:03:22.850> something<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.570> that<00:03:23.780> break

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
you can scrape something like that break

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.710 
you can scrape something like that break
up<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.920> edges<00:03:25.220> with<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.579> just<00:03:26.180> grate<00:03:26.390> them<00:03:26.540> in

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
up the edges with it just grate them in

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.760 
up the edges with it just grate them in
like<00:03:26.900> that

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
like that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.410 
like that
they're<00:03:28.770> all<00:03:28.950> sticks<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.640> twigs<00:03:29.820> alors<00:03:30.270> be

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
they're all sticks and twigs alors be

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.150 
they're all sticks and twigs alors be
sticks<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.900> twigs<00:03:30.960> they<00:03:31.290> were<00:03:31.470> everywhere

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
sticks and twigs they were everywhere

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.730 
sticks and twigs they were everywhere
I'll<00:03:32.280> do<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:34.080> when<00:03:34.230> you're<00:03:34.380> looking<00:03:34.590> at

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
I'll do that so when you're looking at

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.320 
I'll do that so when you're looking at
painting<00:03:35.190> face<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:35.910> get<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.150> more

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
painting face on you can get it more

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:52.400 
painting face on you can get it more
right<00:03:46.100> make<00:03:47.100> sure<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:51.600> say<00:03:52.110> looks<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.380> bit

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
right make sure you just say looks a bit

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.160 
right make sure you just say looks a bit
too<00:03:52.770> realistic<00:03:53.520> what<00:03:53.670> we're<00:03:53.820> doing<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.840> then

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
too realistic what we're doing and then

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.810 
too realistic what we're doing and then
when<00:03:55.320> you've<00:03:55.470> done<00:03:55.500> your<00:03:55.650> stratum<00:03:56.250> expecting

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
when you've done your stratum expecting

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:13.490 
when you've done your stratum expecting
and<00:03:56.910> scratching<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:12.030> idea<00:04:12.450> is<00:04:12.660> when<00:04:13.320> that

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
and scratching the idea is when that

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.580 
and scratching the idea is when that
dries<00:04:13.830> now<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.580> see<00:04:14.820> all<00:04:15.000> these<00:04:15.440> well<00:04:16.440> these

then<00:04:54.540> I'll<00:04:55.169> put<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> tree<00:04:55.770> now<00:04:56.760> we<00:04:57.030> won't<00:04:57.150> see

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
then I'll put a tree now we won't see

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.830 
then I'll put a tree now we won't see
the<00:04:57.570> dark<00:04:58.130> scratches<00:04:59.390> and<00:05:00.390> that's<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.690> good

time<00:05:20.490> it's<00:05:20.729> got<00:05:20.850> to<00:05:20.910> be<00:05:21.000> wet<00:05:21.240> though<00:05:21.419> why<00:05:21.630> you

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
time it's got to be wet though why you

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.860 
time it's got to be wet though why you
do<00:05:21.930> this<00:05:22.140> if<00:05:22.919> it's<00:05:23.490> dry<00:05:23.790> it<00:05:24.150> won't<00:05:24.360> happen<00:05:24.570> so

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
do this if it's dry it won't happen so

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.780 
do this if it's dry it won't happen so
good<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.710> might<00:05:25.919> come<00:05:26.100> in<00:05:26.130> a<00:05:26.250> little<00:05:26.370> bit<00:05:26.550> but

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
good it might come in a little bit but

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.070 
good it might come in a little bit but
not<00:05:26.910> so<00:05:26.970> good<00:05:27.470> so<00:05:28.470> I<00:05:29.330> made<00:05:30.330> that's<00:05:30.479> dry<00:05:30.810> there

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
not so good so I made that's dry there
