00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:19.100
 Let's investigate the material wood metal plastic familiar to us 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:19.100
 Easy processing is likely to wood to come is the material that has been used for a long time whether or not there is we humans 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.740
 In order to understand the features of wood, you first need to know its structure 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:38.050
 When I expanded it with a microscope, the inside of my side was a path such as water 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:44.550
 Many tubular fibers line up 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 Does not deform even put the weight and put the had in this direction 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.980
 If you put the same board in this direction 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.210
 Will be 1 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:03.150
 this 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:08.130
 The second half made the title thin and cut the board and apply the adhesive 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:12.020
 We make direction of fiber pile up alternately in length and width 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 In any direction 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:21.549
 Iron ore in a huge furnace is melted at high temperature 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.549
 Become a trap of the state of muddy 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:39.549
 Through a process of several that we moved this to yet another road and then to steel the removal of the impurities 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.549
 Let's apply the force to this metal from the opposite direction 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.700
 The bent part did not return and the different part was bent 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.460
 The part that has been deformed once is changing its structure and becoming hard 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:04.799
 We press people with strong force and form thin metal plate 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 It can be transformed because it has a feature 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:14.440
 The strength of the part that was checked by the work hardening will increase 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:19.900
 Plastic products are now essential to life 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:24.780
 The type of plastic also increased countless 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.780
 This is a plastic processing plant 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.740
 Plastics made at petrochemical plants are 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.740
 It is carried in the form of rice grain called ferret 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:43.250
 The product is made one after another by pouring it into the mold with heat . 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.170
 This is often used for plastic products 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.580
 In the processing method of injection molding 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.030
 Can produce a large number of products of the same quality 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.400
 Hmm 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.900
 Process plastic in small steps 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.900
 Make a lump 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 This is put into the coke oven and reused as a scientific raw material for producing iron 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.580
 It is a method called chemical recycling 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:30.060
 These technologies are responsible for the future of plastics, which calls for the creation of a sustainable society 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.060
 It may be said that
