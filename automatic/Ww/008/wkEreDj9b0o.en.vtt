00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.370
 review of the phone samsung galaxy star 

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:14.400
 2 + and so in general it is certainly not the most 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.209
 expensive and top phone model from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.060
 samsung 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.519
 but not the cheapest one either 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.019
 such a middle class in a class of phones 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.359
 samsung is of course you not iphone 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.570
 which is still the iphone 3g to 100 and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 there still samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.400
 it so randomly said in general just 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.490
 inexpensive so far though old 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.470
 model in general execute and so this 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:44.400
 Duplex phone supports 2 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:46.020
 Sims and of course he was already hidden in 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.330
 the store in general was hidden there 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.090
 film me and so on in general how would 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.920
 he is considered new 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.360
 let's spend unboxing here nice 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.070
 the camera will now say how many megapixels 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.289
 4 it is written that in total 2 sim cards and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.119
 so far nothing is written here 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.700
 generally android vsky phone let's 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.649
 We proceed to the NBA Ksenia generally well, as 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.530
 anboxing you said so anboxing on 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:18.570
 in fact, it's just a watch phone so 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:24.170
 so phone while in the direction here you see 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.170
 so that it is suitable as the white Eunice 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.530
 how would a peasant suit a man and a woman 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.719
 ufa but here you know such coverage 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.719
 you know well, how do you know this 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.729
 little ball shaving it nice but 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:44.909
 only pleasantly here like 100 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:48.990
 flash camera speaker in general and 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:54.149
 samsung duos logo written samsung 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.670
 also, in general, nothing like that 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.560
 postpone his side and see that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 us in a box well in a box 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.179
 standard set 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 here is a film that is generally 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.979
 belonged to our phone here 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.649
 samsung galaxy star two and so on 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.180
 bluetooth wi-fi 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.780
 so we will analyze later but we will not 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.349
 glue so it is there guaranteed people gave 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.500
 he wanted parties here here is charging 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.090
 so in general, the roll-up is here 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.000
 such a plug to charge the phone 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.329
 that is, of course, and if it were yuzbi 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.250
 it would have been much steeper well, that could 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.769
 connect it to the computer to charge it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.170
 Yes, that is, we do not know, in principle 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.090
 from which phone to pick up but already 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.690
 if this part is not detached 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.269
 from here yes that is it is very bad so well 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.030
 headphones I will tell you not the most such 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.859
 professional not very cool 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.859
 standard headphones are these here 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.730
 Headphones are not comfortable at all. 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:58.129
 the spirit is difficult to somehow sit hurt too 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.439
 and this well, in general, too white headphones 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.989
 charging for some reason black in general 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:06.670
 box we don't need more when 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:11.200
 nothing is put so well in general phone 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.669
 so well the phone in general is how much 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.359

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.419
 just technical specifications just 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.209

 common single core processor central 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.359

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.479
 the amount of memory this standard memory 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.419

 well probably 100 grams is a burrow 100 grams 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.780
 he is not so heavy in general 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.870

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.680
 phone here so here 10 millimeters you 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.810
 Think about it 10 I do not know well, before something 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.430

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.040
 be but now 10 millimeters to well 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.460
 Of course there is a thinner phone but in general 10 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.590
 millimeters phone is generally excellent 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:19.780

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.360
 can you tell by this phone in 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.570
 Generally battery up to five hours can 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.880
 Well that's charged anyone interested can 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.840
 read it all on the site in general 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:40.810
 The main thing is to find that phone samsung galaxy 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:42.690
 and read it all on the site so what 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.550
 I can also say therefore 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:50.640
 phone so well of course wi fi 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:56.170
 he is available you are watching my 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.570
 now is the time to here here but wai 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.030
 fi here everything is in general already 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.250
 Connected i.e. Wi-Fi is catching but 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:08.680
 if you understand that this is up to 800 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.720
 dgb account so i don't understand at all 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.520
 This is like a new file in general. 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.100
 catches i'm in another room and 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.140
 Wi-Fi in general, then the whole is not all here 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.240
 half here is the same here version of usb 2 0 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.370
 Wi-Fi and by the way synchronization father is 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.090
 This program Kies in general, then it is like 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.920
 would be able to download music through it 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.500
 so on then there is some such 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.820
 Of course, the program is inconvenient but still 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.130
 and so you can connect through 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:42.340
 program not yet download 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:45.910
 35 mm headphone jack 840 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.710
