shortage of this quality willow there

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.520 
shortage of this quality willow there
really<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.669> and<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.150> problem<00:03:28.389> in<00:03:29.319> the

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
really is and it's a problem in the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.770 
really is and it's a problem in the
industry<00:03:30.000> hopefully<00:03:31.000> someone<00:03:31.450> will<00:03:31.480> sort

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
industry hopefully someone will sort

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.869 
industry hopefully someone will sort
itself<00:03:32.049> out<00:03:32.319> but<00:03:32.590> there's<00:03:32.950> only<00:03:33.099> only<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:33.790> many

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
itself out but there's only only so many

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.729 
itself out but there's only only so many
of<00:03:33.970> these<00:03:34.060> clefts<00:03:34.540> around<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.079> they're<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.620> in

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
of these clefts around and they're so in

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.280 
of these clefts around and they're so in
demand<00:03:36.129> and<00:03:36.489> usually<00:03:37.480> obviously<00:03:38.079> if<00:03:38.139> they've

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
demand and usually obviously if they've

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.229 
demand and usually obviously if they've
got<00:03:38.410> more<00:03:38.530> grains<00:03:38.859> it's<00:03:39.129> older<00:03:39.609> willow<00:03:40.090> as

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
got more grains it's older willow as

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.140 
got more grains it's older willow as
well<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:41.799> just<00:03:41.919> harder<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.310> source<00:03:42.730> um

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
well so it's just harder to source um

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.539 
well so it's just harder to source um
