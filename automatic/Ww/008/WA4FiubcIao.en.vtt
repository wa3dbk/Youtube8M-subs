00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
video when I toured the ship the reason

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.250 
video when I toured the ship the reason

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.290 
that I've never cruised on one of these
lines<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:26.099> they're<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.519> relation<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
lines is because they're in relation to

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
Hamburg one of them is sort of like a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.870 
Hamburg one of them is sort of like a
temporary<00:01:22.600> kind<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.619> structure<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.700> that's

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
temporary kind of structure and that's

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.370 
temporary kind of structure and that's
the<00:01:25.030> one<00:01:25.150> that's<00:01:25.270> much<00:01:25.479> closer<00:01:25.810> that's<00:01:26.200> where

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
the one that's much closer that's where

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.230 
the one that's much closer that's where
we<00:01:26.500> got<00:01:26.650> on<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.160> legend<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.700> Seas<00:01:27.910> and

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
we got on the legend of the Seas and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.499 
we got on the legend of the Seas and
then<00:01:28.990> there's<00:01:29.170> another<00:01:29.290> one<00:01:29.500> which<00:01:29.890> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
then there's another one which is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.190 
then there's another one which is
fancy-schmancy<00:01:31.509> but<00:01:31.690> that's<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.900> little<00:01:32.050> bit

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
fancy-schmancy but that's a little bit

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.050 
fancy-schmancy but that's a little bit
further<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.220> thing<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.580> makes<00:01:33.820> it

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
further and the thing that makes it

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.330 
further and the thing that makes it
weird<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.660> it's<00:01:34.930> exactly<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.680> same<00:01:35.860> way<00:01:36.130> that

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
weird is it's exactly the same way that

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.640 
weird is it's exactly the same way that
I<00:01:36.400> take<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.880> work<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.420> get<00:01:37.600> there<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.110> it<00:01:38.350> seems

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
I take to work to get there so it seems

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.249 
I take to work to get there so it seems
weird<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.100> be<00:01:39.280> on<00:01:39.820> my<00:01:40.090> way<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.330> work<00:01:40.690> but<00:01:40.900> on<00:01:41.080> my

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
weird to be on my way to work but on my

00:01:41.259 --> 00:02:17.839 
weird to be on my way to work but on my
way<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.470> vacation

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849

tradition<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.049> started<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.530> The<00:02:43.709> Legend

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
tradition that I started on The Legend

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.949 
tradition that I started on The Legend
of<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.220> Seas<00:02:44.549> one<00:02:45.120> thing<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.690> noticed

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
of the Seas one thing I have noticed

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.160 
of the Seas one thing I have noticed
already<00:02:46.349> is<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.129> compared<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.879> like<00:02:48.540> Royal

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
already is that compared to like Royal

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.229 
already is that compared to like Royal
Caribbean<00:02:49.680> or<00:02:49.920> Norwegian<00:02:50.459> cruise<00:02:50.640> lines<00:02:50.760> that

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
Caribbean or Norwegian cruise lines that

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.440 
Caribbean or Norwegian cruise lines that
sail<00:02:51.599> away<00:02:51.780> there's<00:02:52.410> no<00:02:52.739> live<00:02:53.400> music<00:02:54.030> anywhere

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
sail away there's no live music anywhere

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.820 
sail away there's no live music anywhere
I<00:02:54.480> don't<00:02:55.049> think<00:02:55.349> on<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> pool<00:02:55.799> deck

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
I don't think on the pool deck

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.400 
I don't think on the pool deck
definitely<00:02:56.579> not<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.269> centrum<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.200> feel

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
definitely not in the centrum and I feel

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.199 
definitely not in the centrum and I feel
like<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:58.890> other<00:02:59.220> lines<00:02:59.489> there's<00:02:59.730> always

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
like on the other lines there's always

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.440 
like on the other lines there's always
like<00:03:00.870> always<00:03:01.049> live<00:03:01.980> music<00:03:02.489> someplace<00:03:03.180> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
like always live music someplace and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.850 
like always live music someplace and
maybe<00:03:03.750> there<00:03:03.959> isn't<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.290> just<00:03:04.470> didn't<00:03:04.709> see<00:03:04.829> it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
maybe there isn't we just didn't see it

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.819 
maybe there isn't we just didn't see it
yet<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.340> also<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.390> at<00:03:06.930> least<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.739> the
