uncoolest ravine you are trying to keep

uncoolest ravine you are trying to keep
that<00:04:08.829> hidden<00:04:09.160> but<00:04:10.000> Huck<00:04:10.569> already<00:04:11.109> knowing

that hidden but Huck already knowing

that hidden but Huck already knowing
that<00:04:11.590> that's<00:04:11.709> up<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.190> field<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.669> can<00:04:12.790> see

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
that that's up on the field you can see

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.300 
that that's up on the field you can see
him<00:04:13.120> adding<00:04:13.449> two<00:04:13.660> more<00:04:13.690> gateways<00:04:14.129> he's<00:04:15.129> going

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
him adding two more gateways he's going

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.500 
him adding two more gateways he's going
to<00:04:15.370> be<00:04:15.430> able<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.639> put<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.819> lot<00:04:16.000> of<00:04:16.030> pressure<00:04:16.359> on

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
to be able to put a lot of pressure on

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.810 
to be able to put a lot of pressure on
that<00:04:16.690> by<00:04:17.440> making<00:04:17.650> stall<00:04:18.099> life<00:04:18.220> have<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.549> defend

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
that by making stall life have to defend

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.789 
that by making stall life have to defend
two<00:04:19.150> different<00:04:19.479> places<00:04:19.690> that<00:04:20.049> are<00:04:20.139> very<00:04:20.440> very

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
two different places that are very very

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.920 
two different places that are very very
far<00:04:21.070> apart<00:04:21.190> on<00:04:21.489> this<00:04:21.579> map<00:04:21.789> yeah<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.810> was<00:04:22.900> very

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
far apart on this map yeah that was very

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.540 
far apart on this map yeah that was very
unfortunate<00:04:23.620> for<00:04:23.949> style<00:04:24.130> life<00:04:24.250> but<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.460> were

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
unfortunate for style life but you were

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.920 
unfortunate for style life but you were
talking<00:04:24.880> about<00:04:24.940> cheese<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.630> how<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.810> all

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
talking about cheese and how it all

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.360 
talking about cheese and how it all
hinges<00:04:26.169> on<00:04:26.320> whether<00:04:26.620> or<00:04:26.710> not<00:04:26.770> scouted<00:04:27.310> and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
hinges on whether or not scouted and

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.339 
hinges on whether or not scouted and
that<00:04:27.490> just<00:04:27.729> goes<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.909> show<00:04:28.060> how<00:04:28.750> life<00:04:28.930> taking<00:04:29.260> a

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
that just goes to show how life taking a

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:29.959 
that just goes to show how life taking a
very

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969 
very

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.449 
very
he<00:04:30.089> move<00:04:30.269> and<00:04:30.509> it<00:04:30.599> was<00:04:30.929> scouted<00:04:31.499> so<00:04:31.919> great<00:04:32.279> play

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:32.459 
he move and it was scouted so great play

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:33.589 
he move and it was scouted so great play
by<00:04:32.610> hawk<00:04:32.759> they're<00:04:32.909> anticipating<00:04:33.119> you<00:04:33.479> see

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
by hawk they're anticipating you see

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.549 
by hawk they're anticipating you see
already<00:04:33.779> that<00:04:34.019> attack<00:04:34.949> is<00:04:35.189> on<00:04:35.339> the<00:04:35.459> way<00:04:36.559> yeah

00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:37.559 
already that attack is on the way yeah

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.739 
already that attack is on the way yeah
so<00:04:37.979> he's<00:04:38.489> going<00:04:38.639> to<00:04:38.729> be<00:04:38.819> able<00:04:38.909> to<00:04:39.059> force<00:04:39.360> a

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 
so he's going to be able to force a

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:41.749 
so he's going to be able to force a
cancel<00:04:40.319> on<00:04:40.409> this<00:04:40.529> command<00:04:40.829> center<00:04:41.129> by<00:04:41.309> killing

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
cancel on this command center by killing

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.209 
cancel on this command center by killing
this<00:04:41.879> SCV<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.719> once<00:04:43.319> that's<00:04:43.499> down<00:04:43.829> there's

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
this SCV and once that's down there's

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.129 
this SCV and once that's down there's
just<00:04:44.849> no<00:04:44.999> real<00:04:45.269> way<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:45.539> can<00:04:45.779> get<00:04:45.869> enough

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
just no real way you can get enough

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.129 
just no real way you can get enough
units<00:04:46.409> over<00:04:46.679> here<00:04:46.860> fast<00:04:47.249> enough<00:04:47.779> to<00:04:48.779> keep<00:04:48.929> up

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
units over here fast enough to keep up

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.289 
units over here fast enough to keep up
from<00:04:49.499> carrying<00:04:49.799> this<00:04:49.949> down<00:04:50.189> with<00:04:50.519> some

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:51.299 
from carrying this down with some

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:53.539 
from carrying this down with some
reinforcements<00:04:52.139> so<00:04:52.709> we<00:04:52.799> should<00:04:52.979> see<00:04:53.219> him<00:04:53.369> just

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:53.549 
reinforcements so we should see him just

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:55.729 
reinforcements so we should see him just
let<00:04:53.759> Hawk<00:04:53.999> pick<00:04:54.749> away<00:04:54.959> at<00:04:54.989> that<00:04:55.229> for<00:04:55.529> a<00:04:55.589> little

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:55.739 
let Hawk pick away at that for a little

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:57.829 
let Hawk pick away at that for a little
bit<00:04:55.919> longer<00:04:56.159> just<00:04:56.579> to<00:04:56.729> buy<00:04:56.969> some<00:04:57.269> time<00:04:57.539> which

00:04:57.829 --> 00:04:57.839 
bit longer just to buy some time which

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.229 
bit longer just to buy some time which
is<00:04:57.869> a<00:04:58.049> good<00:04:58.319> move<00:04:58.589> rather<00:04:59.369> than<00:04:59.579> canceling<00:05:00.149> it

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:00.239 
is a good move rather than canceling it

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.199 
is a good move rather than canceling it
immediately<00:05:01.369> because<00:05:02.369> Huck<00:05:02.579> spending<00:05:03.089> this

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:03.209 
immediately because Huck spending this

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:05.719 
immediately because Huck spending this
time<00:05:03.319> chipping<00:05:04.319> away<00:05:04.559> at<00:05:04.679> it<00:05:04.769> very<00:05:04.949> slowly<00:05:05.339> and

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
time chipping away at it very slowly and

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.819 
time chipping away at it very slowly and
then<00:05:06.329> once<00:05:06.539> it<00:05:06.659> starts<00:05:06.899> to<00:05:06.989> get<00:05:07.079> low<00:05:07.349> he<00:05:07.679> will

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:07.829 
then once it starts to get low he will

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:10.039 
then once it starts to get low he will
cancel<00:05:08.129> it<00:05:08.459> if<00:05:08.699> you<00:05:09.209> look<00:05:09.360> back<00:05:09.509> into<00:05:09.719> his<00:05:09.839> base

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:10.049 
cancel it if you look back into his base

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:11.959 
cancel it if you look back into his base
this<00:05:10.289> extra<00:05:10.649> time<00:05:10.829> has<00:05:11.099> given<00:05:11.519> him<00:05:11.789> the

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
this extra time has given him the

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.549 
this extra time has given him the
opportunity<00:05:11.999> yet<00:05:12.689> three<00:05:12.989> barracks<00:05:13.319> up

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:13.559 
opportunity yet three barracks up

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.519 
opportunity yet three barracks up
there's<00:05:14.159> a<00:05:14.219> factory<00:05:14.669> being<00:05:14.939> built<00:05:15.209> as<00:05:15.419> well<00:05:15.629> so

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529 
there's a factory being built as well so

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.259 
there's a factory being built as well so
now<00:05:16.769> that<00:05:16.799> he<00:05:17.039> finally<00:05:17.069> cancels<00:05:17.759> it<00:05:17.909> he<00:05:18.089> will

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:18.269 
now that he finally cancels it he will

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:21.199 
now that he finally cancels it he will
be<00:05:18.449> looking<00:05:19.439> a<00:05:19.709> little<00:05:20.159> bit<00:05:20.369> better<00:05:20.549> versus

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:21.209 
be looking a little bit better versus

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:23.809 
be looking a little bit better versus
this<00:05:21.389> three<00:05:21.809> warp<00:05:22.049> gate<00:05:22.349> pressure<00:05:22.769> by<00:05:23.489> Huck

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
this three warp gate pressure by Huck

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.749 
this three warp gate pressure by Huck
but<00:05:24.179> still<00:05:24.509> after<00:05:25.439> dropping<00:05:25.649> 400<00:05:26.309> minerals<00:05:26.639> in

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
but still after dropping 400 minerals in

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.029 
but still after dropping 400 minerals in

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
that early expansion and being forced to

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.379 
that early expansion and being forced to
cancel<00:05:29.219> it<00:05:29.489> it's<00:05:29.579> going<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:29.759> be<00:05:29.849> very<00:05:29.879> tough

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
cancel it it's going to be very tough

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.879 
cancel it it's going to be very tough
position<00:05:30.629> for<00:05:31.079> him<00:05:31.139> he's<00:05:31.289> probably<00:05:31.319> enough<00:05:31.799> to

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
position for him he's probably enough to

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.069 
position for him he's probably enough to
pull<00:05:32.069> workers<00:05:32.459> not<00:05:32.819> die<00:05:33.029> yeah<00:05:33.569> style<00:05:33.929> life

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
killed so he has to pull even more these

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.399 
killed so he has to pull even more these
small<00:06:08.579> SCV<00:06:09.269> poles<00:06:09.569> I'm<00:06:09.809> not<00:06:09.929> the<00:06:10.049> biggest<00:06:10.229> fan

of because yes you will be able to keep

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:15.259 
of because yes you will be able to keep
mining<00:06:13.259> but<00:06:14.129> if<00:06:14.219> they<00:06:14.339> don't<00:06:14.459> work<00:06:14.879> then

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:15.269 
mining but if they don't work then

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:17.629 
mining but if they don't work then
you're<00:06:15.389> down<00:06:15.569> like<00:06:16.169> most<00:06:16.829> of<00:06:17.009> your<00:06:17.129> SUVs<00:06:17.610> and

you're down like most of your SUVs and
you<00:06:17.999> have<00:06:18.089> to<00:06:18.179> pull<00:06:18.389> even<00:06:18.959> more<00:06:19.169> so<00:06:20.009> it's

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
you have to pull even more so it's

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.829 
you have to pull even more so it's
probably<00:06:20.429> better<00:06:20.639> just<00:06:20.729> to<00:06:21.029> grab<00:06:21.299> the<00:06:21.569> whole

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:21.839 
probably better just to grab the whole
