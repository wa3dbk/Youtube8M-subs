00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.919
 robin williams tribute to those who made us 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.919
 smile and reflect 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.539
 robin williams went there he did 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.330
 laugh made us think we had 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 amused he let us in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.920
 we 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.650
 certainly it was different from the mass it is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.309
 probably that diversity in the end 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 did not make him accept this reality 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:40.020
 sometimes too much sensitivity can 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.170
 cause this too you me anyway 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.129
 think that having understood her 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.940
 gesture will also amuse other beings 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 living in the astral world 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 yes because those who loved doing something also 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.859
 in the afterlife it will continue to do so and then 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 I want to think that it will delight those 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.900
 souls who want to smile and not 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.510
 take yourself too seriously 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.610
 although perhaps he made a gesture 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.420
 that no one should ever do 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.979
 people have made people smile so much 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.979
 will continue to do so even after 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.470
 good trip or bing and thanks for yours 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.220
 sensitivity that touched our hearts and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.220
 made us smile 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.290
 I also want to mention it in two 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.880
 very short lengths taken from the moment 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.710
 Poets Society 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.900
 the first in which the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.640
 concept of how each of us can do 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 its part in this powerful 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.320
 show of life 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.110
 the second of how it should not be done 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.090
 condition from the mass but express if 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.670
 themselves based on their own 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.210
 features and not copy what 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.210
 others do 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.040
 in naples j evans pritchard and now mine 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.880
 adored you will learn to think again 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.820
 with your head 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.160
 you will learn to savor words and 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.820
 whatever language you say in 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.010
 around words and ideas can change the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.900
 world that look in pete's eyes 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.030
 says that nineteenth-century literature 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.540
 has nothing to do with the faculties of economics e 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.980
 true medicine may be 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.660
 and she hopkins agrees with him and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.060
 he thinks they should simply 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.370
 study professor preacher learn 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.269
 rhyme and metrics to worry about 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.910
 cultivate other ambitions or a secret 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.910
 to confess you come closer approach 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.270
 we do not read and write poetry because it is 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.760
 nice we read and write poetry 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.190
 because we are members of the human race and 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.140
 the human race is full of passion 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.730
 medicine law economics engineering are 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.320
 noble professions necessary to ours 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.650
 sustenance but poetry beauty 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.060
 romance love 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.680
 these are the things that are held in 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.980
 life by quoting walt whitman or me or life 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.530
 questions like these haunt me 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.650
 endless processions of unfaithful cities 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.900
 crowded with fools you see new in 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:36.920
 all this with me or life response that 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.580
 you are here that life exists and 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.620
 the identity that the powerful show 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.420
 continue is that you can contribute with 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.450
 a verse that the powerful show 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:59.300
 continue is that you can contribute with 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:04:01.780
 a verse which will be no votes today yes 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.780
 strolling 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:26.160
 here's how the poem someone said 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.930
 it is certainly not a big foot bed 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:35.970
 left 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:38.410
 the same thanks guys 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.780
 you will have noticed that each of you moves 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.440
 with his particular gait for 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.570
 example pizza 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.180
 he takes it easy, sooner or later 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.160
 instead, cameron will be thinking 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.949
 will be fine maybe yes but yes sure 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.720
 or maybe not who I know is our over 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.070
 trip is driven by deep passion 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.660
 we all know it's not true but I don't have them 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.340
 made to march to mock them I made 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.930
 marching to illustrate the issue of 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.970
 conformity the difficulty of maintaining 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.660
 their beliefs in the face of 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.460
 others 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.620
 some of you seem to think of 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.360
 I would have marched differently 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.570
 then ask yourself why he beat you 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.570
 hands 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.030
 we all want to be accepted but 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.310
 you have to believe your thoughts 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.410
 be unique and yours even if to others 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.669
 they seem strange and unpopular even if the 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.610
 flock can say is not as good as he said 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.970
 frost two roads I found in the woods and me 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.740
 I chose the one less traveled and it is for 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.840
 what I am different I want that 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.729
 find your walk now on 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.770
 your way of running stroll in 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.000
 any direction you want it to be anyway 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:46.570
 proud that it is silly 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.639
 it is up to you jovanotti the courtyard you do not 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:54.070
 you have to show it, you do it for yourself 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:56.530
 same and tall does not participate 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.840
 army the right not to walk 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:03.860
 thank you so much grabbed the idea at 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.020

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:10.680
 I conclude by asking you all for a moment 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.820
 of recollection to send him energy 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.440
 of love from our hearts for 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.650
 thank him for what he gave us 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.440
 throughout his life 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.830
 surely they will arrive and will be a 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:32.389
 great good for him to receive them 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.389
