those two pens or section of pins

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.259 
those two pens or section of pins
they're<00:03:40.220> basically<00:03:41.220> your<00:03:41.340> buffer<00:03:41.669> boards<00:03:42.030> bad

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
they're basically your buffer boards bad

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.659 
they're basically your buffer boards bad
and<00:03:42.750> what<00:03:43.500> happens<00:03:43.889> is<00:03:44.069> if<00:03:44.159> you<00:03:44.280> plug<00:03:44.489> in<00:03:44.639> that

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
and what happens is if you plug in that

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.849 
and what happens is if you plug in that
buffer<00:03:44.970> board<00:03:45.359> into<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> good<00:03:46.229> wasup<00:03:46.650> stain

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859

buffer board into a good wasup stain
board<00:03:47.129> you<00:03:47.400> will<00:03:47.609> blow<00:03:47.909> your<00:03:48.150> oh<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.299> sustained

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
board you will blow your oh I sustained

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.659 
board you will blow your oh I sustained
board<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.549> identify<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.989> bad<00:03:52.349> IC<00:03:52.829> and

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
board so to identify the bad IC and

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.339 
board so to identify the bad IC and
basically<00:03:54.209> you're<00:03:54.449> gonna<00:03:54.540> do<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> exact<00:03:55.259> same

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
basically you're gonna do the exact same

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.229 
basically you're gonna do the exact same
thing<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.949> did<00:03:56.069> with<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> other<00:03:56.549> samsung

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
thing that I did with the other samsung

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.009 
thing that I did with the other samsung
buffer<00:03:57.569> boards

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
buffer boards

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.110 
buffer boards
you're<00:03:58.799> gonna<00:03:58.919> prong<00:03:59.299> one<00:04:00.299> terminal<00:04:01.009> on<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
you're gonna prong one terminal on the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.709 
you're gonna prong one terminal on the
ground<00:04:04.099> let's<00:04:05.099> see<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.310> got<00:04:05.519> these<00:04:05.639> cool<00:04:05.939> and

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
ground let's see I got these cool and

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.539 
ground let's see I got these cool and
Danny<00:04:07.139> clip<00:04:07.439> things<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.889> could<00:04:08.009> probably<00:04:08.219> clip

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
Danny clip things I could probably clip

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.059 
Danny clip things I could probably clip
it<00:04:08.699> on<00:04:08.789> here

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.289 

let's<00:04:15.069> see<00:04:15.129> if<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.280> can<00:04:15.400> get<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.700> click

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
let's see if I can get it a click

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.289 
let's see if I can get it a click
probably<00:04:17.229> not<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.739> might<00:04:18.609> get<00:04:18.729> lucky

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
probably not I might get lucky

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.120 
probably not I might get lucky
let's<00:04:19.930> do<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.079> from<00:04:20.229> this<00:04:20.410> angle<00:04:20.560> cuz<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:20.979> can

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
let's do it from this angle cuz I can

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:31.350 
let's do it from this angle cuz I can
clip<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.430> better<00:04:21.609> this<00:04:21.820> angle<00:04:29.910> we<00:04:30.910> can<00:04:31.030> do<00:04:31.150> like

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
clip it better this angle we can do like

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.290

and then she couldn't see the ground I

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.340 
and then she couldn't see the ground I
don't<00:04:49.990> know

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
don't know

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.409

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
doesn't matter until jinafire which I

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.820 
doesn't matter until jinafire which I
see<00:04:55.510> is<00:04:55.570> bad<00:04:55.810> basically<00:04:56.500> what<00:04:56.650> you're<00:04:56.770> gonna

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
see is bad basically what you're gonna

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.879 
see is bad basically what you're gonna
do<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:57.190> run<00:04:57.340> your<00:04:57.490> pro<00:04:58.350> against<00:04:59.350> each<00:04:59.530> one<00:04:59.770> of

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
do is run your pro against each one of

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.629 
do is run your pro against each one of
these<00:05:00.010> little<00:05:00.340> pads<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:01.150> think<00:05:02.310> when<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.340> test

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
these little pads I think when I test

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.570 
these little pads I think when I test
it's<00:05:03.820> gonna<00:05:03.940> be<00:05:04.090> this<00:05:04.210> area<00:05:04.539> here<00:05:05.580> basically

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
it's gonna be this area here basically

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:16.500 
it's gonna be this area here basically
just<00:05:07.090> run<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.539> pro<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:15.910> you<00:05:15.940> just<00:05:16.150> run<00:05:16.389> across

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
just run the pro and you just run across

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.230 
just run the pro and you just run across
and<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.110> get<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.350> consistent<00:05:17.710> beat<00:05:18.099> once<00:05:19.060> you

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
and to get a consistent beat once you

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.820 
and to get a consistent beat once you
can<00:05:19.419> get<00:05:19.510> consistent<00:05:20.080> beep<00:05:20.200> then<00:05:20.470> basically

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
can get consistent beep then basically

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.230 
can get consistent beep then basically
what<00:05:21.039> you're<00:05:21.190> gonna<00:05:21.280> do<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.700> follow<00:05:21.970> those

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
what you're gonna do is follow those

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.719 
what you're gonna do is follow those
tail<00:05:22.539> those<00:05:22.840> leads<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.310> particular<00:05:24.550> I

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
tail those leads to that particular I

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:38.060 
tail those leads to that particular I
see<00:05:25.060> which<00:05:26.669> one<00:05:27.669> of<00:05:27.700> these<00:05:27.849> is<00:05:27.940> gonna<00:05:28.210> be<00:05:28.300> bad

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
video tutorial on that but probably not

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.499 
video tutorial on that but probably not
I<00:06:48.139> made<00:06:48.919> a<00:06:48.949> video<00:06:49.159> tutorial<00:06:49.490> in<00:06:49.940> place<00:06:50.090> in<00:06:50.210> IC

seem to figure out what's wrong with it
basically<00:07:48.469> check<00:07:48.770> your<00:07:48.889> board<00:07:49.099> for<00:07:49.310> a<00:07:49.370> short

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 
basically check your board for a short

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.390 
basically check your board for a short
and<00:07:49.819> you'll<00:07:49.940> find<00:07:50.889> hope<00:07:51.889> this<00:07:52.069> helped<00:07:52.250> some<00:07:52.370> of
