00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.710

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.890
 business balls were blue we painted them 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.020

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.660

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.320
 The first shows from such a gentle 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:30.340

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.720

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590
 by the way, it smells cool like that 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.439
 pretty 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.210

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.929

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.560

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.599
 on 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.630

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.830
 This one will be given to mom because 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.600
 This one is a little lighter, but a bit brighter. 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.090

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.000

 carnation chrysanthemum greens here are just one 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.970
 a bouquet is a man's bouquet and in fact 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.330
 most of all I love and men's bouquets 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.540
 oddly and do and how they 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.050
 look and look like they are swallowed 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.170
 all words 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.160
 that's composition I like them 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.190
 much bigger and darker such 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.560
 colors in men's bouquets do not know 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.860
 why then I really like her 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.049
 such a bouquet from afar but not all the same 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.220
 the form is full of flowers 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.090
 called amoris you are very beautiful without 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.070

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.910

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.480
 sorry just for men's bouquets if 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.700
 compare orders much less often than 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.150
 ordinary women's round all over again 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.480

 I honestly do not remember what I said 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.020

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.810
