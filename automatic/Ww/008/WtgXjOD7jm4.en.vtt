 It concerns the turnover of a simpleton 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.529
 split screen 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.810
 good or bad in my opinion this 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.949

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.249
 democratic way gribaleva whether 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.019
 passing a game together or 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.469
 playing against each other 

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.300
 man does not need to buy them 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.730
 such prefixes about you emission sit down 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.730

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.290
 identical conditions 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 and the one and the other if you go to attack not 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.850
 very correctly gets this 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.320
 portion of inconvenience 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.630

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.450
 everyone is happy 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.090
 it can add that the toy with a roll 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.340
 also gives more opportunities 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.310
 more leeway than darker 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.840
 the screen is not endowed in turn because 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.540
 that the camera and in the project is possible here every 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.010

 Reverend and all restrictions come down 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.210
 only to us in the clubs of the city on the screen 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.730
 which is allocated to you 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.890

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 on those noticed 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.530
 besides the game with the screen section where 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.659
 more heartily than the same games to visit 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.210
 here and the incredible feeling of elbow 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.270
 comrades who sits to germany

 help and in every way 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.090
 great passion of competition 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.790
 when 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.340
 on the contrary, fight against each other 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.210
 read a person no well you do not even 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 vote like balances 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.590

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.169
 when you are friends what if earlier today 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.609
 the main goal you want to play together which 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:13.879
 that player 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.739
 wherein 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.230
 there is no way to play through 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.850
 the Internet 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.330
 because your meet such 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.199
 does not support features 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.189
 That was cool when there years 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.399
 ten back 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.199

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.079
 victim then a steep count on sake of 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.209
 to 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.670
 Let them be four identical windows and 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.829
 lose and together in my opinion not very 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.129
 cool 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.659
 but that is 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.379
 so is created games dates percentage 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.379
 the artist comes up with a cool background 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.349
 and one time vestibule making this 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.619
 Kiev is all put in a little krasikov 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.539

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:00.569
 together 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.239
 Well, that is again, I am very glad that 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.009

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.620

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.689
 true 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.289

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.719
 when I and my friend quarreled out 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.879

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.209
 vertically 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.989
 in general May did not come to a compromise 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.849
 and did not play together 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.529
 in general, there is no protest 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.149

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.260
 such actions 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.429
 each with its own console 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.889
 you can go and overcome it 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.169
