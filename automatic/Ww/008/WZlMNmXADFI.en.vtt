experience with Schwinn fitness for the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:03.230 
experience with Schwinn fitness for the
last<00:01:57.079> 15<00:01:58.079> years<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.390> when<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.880> resell<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
last 15 years is that when you resell a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.380 
last 15 years is that when you resell a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.470 
so my advice would be that if you're
buying<00:02:12.600> an<00:02:13.050> AC<00:02:13.530> performance<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:15.210> used
