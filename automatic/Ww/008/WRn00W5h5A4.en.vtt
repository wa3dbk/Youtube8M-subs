ever hear it dr. templeman but I know
that<00:00:19.000> you<00:00:19.210> believe<00:00:19.509> that<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:20.410> mangosteen<00:00:20.740> can

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
that you believe that the mangosteen can

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.040 
that you believe that the mangosteen can
really<00:00:21.490> help<00:00:21.790> in<00:00:21.970> that<00:00:22.150> direction<00:00:22.300> certainly

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
really help in that direction certainly

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.409 
really help in that direction certainly
with<00:00:23.200> tumors<00:00:23.619> well<00:00:24.310> in<00:00:24.430> fact<00:00:24.669> what<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:24.910> wrote<00:00:25.210> in

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
with tumors well in fact what I wrote in

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
the mangosteen The X Factor was that it

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.540 
the mangosteen The X Factor was that it
was<00:00:27.820> an<00:00:28.000> anti-tumor<00:00:28.899> effect<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.710> here<00:00:30.430> again

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
was an anti-tumor effect and here again

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.940 
was an anti-tumor effect and here again
we<00:00:30.939> have<00:00:31.149> to<00:00:31.329> go<00:00:31.450> back<00:00:31.689> to<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.230> idea<00:00:32.770> that

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
we have to go back to the idea that

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.430 
we have to go back to the idea that

not impress a lot of people because it's

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.349 
not impress a lot of people because it's

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
in a petri dish but I'll tell you to

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.330 
in a petri dish but I'll tell you to
impressed<00:01:55.689> me<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.619> think<00:01:56.829> it<00:01:56.950> impressed

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
impressed me and I think it impressed

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.300 
impressed me and I think it impressed
the<00:01:57.459> cancer<00:01:57.849> cells<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:59.109> really<00:01:59.740> do<00:01:59.950> believe

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
the cancer cells so I really do believe

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.370 
the cancer cells so I really do believe
that<00:02:00.609> there<00:02:01.209> is<00:02:01.240> reason<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.049> be<00:02:02.200> optimistic

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
that there is reason to be optimistic

that there is reason to be optimistic
about<00:02:03.039> this<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:04.329> use<00:02:04.599> of<00:02:05.369> cancer<00:02:06.369> therapy

about this in the use of cancer therapy

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.300 
about this in the use of cancer therapy
however<00:02:06.999> I<00:02:07.509> would<00:02:08.289> never<00:02:08.530> recommend<00:02:09.009> that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
however I would never recommend that

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.910 
however I would never recommend that
anyone<00:02:09.580> stop<00:02:10.270> their<00:02:10.720> standard<00:02:11.410> cancer

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
anyone stop their standard cancer

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.710 
anyone stop their standard cancer

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
therapy in favor of this I would suggest

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.320 
therapy in favor of this I would suggest
that<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.430> be<00:02:21.459> added<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.450> it

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
that it be added to it
