some really big motor but you guys can
see<00:01:02.629> here<00:01:03.670> some<00:01:04.670> motors<00:01:05.000> about<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.360> size<00:01:05.600> of

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
see here some motors about the size of

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.289 
see here some motors about the size of
my<00:01:05.960> knuckle<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:10.250> we'll<00:01:10.430> be<00:01:10.579> going<00:01:10.790> head<00:01:11.119> and

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
my knuckle so we'll be going head and

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.530 
my knuckle so we'll be going head and
Starlin<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.380> motor<00:01:13.180> hooking<00:01:14.180> until<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
Starlin the motor hooking until the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.530 
Starlin the motor hooking until the
speed<00:01:14.840> control<00:01:15.790> did<00:01:16.790> not<00:01:16.939> bring<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.329> plane

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
speed control did not bring the plane

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.670

okay<00:01:17.689> and<00:01:17.930> let<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.170> guys<00:01:18.320> see<00:01:18.380> how<00:01:18.619> to

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
okay and let you guys see how to

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.429 
okay and let you guys see how to
retracts<00:01:19.399> work<00:01:19.700> with<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.119> uh<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:21.079> we<00:01:21.229> head

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
retracts work with it uh then we head

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.700 
retracts work with it uh then we head
over<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.680> fly<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.340> field<00:01:23.440> see<00:01:24.440> how<00:01:24.560> it

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
over to fly in the field see how it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.170 
over to fly in the field see how it
performs<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.460> we'll<00:01:25.760> give<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:25.909> guys<00:01:26.150> a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.340 
so let me go ahead and install the motor
on<00:02:46.950> side<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> epic<00:02:47.700> jet<00:02:47.970> then<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.750> pull<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.170> out

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
on side the epic jet then I pull it out

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.320 
on side the epic jet then I pull it out
show<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.740> guys<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.040> good<00:02:50.340> example<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.940> how<00:02:51.270> to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
show you guys a good example of how to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.170 
show you guys a good example of how to
retracts<00:02:51.900> worth<00:02:52.459> maybe<00:02:53.459> show<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> motor

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
retracts worth maybe show you the motor

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.080 
retracts worth maybe show you the motor
also<00:02:54.450> installed<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.410> there<00:02:55.560> also<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.190> let<00:02:56.970> me

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
also installed on there also so let me

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.030 
also installed on there also so let me
go<00:02:57.209> ahead<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.630> pull<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> Epogen<00:02:58.410> over<00:02:58.800> here

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
go ahead and pull the Epogen over here

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.740 
go ahead and pull the Epogen over here
and<00:02:59.250> I'll<00:02:59.400> continue<00:02:59.640> on<00:03:00.000> again<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.600> hit

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
and I'll continue on again when we hit

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.660 
and I'll continue on again when we hit
over<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> finite<00:03:01.440> field<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:02.400> how<00:03:02.520> this

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
over to a finite field see how this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.270 
over to a finite field see how this
product<00:03:02.940> works<00:03:03.120> out<00:03:03.620> okay<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.680> as<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.069> can<00:03:05.220> see

product works out okay so as you can see

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.030 
product works out okay so as you can see
I've<00:03:05.700> installed<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.480> Nitro<00:03:06.989> planes<00:03:07.320> must

I've installed the Nitro planes must

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.820 
I've installed the Nitro planes must
have<00:03:08.280> power<00:03:08.519> 110<00:03:09.239> motor<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.290> now<00:03:10.440> we're<00:03:10.590> gonna

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
have power 110 motor so now we're gonna

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.560 
have power 110 motor so now we're gonna
head<00:03:11.070> over<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.430> flying<00:03:11.850> field<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.390> see

okay so everything's working motors
install<00:03:59.020> let's<00:03:59.680> go<00:03:59.980> ahead<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.400> let<00:04:00.520> the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
install let's go ahead and let the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.630 
install let's go ahead and let the
retracts<00:04:01.210> up<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.410> can<00:04:02.590> transport<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.370> on<00:04:03.520> my

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
retracts up so I can transport it on my

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:23.960 
retracts up so I can transport it on my
car<00:04:05.400> let's<00:04:06.400> go<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.730> fly<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.000> field
