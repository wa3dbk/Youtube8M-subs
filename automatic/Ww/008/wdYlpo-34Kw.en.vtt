00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 ah 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.140
 ah 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.210
 and I knew how well it is different 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.720
 new milestone they came back in the theory title 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.730
 big spring lcd departure date 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.680
 5 online car and what you will see in the background 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.419
 it will be a survival game in 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.770
 no matter what language has post 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.059
 fact I will have put them to any of 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.370
 those that I have I have saved because I 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.380
 I really like which survivals but 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.510
 I do not leave the branches anymore, I come to them 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.070
 give my theory of what I think and what 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.559
 that I think it's going to be the date of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.480
 exit and why I believe fame the date 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.760
 of output what doing the new dlc 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.559
 in this a theory is not rumors 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.809
 person theory pretty good since in 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.519
 this theory I will tell you how the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.710
 strong points, weak points and 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.409
 other points that exist in grand theft 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.440
 auto ok for the first thing he said this 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:04.070
 theory my theory is that the dlc is going to 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.380
 leave if not before the 27 of 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.530
 may will come out a little later and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.540
 you will see why May 27 May 27 is 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.570
 the departure date of watch docs a 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.180
 sandbox type game which has a 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.040
 kinship and like that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.290
 a small competition with a large 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.060
 auto then I think this game 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.580
 besides that this game is not going to come out 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.170
 only for xbox 360 and playstation 3 but 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.630
 that I just saw and just confirmed 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.520
 that he will also leave for willy and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.250
 for the new generation what is the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.780
 play four and the xbox one I this game 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.420
 particularly I'm going to buy it in 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.180
 the xbox with one as it is a game on 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.800
 which I like more in HD do not do the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.500
 comparison I do not have titans fail of 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.180
 xbox one and the truth that the xbox lives 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 one and the one of plays I say the one of play 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.610
 station the xbox 360 and if it works 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 quite the difference of graphics by 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.729
 that I like the games of the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.080
 new generation plus they feel 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.300
 which is more powerful there is no apart from the 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.340
 games make them more age this then 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.030
 having said that because I say so many 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.369
 things in this game and I hardly saw a video 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.470
 of how it was going to be more or less the online 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.910
 In fact, I'm going to look for them so that 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.530
 you also see it I think it 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.030
 I will leave them in the description since 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.280
 this game the truth looks pretty 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.110
 good and besides that it is a game type 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.940
 sandbox as I had already told you and 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.640
 also for those who know all 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.540
 the ubisoft company is very good the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.750
 sandbox 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.069
 the example of assassin's creed then 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.079
 taking into account that they will leave more 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.879
 games throughout this spring and taking 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.170
 into account the new rockstar generation 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.810
 I think it will not be left in the hands 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.310
 crusades against watch dogs then by 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.129
 that more or less I say that my theory 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.109
 more or less if not a little 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.060
 before 27 May or a little 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.939
 then ok but the truth is that it's a 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.859
 great theory since seeing it by competition 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.810
 of sales the truth that I believe that if 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.180
 there is a small there is a mess a little 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.650
 stick there between the two companies but 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.889
 the truth is that it is a game that you open and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.189
 It promises quite something worth noting 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.829
 of this game I hardly saw what was going 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.900
 making a good trailer and the cars 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.150
 of what was going to be something stoxx and the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.889
 I really did not like it in fact 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.750
 in the description I will leave you a 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.739
 video to see what I'm going to put here the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.659
 true that it is a video that looks 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.549
 quite father because here we see how 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.129
 that he's a big cautious guy but he 's 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.139
 doing everything and it's kind of weird and 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.030
 apart these as something new not the 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.950
 possibility of hacking and see that 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.129
 in the photo you could not and that's why I think 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.750
 that there will be quite a shock not 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.430
 quite the mess between all this besides 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.859
 of that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.650
 and pretty good which is also 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.109
 the same issues and a little bit of stuff 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.090
 what a big car then I told you 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.219
 the departure date is a theory like 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.469
 Tell them, do not tell me that x 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:46.269
 it also does not matter, you do not say, it's not worth it, 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.430
 It is a theory which I believe 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.500
 which is quite good is not the next 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.760
 large photo competition plus that 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.069
 I believe in another dead network game 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.879
 redemption 2 but that will speak to you in 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.889
 another video 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.139
 in fact I think the video if it is not 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.340
 that there were them tomorrow or past I do not know how 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.500
 I'm going to upload it because the video 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.599
 talking to them about red dead redemption 2 a 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.680
 great game which I 'm waiting for 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.450
 I think it's going to leave for the new 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.840
 generation but without going through the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.120
 branches deadline maximum date I do not know 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.760
 May the end of May that's my theory 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.620
 then how is the video today and 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.269
 I told them again with the de calco is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.919
 a theory we should not get to 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.539
 discuss about this then he has 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.680
 liked not to forget like favorites

 'put in and you search on youtube 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.270
 google docs online trailer the truth that 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.650
 It is a great game to me the truth if I 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.060
 surprised then good they have 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.260
