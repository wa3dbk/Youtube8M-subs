00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.160
 the new pools 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.140
 we can see in the whole image 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.830
 two hundred meters from the king 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.759
 hardwood 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.339
 three pools 2 for adults some for boy 76 but later 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.589
 fully coated in charity 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.589
 for walk the ladder in stainless steel 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.779
 percent a work 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.619
 that has taken us longer than we expected but if finally 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.119
 great to concretize 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.360
 a project made by the architect 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.380
 carranza sacripanti 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.020
 the one that good my old one knew to interpret and they are shuffled 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.560
 a design that is a fan we have built lavalle rubbed 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 you can only get to build 4 5 to hamas 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.510
 they are 600 meters covered 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.350
 new sanitary 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.600
 fidel Castro is what will be enabled to our public starting 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.770
 of the day friday 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.110
 gualeguaychú 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.870
 it's been growing year by year 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.140
 touristy 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.200
 i the hot springs have worked for me so I donkey 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.050
 back in 2005 when we 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.170
 we will cost more 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.290
 had very few people during the winter 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.290
 Our goal was to break the seasonality 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 we work so that we continue to believe that we have managed to reverse the situation 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 from the city 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.310
 we have reserved a place that the architects authors some for 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 five years 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.610
 who is an inhabitant 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.440
 vizcarra its inhabitants 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.290
 which lead a planning of everything that can be 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.010
 while future 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.960
 nor do we have four tasks reserved to become a high-class hotel 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.759
 that will have to be a company that has extensive knowledge in the 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:02.760
 topic 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.950
 today you can get to work all year long bring many people 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.670
 and continue to improve it notoriously despite the poor performance because 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 has much more demanding people 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.519
 but the winter we set there is a project that we carry out 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.169
 p after they were born by hand we fix projects 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.499
 I did it to reveal our pools and grow in a pool 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.749
 i oil we are inaugurating new pools 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.529
 and soon this does not stop but this begins today to eta 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.079
 we start with these pools and continue with more complete quique 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.409
 also accommodation 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.109
 and another side has to grow a lot gualeguaychú deserves much more 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.979
 yes yes of August 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.739
 I tell the people of Gualeguaychú 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.949
 what we try tourism 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.060
 in advertising 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.719
 there is no expense is an investment 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.779
 we create conscious of our people 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.370
 from always everything 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.309
 it does very little publicity we are going to have much more we are going to take much better 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.579
 we not only have 20 million inhabitants 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.809
 230 kilometers from gualeguaychú 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.729
 and say that when those people 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.589
 10% 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.979
 of the people of the country to perform performances 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.249
 there is no capacity throughout the country to host tourism 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.439
 then let's think that the other 130 km 120 kilometers 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.469
 we can be very much very much 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.579
 but it has a bearing to occupy them 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.499
 are these 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.679
 not because many people come 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.959
 shoot yourself with the price that is one of the fundamental bases to give good 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:52.979
 service 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.549
 good attention 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.049
 and we can have 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.049
 something very very important in our soul 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:17.159
 thank we will have to thank all our customers 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.210
 that has made possible our growth my family that has supported me very much 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.919
 standards 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.240
 the old belief 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.240
 with his animals or things that he supports me notoriously 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.439
 all our suppliers 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.169
 who have served 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.449
 We hold the materials when 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.629
 things have become complicated and we have not been able to pay at full term 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.449
 percent the good state part we would have to start suppliers 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.129
 by emilio 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.479
 500 and as mayor did not provide the study to see if it was feasible 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.650
 the thermal well in 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.569
 here on the premises 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.569
 we must continue e with my origin book 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.499
 i also 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.059
 in the management of was when we inaugurated 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.150
 i 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.620
 we received a moment all the support 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.680
 we are transiting 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.129
 difficult road 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.559
 miquel coca they have changed 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:25.849
 the economic situation is not the same today as when we long morin 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.620
 we also continue to receive daily support 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.419
 give it to the state 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.419
 of the municipality as much of good me as of belgrano town 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.929
 the goal is to get to have much more direct better quality since we have 20 

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:48.050
 hectares of 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.199
 of stereo field to do many things 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.710
 but it is only very difficult to reach 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.419
 When you complete everything you have to go slowly 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.229
 because the economic capacity does not give for services and in the news of the 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.779
 service 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.869
 what I have I think he will never get ahead 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.699
 we will never achieve them 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.339
 and it's because the day we achieve 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.339
 meet some goals is going to be the day we sit down 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.479
 i was not blood my old sitting here
