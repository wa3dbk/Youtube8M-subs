00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
was I know I didn't like check a few

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.710 
was I know I didn't like check a few
weeks<00:02:13.940> ago<00:02:15.129> with<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:17.079> pulling<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.230> my<00:02:18.470> my<00:02:18.829> hair

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
weeks ago with the pulling of my my hair

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.020 
weeks ago with the pulling of my my hair
I<00:02:19.750> mean<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.290> works<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:21.850> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
I mean that works but this is like the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.150 
I mean that works but this is like the
actual<00:02:22.420> representation<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.500> what<00:02:23.830> my<00:02:23.980> hair

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
actual representation of what my hair

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.120 
actual representation of what my hair
looks<00:02:24.370> like<00:02:24.630> straightened<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.350> as<00:02:26.860> I've

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
looks like straightened out so as I've

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.800 
looks like straightened out so as I've
said<00:02:27.310> before<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.670> mean<00:02:28.000> hearing<00:02:28.240> three<00:02:28.540> months

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
said before I mean hearing three months

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.580 
said before I mean hearing three months
natural<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.940> how<00:02:31.210> long<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.660> done<00:02:31.960> um

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
natural and this is how long it done um

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.260 
natural and this is how long it done um
I<00:02:33.220> don't<00:02:33.520> think<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.060> true

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
I don't think this is a true

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.110 
I don't think this is a true
representation<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:35.170> how<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.790> point<00:02:37.060> three

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
representation of how one point three

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.210 
representation of how one point three
years<00:02:37.540> natural<00:02:37.810> hair<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.530> supposed<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.040> look

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
years natural hair is supposed to look

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.670 
years natural hair is supposed to look
because<00:02:39.430> while<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.060> was<00:02:40.440> natural<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
because while I was natural for the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.770 
because while I was natural for the
first<00:02:41.920> year<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.490> was<00:02:43.030> cutting<00:02:43.360> my<00:02:43.480> hair

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
first year I was cutting my hair

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.690 
first year I was cutting my hair
constantly<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.070> just<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.370> they

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
constantly and that's just because they

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.370 
constantly and that's just because they
found<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.330> there's<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.570> lot<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.720> breakage<00:02:47.170> and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
found that there's a lot of breakage and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.380 
found that there's a lot of breakage and
a<00:02:47.440> lot<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.650> splits<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.820> was<00:02:48.940> doing<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.270> on<00:02:49.330> my

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
a lot of splits and I was doing it on my

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.450 
a lot of splits and I was doing it on my
own<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.930> think<00:02:50.200> actually<00:02:50.440> i<00:02:50.680> was<00:02:50.920> making<00:02:51.250> some

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
own I think actually i was making some

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.910 
own I think actually i was making some
bad<00:02:51.580> judgments<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.390> wasn't<00:02:53.230> split<00:02:53.440> ends<00:02:53.740> but

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
bad judgments it wasn't split ends but

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.560 
bad judgments it wasn't split ends but
because<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.370> wasn't<00:02:54.640> perfectly<00:02:55.090> straight<00:02:55.420> i

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
because it wasn't perfectly straight i

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.449 
because it wasn't perfectly straight i
just<00:02:55.810> cut<00:02:55.990> him<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.380> kind<00:02:57.070> of<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.280> been

just cut him so kind of have been

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.300 
just cut him so kind of have been
