didn't really like the first one I tried

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.120 
didn't really like the first one I tried
so<00:00:26.609> yeah<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.869> well<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.650> bought<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.519 
so yeah I was like well you bought it so
I'm<00:00:29.310> gonna<00:00:29.429> give<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.960> second<00:00:31.500> time

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I'm gonna give this a go a second time

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.980 
I'm gonna give this a go a second time
time<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.369> tried<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.670> I<00:00:33.120> had<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> long<00:00:33.720> hair<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
time I tried this I had a long hair and

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.680 
time I tried this I had a long hair and
then<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.010> damaged<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.640> maybe<00:00:36.240> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
then it was pretty damaged so maybe you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.180 
then it was pretty damaged so maybe you
know<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.810> thought<00:00:37.080> maybe<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
know I thought maybe it was one of the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
know I thought maybe it was one of the
reasons<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.880> you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> didn't<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.110> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
reasons that you know I didn't like this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.600 
reasons that you know I didn't like this
product<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.340> gave<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.260> another<00:00:43.260> chance<00:00:43.610> even

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
product so I gave it another chance even

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
product so I gave it another chance even
then<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.149> didn't<00:00:45.449> really<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.199> mean<00:00:46.379> my

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
then I didn't really like it I mean my

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
then I didn't really like it I mean my
hair<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> shorter<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.579> hair<00:00:47.820> hair<00:00:48.300> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
hair is shorter in my hair hair is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.310 
hair is shorter in my hair hair is
healthier<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.770> every<00:00:50.160> time<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.340> use<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.879> I

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
healthier but every time I use it I

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
healthier but every time I use it I
didn't<00:00:52.320> particularly<00:00:52.739> feel<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.550> hair

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
didn't particularly feel like my hair

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.410 
didn't particularly feel like my hair
was<00:00:53.940> getting<00:00:54.210> stronger<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.930> anything<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
was getting stronger or anything and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.660 
was getting stronger or anything and
again<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.690> got<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> sick<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.920> end<00:00:59.219> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
again I got kind of sick of this end so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.259 
again I got kind of sick of this end so
yeah<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.989> hmm<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.129> ok<00:01:02.519> but<00:01:02.940> i

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
yeah it's like hmm it was ok but i

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.850 
yeah it's like hmm it was ok but i
probably<00:01:03.870> wouldn't<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.440> would<00:01:04.650> purchase

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
probably wouldn't really would purchase

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.040 
probably wouldn't really would purchase
it<00:01:05.160> unless<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:06.030> husband<00:01:06.360> goes<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> then

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
it unless my husband goes there and then

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.410 
it unless my husband goes there and then
buys<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.440> again<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.490> time<00:01:08.550> I<00:01:08.940> told<00:01:09.000> him<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
buys it again this time I told him that

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
buys it again this time I told him that
I<00:01:09.690> this<00:01:10.230> is<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.680> favorite<00:01:10.830> shampoo<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.520> he

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
I this is not my favorite shampoo so he

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
I this is not my favorite shampoo so he
probably<00:01:12.119> won't<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.960> long<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.409> he<00:01:13.530> remembers

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
probably won't as long as he remembers

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.130 
probably won't as long as he remembers
the<00:01:14.759> next<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.210> girls<00:01:15.720> only<00:01:16.220> dry<00:01:17.220> shampoos

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
the next one is girls only dry shampoos

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.010 
the next one is girls only dry shampoos
XXL<00:01:19.140> volume<00:01:19.830> plus<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:21.020> few

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
XXL volume plus so they have few

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.590 
XXL volume plus so they have few
different<00:01:22.409> kinds<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.579> they<00:01:23.850> recently

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
different kinds I think they recently

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
different kinds I think they recently
narrowed<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.079> down<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.799> used<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> have

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
narrowed it down but they used to have

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.630 
narrowed it down but they used to have
like<00:01:26.460> several<00:01:26.759> kinds<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.470> same<00:01:28.680> dry

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
like several kinds of the same dry

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
like several kinds of the same dry
shampoo<00:01:30.090> depending<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> want

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
shampoo depending on like what you want

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
shampoo depending on like what you want
to<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> volume<00:01:32.729> or<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to do with it you want to volume or you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020 
to do with it you want to volume or you
just<00:01:33.299> want<00:01:33.509> simple<00:01:34.009> dry<00:01:35.009> shampoos<00:01:35.400> when<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> did

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
just want simple dry shampoos when I did

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
just want simple dry shampoos when I did
actually<00:01:36.420> enjoy<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.680> didn't<00:01:38.070> feel<00:01:38.399> like<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
actually enjoy it I didn't feel like it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.330 
actually enjoy it I didn't feel like it
was<00:01:39.030> quite<00:01:39.479> different<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.560> original<00:01:41.040> like

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
was quite different to the original like

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.090 
was quite different to the original like
normal<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.049> even<00:01:43.049> though<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.229> says<00:01:43.259> volume

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
normal one even though it says volume

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
normal one even though it says volume
plus<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.670> didn't<00:01:45.119> really<00:01:45.240> feel<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:46.560> was

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
plus I didn't really feel like this was

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350 
plus I didn't really feel like this was
like<00:01:46.799> super<00:01:47.189> volumizing<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:47.970> hair<00:01:48.180> or

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
like super volumizing my hair or

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
like super volumizing my hair or
anything<00:01:48.450> maybe<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.350> hair<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.920> hair<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
anything maybe it's my hair my hair is

anything maybe it's my hair my hair is
pretty<00:01:50.909> flat<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.509> maybe<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.229> why<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.310> um<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
pretty flat so maybe that's why but um I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.719 
pretty flat so maybe that's why but um I
did<00:01:54.270> actually<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.799> why<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.219> keep

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729

and they did the price change they jack
a<00:02:04.740> price<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.549> three<00:02:05.909> dollars<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.539> know<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.110> not

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
a price to three dollars I know it's not

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.380 
a price to three dollars I know it's not
much<00:02:07.289> but<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:08.160> used<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.490> two<00:02:08.670> dollars<00:02:08.850> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
much but it used to be two dollars and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.050 
much but it used to be two dollars and
now<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.720> three<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.320> i'm<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.640> it's<00:02:11.640> exactly

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
now it's three and i'm like it's exactly

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.600 
now it's three and i'm like it's exactly
the<00:02:12.210> same<00:02:12.390> thing<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.020> why<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.130> pay

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
the same thing and why do we have to pay

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.480 
the same thing and why do we have to pay
more<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.570> actually<00:02:15.750> any<00:02:16.200> better<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
more is it actually any better and I

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.180 
more is it actually any better and I
think<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.780> exactly<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> same<00:02:19.860> thing

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
think that it's exactly the same thing

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.550 
think that it's exactly the same thing
so<00:02:20.430> they're<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.030> telling<00:02:21.510> us<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.840> pay<00:02:22.260> more

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
so they're just telling us to pay more

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.160 
so they're just telling us to pay more
for<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.160> exactly<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.610> same<00:02:23.820> thing<00:02:24.090> also<00:02:24.840> they

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
for the exactly the same thing also they

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.000 
for the exactly the same thing also they
did<00:02:25.440> product<00:02:26.160> repackaging<00:02:27.080> what<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.740> it

is still my favorite mascara but it

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.440 
is still my favorite mascara but it
feels<00:04:47.860> like<00:04:48.070> it's<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.340> little<00:04:48.610> bit<00:04:48.700> wet<00:04:49.060> to

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
feels like it's a little bit wet to

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.450 
feels like it's a little bit wet to
start<00:04:49.720> with<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.200> then<00:04:50.230> it<00:04:50.410> starts<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.130> dry<00:04:51.430> a

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
start with and then it starts to dry a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.550 
start with and then it starts to dry a
little<00:04:51.820> bit<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.180> then<00:04:52.240> becomes<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.200> really

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
little bit and then becomes like really

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.000 
little bit and then becomes like really
nice<00:04:53.980> formula<00:04:54.850> for<00:04:55.240> me<00:04:55.360> at<00:04:55.480> least<00:04:55.510> anyway<00:04:56.110> so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
nice formula for me at least anyway so

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.600 
nice formula for me at least anyway so
yeah<00:04:57.190> it<00:04:57.430> does<00:04:57.670> have<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.270> weird<00:04:59.610> collagen

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
yeah it does have that weird collagen

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.870 
yeah it does have that weird collagen
kind<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.090> smell<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:02.070> came<00:05:03.070> with<00:05:03.340> original

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
kind of a smell that came with original

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.020 
kind of a smell that came with original
colossal<00:05:04.390> volume<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:05.080> think<00:05:05.380> but<00:05:05.920> yeah<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.640> don't

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
eyeliner this one I I think I already

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.470 
eyeliner this one I I think I already
talked<00:05:30.250> about<00:05:30.370> this<00:05:30.669> but<00:05:30.850> it's<00:05:31.000> really<00:05:31.300> good

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
talked about this but it's really good

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.110 
talked about this but it's really good
because<00:05:31.660> it's<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.230> super<00:05:32.710> fine<00:05:33.010> brush<00:05:33.610> it's

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
because it's a super fine brush it's

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.990 
because it's a super fine brush it's
actually<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.600> brush<00:05:34.930> tip<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.530> it<00:05:36.310> doesn't

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
actually a brush tip and it doesn't

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.280 
actually a brush tip and it doesn't
really<00:05:37.090> dry<00:05:37.360> out<00:05:37.540> but<00:05:37.720> like<00:05:37.840> really<00:05:38.110> really

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
really dry out but like really really

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.830 
really dry out but like really really
quickly<00:05:38.940> like<00:05:39.940> some<00:05:40.180> of<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.450> liquid

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
quickly like some of the liquid

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.020 
quickly like some of the liquid
eyeliners<00:05:41.410> do<00:05:41.710> dry<00:05:41.919> up<00:05:42.070> really<00:05:42.370> quickly<00:05:42.640> it's

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
eyeliners do dry up really quickly it's

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.260 
eyeliners do dry up really quickly it's
ridiculous<00:05:43.780> but<00:05:43.990> this<00:05:44.380> one<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.830> think<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.760> use<00:05:46.030> it

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270

hand<00:05:53.229> I<00:05:53.530> use<00:05:53.919> it<00:05:54.190> at<00:05:54.460> least<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.300> month<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:56.080> after

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
hand I use it at least a month and after

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.100 
hand I use it at least a month and after
that<00:05:57.040> he<00:05:57.400> started<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.910> dry<00:05:58.210> out<00:05:58.419> a<00:05:58.450> little<00:05:58.630> bit

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
that he started to dry out a little bit

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.719 
that he started to dry out a little bit
it's<00:05:59.650> not<00:05:59.830> really<00:05:59.950> like<00:06:00.070> it's<00:06:00.160> completely

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
it's not really like it's completely

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.130 
it's not really like it's completely
dried<00:06:00.940> up<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.210> then<00:06:01.300> I<00:06:01.360> can't<00:06:01.600> really<00:06:01.810> use<00:06:01.990> it

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
dried up and then I can't really use it

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.200 
dried up and then I can't really use it
anymore<00:06:02.350> but<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.830> could<00:06:03.100> see<00:06:03.370> that<00:06:03.729> it<00:06:04.000> was

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
anymore but I could see that it was

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.500 
anymore but I could see that it was
thinning<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.200> it<00:06:05.770> was<00:06:05.950> not<00:06:06.100> as<00:06:06.310> juicy<00:06:06.640> at<00:06:07.090> the

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
thinning and it was not as juicy at the

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.590 
thinning and it was not as juicy at the
tip<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:08.169> this<00:06:08.470> is<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.650> felt<00:06:08.979> tip<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.520> it's<00:06:10.419> not

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
tip and this is a felt tip and it's not

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.700 
tip and this is a felt tip and it's not
as<00:06:10.900> fine<00:06:11.169> as<00:06:11.380> maybelline's<00:06:12.690> eyeliner<00:06:13.690> and<00:06:14.080> it

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
as fine as maybelline's eyeliner and it

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.090 
as fine as maybelline's eyeliner and it
didn't<00:06:15.070> have<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.880> amazing<00:06:16.800> staying<00:06:17.800> power

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
didn't have the amazing staying power

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.280 
didn't have the amazing staying power
like<00:06:18.580> a<00:06:18.610> Maybelline<00:06:18.940> so<00:06:19.540> when<00:06:19.780> I<00:06:19.810> compare<00:06:20.260> it

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
like a Maybelline so when I compare it

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.950 
like a Maybelline so when I compare it
to<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.590> maybelline's<00:06:21.070> all<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.760> aspect<00:06:22.360> was

something that i would go to Thailand
for<00:06:33.130> it's<00:06:33.370> not<00:06:33.520> really<00:06:33.729> worth<00:06:33.880> over<00:06:34.300> travel

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720
