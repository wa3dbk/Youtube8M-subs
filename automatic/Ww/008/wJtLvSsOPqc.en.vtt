00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.389
 construction it will serve you especially 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.429

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.689
 will be from readers that's what they will 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 of a day there and if it pleases they will do 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.590
 maybe other flap flaps but in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.739
 anyway gary fence I think in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.030
 our guard now actually taste 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.920
 this is you have in your little 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 people type you did you are 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 an artist is nice and then you have 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.520
 a little bit of time to kill place between 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.410
 the lair of round and ben you go 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.510
 ask to play a few games - 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.039
 single healed him he was able to keep the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.750
 face on deck but beware of it all 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.829
 only I should use it wait 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 good thing so that's why they 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.590
 we envy the little wolves 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.149
 inside you can use it 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.390
 if there are neighborhoods where we are safe 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.680
 but sega who him for 0 so this is a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.400
 surveyor so he has with flights will mark 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.190
 briotet I had moussa for 0 hires to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.630
 turn if he wants he can put one or two 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.560
 so already your attacker who is going 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.280
 start generally he'll say 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.080
 mathieu gines two rooms began 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.720
 a little bit of the region everything is going to be 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.130
 marked 6 1 the capabilities finally depends 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.720
 how does it work and people to thursday 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.060
 pretty much what is it next he goes 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.710
 have a +4 the creature lhoucine more 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.780
 simple 0 and account to account obviously 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.940
 story so that can be nice if he 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.220
 wants to pass your opposing lines and in 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.009
 plus it helps to win 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.610
 points binkÃ¨ not called window to 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.690

 moody's is the creature targeting the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.600
 marker talents language loyalty 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.740
 ancestors be careful because that's 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.710
 really good because it allows 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.479
 duty 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.640
 killing animals to manage large 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.080
 boxes and plus it's less 10 may goes 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.540

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.820
 by car and -25 if he arrives if he does 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.040
 twice the ability to find all the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.900
 other creatures that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.060
 gary culture does not control power 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.760
 cross the table if you have to do 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.010
 too much starting too hard I do not know 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.830
 anyway it's an instrument 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 very hard to do me I'll try 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.130
 to be me I regret a video where I 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.600
 not play against him with those of 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.580
 classes whose age and its people to 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.690
 Tower doors of the end surely not 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.690

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.570

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.890
 flat tired he'll be able to again 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.290
 to annoy you by putting beasts 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.140
 attack and then then to the third 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.460
 nobody is that if you have you 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.280
 lost contradicting him but that you 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.760

 awesome you can do a little 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.490
 photo against him then two defeats 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.220
 like that 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.870
 two victories if you liked and in 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.160
 do we take a picture for 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.250
 housing and social networks and 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.450
 the best photo will win a while 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.040
 best photo france will win an ax 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.590
 of war latex gloves if you want 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.300
 pt a little bit at home lived 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.830
 with his death it's really 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.660
 something that is super nice because 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.950
 that he not to do it and there we 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.630
 propose a title or a small challenge a little 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.400
 FULL as my mode I will kill well 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.830
 successful he will kill me and then if ever 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.060
 I have a good break is going to have a little 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.770
 something more is really okay 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.510
 heat what they did you 're 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.209
 of course not have to do anything 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.850
 either where the tower will take a picture and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.290
 knowing that two if I believe it 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.270
 the special thing just for the shop 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.590
 we do not know much more about 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.210
 said that there might also be a 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.270
 special stuff here we are so 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.370
 but we are really expecting it if 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.620
 you this is your first tome to the magic 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.410
 you do not panic boost with much 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.820
 people who slipped while also 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.590
 the magic star so no problem 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.990
 you will leave necessarily helped because if 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.850
 you lose everything makes us at least one 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.560
 sure shot of 300 everyone and after 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.850
 there are lots for all I invite you 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.030
 to see on a signage 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.500
 especially if you participate first 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.060
 prince river you it's easier 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.130
 because that allows so already insured 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.950
 to have a place and then it allows 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.570
 to be able to facilitate the organization or 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.950
 years when you arrive you just have to 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.450
 give your dci number or you in 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.460
 France it's not going to worry 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.740
 it's remained very fast here hero 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.600
 already necessarily to build eat that thing 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.250
 could be taken something behind that's it 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.530
 goes faster and it's true that since 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.980
 condense us with the day three 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.140
 before premieres 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.000
 we need to animate so if you want 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.310
 participate I invite you to go 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.090
 on the site dmc animations for malcolm 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.530
 nations for which you are going 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.390
 find your help choose you 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.650
 catch up prescribe is like that 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.180
 you arrive and the same day and a little 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.470
 little advanced like that we can not think 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.600
 to finish them off to death and to others 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.620
 worry or pre-register if you 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.670
 want to participate 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.170
 and whatever it is I do not know for 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.850
 give in to this will be another one you have 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.320
 understood a little bit the principle of if 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.730
 youth hope to build it 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.820
 in front of you I will do it on others 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.080
 projects zap anyway this 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.430
 kind of two legs 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.379
 available in pre- last phase 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.330
 but we make a package that's normal I 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:11.219
 booster style every Sunday 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.360
 at 15h do not hesitate if you have you 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.220
 have a little afternoon in turin 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.990
 Sunday you 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.460
 if you will know how to leave with that 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.240
 it's really cool that it's 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.800
 actually a bit more expensive than a 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.510
 tournament we bring back his dec 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.950
 but the advantage spoke to me all the 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.570
 all the cards after and in addition if 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.410
 you want if you want me games 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.690
 you will have good times 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.400
 this is good not listened I hope 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.710
 less numerous presented then will unite 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.710
 wanted to spy shop called
