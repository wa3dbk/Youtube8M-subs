00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.740 
dt one two five arches being tested
there's<00:00:05.430> got<00:00:05.580> brakes<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.180> starts<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
there's got brakes and it starts and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.780 
there's got brakes and it starts and
runs<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.200> kind<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.470> thing<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:07.790> first

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
runs and that kind of thing so first

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.970 
runs and that kind of thing so first
thing<00:00:08.940> use<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.240> climb<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:09.990> climb<00:00:10.590> up<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:10.889> of

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
thing use to climb on so climb up one of

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.450 
thing use to climb on so climb up one of
the<00:00:11.040> foot<00:00:11.219> pick<00:00:11.429> first<00:00:11.730> because<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.120> high

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
the foot pick first because it's high

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.170 
the foot pick first because it's high
and<00:00:14.460> stand<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:16.039> recognition<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:18.029> them

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
and stand up recognition on you see them

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.640 
and stand up recognition on you see them
in<00:00:18.270> neutral<00:00:18.690> right<00:00:18.810> there<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> or<00:00:19.439> light

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
in neutral right there on the or light

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.099 
in neutral right there on the or light
comes<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.750> this<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.960> has<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:24.109> more

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
comes on there this one has got a more

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.750 
comes on there this one has got a more
north<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.710> solenoid<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> need<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> change

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
north are solenoid so you need to change

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.009 
north are solenoid so you need to change
that<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> better<00:00:27.390> start<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that you have to better start about a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.310 
that you have to better start about a
few<00:00:28.320> times<00:00:28.529> sometimes<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.720> first<00:00:31.050> thing<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.230> do

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
few times sometimes so first thing we do

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
few times sometimes so first thing we do
is<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> junction<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
is up to the junction and on to the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
is up to the junction and on to the
brakes<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:34.110> find<00:00:34.350> movement<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.920> bit

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160

of rear brake now and a little bit more

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
of rear brake now and a little bit more
I<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.700> feel<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> rear<00:00:39.600> brake<00:00:39.870> disc

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
I can feel that that the rear brake disc

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600 
I can feel that that the rear brake disc
feels<00:00:40.320> nice<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.590> flat<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> rear<00:00:41.399> brake

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
feels nice and flat and the rear brake

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.209 
feels nice and flat and the rear brake
feels<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:41.969> powerful<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> should<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:43.219> now

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
feels as powerful as it should do now

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.560 
feels as powerful as it should do now
the<00:00:44.280> same<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> front<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.120> little<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
from that with the front brake disc

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.500 
from that with the front brake disc
feels<00:00:51.210> nice<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.510> flat<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:54.120> front<00:00:54.239> brake

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
feels as powerful as I would expect it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.110 
feels as powerful as I would expect it
to<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> run<00:00:58.500> through<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> gears<00:00:59.120> and

rear drive chain feels slack and I

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.190 
rear drive chain feels slack and I
notice<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:25.969> earlier<00:01:26.270> look<00:01:26.420> dry<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:26.929> it's<00:01:27.049> gonna

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
notice it earlier look dry so it's gonna

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.899 
notice it earlier look dry so it's gonna
want<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.439> adjusting<00:01:27.859> it<00:01:28.399> looks<00:01:28.609> like<00:01:28.729> there's

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
want to adjusting it looks like there's

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.249 
want to adjusting it looks like there's
plenty<00:01:29.149> of<00:01:29.179> adjustment<00:01:29.630> left<00:01:29.869> on<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.109> but

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
plenty of adjustment left on it but

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.719 
plenty of adjustment left on it but
that's<00:01:31.009> going<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.189> eat<00:01:31.280> some<00:01:31.429> attention

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
that's going to eat some attention

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.539 
that's going to eat some attention
before<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.209> ride<00:01:32.450> its<00:01:32.659> anymore

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
before you ride its anymore

accelerate

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.310 

and<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.119> can<00:01:40.270> easily<00:01:40.390> feel<00:01:40.720> from<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.259> the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
and I can easily feel from that that the
