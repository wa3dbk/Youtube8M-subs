one<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:07.980> unique<00:00:08.099> things<00:00:08.189> about<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.360> case

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
one of the unique things about the case

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.110 
one of the unique things about the case
motor<00:00:10.019> grader<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.620> what<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.070> have<00:00:11.250> called<00:00:11.940> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
motor grader is what we have called a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.250 
motor grader is what we have called a
involute<00:00:12.750> moldboard<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.820> is

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
involute moldboard and what that is is

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.769 
involute moldboard and what that is is
instead<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.320> one<00:00:16.770> continuous<00:00:17.490> radius<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.570> have

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
instead of one continuous radius we have

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.400 
instead of one continuous radius we have
three<00:00:19.289> radiuses<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.820> moldboard<00:00:21.539> what

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
three radiuses on this moldboard what

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.310 
three radiuses on this moldboard what
that<00:00:22.590> does<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.220> us<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.939> gives<00:00:24.689> us<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.050> good

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that does for us is gives us a good

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.570 
that does for us is gives us a good
mixing<00:00:25.769> ability<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.460> material<00:00:27.349> also<00:00:28.580> because

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
mixing ability of material also because

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.450 
mixing ability of material also because
of<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> rolling<00:00:30.539> effect<00:00:30.859> it<00:00:31.859> takes<00:00:32.219> less

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
of that rolling effect it takes less

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.090 
of that rolling effect it takes less
power<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> work<00:00:33.840> which<00:00:34.170> computes<00:00:34.829> the

power to do the work which computes the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
behind the cab what that does for us is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.590 
behind the cab what that does for us is
several<00:01:09.570> things<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.880> articulated<00:01:11.880> mode<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
several things in articulated mode you
