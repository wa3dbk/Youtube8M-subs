00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
it looks like when you actually open the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.840 
it looks like when you actually open the
box<00:00:56.539> to<00:00:57.409> need<00:00:57.589> are<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.980> motors<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.429> a<00:00:58.519> separate

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
box to need are the motors in a separate

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.689 
box to need are the motors in a separate
case<00:00:59.089> i<00:00:59.600> also<00:01:00.260> got<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.589> cooling<00:01:00.949> fan<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:01.579> it

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
case i also got the cooling fan so it

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.049 
case i also got the cooling fan so it
doesn't<00:01:01.969> overheat<00:01:02.260> again<00:01:03.280> this<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.489> really

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
doesn't overheat again this is a really

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.710 
doesn't overheat again this is a really
good<00:01:05.239> fan<00:01:05.510> i<00:01:05.870> really<00:01:06.680> like<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.600> it'll<00:01:08.600> be

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
good fan i really like it it'll be

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.620 
good fan i really like it it'll be
really<00:01:08.960> useful<00:01:09.259> in<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:09.770> kitchen<00:01:10.390> then<00:01:11.390> here's

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
really useful in the kitchen then here's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.620 
really useful in the kitchen then here's
the<00:01:11.689> esc<00:01:12.110> can<00:01:12.560> hand<00:01:12.710> up<00:01:12.829> just<00:01:13.040> 6s<00:01:13.490> lipo<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.509> the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
the esc can hand up just 6s lipo so the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.010 
the esc can hand up just 6s lipo so the
fan<00:01:14.899> um<00:01:15.470> switches<00:01:16.280> separate<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.390> mod<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.780> so

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
fan um switches separate and mod that so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.740 
fan um switches separate and mod that so
I'm<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:19.070> they<00:01:19.369> connected<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.329> all<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.509> got<00:01:20.630> to

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
I'm that they connected and all I got to

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.230 
I'm that they connected and all I got to
do<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:20.960> plug<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.259> batch<00:01:21.409> in<00:01:21.619> little<00:01:21.890> turn<00:01:22.100> on

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
do is plug the batch in little turn on

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.969 
do is plug the batch in little turn on
much<00:01:23.240> easier<00:01:23.719> special<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.439> sand<00:01:24.740> when

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
much easier special in the sand when

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.289 
much easier special in the sand when
this<00:01:25.070> gets<00:01:25.219> all<00:01:25.399> clogged<00:01:25.670> up<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.090> doesn't

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
this gets all clogged up and doesn't

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.969 
this gets all clogged up and doesn't
work<00:01:26.680> all<00:01:27.680> right<00:01:27.829> now<00:01:28.549> here's<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.979> high

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
their packets once we ordered the motor

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.300 
their packets once we ordered the motor
and<00:03:41.050> that's<00:03:41.290> we're<00:03:41.440> going<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.620> keep<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.830> spare
