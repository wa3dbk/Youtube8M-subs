 are in the description 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 once a big youtuber america 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.650
 bit the that the smosh style 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.630
 so my question was would you 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.729

 anthony from smosh on twitter 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.740
 I would just take the things that you do before 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.600
 to do in beside the check so 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.290

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.759

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.079
 seven, for example, 10 minutes ago
