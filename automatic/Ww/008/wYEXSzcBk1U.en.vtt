00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.029 
Stabila pod technology so what we've
done<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.750> podiatry<00:00:25.230> school<00:00:25.289> they<00:00:25.650> teach<00:00:25.710> you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
done in podiatry school they teach you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
done in podiatry school they teach you
to<00:00:26.240> stabilize<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> tripod<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> foot<00:00:28.080> so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
to stabilize the tripod of the foot so

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.439 
to stabilize the tripod of the foot so
stabilize<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> lateral<00:00:29.550> heel<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.269> met

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
stabilize the lateral heel the first met

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.810 
stabilize the lateral heel the first met
and<00:00:30.720> v<00:00:30.929> met<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.130> stabilize<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and v met and if you can stabilize that

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.520 
and v met and if you can stabilize that
tripod<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> foot<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.050> whole<00:00:34.170> foots<00:00:34.410> gonna

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
tripod of the foot the whole foots gonna

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
tripod of the foot the whole foots gonna
be<00:00:34.739> stable<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.489> literally<00:00:35.760> took<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.149> shoe

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
be stable so we literally took this shoe

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.260 
be stable so we literally took this shoe
and<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.350> bumped<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:38.010> columns<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and we bumped these columns out of the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
and we bumped these columns out of the
midsole<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> shoe<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.280> in

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
midsole of the shoe here so that in

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.280 
midsole of the shoe here so that in
those<00:00:41.640> three<00:00:41.940> areas<00:00:41.969> literally<00:00:42.809> making<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
those three areas literally making it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
those three areas literally making it
wider<00:00:43.649> through<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.190> zone<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
wider through that zone so you get the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
wider through that zone so you get the
stability<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> had<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.770> much<00:00:47.039> wider

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
stability as if you had a much wider

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970 
stability as if you had a much wider
shoe<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:48.000> only<00:00:48.149> having<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.809> widen<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
shoe with only having to widen out that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
shoe with only having to widen out that
area<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> shoe<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> stability

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
area of the shoe and so the stability

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.860 
area of the shoe and so the stability
are<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.460> helpful<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.750> other

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
are really helpful and then the other

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.090 
are really helpful and then the other
thing<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.230> stability<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.920> shoe

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
thing we do for stability in this shoe

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.950 
thing we do for stability in this shoe
is<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.360> has<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> half

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
is it actually has two and a half

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.619 
is it actually has two and a half
millimeters<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> varus<00:00:59.239> stability<00:01:00.239> wedge<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
millimeters of varus stability wedge to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.760 
millimeters of varus stability wedge to
it<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.930> call<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> stability<00:01:01.379> wedge

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it so we call it a stability wedge

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.650 
it so we call it a stability wedge
basically<00:01:02.550> means<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.850> there's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> wedge<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
basically means that there's a wedge in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.710 
basically means that there's a wedge in
the<00:01:03.899> midsole<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.159> shoe<00:01:05.400> gets<00:01:05.720> thicker

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the midsole here the shoe gets thicker

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
the midsole here the shoe gets thicker
as<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.229> goes<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.650> inside<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> shoe<00:01:08.250> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
as it goes to the inside of the shoe so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.550 
as it goes to the inside of the shoe so
this<00:01:08.460> side<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> shoe<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.420> thicker<00:01:10.260> than

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
this side of the shoe is thicker than

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.500 
this side of the shoe is thicker than
this<00:01:10.770> side<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> shoe<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.820> typically<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this side of the shoe and typically a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
this side of the shoe and typically a
shoe<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.409> people<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.830> have

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
shoe like this is for people that have

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
shoe like this is for people that have
their<00:01:14.310> feet<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.580> collapsed<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.330> natural

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
their feet are collapsed out of natural

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
their feet are collapsed out of natural
position<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.130> help<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.549> them

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
position so it's gonna help put them

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.390 
position so it's gonna help put them
back<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.210> natural<00:01:19.170> foot<00:01:19.320> position<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.860> if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400

etc and tell us more about the zero drop

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.030 
etc and tell us more about the zero drop
philosophy<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.990> alter<00:01:52.259> has<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> its

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
philosophy that alter has in all of its

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.530 
philosophy that alter has in all of its
shoes<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:54.299> zero<00:01:54.720> drop<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.229> put<00:01:56.299> into<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
shoes so zero drop was put into the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.200 
shoes so zero drop was put into the
shoes<00:01:58.189> actually<00:01:59.189> first<00:01:59.520> came<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.880> it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
shoes actually first came up with it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.499 
shoes actually first came up with it
after<00:02:00.810> watching<00:02:01.320> film<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:02.579> our<00:02:02.969> runners<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.420> my

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
after watching film of our runners at my

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.200 
after watching film of our runners at my
running<00:02:03.780> store<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.920> people<00:02:05.520> ran<00:02:05.700> great<00:02:06.000> in

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
running store they people ran great in

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
running store they people ran great in
spikes<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.780> flats<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> barefoot<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.740> then

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
spikes and flats and barefoot and then

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.619 
spikes and flats and barefoot and then
we<00:02:08.310> would<00:02:08.489> film<00:02:08.700> them<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.209> shoes<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.539> were

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
we would film them in the shoes we were

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.690 
we would film them in the shoes we were
selling<00:02:09.929> them<00:02:10.050> typically<00:02:10.560> your<00:02:11.250> traditional

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
selling them typically your traditional

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.140 
selling them typically your traditional
running<00:02:11.970> shoes<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
running shoes and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.630 
running shoes and
they<00:02:13.510> landed<00:02:14.470> with<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> lot<00:02:14.799> more<00:02:14.950> impact<00:02:15.250> and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
they landed with a lot more impact and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.140 
they landed with a lot more impact and
so<00:02:16.709> we<00:02:17.709> had<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.370> theory<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.670> if<00:02:18.819> we<00:02:18.970> took

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
so we had this theory that if we took

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.000 
so we had this theory that if we took
the<00:02:19.390> weight<00:02:20.319> out<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> heel<00:02:20.829> and<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
the weight out of the heel and the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.990 
the weight out of the heel and the
height<00:02:21.129> out<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.459> heel<00:02:21.549> that<00:02:21.579> people<00:02:21.879> would

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
height out of the heel that people would

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.179 
height out of the heel that people would
run<00:02:22.150> better<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:22.480> sure<00:02:23.049> enough<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.980> video

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
run better and sure enough the video

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.160 
run better and sure enough the video
analysis<00:02:24.610> confirms<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.810> know<00:02:25.870> people

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
analysis confirms that you know people

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.050 
analysis confirms that you know people
look<00:02:26.319> very<00:02:26.349> similar<00:02:27.099> run<00:02:27.519> with<00:02:27.670> nice<00:02:27.879> low

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
look very similar run with nice low

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.000 
look very similar run with nice low
impact<00:02:28.420> technique<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.049> a<00:02:29.379> zero<00:02:29.620> drop<00:02:29.769> shoe

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
impact technique in a zero drop shoe

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.099 
impact technique in a zero drop shoe
just<00:02:30.250> like<00:02:30.430> they<00:02:30.549> do<00:02:30.609> without<00:02:30.939> a<00:02:31.120> shoe<00:02:31.390> or<00:02:31.689> in<00:02:32.019> a

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
just like they do without a shoe or in a

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.349 
just like they do without a shoe or in a
spike<00:02:32.349> or<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.620> flap<00:02:32.829> and<00:02:33.010> then<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:34.060> take<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
spike or a flap and then you take that

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.059 
spike or a flap and then you take that
same<00:02:34.510> person<00:02:34.689> from<00:02:35.049> a<00:02:35.200> traditional<00:02:35.650> shoe<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
same person from a traditional shoe and

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.800 
same person from a traditional shoe and
technique<00:02:36.909> kind<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.180> goes<00:02:37.299> out<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> window

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
technique kind of goes out the window

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.780 
technique kind of goes out the window
and<00:02:38.079> impact<00:02:38.409> gets<00:02:38.680> higher<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.129> bad<00:02:39.549> things

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
and impact gets higher and bad things

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.360 
and impact gets higher and bad things
happens<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:41.260> think<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:41.769> pretty<00:02:41.950> important

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
happens we think that's pretty important

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.670 
happens we think that's pretty important
well<00:02:43.239> thank<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.569> so<00:02:43.750> much<00:02:43.900> golden<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.560> this

well thank you so much golden and this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.420 
well thank you so much golden and this
has<00:02:44.859> been<00:02:45.040> rachael<00:02:45.370> with<00:02:45.400> running<00:02:45.790> shoes<00:02:46.000> calm
