00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.359
 digital slates are already part of the routine of some schools 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.100
 but technological innovation for teaching is only in the beginning so the 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.249
 computerized classrooms 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.570
 the value set the chair is a way to ensure safety and prevent theft 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.919
 of computers used in the classroom 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.449
 and when folded the furniture becomes a normal portfolio occupying much less 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.789
 space 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.669
 this rural portfolio 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.319
 an internal equipment 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.470
 would be part of the buyer 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.270
 I get here for people. 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.200
 this equipment has no 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.870
 let's use a gun home us because it happens if someone uses the country 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.900
 could carry are packed 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.350
 it only works on network then 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.040
 appealed to another who stole this will not have a network to connect a match as 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
 that is, it only has utility even in the classroom 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.670
 the structure of the equipment also adapted for the use of 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.900
 physical disability 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.110
 and even with the idea of â€‹â€‹including the system connect them to digital to a 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.900
 and allows the 'teacher' to be the information to the students of 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.140
 where it is 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.050
 it was a challenge for a customer 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.110
 we ended up fighting for a product line for people with needs 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.160
 where there was the emergence of the computerized driver's license 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.890
 then this bitch has a height adjustment 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.840
 who in the space at the wheelchair's entrance 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.200
 so that he can stay calm baby is economically correct beyond 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.670
 end of table 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.430
 already digital rock we have opted in testament that is a was an intention 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.810
 of the group's return to their classroom chair 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.110
 then you can walk all over the whole room and with this team 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.770
 can return activity per person you already thought about taking a course 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.159
 receive the proof of completion at the same time already with your photo taken in the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.120
 Graduation 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.270
 have digital certificates, in addition to guaranteeing the authenticity of the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.670
 use the same printing system for cash and passport notes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.979
 enabling the student to receive the document instantly 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.900
 take a picture 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.960
 and provide your fingerprint 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.370
 There you make the capture. 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.919
 Whom you wish for 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.510
 you make the impression of a certificate with the security role 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.959
 the student leaves with a certificate 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.519
 it is in the collation of degree 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.609
 on the same day 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.289
 we collect data on time 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.259
 but the impression of a security role 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.259
 at the time of action 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.430
 in the digital look another point br you find a series of subjects that 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.319
 talk about technology applied to education 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.929
 Run there and do a search on our collection that stays inside the subject. 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:51.689
 he also enjoys to know the project elements it is a course 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.499
 free internet that prepares teachers to deal with technology 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.499
 in the classroom is worth checking
