00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.600 
over there Justin it
the<00:04:57.230> fuel<00:04:57.440> gauge<00:04:57.680> should<00:04:57.980> have<00:04:58.160> been<00:04:58.340> sit

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
the fuel gauge should have been sit

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.030 
the fuel gauge should have been sit
right<00:04:58.880> over<00:04:58.940> there<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.570> there<00:05:00.470> are<00:05:00.500> P<00:05:00.680> attack

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
right over there and there are P attack

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.490 
right over there and there are P attack
calm<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.580> everything<00:05:01.640> was<00:05:02.330> what<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.660> tax<00:05:02.930> I

I'm<00:05:09.470> not<00:05:09.740> gonna

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
I'm not gonna

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.970 
I'm not gonna
just<00:05:11.690> playing<00:05:12.690> with<00:05:12.780> it

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:24.459 

the<00:05:16.580> chart<00:05:16.880> by<00:05:17.120> checking<00:05:17.750> everything<00:05:18.140> out

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.670 

so<00:05:25.469> anyway<00:05:25.830> there's<00:05:26.460> Lana<00:05:27.169> Steen<00:05:28.169> coming<00:05:28.530> out

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
so anyway there's Lana Steen coming out

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.629 
so anyway there's Lana Steen coming out
of<00:05:28.830> one<00:05:29.250> sign<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:29.969> it<00:05:30.120> looks<00:05:30.840> funny<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.289> that

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
of one sign and it looks funny is that

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.529 
of one sign and it looks funny is that
the<00:05:32.639> other<00:05:33.120> side<00:05:33.599> it's<00:05:33.840> not<00:05:34.099> producing<00:05:35.099> on<00:05:35.639> the

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
the other side it's not producing on the

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.179 
the other side it's not producing on the
right<00:05:36.750> side<00:05:37.110> left<00:05:37.500> saying<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.949> truck

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
right side left saying the truck

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:40.490 
right side left saying the truck
produces<00:05:38.849> more<00:05:39.060> steam<00:05:39.539> on<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.840> left<00:05:40.259> side

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
produces more steam on the left side

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.230 
produces more steam on the left side
just<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:41.430> right<00:05:41.580> side<00:05:41.819> doesn't<00:05:42.120> produce

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
just the right side doesn't produce

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.999 
just the right side doesn't produce
anything<00:05:42.659> I<00:05:43.050> mean<00:05:43.169> there's<00:05:43.409> two<00:05:43.620> exhaust

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
anything I mean there's two exhaust

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.670 
anything I mean there's two exhaust
manifolds<00:05:44.759> in<00:05:44.819> there<00:05:45.050> that<00:05:46.050> when<00:05:46.169> I<00:05:46.199> first<00:05:46.439> saw

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
manifolds in there that when I first saw

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.200 
manifolds in there that when I first saw
two<00:05:46.860> exhaust<00:05:47.159> manifolds<00:05:47.759> I<00:05:47.819> thought<00:05:48.030> their

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
two exhaust manifolds I thought their

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.179 
two exhaust manifolds I thought their
hot<00:05:48.419> rods<00:05:48.810> but<00:05:49.080> I<00:05:49.139> guess<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:49.409> gotta<00:05:49.590> make<00:05:49.949> the

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 
hot rods but I guess you gotta make the

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.010 
hot rods but I guess you gotta make the
exhaust<00:05:50.520> pipes<00:05:50.819> bigger<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.479> make<00:05:51.599> them<00:05:51.780> loud

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
exhaust pipes bigger and make them loud

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.409 
exhaust pipes bigger and make them loud
or<00:05:52.379> something<00:05:54.289> anyway<00:05:55.289> I<00:05:55.529> don't<00:05:56.000> get<00:05:57.000> outside

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
or something anyway I don't get outside

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:13.140 
or something anyway I don't get outside
and<00:05:57.750> turn<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.590> lights<00:05:58.800> on

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:34.730 

sounds<00:06:13.780> like<00:06:13.870> a<00:06:14.260> man

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.080 

that

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.810 

right<00:06:37.540> amount<00:06:37.990> from

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:47.060 

drive<00:06:41.240> for<00:06:41.570> Chris

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.890 

they<00:06:47.460> get<00:06:47.640> driving<00:06:48.060> up

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
they get driving up

00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:06.280 
they get driving up
every<00:06:49.440> day

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.310 

see<00:07:06.770> you<00:07:06.830> next<00:07:07.130> time
