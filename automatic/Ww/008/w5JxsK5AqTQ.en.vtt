00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.959 

this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.439> picture

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.249 

let's<00:00:13.389> see<00:00:13.690> we<00:00:14.019> got

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
let's see we got

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.580 
let's see we got
and<00:00:15.500> we're<00:00:16.189> here<00:00:16.609> is<00:00:16.880> of<00:00:17.210> course

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.640 

why<00:00:21.190> I<00:00:21.220> can't<00:00:21.820> tell<00:00:22.030> you<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:23.350> there's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
why I can't tell you but there's

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.200 
why I can't tell you but there's
definitely<00:00:23.890> across<00:00:26.100> counter<00:00:27.100> cross<00:00:27.340> goes

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
definitely across counter cross goes

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.170 
definitely across counter cross goes
down<00:00:28.770> then<00:00:29.770> there's<00:00:30.330> looks<00:00:31.330> like<00:00:31.630> I<00:00:31.900> guess

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
down then there's looks like I guess

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.389 
down then there's looks like I guess
foundation<00:00:34.180> from<00:00:34.360> an<00:00:34.480> old<00:00:34.630> building

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.389 

but<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.539> got<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.719> remember<00:00:41.399> whatever

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
but you got to remember whatever

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.799 
but you got to remember whatever
happened<00:00:42.940> to<00:00:43.300> on<00:00:43.420> Mars<00:00:43.750> was<00:00:45.570> incredible

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
happened to on Mars was incredible

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.139 
happened to on Mars was incredible
I<00:00:47.100> mean<00:00:48.100> there's<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.340> couple<00:00:48.610> of<00:00:48.790> moons<00:00:48.969> that

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
I mean there's a couple of moons that

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.420 
I mean there's a couple of moons that
circle<00:00:49.719> Mars<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.530> my<00:00:53.649> best<00:00:53.920> guess<00:00:54.190> is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
circle Mars are one of my best guess is

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.040 
circle Mars are one of my best guess is
that<00:00:54.760> one<00:00:55.540> of<00:00:55.570> them<00:00:55.920> impacted<00:00:56.920> Mars<00:00:57.159> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
that one of them impacted Mars and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.310 
that one of them impacted Mars and
created<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.199> just<00:00:59.920> disaster<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:04.809> stuff

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
created this just disaster the way stuff

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.680 
created this just disaster the way stuff
is<00:01:05.530> thrown

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
is thrown

there's<00:01:07.690> artifacts<00:01:08.409> everywhere<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.940> have

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
there's artifacts everywhere we have

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.990 
there's artifacts everywhere we have
something<00:01:13.479> here<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.780> just<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:15.460> makes<00:01:15.759> no

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
something here that just really makes no

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.440 
something here that just really makes no
sense

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.610 

and<00:01:20.840> look<00:01:21.050> at<00:01:21.140> this

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.380 

it<00:01:28.190> looks<00:01:28.550> like<00:01:28.760> an<00:01:28.910> old<00:01:29.060> fence<00:01:29.420> with<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.500> post

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
it looks like an old fence with the post

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.920 
it looks like an old fence with the post
steel<00:01:33.130> forged<00:01:34.130> posts<00:01:34.610> coming<00:01:34.790> up<00:01:35.000> with<00:01:35.300> looks

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
steel forged posts coming up with looks

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.070 
steel forged posts coming up with looks
like<00:01:35.990> spades<00:01:36.440> on<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.800> top<00:01:36.980> of<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:38.050> you<00:01:39.050> can

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
like spades on the top of it you can

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.000 
like spades on the top of it you can
download<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.740> picture<00:01:40.040> yourself<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.730> see

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
download the picture yourself and see

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.470 
download the picture yourself and see
and<00:01:43.010> these<00:01:43.160> things<00:01:43.430> are<00:01:43.610> definitely<00:01:43.850> there

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
and these things are definitely there

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.370 
and these things are definitely there
but<00:01:46.360> that's<00:01:47.360> definitely<00:01:47.630> across<00:01:50.170> it's<00:01:51.170> easy

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
but that's definitely across it's easy

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.380 
but that's definitely across it's easy
to<00:01:51.560> see<00:01:53.920> my<00:01:54.920> best<00:01:55.220> guess<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.730> it<00:01:55.910> is<00:01:56.180> either

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
to see my best guess is it is either

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.530 
to see my best guess is it is either
made<00:01:56.660> out<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.900> wood<00:01:57.080> or<00:01:57.110> cars<00:01:59.560> and<00:02:01.330> again<00:02:02.330> I

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
made out of wood or cars and again I

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.390 
made out of wood or cars and again I
just<00:02:02.840> want<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.080> give<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.230> shout<00:02:03.500> out<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.710> will<00:02:04.160> I
