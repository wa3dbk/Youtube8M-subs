00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 or 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.309
 do not 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.809
 plus 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.400
 every time I see the one in madrid, it's more 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.890
 convinces more convinces me that that team 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.360
 that was going to be until the end that what 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.390
 we mentioned in the month of September 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.710
 It is also true and simply because 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.570
 I see conviction, I really see 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.660
 conviction and it is also the most 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.120
 heavy that I remember because that 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.670
 equipment for all seasons to 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.820
 many times that early I have seen the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.170
 last time then without embroidering the let's say 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.629
 when is the other team that carries 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.449
 initiative etc etcetera and we do not see 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.729
 a high of very 'plugged' so we live 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.830
 before the valence in the first half of 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.920
 balance and had its percentage of value 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.229
 but even so, violence does not create 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.210
 in no danger and those of valence not 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.000
 they should take it very personally because 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.490
 the same goes for many teams many 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.299
 teams have percentages of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.729
 remarkable possession but do not cause 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.200
 problems at the same time and madrid Ã¡lex madrid 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.530
 He is extremely comfortable playing without a ball 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.340
 we lived a half when he took the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.520
 party by the rocks and then attacked and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.070
 has an insistence I go back to that 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.530
 heavy heavy symbol a little bit of another 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.140
 team do not see goal and when you have 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.799
 the ball and believe in play follow 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.710
 insisting insisting insisting 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.049
 has a very healthy side of the brain is 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.000
 that I know I have a team that 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.080
 really think that they can win 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.810
 any match against any opponent 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.399
 I would not like my team to face 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.679
 to his 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.110
 Paiva also the foolishness of riding 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.950
 milan game that said he wished 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.260
 face the chaos because 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.140
 I thought he was the weakest opponent 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.349
 possible first I would like to say that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.989
 I think that Madrid is 20 times better 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.180
 that the milan and they have already touched him in the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.329
 draw and I think the estimator will pass 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.860
 but we go further to that washing of 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.840
 brain 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.510
 good that has the flutter of madrid 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.640
 I do not know millions has already reached 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.650
 impregnate the minds of all 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.819
 components templates that this is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.700
 party party party and party 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.090
 well championship teams usually go like this 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.540
 match to match and do not think beyond 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.330
 that the next stake but I think that 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.299
 it's something beyond I think the subject 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.260
 of plays his football constantly 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.599
 thinking that it goes to 0-0 they are tied of 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.930
 steel independently that was going 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.920
 winning 1 0 2 0 3 0 are always 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.140
 thinking that they were 0 0 because it returns to 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.780
 talk about insistence that encouraged and 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.260
 madrid if the referee adds 5 minutes and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.560
 be with the same tension with the same 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.079
 goal to score a goal until the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.870
 minute 95 and it was not yesterday because 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.450
 simply if he scores a goal more he 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.180
 became leader said with Betis 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.910
 it was the same and he had scored 4 and he continues 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.620
 looking for the fifth one is always in a 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.650
 state 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.640
 the greatest possible diligence then not 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.989
 it's just match to match it's almost 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.870
 minute to minute goal to goal 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.360
 I think he has a mentality 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.360
 superlative I would not like to think of being a 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.340
 rival of the altima to serve in champions 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.340
 or in any area of the league
