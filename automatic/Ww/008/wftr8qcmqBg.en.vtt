metabolize<00:00:39.360> drugs<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.170> bit

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
metabolize drugs a little bit

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
metabolize drugs a little bit
differently<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.219> had<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> kind<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.820> think

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
differently so we had to kind of think

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.970 
differently so we had to kind of think
outside<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.510> box<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.079> his<00:00:43.320> treatment<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
outside the box for his treatment and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
outside the box for his treatment and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
that's how we settled on acupuncture so

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
that's how we settled on acupuncture so
there's<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.730> many<00:00:47.969> zoos<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.390> have

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
for needles necessarily so we like using

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.210

our systems all electricity so we have
these<00:02:12.740> little<00:02:12.950> electrical<00:02:13.460> points

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
these little electrical points
