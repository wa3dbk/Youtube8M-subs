00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.449
 in particular in Moscow, eight 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.410
 ha ha how so 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.400
 Podolsky 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.790
 topic closer baptism from stroke 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.400
 rejuvenation propping 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.670
 prefers to her 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.230
 patient on goal 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.330
 special purpose food 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.620
 it's like a difficult name specifically 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 it applies to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.090
 nearer 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.090
 of course the edges of that situation 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.370
 for understanding since it is being conducted 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.060
 everyone understands how I previously cells in favor 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.500
 shopping 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.480
 she is different with ultra 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.980
 bodies we live like brain cells 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.890
 understand and so on then so here i am you 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.720
 I want to say that in any curious 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.060
 goes to no thought 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.270
 and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.400
 without power this is withering away 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.350
 much faster than we would like 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.490
 nutrition 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.390
 need to give if fitness is animating 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.280
 power supply 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.360
 but when we expect the cage 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.740
 Only this concerns big he will live 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.240
 longer this life cast rejuvenate then 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 have hobbies rejuvenation 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660
 why because all that idea 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.580
 in the data in this understanding of this 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.910
 treatment compulsory 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.970
 learning for everyone 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.310
 sick though without him of course without 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.800
 nutrition but what kind of treatment is understandable 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.180
 so there in the understanding of each 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.030
 the patient we put the main postulate 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.730
 and judge 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.490
 first of all premature 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.610
 the aging of that filed which 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.549
 what is stroke 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.099
 I will not and because everyone who is sick he 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.659
 outgrown the method is sick that he will go 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.239
 on the internet thank god today so 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.339
 there is a beautiful thing and see 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.599
 and together taking into account anyway this 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.309
 associated with the collapse of food if we ourselves 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:27.869
 chose more broadly this for the disease 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 vascular wall disease so to speak 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.659
 further ostrenko this name is very, very 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.889
 much there 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.889
 so let's say so 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.739
 m
