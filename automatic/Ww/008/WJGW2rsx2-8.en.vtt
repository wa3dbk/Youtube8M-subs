was our focus of what we had was this 38
on<00:00:54.870> span<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.890> six-week<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> middle

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
on span and a six-week bit in the middle
that<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.050> called<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> Olympic<00:00:58.590> Games<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.070> we

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that was called the Olympic Games and we

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.450 
that was called the Olympic Games and we
had<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.930> cater<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.649> focus<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
had to really cater and focus for that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.450 
had to really cater and focus for that
that<00:01:02.879> long-term<00:01:03.420> legacy<00:01:04.080> plan<00:01:04.650> while

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that long-term legacy plan while

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.649 
that long-term legacy plan while
building<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> provision<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
building in the provision for the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.450 
building in the provision for the
Olympic<00:01:07.020> Games<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> legacy<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> as

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
Olympic Games and so the legacy is as

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.450 
Olympic Games and so the legacy is as
important<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> games<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> legacy

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
important as the games the legacy

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.310 
important as the games the legacy
arguably<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.270> important<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.020> legacy

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
arguably was more important the legacy

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.100 
arguably was more important the legacy
is<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.670> were<00:01:14.820> how's<00:01:15.630> London<00:01:16.020> going

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.120 
in architecture how did you avoid
negative<00:01:50.119> compromise<00:01:50.630> because<00:01:51.080> we<00:01:51.470> because

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
negative compromise because we because

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.880 
negative compromise because we because
the<00:01:52.280> legacy<00:01:53.000> was<00:01:53.150> uncertain<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:54.799> you

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
the legacy was uncertain the if you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.649 
the legacy was uncertain the if you
break<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.310> stadium<00:01:55.940> into<00:01:56.119> various<00:01:56.390> different

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
break the stadium into various different

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.330 
break the stadium into various different
components<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.290> kid<00:01:57.470> two<00:01:57.560> parts<00:01:57.920> if<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.159> like

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
components a kid two parts if you like

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.539 
components a kid two parts if you like
then<00:01:58.850> each<00:01:59.060> part<00:01:59.570> can<00:01:59.990> have<00:02:00.140> its<00:02:00.320> own<00:02:00.440> life<00:02:00.740> so

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
then each part can have its own life so

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.249 
then each part can have its own life so
that<00:02:01.729> lower<00:02:01.940> tier<00:02:02.240> is<00:02:02.450> embedded<00:02:02.869> within<00:02:03.049> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
that lower tier is embedded within the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.740 
that lower tier is embedded within the
landscape<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.700> upper<00:02:04.970> tier<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:05.450> with<00:02:05.570> its

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
landscape the upper tier then with its

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.139 
landscape the upper tier then with its
seats<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.409> cannon<00:02:06.649> sit<00:02:06.860> above<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.729> that

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
seats that cannon sit above so that that

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.240 
seats that cannon sit above so that that
tier<00:02:08.450> can<00:02:08.690> be<00:02:08.959> scaled<00:02:09.229> appropriately<00:02:09.440> the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
tier can be scaled appropriately the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.670 
tier can be scaled appropriately the
roof<00:02:10.850> itself<00:02:11.239> is<00:02:11.450> separate<00:02:11.900> from<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.290> from

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
roof itself is separate from the from

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.070 
roof itself is separate from the from
the<00:02:12.709> upper<00:02:13.040> tier<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:14.540> theory<00:02:14.900> you

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the upper tier so that in theory you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.210 
the upper tier so that in theory you
could<00:02:15.200> actually<00:02:15.350> take<00:02:15.680> down<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.010> tier

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
could actually take down the tier

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.530 
could actually take down the tier
without<00:02:16.459> taking<00:02:16.760> down<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.000> roof<00:02:17.180> or<00:02:17.360> vice

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
without taking down the roof or vice

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.740 
without taking down the roof or vice
versa<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.560> flexibility<00:02:19.250> was<00:02:19.970> built<00:02:20.300> into

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
versa so the flexibility was built into

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.770 
versa so the flexibility was built into
the<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.470> overall<00:02:21.830> design<00:02:22.160> but<00:02:22.819> not<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:23.300> but

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the the overall design but not but but

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.479 
the the overall design but not but but
you<00:02:23.900> know<00:02:24.019> so<00:02:24.170> there<00:02:24.290> was<00:02:24.440> no<00:02:24.680> ultimate

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
you know so there was no ultimate

you know so there was no ultimate
compromised<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.510> real<00:02:26.810> real<00:02:27.530> difference<00:02:27.950> in

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
compromised a real real difference in

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.270 
compromised a real real difference in
what<00:02:28.310> we<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:29.230> how<00:02:30.230> we<00:02:30.290> approach<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:31.010> design

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
what we have how we approach the design

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.040 
what we have how we approach the design
of<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.459> stadium<00:02:31.640> was<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.569> really<00:02:32.870> rethink

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
of the stadium was to to really rethink

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.309 
of the stadium was to to really rethink
what<00:02:34.010> our<00:02:34.250> nation<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.880> permanence<00:02:35.510> was<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.140> so

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
what our nation of permanence was and so

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.340 
what our nation of permanence was and so
we<00:02:36.920> rather<00:02:37.340> than<00:02:37.489> using<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.450> word<00:02:38.600> temporary<00:02:39.200> we

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
we rather than using a word temporary we

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.380 
we rather than using a word temporary we
started<00:02:39.680> use<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.950> word<00:02:40.100> demountable<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.000> it

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
started use the word demountable and it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.600 
started use the word demountable and it
really<00:02:41.660> we<00:02:41.870> had<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.170> change<00:02:42.440> changed<00:02:43.220> up<00:02:43.370> our

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
really we had to change changed up our

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.970 
really we had to change changed up our
way<00:02:44.000> we<00:02:44.209> thought<00:02:44.450> about<00:02:44.860> materials<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
way we thought about materials the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.610 
way we thought about materials the
building<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:47.540> rap<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:47.780> example<00:02:48.290> around<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
building the rap for example around the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.590 
building the rap for example around the
outside<00:02:49.100> there<00:02:49.730> was<00:02:49.819> depth<00:02:50.030> never<00:02:50.330> going<00:02:50.540> to

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
outside there was depth never going to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.140 
outside there was depth never going to
be<00:02:50.690> out<00:02:50.810> any<00:02:50.989> appetite<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.739> build<00:02:51.980> a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
be out any appetite to build a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.789 
be out any appetite to build a
conventional<00:02:53.150> facade<00:02:53.480> system<00:02:53.989> around<00:02:54.560> that

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
conventional facade system around that

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.470 
conventional facade system around that
around<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.250> building<00:02:55.640> while<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.970> do<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.329> for

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
around the building while to do that for

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.060 
around the building while to do that for
two<00:02:56.660> weeks<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:56.989> doesn't<00:02:57.200> make<00:02:57.290> any<00:02:57.440> sense<00:02:57.709> and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
two weeks it doesn't make any sense and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.039 
two weeks it doesn't make any sense and
yeah<00:02:58.610> they<00:02:58.790> needed<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.120> be<00:02:59.180> something<00:02:59.570> that

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
yeah they needed to be something that

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.740 
yeah they needed to be something that
that<00:03:00.440> effectively<00:03:01.340> enclosed<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.299> stadium

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
that effectively enclosed the stadium

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.810 
that effectively enclosed the stadium
created<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.260> threshold<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.400> people<00:03:04.640> when<00:03:04.730> they

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
created a threshold so people when they

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.090 
created a threshold so people when they
entered<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.600> stadium<00:03:05.840> structure<00:03:06.470> they<00:03:06.859> knew

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
entered the stadium structure they knew

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.789 
entered the stadium structure they knew
they'd<00:03:07.310> arrived<00:03:07.760> there<00:03:08.359> is<00:03:08.690> simply<00:03:09.260> made<00:03:09.590> out

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
they'd arrived there is simply made out

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.210 
they'd arrived there is simply made out
of<00:03:09.950> ordinary<00:03:10.670> i<00:03:10.940> section<00:03:11.540> yeah<00:03:12.070> could<00:03:13.070> even

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
of ordinary i section yeah could even

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.190 
of ordinary i section yeah could even
described<00:03:13.549> as<00:03:13.670> cooking<00:03:14.030> steal<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.600> know<00:03:14.630> but

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
described as cooking steal you know but

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.930 
described as cooking steal you know but
we<00:03:15.320> all<00:03:15.500> get<00:03:15.680> mean<00:03:15.829> organize<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.459> in<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.579> simple

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
we all get mean organize it in a simple

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.910 
we all get mean organize it in a simple
geometry<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.450> painted<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.900> black<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.890> just

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
geometry and painted it black so it just

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.770 
geometry and painted it black so it just
disappears<00:03:19.609> into<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.910> background<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:20.480> all

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
disappears into the background and all

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.509 
disappears into the background and all
that<00:03:21.049> all<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.350> focus<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.799> on<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.040> roof<00:03:22.220> steel

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
that all the focus is on the roof steel

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.729 
that all the focus is on the roof steel
work<00:03:22.730> under<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> rap<00:03:24.109> in<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.320> foreground

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
work under and the rap in the foreground

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.620 
work under and the rap in the foreground
so<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.370> was<00:03:25.459> using<00:03:25.670> those<00:03:25.820> sort<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.090> techniques

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
so it was using those sort of techniques

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.330 
so it was using those sort of techniques
we<00:03:26.870> were<00:03:26.959> able<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.320> challenge<00:03:27.560> our<00:03:27.980> own

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
we were able to challenge our own

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.819 
we were able to challenge our own
perceptions<00:03:29.079> really<00:03:30.079> what<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.290> stadium<00:03:30.560> cook

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
perceptions really what a stadium cook

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.910 
perceptions really what a stadium cook
them<00:03:31.480> we<00:03:32.480> work<00:03:32.690> very<00:03:32.720> hard<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.290> make<00:03:33.410> sure<00:03:33.560> that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
them we work very hard to make sure that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.420
