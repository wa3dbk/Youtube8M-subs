00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
flywheels see these get keys whatever

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.670 
flywheels see these get keys whatever
they<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:43.020> welded<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.500> on

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
there so we can't see it we tried taking
the<00:00:45.180> flywheels<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.950> couldn't<00:00:48.590> so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the flywheels off and we couldn't so

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
the flywheels off and we couldn't so
what<00:00:50.160> we're<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.760> we're<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.329> to
