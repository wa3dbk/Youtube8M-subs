criticism and how to deal with that
someone<00:00:17.029> had<00:00:17.210> asked<00:00:17.420> me<00:00:17.480> recently<00:00:17.660> if<00:00:18.110> I<00:00:18.230> can

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
someone had asked me recently if I can

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.800 
someone had asked me recently if I can
do<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.500> video<00:00:18.710> on<00:00:19.150> how<00:00:20.150> to<00:00:20.180> deal<00:00:20.480> with<00:00:20.509> criticism

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
do a video on how to deal with criticism

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.990 
do a video on how to deal with criticism
and<00:00:21.349> I<00:00:21.680> thought<00:00:21.830> this<00:00:21.980> is<00:00:22.040> a<00:00:22.130> great<00:00:22.400> topic<00:00:22.670> but

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
and I thought this is a great topic but

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.030 
and I thought this is a great topic but
also<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.300> very<00:00:23.540> challenging<00:00:23.840> one<00:00:24.380> because<00:00:24.830> I

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
also a very challenging one because I

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.179 
also a very challenging one because I
think<00:00:25.610> that<00:00:25.820> everyone<00:00:26.750> deals<00:00:27.080> criticism<00:00:27.980> and

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
think that everyone deals criticism and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.490 
think that everyone deals criticism and
a<00:00:28.550> lot<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.060> different<00:00:29.720> people<00:00:29.810> deal<00:00:30.170> with<00:00:30.230> in

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
a lot and different people deal with in

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.109 
a lot and different people deal with in
different<00:00:30.890> ways<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.369> some<00:00:31.820> people<00:00:32.059> are

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
different ways and some people are

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.810 
different ways and some people are
affected<00:00:32.360> by<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:32.989> other<00:00:33.140> people<00:00:33.199> aren't

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
affected by it and other people aren't

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.770 
affected by it and other people aren't

intention<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.590> actually<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.950> positive<00:03:38.190> one

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
intention is actually a positive one

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.000 
intention is actually a positive one
then<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.840> don't<00:03:39.930> even<00:03:40.200> go<00:03:40.410> into<00:03:40.650> that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
then you don't even go into that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.370 
then you don't even go into that
negative<00:03:41.489> stuff<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.060> does<00:03:42.239> it's<00:03:42.510> no<00:03:42.720> longer<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
negative stuff it does it's no longer a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.120 
negative stuff it does it's no longer a
negative<00:03:44.130> criticism<00:03:44.760> but

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
negative criticism but

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.090 
negative criticism but
actually<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> constructive<00:03:46.360> criticism<00:03:47.080> but<00:03:47.950> on

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
actually a constructive criticism but on

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.760 
actually a constructive criticism but on
the<00:03:48.220> other<00:03:48.340> end<00:03:48.580> if<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.150> see<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:49.600> as<00:03:49.900> someone

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
the other end if you see it as someone

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.350 
the other end if you see it as someone
is<00:03:50.920> actually<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.730> know<00:03:51.820> really<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.270> a

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
is actually you know really in a

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.080 
is actually you know really in a
negative<00:03:52.720> place<00:03:52.900> then<00:03:53.410> maybe<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.760> don't<00:03:54.880> need

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
negative place then maybe you don't need

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.640 
negative place then maybe you don't need
to<00:03:55.180> even<00:03:55.330> defend<00:03:55.750> yourself<00:03:56.080> because<00:03:56.320> you<00:03:56.440> see

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
to even defend yourself because you see

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.280 
to even defend yourself because you see
it<00:03:56.740> for<00:03:56.920> what<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.070> is<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.460> see<00:03:57.490> that<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.450> you

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
it for what it is you see that that you

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.080 
it for what it is you see that that you
know<00:03:59.380> they're<00:03:59.590> just<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.920> foul<00:04:00.250> place<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:01.000> if

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
know they're just in a foul place and if

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.370 
know they're just in a foul place and if
it<00:04:01.240> wasn't<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.630> would<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:01.870> someone<00:04:02.230> else

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
it wasn't you would be someone else

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.650 
it wasn't you would be someone else
that's<00:04:02.620> receiving<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.460> and<00:04:04.180> maybe<00:04:04.420> it

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
that's receiving it and and maybe it

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.930 
that's receiving it and and maybe it
won't<00:04:04.780> hurt<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.110> as<00:04:05.350> much<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:06.520> know<00:04:06.640> so

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
won't hurt you as much you know so

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.910 
won't hurt you as much you know so
that's<00:04:07.390> one<00:04:07.750> thing<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.080> do<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.470> try<00:04:08.860> and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
that's one thing to do is to try and

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.620 
that's one thing to do is to try and
take<00:04:09.100> yourself<00:04:09.460> out<00:04:09.550> of<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.790> situation<00:04:09.970> and

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
take yourself out of the situation and

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.310 
take yourself out of the situation and
just<00:04:10.930> see<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.800> in<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.100> different<00:04:12.130> perspective

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
just see it in a different perspective

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.550 
just see it in a different perspective
the<00:04:14.320> next<00:04:14.590> suggestion<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.340> is<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:16.660> explore<00:04:17.290> how

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
the next suggestion to is to explore how

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.300 
the next suggestion to is to explore how
you<00:04:17.620> are<00:04:18.130> reacting<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:19.540> criticism<00:04:20.140> because<00:04:20.860> as

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
you are reacting to criticism because as

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.470 
you are reacting to criticism because as
I<00:04:21.430> mentioned<00:04:21.459> before<00:04:21.850> it's<00:04:22.150> one<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.390> those

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
I mentioned before it's one of those

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.420 
I mentioned before it's one of those
things<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:22.900> it<00:04:23.380> comes<00:04:23.830> through<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.130> heat<00:04:24.310> of

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
things that it comes through the heat of

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.670 
things that it comes through the heat of
the<00:04:24.520> moment<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.940> we<00:04:25.120> react<00:04:25.480> and<00:04:25.840> we<00:04:26.470> get

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the moment and we react and we get

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.880 
the moment and we react and we get
defensive<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.490> argumentative<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.020> and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
defensive and argumentative and and and

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.100 
defensive and argumentative and and and
get<00:04:30.220> into<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.460> fight<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.000> throw<00:04:31.480> criticism

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
get into a fight and throw criticism

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.780 
get into a fight and throw criticism
back<00:04:32.320> right<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:34.920> it's<00:04:35.920> something<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.430> can

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
back right and it's something that can

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.630 
back right and it's something that can
be<00:04:36.820> practiced<00:04:37.300> over<00:04:38.050> time<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.890> is<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.370> learn

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
be practiced over time is is to learn

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.830 
be practiced over time is is to learn
not<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.120> react<00:04:40.470> but<00:04:41.470> but<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.640> to<00:04:43.360> look<00:04:43.600> at<00:04:43.750> the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
not to react but but to to look at the

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.620 
not to react but but to to look at the
situation<00:04:44.020> for<00:04:44.650> what<00:04:44.920> it<00:04:44.980> is<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:46.300> be<00:04:46.420> more

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
situation for what it is and to be more

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.990 
situation for what it is and to be more
mindful<00:04:46.870> as<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.470> how<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:48.040> want<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.430> act<00:04:48.490> upon

take it on to hurt yourself or to hurt
that<00:04:59.320> person<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.950> think<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.670> most<00:05:00.820> negative

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
that person I think the most negative

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.450 
that person I think the most negative
thing<00:05:01.450> about<00:05:01.480> criticism<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:03.250> most

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
thing about criticism and the most

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.340 
thing about criticism and the most
destructive<00:05:03.790> thing<00:05:04.180> about<00:05:04.360> criticism<00:05:04.810> is<00:05:05.140> is

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
destructive thing about criticism is is

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.320 
destructive thing about criticism is is
that<00:05:05.890> a<00:05:05.920> lot<00:05:06.160> of<00:05:06.220> people<00:05:06.310> tend<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.790> take<00:05:07.030> that

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
that a lot of people tend to take that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.450 
that a lot of people tend to take that
criticism<00:05:07.510> on<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.410> hurt<00:05:08.680> themselves<00:05:08.860> with<00:05:09.250> it

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
criticism on and hurt themselves with it

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.700 
criticism on and hurt themselves with it
and<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.090> find<00:05:10.450> that's<00:05:10.690> where<00:05:11.050> people<00:05:11.170> struggle

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
and I find that's where people struggle

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.710 
and I find that's where people struggle
with<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:12.070> that<00:05:12.220> already<00:05:13.150> they're<00:05:13.420> dealing

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
with is that already they're dealing

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.270 
with is that already they're dealing
with<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.840> lot<00:05:14.020> of<00:05:14.080> negative<00:05:14.770> self<00:05:15.040> talk<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.580> lot

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
with a lot of negative self talk a lot

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.910 
with a lot of negative self talk a lot
times<00:05:16.520> people<00:05:16.730> sort<00:05:17.540> of<00:05:17.660> carry<00:05:18.200> you<00:05:18.560> know<00:05:18.650> just

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
times people sort of carry you know just

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.610 
times people sort of carry you know just
a<00:05:19.130> lot<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.639> self-criticism<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.870> then<00:05:21.500> when

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
a lot of self-criticism and then when

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.320 
a lot of self-criticism and then when
someone<00:05:21.980> else<00:05:22.100> criticizes<00:05:22.820> them<00:05:23.000> it's<00:05:23.180> like

something<00:06:58.039> that<00:06:58.070> that<00:06:58.820> we<00:06:58.940> need<00:06:59.120> to<00:06:59.210> be

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
something that that we need to be

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.400 
something that that we need to be
fighting<00:06:59.510> because<00:06:59.810> I<00:06:59.990> think<00:07:00.050> the<00:07:00.260> more

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
fighting because I think the more

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.040 
fighting because I think the more
someone<00:07:00.680> fights<00:07:01.220> it<00:07:01.460> and<00:07:01.669> the<00:07:02.210> more<00:07:02.360> we<00:07:02.419> become

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
someone fights it and the more we become

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.560 
someone fights it and the more we become
reactive<00:07:03.830> to<00:07:04.010> it<00:07:04.160> the<00:07:04.880> more<00:07:05.090> it<00:07:05.150> takes<00:07:05.360> on<00:07:05.539> a

reactive to it the more it takes on a

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.530 
reactive to it the more it takes on a
life<00:07:05.630> of<00:07:05.900> its<00:07:06.080> own

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540 
life of its own

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.620 
life of its own
and<00:07:06.800> it's<00:07:07.800> it's<00:07:08.250> about<00:07:08.550> so<00:07:08.820> stopping<00:07:09.360> it<00:07:09.480> in

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
its tracks so that's my view with

its tracks so that's my view with
criticism<00:07:13.110> and<00:07:14.010> my<00:07:14.790> suggestions<00:07:15.480> with
