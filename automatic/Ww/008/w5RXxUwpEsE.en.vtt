00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
also includes a utg railed base so that

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.930 
also includes a utg railed base so that
if<00:02:19.859> you<00:02:19.950> want<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> run<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:20.700> say<00:02:20.820> the

if you want to run this on the say the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.550 
if you want to run this on the say the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
front end of an a que you can run it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.520 
front end of an a que you can run it
without<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.980> base<00:02:23.160> or<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.940> an<00:02:24.030> ar-15<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.959> the

without the base or on an ar-15 on the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.199 
without the base or on an ar-15 on the
receiver<00:02:25.859> you<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.310> run<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.579> with<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.760> base<00:02:27.030> so

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
receiver you can run it with the base so

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.340 
receiver you can run it with the base so
it<00:02:27.329> comes<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:27.540> both<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:28.019> probably<00:02:28.290> the

it comes with both it's probably the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.479 
it comes with both it's probably the
most<00:02:28.470> versatile<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.160> their<00:02:29.310> sights

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
most versatile of all their sights

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.319 
most versatile of all their sights
because<00:02:29.609> it<00:02:29.790> comes<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.030> all<00:02:30.090> those<00:02:30.150> stuff

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
because it comes with all those stuff

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.630 
because it comes with all those stuff
with<00:02:30.560> Evan<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.799> he<00:02:32.780> used<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:34.049> light

sheet so take it away Evan what you
think<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.299> love<00:02:42.299> this<00:02:42.750> light<00:02:43.079> right<00:02:44.070> here

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
think of it I love this light right here

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.380 
think of it I love this light right here
you<00:02:44.459> can<00:02:45.410> beat<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.730> thing<00:02:47.910> even<00:02:48.329> though

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you can beat up the thing even though

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.199 
you can beat up the thing even though
it's<00:02:48.570> 450<00:02:49.260> lumens<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.890> how<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:51.000> designed

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
it's 450 lumens it's how it's designed

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.630 
it's 450 lumens it's how it's designed
it<00:02:51.780> actually<00:02:52.200> looks<00:02:52.409> like

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it actually looks like

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.210 
it actually looks like
like<00:02:53.730> an<00:02:53.819> 800<00:02:54.270> 700<00:02:54.870> lumen<00:02:55.140> light<00:02:55.380> doesn't<00:02:56.160> say

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
like an 800 700 lumen light doesn't say

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.160 
like an 800 700 lumen light doesn't say
more<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.490> concentrated<00:02:57.210> beam<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.810> candle

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
more of a concentrated beam the candle

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.900 
more of a concentrated beam the candle
watt<00:02:58.290> powers<00:02:58.590> higher<00:02:58.770> exactly<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.700> learned

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
watt powers higher exactly you learned

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.750 
watt powers higher exactly you learned
about<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.300> right<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:04.230> after<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:05.459> actually

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
about that right so after it actually

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.070 
about that right so after it actually
looks<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.970> lot<00:03:06.090> brighter<00:03:06.300> than<00:03:06.420> what<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.840> so

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
looks a lot brighter than what it is so

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.380 
looks a lot brighter than what it is so
I<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.980> fact<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.700> price<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.180> not

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
I really like that fact the price is not

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.050 
I really like that fact the price is not
bad<00:03:09.660> at<00:03:09.840> only<00:03:10.110> $97<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> base<00:03:11.820> light

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
bad at only $97 for just the base light

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.310 
bad at only $97 for just the base light
that's<00:03:12.360> including<00:03:12.720> tax<00:03:12.930> that's<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.290> our

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
that's including tax that's for our

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.710 
that's including tax that's for our
local<00:03:13.560> guess<00:03:13.830> that's<00:03:14.100> for<00:03:14.220> local<00:03:14.490> guys<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:15.240> also

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
local guess that's for local guys I also

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.360 
local guess that's for local guys I also
like<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.140> pressure<00:03:16.350> pad<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.950> compress

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
like the pressure pad that I compress

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.830 
like the pressure pad that I compress
approach<00:03:17.610> anywhere<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.270> this<00:03:18.420> pressure<00:03:18.630> bad

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
approach anywhere on this pressure bad

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.060 
approach anywhere on this pressure bad
in<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.050> light<00:03:19.230> work<00:03:19.470> I've<00:03:19.680> had<00:03:19.860> pressure

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
in this light work I've had pressure

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.830 
in this light work I've had pressure
pads<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.550> past<00:03:21.120> where<00:03:21.360> he<00:03:21.390> only<00:03:21.660> had<00:03:21.810> one

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
pads in the past where he only had one

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.290 
pads in the past where he only had one
spot<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.470> press<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> cords

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
spot you press and I like that the cords

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.270 
spot you press and I like that the cords
not<00:03:24.480> 15<00:03:24.840> feet<00:03:25.050> long<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.560> too<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.800> don't<00:03:26.010> like<00:03:26.100> I

30-foot long coiled line and I have as
you<00:03:34.769> can<00:03:34.920> see<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.100> like<00:03:35.370> wrap<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.820> around<00:03:35.940> stuff

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
you can see I like wrap it around stuff

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.060 
you can see I like wrap it around stuff
and<00:03:36.690> tie<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.900> knots<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> get<00:03:37.739> rid<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.980> all

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
and tie it knots just to get rid of all

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.009 
and tie it knots just to get rid of all
the<00:03:38.190> slack<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.670> it's<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.090> perfectly<00:03:39.420> it's

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
the slack so it's just perfectly it's

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.420 
the slack so it's just perfectly it's
just<00:03:40.080> right<00:03:40.320> here<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.620> side<00:03:40.860> it's<00:03:41.130> not<00:03:41.310> in

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
just right here on the side it's not in

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.650 
just right here on the side it's not in
the<00:03:41.489> way<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.700> anything<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.360> right<00:03:42.510> there

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
the way of anything and to right there

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.740 
the way of anything and to right there
on<00:03:42.750> top<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:43.260> also<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.880> what's<00:03:45.360> made<00:03:45.600> up

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
on top I also like the what's made up

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.420 
on top I also like the what's made up
it's<00:03:45.959> made<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.320> aluminum<00:03:46.800> so<00:03:47.010> it's<00:03:47.130> very

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
it's made of aluminum so it's very

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.030 
it's made of aluminum so it's very
durable<00:03:48.209> as<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.690> still<00:03:48.870> CNC<00:03:49.290> machining<00:03:49.739> see

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
durable as you still CNC machining see

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.380 
durable as you still CNC machining see
I've<00:03:50.190> already<00:03:50.310> beaten<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> crap<00:03:50.910> out<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.180> mine

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
I've already beaten the crap out of mine

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.090 
I've already beaten the crap out of mine
mine's<00:03:51.750> been<00:03:51.930> shot<00:03:52.230> all<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.709> kind<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:52.980> stuff

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
mine's been shot all that kind of stuff

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.420 
mine's been shot all that kind of stuff
and<00:03:53.519> still<00:03:54.510> works<00:03:54.690> perfectly<00:03:55.110> fine<00:03:55.430> even

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
and still works perfectly fine even

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.970 
and still works perfectly fine even
though<00:03:57.090> how<00:03:57.540> large<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.200> light<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.709> it's

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
though how large this light is it's

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.160 
though how large this light is it's
actually<00:03:59.610> very<00:03:59.880> lightweight<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.690> actually

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
actually very lightweight it's actually

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.110 
actually very lightweight it's actually
for<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.829> guy<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.220> about<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.670> same<00:04:02.880> weight

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
for this guy it's about the same weight

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.690 
for this guy it's about the same weight
so<00:04:03.510> it's<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:04.290> bad<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.590> don't<00:04:04.980> really<00:04:05.190> notice<00:04:05.400> it

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
so it's not bad I don't really notice it

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.840 
so it's not bad I don't really notice it
