 P 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.690
 Today I present to your attention 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.120
 flagship 2011 tv samsung 200 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.009
 thousand 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.059
 this is tv master classes first 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.149
 tv day 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.169
 which means he is incredibly first 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.029
 thin 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.679
 and incredibly light 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.339
 secondly, it is celebrated 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.369
 awesome pictures 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.820
 stunning contrast just because he 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.789
 belongs to the class and drivers 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.769
 besides this tv is different 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.710
 incredibly low power consumption 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.710
 which is typical for all drivers 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.330
 besides being master tv 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.310
 white day classes 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.080
 This TV belongs to the class 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.800
 TVs capable of showing 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.150
 three-dimensional image 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.170
 that is, it is a 3d TV 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.570
 what does it mean it means that at odessa 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.440
 and special 3d glasses we can enjoy 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.240
 three-dimensional picture 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.370
 n it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.680
 percent shutter 3d glasses and in principle itself 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.629
 this idea is not new last year 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.559
 ashamed samsung uses 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.600
 three-dimensional 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.630
 congestion on glasses but this year the quality is 3d 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.070
 the pictures are very transformed 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.409
 but underwent undergone changes 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260
 the percentage is in the following parameters 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.690
 First came the auto auto contrast feature. 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.760
 what does it mean it means that if u 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.240
 you have some object in the front 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.190
 plan 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.150
 correspondent and if there is any background then 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.270
 the foreground object becomes 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.100
 more contrast that is automatically 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.500
 adjusts the contrast 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.000
 front front objects 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.720
 what is behind is left without 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.660
 changes because of this and increasing depth 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.490
 also governor 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.320
 automatically adjusted 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.970
 that is, if the gate take the TV 2010 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.100
 years there was a night manual tuning 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 the depths here is the 2011 TV 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.220
 which can determine what 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.350
 is further what is closer 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.780
 There is already depending on what content 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 on the screen to adjust 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.830
 automatically creating depth 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.770
 somewhere more 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.940
 the percentage of three-dimensional cadet less 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.090
 in order to less tired eyes was 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.260
 greater comfort 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.170
 and besides this year, the scheduled time 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.350
 panel responses 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.830
 and at the same time percent 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.090
 reduced by falcon reduced time 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.130
 the work of the glasses themselves that is the speed 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.210
 Toggle shutter glasses too 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.880
 greatly increased 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.620
 because of this, it turns out we do not have 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.590
 no crosstalk that is, we 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.200
 look at three-dimensional images and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.229
 we get a clearer picture than 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.739
 Prof. You probably already know that Samsung. 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.439
 there is in three-dimensional 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.710
 image traditional feature 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.029
 we can transform 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.969
 and with 22 g signal 3d signal 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.619
 that is, a special envelope in which 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.229
 capable of any signal absolutely even from 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:41.109
 conventional television 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.359
 antennas 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.119
 convert translate three-dimensional 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:47.419
 and we can bring today 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.909
 tv home 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.559
 or even if we have no 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.230
 Three-dimensional blue area cocody cancellation 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.279
 consoles or computer even 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.609
 today internet events watch 3g 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:57.959
 a cat
