alright desktop so just booted into this
new<00:04:40.630> Metro<00:04:41.630> UI<00:04:41.960> in<00:04:42.530> their<00:04:43.100> face<00:04:44.230> my<00:04:45.230> first

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
new Metro UI in their face my first

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.430 
new Metro UI in their face my first
impression<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.690> looks<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:48.080> lot<00:04:48.230> like

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
impression that it it looks a lot like

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.080 
impression that it it looks a lot like
Windows<00:04:49.510> Phone<00:04:50.510> 7<00:04:51.490> but<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.730> think<00:04:52.970> it<00:04:53.060> looks

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
Windows Phone 7 but I think it looks

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.800 
Windows Phone 7 but I think it looks
really<00:04:53.300> nice<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:53.870> clean<00:04:54.140> I<00:04:54.170> guess<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.750> you

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
really nice and clean I guess I so you

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.380 
really nice and clean I guess I so you
don't<00:04:57.020> have<00:04:57.140> a<00:04:57.200> touchscreen<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.980> this<00:04:58.100> is

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
don't have a touchscreen and this is

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.480 
don't have a touchscreen and this is
more<00:04:59.390> orientated<00:05:00.080> for<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.560> but<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.890> think<00:05:04.400> it

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
more orientated for that but I think it

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.960 
more orientated for that but I think it
really<00:05:04.520> looks<00:05:05.330> slick<00:05:05.950> so<00:05:06.950> we're<00:05:07.730> at<00:05:07.820> the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
really looks slick so we're at the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.960 
really looks slick so we're at the
desktop<00:05:08.540> right<00:05:08.810> now<00:05:09.020> let's<00:05:09.650> see<00:05:09.860> if<00:05:10.100> I<00:05:10.220> can<00:05:10.250> get

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
desktop right now let's see if I can get

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.050 
desktop right now let's see if I can get
a<00:05:11.060> little<00:05:11.210> better<00:05:11.390> Oh<00:05:13.570> resolution<00:05:16.060> is

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
a little better Oh resolution is

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.970 
a little better Oh resolution is
actually<00:05:17.450> my<00:05:17.570> first<00:05:17.780> time<00:05:17.990> using<00:05:18.320> Windows<00:05:18.770> 8

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
put this in full screen check out that

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.980 
put this in full screen check out that
line<00:06:39.770> feature<00:06:40.130> all<00:06:41.120> right<00:06:41.270> so<00:06:41.690> this<00:06:41.780> actually

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
line feature all right so this actually

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.260 
line feature all right so this actually
looks<00:06:42.410> like<00:06:42.650> i'm<00:06:42.830> running<00:06:43.220> windows<00:06:44.080> 8<00:06:45.080> and<00:06:46.270> you

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
looks like i'm running windows 8 and you

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.250 
looks like i'm running windows 8 and you
can<00:06:47.480> actually<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:48.800> know<00:06:48.920> it's<00:06:49.990> lisa's<00:06:50.990> mouse

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
can actually you know it's lisa's mouse

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.160 
can actually you know it's lisa's mouse
again<00:06:51.440> you<00:06:52.340> can<00:06:52.550> change<00:06:53.000> the<00:06:53.510> settings<00:06:53.960> for

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
again you can change the settings for

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.000 
again you can change the settings for
this<00:06:54.260> virtual<00:06:54.710> machine<00:06:55.070> and<00:06:55.100> you<00:06:55.460> can<00:06:55.640> add

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
this virtual machine and you can add

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.610 
this virtual machine and you can add
more<00:06:58.010> ram<00:06:58.310> and<00:06:58.790> you<00:06:58.910> can<00:06:59.030> add<00:06:59.210> more<00:06:59.480> cores<00:07:00.260> and

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
more ram and you can add more cores and

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.580 
more ram and you can add more cores and
i'm<00:07:01.010> guessing<00:07:01.370> that<00:07:01.400> will<00:07:01.750> make<00:07:02.750> it<00:07:02.780> run<00:07:03.170> a<00:07:03.200> lot

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
i'm guessing that will make it run a lot

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.820 
i'm guessing that will make it run a lot
faster<00:07:03.620> but<00:07:04.460> i<00:07:04.900> won't<00:07:05.900> take<00:07:06.170> the<00:07:06.290> time<00:07:06.320> to<00:07:06.620> set

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
faster but i won't take the time to set

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.110 
faster but i won't take the time to set
that<00:07:07.040> um<00:07:08.980> alright<00:07:09.980> so<00:07:10.310> this<00:07:10.430> is<00:07:10.670> just<00:07:10.910> the
