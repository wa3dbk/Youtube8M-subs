00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.230
 the vegetable pan after waltraud becker 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 is indeed one of my favorite dishes 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 when it comes to cooking vegetables 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 and I have that in different 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.580
 variations cooked and cooked again and again 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.160
 It is also delicious if you are 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.859
 something dry for that now 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.529
 first water in the pan namely 100 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.269
 water I took it 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.820
 depending on the heerdt recommended maybe 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.489
 150 grams increase 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.010
 Take here 270 to 300 grams of vegetables 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.450
 for one person I count that that can 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 to be totally mixed I have this here 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.920
 extra very colorful by my vegetables 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 given supplies one can only one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.420
 take sort but looks very pretty 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 if it takes different varieties 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.730
 and then I put them next to each other 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.170
 Do not peel or listen to anything 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.399
 So to get the ones to steal is one 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.780
 I find very rough sin and also red 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.270
 beets thats usually when you see them 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.589
 today buys absolutely washed before 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.970
 the need to look again if they 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.350
 dirty you can wash it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350
 but you do not have to miss them either 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.250
 Fennel, too, must be natural 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.840
 nothing asked if there is not synonymous 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.070
 to wash off incident can be of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.070
 the root if it needs a bit 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.540
 cut something off and the nice thing about the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.380
 vegetables from is just talk 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.960
 to cut 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.280
 that somehow worked and you can do it 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.780
 quietly different long stew vegetables 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.490
 I have first in Europe 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.079
 taken because a little longer steams 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.000
 I do that on the whole 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.619
 not noticeable there are just some 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.829
 vegetables a bit softer and others 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.820
 are a bit bite-hard I like 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.070
 It would rather know who so happy to 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.409
 firm vegetables should eat once with eleven 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.060
 minutes only ten minutes to start sinking 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.060
 also a bit of the hearth so the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.000
 Induction cooker of the induction plate is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.890
 fast 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.299
 even a bit chicoree before 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.500
 tomato I is not even done 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.500
 but also a very nice addition 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.319
 so that he does not burn anything now I do 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.999
 the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:20.389
 whole vegetables down and on top 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:24.209
 I'll give you the floppy skirt right away 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:27.030
 followed flopping and eating has given so 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.409
 a bit of mince is missing and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.250
 also minced meat taste only secretly 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.079
 terrible so as to meat 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.639
 Minced meat is now a stupid 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.109
 But it is really very nice 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.639
 nice with vegetables together because it's one 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.829
 bit stronger is you can do that too 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.750
 but make with other cereal flakes 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.930
 ich finds halt with rock specially 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.469
 nice and 30 grams to 50 grams are 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.609
 sufficient and approach to make 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.549
 then you do not need to be so excited 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.169
 Either way there is something very many to 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.139
 So vegetables we eat a pan 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:01.370
 electrical blogger with whom I now the 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:05.340
 flops have been detected before lit up 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.159
 then he gets super flake energy 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.409
 through the beautiful big flakes 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:15.479
 here is my induction plate stray 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.579
 The organs on top of it have already been fast 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:19.500
 said then the lid is on it and 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.979
 the principle of the vegetable links that one 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.750
 let's boil than bring to a boil 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.790
 until steam escapes under the lid and 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.889
 then put on the smallest setting 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.979
 I start at 2000 watts that way 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.509
 called booster and right I cook 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:36.060
 then woke not always know so 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:38.729
 escapes under the lid because that is very 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.870
 important with taste goes off I have 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:43.439
 already a bit down before that 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.799
 and then I go straight on 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.780
 the lowest number of cases i have one 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.669
 whole for cooking slightly shortened the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.009
 only twelve now see 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.290
 the vegetable cooks I can because the 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.949
 also adjust that but one 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.449
 Induction plates quite wonderful 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:01.099
 publicly extremely short time away 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:03.659
 that just turns off after the time 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.979
 now and then if you go too strong me 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:10.049
 on temperature you can also equal 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:12.030
 then see here is already 60 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.009
 grad and then it stops cooking and 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.259
 I can go back to 300 grams 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:19.739
 and here I look 300 degrees 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:22.229
 presented here, I look just 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.460
 over example with the plate are very 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.199
 We were satisfied and had already 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.770
 Sworn if you break yourself 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.830
 Should there be an induction cooker 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.360
 to make a new flag a new one 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.069
 or whatever you should always 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.020
 briefly with why the knife try if 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.190
 that is really even you can also 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.289
 I also take a piece out 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.330
 ever when I'm in a hurry under 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.699
 hold cold water and then quickly 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.610
 food and serious enough is now 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.380
 I taste it with salt macadamia nut 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.150
 Oil vinegar Yes, I like it very much 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.440
 everything to conclude with that was the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.180
 Nutrients are not lost by cooking 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.400
 go 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.919
 and now the salt to the conclusion then 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.389
 right everything is mixed up and yes 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.620
 is all the food ready you can 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.810
 really do not say that that much now 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.740
 work was delicious 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.440
 can now have a bit of water 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.440
 admit that you can do that too 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.020
 so that also has a bit of consistency 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.159
 and not that dry you can do that 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.630
 keep if you want you can now 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.120
 I also like to make with sauce 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.440
 It absolutely not necessary than in a pot 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.969
 all delicious and lemon juice and 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.750
 Oil is always in delicious taste 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.270
 a warm meal 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.610
 who wants to cook that now 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.610
 good appetite while eating
