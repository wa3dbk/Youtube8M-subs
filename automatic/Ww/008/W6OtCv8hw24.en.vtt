you set it set it all all the daddies
it's<00:00:28.449> a<00:00:28.509> setup

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
it's a setup

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.019 
it's a setup
no<00:00:29.109> all<00:00:29.529> I<00:00:29.590> do<00:00:29.830> is<00:00:30.220> because<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.580> fully<00:00:30.789> loaded

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
no all I do is because the fully loaded

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.570 
no all I do is because the fully loaded
yeah<00:00:31.420> this<00:00:31.810> place<00:00:31.990> a<00:00:32.470> couple<00:00:33.129> of<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.309> shop

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
yeah this place a couple of the shop

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.840 
yeah this place a couple of the shop
either<00:00:33.820> side<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.629> float<00:00:34.870> yeah<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:36.670> no

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
either side of the float yeah there's no

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.340 
either side of the float yeah there's no
need<00:00:37.030> yeah<00:00:37.690> there's<00:00:37.870> no<00:00:37.960> need<00:00:38.110> for<00:00:38.140> any

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
need yeah there's no need for any

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.400 
need yeah there's no need for any
attachments<00:00:38.769> because<00:00:38.830> if<00:00:39.129> you<00:00:39.220> look<00:00:40.410> each

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
attachments because if you look each

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.529 
attachments because if you look each
flow<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:42.010> interchangeable<00:00:42.700> that<00:00:42.850> screws<00:00:43.329> out

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
flow is interchangeable that screws out

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.270 
flow is interchangeable that screws out
we<00:00:43.960> could<00:00:44.170> place<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.379> different<00:00:44.800> sized<00:00:44.950> float

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
we could place a different sized float

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.279 
we could place a different sized float
just<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.120> screw<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.420> different<00:00:46.780> sized<00:00:46.960> float

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
just to screw a different sized float

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.760 
just to screw a different sized float
into<00:00:47.620> that<00:00:47.739> slot<00:00:47.980> okay<00:00:48.760> then<00:00:49.420> then<00:00:50.379> does<00:00:50.559> shop

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
into that slot okay then then does shop

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.020 
into that slot okay then then does shop
just<00:00:50.890> lock<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.129> in<00:00:51.309> place<00:00:51.430> then<00:00:51.910> obviously

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
just lock it in place then obviously

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.729 
just lock it in place then obviously
stop<00:00:52.390> it<00:00:52.510> moving<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.870> any<00:00:53.050> unlocker

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
stop it moving on any unlocker

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.950 
stop it moving on any unlocker
when<00:00:54.280> I'm<00:00:54.370> casting<00:00:54.609> yeah<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.750> you're

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
when I'm casting yeah and you're

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.610 
when I'm casting yeah and you're
obviously<00:00:56.320> using<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.690> lasso<00:00:58.690> yeah<00:00:59.379> I'm<00:00:59.469> using

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
obviously using the lasso yeah I'm using

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.990 
obviously using the lasso yeah I'm using
the<00:00:59.769> lasso<00:01:00.039> auckland's<00:01:00.460> let<00:01:00.640> me<00:01:00.730> just<00:01:00.879> show

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
the lasso auckland's let me just show

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.599 
the lasso auckland's let me just show
you<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.300> simple<00:01:01.899> loop<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:03.160> attach<00:01:03.280> these

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
you the a simple loop to attach these

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.880 
you the a simple loop to attach these
lasses<00:01:04.089> all<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.660> do<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:04.869> fold<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.259> line<00:01:05.440> yeah

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
lasses all I do is fold the line yeah

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.880 
lasses all I do is fold the line yeah
look<00:01:06.340> at<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:07.030> go<00:01:07.300> through<00:01:07.600> once<00:01:08.350> that's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
look at that I go through once that's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.620 
look at that I go through once that's
just<00:01:09.039> called<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.460> single<00:01:09.789> overhand<00:01:10.179> knot<00:01:10.390> yeah

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
just called a single overhand knot yeah

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.810 
just called a single overhand knot yeah
I'll<00:01:10.899> go<00:01:11.080> through<00:01:11.320> twice<00:01:11.619> again<00:01:11.979> okay<00:01:12.520> that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
I'll go through twice again okay that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.980 
I'll go through twice again okay that
just<00:01:12.909> adds<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.180> little<00:01:13.330> bit<00:01:13.420> extra<00:01:13.570> strength

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
just adds a little bit extra strength

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.760 
just adds a little bit extra strength
yeah

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
yeah

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.050

Just<00:01:21.690> Swim<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.229> tag<00:01:22.380> end<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> pull<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.280> -

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
Just Swim the tag end off and pull it -

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.990 
Just Swim the tag end off and pull it -
yep<00:01:23.909> okay<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> using<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> these

yep okay and you using one of these
these<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.810> they've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:32.630> sliding

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
these are so good they've got a sliding

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.690 
these are so good they've got a sliding
float<00:01:34.020> slot<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> line<00:01:35.190> which<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
float slot on the on the line which just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.450 
float slot on the on the line which just
enables<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> lock<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> pallet<00:01:36.690> in<00:01:36.810> place

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
enables you to lock a pallet in place

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.920 
enables you to lock a pallet in place
there<00:01:38.460> called<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.759> MIDI<00:01:39.030> laughs<00:01:39.420> oh<00:01:39.600> yeah

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
there called the MIDI laughs oh yeah

sooo yeah let me just show you how I'll

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.030 
sooo yeah let me just show you how I'll
attach<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> beste<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.799> always

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
attach this on for the beste it's always

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
attach this on for the beste it's always
better<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> loop<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.820> hook<00:01:44.970> length<00:01:45.210> over<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
better to loop the hook length over the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
better to loop the hook length over the
mainline<00:01:46.259> loop<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
mainline loop not the other way not the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.399 
mainline loop not the other way not the
other<00:01:48.149> way<00:01:48.240> around<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.630> shall<00:01:48.810> create<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> kink

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
other way around I shall create a kink

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.050 
other way around I shall create a kink
in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> line<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.190> then<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.490> straight<00:01:50.850> through

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
in the line and then go straight through

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.190 
in the line and then go straight through
okay<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.440> one<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:52.830> yeah<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:55.020> white

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
okay with that one there yeah that white

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
okay with that one there yeah that white
forms<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> figure<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.220> fit<00:01:56.429> that<00:01:56.580> way<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
forms a figure over that fit that way it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.430 
forms a figure over that fit that way it
forms<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> figure<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.660> of<00:01:57.929> eight<00:01:58.050> is<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
forms a figure like that of eight is it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.490 
forms a figure like that of eight is it
as<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> folds<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.039> pull<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> tight<00:02:00.500> and

fish on the same pallet that way and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.810 
fish on the same pallet that way and
make<00:02:40.470> obviously<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.430> method<00:02:41.730> I'm

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
make obviously with this method I'm

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.280 
make obviously with this method I'm
making<00:02:42.150> hundreds<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.690> cash<00:02:42.870> during<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.170> day

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
making hundreds of cash during the day

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.069 
making hundreds of cash during the day
it<00:02:43.829> just<00:02:43.890> save<00:02:44.220> time<00:02:44.519> at<00:02:44.670> each<00:02:45.540> time<00:02:45.780> when<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
it just save time at each time when the

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.539 
it just save time at each time when the
paddock<00:02:46.380> comes<00:02:46.590> off<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.130> slide<00:02:47.340> just

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
paddock comes off you just slide just

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.280 
paddock comes off you just slide just
slide<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.239> decide<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> float<00:02:48.780> stop<00:02:48.989> back<00:02:49.140> up

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
slide to decide the float stop back up

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.830 
slide to decide the float stop back up
take<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> Pat<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.430> out<00:02:50.640> bought<00:02:51.420> fresh<00:02:51.600> money

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
take it Pat it out bought fresh money

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.560 
take it Pat it out bought fresh money
and<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.739> were<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:52.950> really<00:02:53.310> simple<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.030> another

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and you were a really simple but another

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.140 
and you were a really simple but another
brilliant<00:02:54.750> idea
