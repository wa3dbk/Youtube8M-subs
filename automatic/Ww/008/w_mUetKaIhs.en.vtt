00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
 That's the whole system 

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.682
 GSM repeater 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.380
 Test phone Samsung with Android. 

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.033
 Ettus USRP N210 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.900
 egh .. egh ... 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.490
 GPS receiver for USRP 

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:55.200
 A computer with the OpenBTS program installed 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 The phone has a T-mobile SIM card 

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:34.400
 The phone is still connected to the T-mobile transmitters for the time being. We make a test connection to any number. 

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.800
 I did not complete the account:) 

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:07.000
 Receive power from the T-mobile transmitter -57 dBm 

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:19.700
 We are launching the GSM network including the OpenBTS program 

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:40.800
 We are now launching the OpenBTS console 

00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:50.637
 The "tmsis" command allows you to display the IMSI number of connected phones to my GSM network 

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:57.985
 As you can see the phone next to it automatically changed the network from T-mobile to mine, and this is its IMSI number. 

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:17.800
 We check if you can call an external phone number. This should not be possible because my network is not connected to the commercial architecture of the GSM network 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.520
 As you can see "silence." The phone is connected to my transmitter, not the T-mobile network. 

00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:56.234
 The phone thinks it is still in T-mobile, but that's not true. 

00:03:59.363 --> 00:04:09.663
 The power of receiving the signal from the transmitter of my network is -65 dBm (I did not even switch on the amplifier). With the amplifier turned on it would be around -22 dBm (in fact, it translates into a range of about 30 meters through walls) 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.360
 Send an SMS from the OpenBTS console to the phone. 

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:48.292
 As you can see, the IMSI number itself is enough. You do not need a phone number. 

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:18.215
 And is :) 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.251
 Gites :) 

00:05:46.251 --> 00:06:00.391
 I would add that the phone would choose my network instead of commercial, also about 30 meters away from the whole system. I put it close to make it easier to record a movie.
