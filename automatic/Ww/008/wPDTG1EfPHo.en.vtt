at this big wall of mountains that just
rises<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:34.159> these<00:01:35.159> geese

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
rises up out of it all so these geese

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.429 
rises up out of it all so these geese
that<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:37.079> flown<00:01:38.060> here<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> freeze<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.170> have

that have flown here to freeze out have

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.609 
that have flown here to freeze out have
flown<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> nonstop<00:01:41.729> flight<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.710> 600<00:01:43.710> miles
