right now is digging holes and the back
of<00:03:42.600> his<00:03:42.690> yard<00:03:42.959> in<00:03:43.200> his<00:03:43.470> backyard<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.730> keep

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
of his yard in his backyard and I keep

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.760 
of his yard in his backyard and I keep
thinking<00:03:45.300> like<00:03:45.450> if<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.989> dog<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.230> got<00:03:46.590> more

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
thinking like if that dog just got more

exercise<00:03:48.410> she<00:03:49.410> might<00:03:49.680> not<00:03:49.980> be<00:03:50.280> diggin<00:03:50.670> but<00:03:51.209> i

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
exercise she might not be diggin but i

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.270 
exercise she might not be diggin but i
don't<00:03:51.600> really<00:03:51.660> know<00:03:51.780> that's<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.830> really<00:03:53.070> fair

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
don't really know that's not really fair

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.710 
don't really know that's not really fair
i<00:03:53.340> guess<00:03:53.610> because<00:03:53.790> i<00:03:53.970> don't<00:03:54.239> really<00:03:54.360> know<00:03:54.480> much

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
i guess because i don't really know much

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.810 
i guess because i don't really know much
about<00:03:54.870> dogs<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:56.130> know<00:03:56.310> whether<00:03:56.550> or<00:03:56.640> not

about dogs to know whether or not

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.400 
about dogs to know whether or not
digging<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:58.280> because<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.310> lack<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.640> exercise

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
digging is because of lack of exercise

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.660 
digging is because of lack of exercise

and let me know but that's another

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.490 
and let me know but that's another
important<00:04:05.760> thing<00:04:05.880> if<00:04:06.269> cat<00:04:06.720> doesn't<00:04:06.959> isn't

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
important thing if cat doesn't isn't

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.170 
important thing if cat doesn't isn't
allowed<00:04:07.739> outside<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.640> doesn't<00:04:08.910> have<00:04:09.060> the
