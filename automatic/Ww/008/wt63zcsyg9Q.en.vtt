00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:09.880
Yeah

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.243
Oh

00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:19.741
This verse starts from the bottom from the past

00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:22.768
When all the people told you you was never gonna last

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.012
And life is so slow, but we moving so fast

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:29.617
so I don't have time to do what I think I must

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:32.791
And love, money and all, is looking like a plus

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.481
And I should have them all, 
but I ain't that good at maths

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:39.508
So, I keep the flow, I look for inspiration

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.820
I swear I do it all, man I'm tryna raise my nation

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:46.502
Thank me for this? no mention, this is worldwide

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:48.444
Now welcome to my section

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:51.510
Staying on my past man that shit is just too old

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.852
I tryna look forward but my forward can't score

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.025
White and from Spain man is all against my own

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.174
Victory and pain, man that's all I have been told

00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:04.390
Cooler than winter, overnight Outta control

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:07.634
And girls wanna have fun, 
but that ain't all what they want

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:11.756
And feels like lately I aint been feeling shit

00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:14.412
But I can't help it, my life style is sick, oh

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.627
It's all a dream, but it feels good

00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:21.003
my thoughts are bread, my head is the soup

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:24.114
Got a lot to say, got a lot to prove

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:27.654
Some say I don't deserve,
some say that I'm too good

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.872
But I can't fade the people trust, even I'm not begging

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:33.912
I can't feel the words that I'm not saying

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.801
in the game girl, but I'm not playing

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.425
Just keep it up girl, hope keeps me praying

00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:42.926
I did it all because I knew I could

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.952
And while I'm home staying, lately I've been good

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:49.191
I won't forget anyone once I leave the hood

00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:52.401
Hope you get this babe, but I'm misunderstood

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:58.865
Oh don't pretend,
don't hide your feelings

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.366
Just let it out

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:05.489
Don't be ashamed
cuz we are in love

00:02:05.703 --> 00:02:08.649
I'm in love with you, 
and I know you love me too, baby

00:02:08.838 --> 00:02:11.929
Might seem like I do, 
but I'm not talking about a lady

00:02:12.144 --> 00:02:14.412
I treat music like it was one, I mean

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.000
I gave her flowers, keep it ours 
and for hours we talk

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:21.103
And I caress her melodies 
when she gets out the shower

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.743
Then I hug her, then I kiss her,
then we start to sing louder, but

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.494
Don't get me wrong, 
I am waiting till we marry

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.108
If I'm ready, I say very, 
so my album let it drop huh!

00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:33.801
Mixtape's good, but let's take it more high

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:37.021
Had a lot of other girlfriends 
but you're definitely my type

00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.261
Wanna be a better singer, 
put a ring on your finger

00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:43.389
So you're in your best dress 
and I'm on my suit and tie

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:46.676
And as long as I got my suit and tie

00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:49.892
Imma, imma stay with her till one of us dies

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:53.027
And I hope it's me, cause if she shall be

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.365
Then the world will be much worse for us

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.551
And as long as I got my suit and tie

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.535

00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:05.761

Shout out to my city thought, I hardly been in town

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:37.841
Shout out to my brother man, 
he's always been around

00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:41.086
I'm surrounded by water, 
Poseidon where is my crown?

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:44.442
Feel the silence on my mind, transmitted as a sound

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:48.007
Believe me when I say, in your head it will resound

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:51.418
All I need is a beat, go slow, and then repeat

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.585
Baby girl, this goes to you, 
I love when you make me sing

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:57.846

Surprised for your beauty, 
no words, just wow!

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.896
Maybe I'm selfish, sometimes I feel like this

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.240
You and me, girl nothing else that I need

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:10.371
Just kiss you and then feel you
