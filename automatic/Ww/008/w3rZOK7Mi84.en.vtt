00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
like a woody call those extension things

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
like a woody call those extension things
I<00:00:37.469> don't<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.920> outlet<00:00:38.280> extension<00:00:39.090> stuffs

I don't know the outlet extension stuffs

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.569 
I don't know the outlet extension stuffs
yeah<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.110> mean<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.620> an<00:00:41.070> old<00:00:41.250> piece<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> crap

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
yeah I mean it's an old piece of crap

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.819 
yeah I mean it's an old piece of crap
anyways<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.270> two<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> outlets<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
anyways like two of the outlets for that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
anyways like two of the outlets for that
thing<00:00:44.010> doesn't<00:00:44.640> work<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> i<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> last

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
thing doesn't work and i think the last

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
thing doesn't work and i think the last
one<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.550> something<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.879> so

one is a going or something like that so

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.380 
one is a going or something like that so
