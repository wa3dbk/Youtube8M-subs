00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
or you know you can always put in a
traveling<00:00:35.100> bag<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.550> anyplace<00:00:36.000> anywhere<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
traveling bag or anyplace anywhere I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.250 
traveling bag or anyplace anywhere I
guess<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.790> use<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.090> traveling<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.690> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
guess and use it for traveling so this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.010 
guess and use it for traveling so this
is<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.739> believe<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.430> perfect<00:00:41.879> for

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
is I believe this is perfect for

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
is I believe this is perfect for
traveling<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> places<00:00:43.350> especially<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.190> cars

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
traveling to places especially in cars

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.799 
traveling to places especially in cars
or<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.180> planes<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.680> actually

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
or in planes because these are actually

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.479 
or in planes because these are actually
noise<00:00:48.809> cancelling<00:00:49.350> headphones<00:00:49.800> well<00:00:50.370> not

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
noise cancelling headphones well not

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.930 
noise cancelling headphones well not
exactly<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.850> cancel<00:00:53.850> out

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
exactly but they do actually cancel out

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
exactly but they do actually cancel out
some<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> noise<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.350> guys<00:00:55.500> notice

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
some of the noise now if you guys notice

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.619 
some of the noise now if you guys notice
you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> actually<00:00:56.760> see<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
you can actually see that in the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
you can actually see that in the
headband<00:00:58.020> part<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.460> steel

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
headband part it's actually steel

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.240 
headband part it's actually steel
reinforced<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.899> very<00:01:01.140> very<00:01:01.410> durable<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
reinforced so it's very very durable and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.810 
reinforced so it's very very durable and
in<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> doesn't<00:01:03.870> Bend<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> easily

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
in and it doesn't Bend that easily

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
in and it doesn't Bend that easily
although<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.240> steel<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.720> mean<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.920> might

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
although it is steel I mean it might

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.940 
although it is steel I mean it might
break<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.900> only<00:01:10.200> if<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> lot

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
break but that's only if you put a lot

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.640 
break but that's only if you put a lot
of<00:01:11.100> pressure<00:01:11.280> onto<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
of pressure onto it if you use it with a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.219 
of pressure onto it if you use it with a
great<00:01:13.830> care<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.240> break<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
great care it will not break at all and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.010 
great care it will not break at all and
it's<00:01:16.530> very<00:01:16.770> very<00:01:17.250> nice<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.790> these<00:01:18.750> type<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
it's very very nice for these type of
compact<00:01:19.830> headphones<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.939> they

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
compact headphones because you know they

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
compact headphones because you know they
can<00:01:21.299> probably<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.380> squished<00:01:22.799> inside<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.369> your

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
can probably get squished inside of your

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.910 
can probably get squished inside of your
traveling<00:01:23.880> bag<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.270> you're<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.570> careful<00:01:24.920> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
is probably very nice for that since

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.130 
is probably very nice for that since
it's<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.439> strong<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> durable<00:01:29.869> now<00:01:30.869> there's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it's very strong and durable now there's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.980 
it's very strong and durable now there's
actually<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.619> volume<00:01:32.070> control<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910 
instead of actually taking out your mp3
player<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.500> nice<00:01:55.710> feature

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
player so this is a very nice feature

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
player so this is a very nice feature
you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> always<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:57.840> volume<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you can always have your volume all the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
you can always have your volume all the
way<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:59.070> mp3<00:01:59.219> player<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.969> they<00:02:00.299> can

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
way up on your mp3 player and they can

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.580 
way up on your mp3 player and they can
always<00:02:00.600> adjust<00:02:01.009> volume<00:02:02.009> controls<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.590> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
always adjust volume controls so it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.649 
always adjust volume controls so it's
actually<00:02:04.770> very<00:02:05.100> very<00:02:05.399> useful<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:06.090> you're<00:02:06.509> that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
actually very very useful if you're that

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.440 
actually very very useful if you're that
kind<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.990> person<00:02:07.350> who<00:02:07.469> travels<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.979> lot<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.310> I

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
kind of person who travels a lot and I

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.630 
kind of person who travels a lot and I
mean<00:02:09.450> generally<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.080> consumers<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.800> volume

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
mean generally for consumers the volume

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.309 
mean generally for consumers the volume
control<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.060> very

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
control is very

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.800 
control is very
useful<00:02:12.909> by<00:02:13.909> looking<00:02:14.209> at<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.390> headphones

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
useful by looking at the headphones

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.929 
useful by looking at the headphones
itself<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.439> probably<00:02:16.010> realize<00:02:16.519> that<00:02:16.790> there's

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
itself you probably realize that there's

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.929 
itself you probably realize that there's
actually<00:02:17.389> a<00:02:17.659> lot<00:02:18.139> of<00:02:18.290> padding<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.859> it<00:02:18.939> there's

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
actually a lot of padding on it there's

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.640 
actually a lot of padding on it there's
padding<00:02:20.239> on<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.659> headband<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
padding on the headband and the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.129 
padding on the headband and the
earphones<00:02:22.099> are<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.819> ear<00:02:23.120> part<00:02:23.389> itself

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.139 
earphones are the ear part itself

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.770 
earphones are the ear part itself
now<00:02:24.889> these<00:02:25.129> padding's<00:02:25.700> are<00:02:25.879> very<00:02:26.389> very

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
now these padding's are very very

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.220 
now these padding's are very very
comfortable<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.650> they<00:02:28.489> actually<00:02:29.230> council

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
comfortable and they actually council

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.860 
comfortable and they actually council
out<00:02:30.349> some<00:02:30.889> of<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.069> noise<00:02:31.420> outside<00:02:32.420> while

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
out some of the noise outside while

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.500 
out some of the noise outside while
you're<00:02:33.049> wearing<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.189> has<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.549> special

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
you're wearing it so it has this special

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.709 
you're wearing it so it has this special
design<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:37.010> helps<00:02:37.400> create<00:02:37.909> a<00:02:38.299> noise

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
design to it that helps create a noise

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.069 
design to it that helps create a noise
cancellation<00:02:39.530> right<00:02:40.099> on<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.459> headphones<00:02:41.079> so

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
cancellation right on the headphones so

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.319 
cancellation right on the headphones so
although<00:02:42.469> it<00:02:42.799> this<00:02:42.980> isn't<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.609> specific<00:02:43.819> model

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
although it this isn't a specific model

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.990 
although it this isn't a specific model
for<00:02:44.989> noise<00:02:45.230> cancelling<00:02:45.799> this<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.489> actually<00:02:46.969> a

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
for noise cancelling this is actually a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.720 
for noise cancelling this is actually a
very<00:02:47.269> nice<00:02:47.450> headphone<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.469> cancel<00:02:49.430> out<00:02:49.519> some

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
very nice headphone that cancel out some

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.179 
very nice headphone that cancel out some
of<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:49.909> noise<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.569> not<00:02:50.599> all<00:02:50.900> obviously<00:02:51.530> if

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
of the noise but not all obviously if

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.629 
of the noise but not all obviously if
you<00:02:52.400> would<00:02:52.760> probably<00:02:53.480> spend<00:02:54.139> about<00:02:54.590> $200<00:02:55.430> on

you would probably spend about $200 on

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.879 
you would probably spend about $200 on
noise<00:02:56.209> cancelling<00:02:56.689> headphones<00:02:56.719> but<00:02:57.349> these

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
they really look nice the design of this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.119 
they really look nice the design of this
looked<00:03:55.430> very<00:03:55.609> nice<00:03:55.849> especially<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:56.569> white<00:03:56.810> and

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
looked very nice especially in white and

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.280 
looked very nice especially in white and
they<00:03:58.129> did<00:03:58.699> really<00:03:59.060> remind<00:03:59.479> me<00:03:59.599> of<00:03:59.629> the<00:03:59.810> dr.<00:04:00.139> dre

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
they did really remind me of the dr. dre

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.499 
they did really remind me of the dr. dre
headphones<00:04:00.349> that<00:04:00.949> they<00:04:01.099> currently<00:04:01.849> sell<00:04:02.239> and

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:02.509 
headphones that they currently sell and

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.920 
headphones that they currently sell and
I<00:04:03.349> think<00:04:04.219> that<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:04.699> design<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.329> very<00:04:05.509> very

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
I think that this design is very very

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.819 
I think that this design is very very
nice<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:07.340> know<00:04:07.629> like<00:04:08.629> I<00:04:08.780> said<00:04:08.840> into<00:04:09.229> all<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
nice you know like I said into all the

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.539 
nice you know like I said into all the
previous<00:04:10.219> clips<00:04:10.459> here<00:04:11.229> the<00:04:12.229> design<00:04:12.650> the

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
previous clips here the design the

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.999 
previous clips here the design the
padding<00:04:13.969> and<00:04:14.299> everything<00:04:14.840> this<00:04:15.409> actually

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
padding and everything this actually

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.039 
padding and everything this actually
seems<00:04:16.639> like<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:17.150> very<00:04:17.449> very<00:04:17.509> good<00:04:17.870> deal

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
seems like a very very good deal

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.960 
seems like a very very good deal
especially<00:04:18.769> for<00:04:18.949> $50<00:04:19.639> and

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
especially for $50 and

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.340 
especially for $50 and
I<00:04:21.000> really<00:04:21.239> think<00:04:21.480> that<00:04:21.540> this<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.959> must-buy

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
I really think that this is a must-buy

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.490 
I really think that this is a must-buy

throughout this whole review but you

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.340 
throughout this whole review but you
know<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:41.030> believe<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.870> headphone

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
know I believe that this headphone

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.650 
know I believe that this headphone
actually<00:04:43.890> lacks<00:04:44.190> some<00:04:44.520> bass<00:04:44.730> just<00:04:45.150> some<00:04:45.390> of<00:04:45.510> it

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
actually lacks some bass just some of it

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.070 
actually lacks some bass just some of it
not<00:04:46.500> too<00:04:46.890> much<00:04:47.100> but<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.820> does<00:04:48.090> lack<00:04:48.330> bass<00:04:48.600> in<00:04:48.900> my

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
not too much but it does lack bass in my

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.710 
not too much but it does lack bass in my
opinion<00:04:49.530> especially<00:04:50.040> in<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.610> type<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:50.910> music

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
opinion especially in the type of music

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.400 
opinion especially in the type of music
I<00:04:51.810> listen<00:04:52.080> to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
honestly with the sound quality but it

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.850 
honestly with the sound quality but it
totally<00:05:04.920> blows<00:05:05.460> away<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.850> lot<00:05:06.330> of<00:05:06.360> my<00:05:06.780> other<00:05:07.290> ear

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860

and<00:05:09.900> this<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:10.890> probably<00:05:11.400> going<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.640> be<00:05:11.760> my

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
and this is probably going to be my

and this is probably going to be my
primary<00:05:12.270> headphone<00:05:13.880> you<00:05:14.880> know<00:05:15.000> for<00:05:15.330> traveling

especially<00:05:16.220> but<00:05:17.220> also<00:05:17.430> taking<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.270> throughout

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
especially but also taking it throughout

especially but also taking it throughout
my<00:05:18.840> car<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.470> when<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.220> go<00:05:20.400> to<00:05:20.460> my<00:05:20.640> friend's

my car and when I go to my friend's
house<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.510> things<00:05:21.780> like<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:21.960> because<00:05:22.260> like

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
house and things like that because like

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.740 
house and things like that because like
I<00:05:23.130> said<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.490> like<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.669> guys<00:05:23.850> saw<00:05:24.090> it's<00:05:24.419> very

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
I said it like you guys saw it's very

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.350 
I said it like you guys saw it's very
very<00:05:24.960> compact<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.650> very<00:05:25.770> portable<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.120> I

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
very compact and very portable so I

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.230 
very compact and very portable so I
really<00:05:27.780> like<00:05:27.960> that<00:05:27.990> feature<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:30.030> sound

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
really like that feature and the sound

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.840 
really like that feature and the sound
quality<00:05:30.390> is<00:05:30.630> actually<00:05:31.140> pretty<00:05:32.040> amazing<00:05:32.220> but

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
quality is actually pretty amazing but

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.840 
quality is actually pretty amazing but
it<00:05:32.940> just<00:05:33.120> lacks<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.480> bass<00:05:33.890> so<00:05:34.890> that's<00:05:35.430> just<00:05:35.610> my

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
it just lacks the bass so that's just my

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.210 
it just lacks the bass so that's just my
opinion<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:37.440> really<00:05:37.650> depends<00:05:38.010> on<00:05:38.130> what

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
opinion and it really depends on what

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.060 
opinion and it really depends on what
kind<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.460> music<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.850> listen<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.500> but<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:41.040> know
