that's how there's would look we have

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.920 
that's how there's would look we have
the<00:05:27.050> adapter<00:05:27.320> here<00:05:27.740> which<00:05:28.460> currently<00:05:28.789> goes<00:05:29.000> on

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
the adapter here which currently goes on

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.040 
the adapter here which currently goes on
top<00:05:30.229> it's<00:05:31.159> kind<00:05:31.400> of<00:05:31.490> big<00:05:31.759> I<00:05:32.090> would<00:05:32.900> like

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050

something<00:05:33.259> smaller<00:05:33.789> no<00:05:34.789> just<00:05:35.120> kind<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.449> it's

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
something smaller no just kind of it's

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.540 
something smaller no just kind of it's
pretty<00:05:36.110> big<00:05:36.380> here<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.710> hange<00:05:37.009> know<00:05:37.310> you<00:05:37.370> know

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
pretty big here in a hange know you know

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.460 
pretty big here in a hange know you know
how<00:05:37.639> the<00:05:37.699> sockets<00:05:38.180> are<00:05:38.300> with<00:05:38.539> a<00:05:38.840> big<00:05:39.139> it<00:05:39.259> loose

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
how the sockets are with a big it loose
