00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to show you how these numbers will

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
to show you how these numbers will
change<00:01:52.140> once<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.220> actually<00:01:53.460> start

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
change once we actually start

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.630 
change once we actually start
downloading<00:01:54.390> some<00:01:54.630> content<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.189> here

transmitting over here and we'll see
these<00:02:02.790> numbers<00:02:03.060> change<00:02:03.119> once<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.899> start<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
these numbers change once I start the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
these numbers change once I start the
YouTube<00:02:05.310> video

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.130 

and<00:02:19.260> let's<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.740> back<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.040> our<00:02:20.070> monitor<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.180> we

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and let's go back to our monitor and we

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.100 
and let's go back to our monitor and we
can<00:02:22.320> see<00:02:22.650> how<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.040> numbers<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.520> changing<00:02:23.700> now

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
can see how the numbers are changing now

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.610 
can see how the numbers are changing now
once<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> video<00:02:25.590> has<00:02:25.680> started<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.460> stream<00:02:27.620> you

diminish starts to read and you can see

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.160 
diminish starts to read and you can see
here<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.360> numbers<00:02:36.660> are<00:02:36.780> starting<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.110> change

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
here the numbers are starting to change

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.640 
here the numbers are starting to change
