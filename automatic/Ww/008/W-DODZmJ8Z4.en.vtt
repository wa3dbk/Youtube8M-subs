00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.850
 They drove on the ranks of a program off energy efficient fame 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.770
 Sports field so the topic is talking yes 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.170
 As a Fourth Partner for the sake of Parking Majesties TrueCrypt 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:14.579
 Pressel par excellence 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.149
 yes that is unfortunately so many drivers in that direction around 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.310
 "We need love 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.150
 that something like power supply something you have to know but that one 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.560
 Plasma has had special ability to save Schum in the schools 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.939
 I no enemy picture No 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.810
 if you look at us at the places where the dumb Schwarzenberg has 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.150
 Canepa had a special technology 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.370
 privately let the stables year consciously so they need practical 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.350
 not be ignited then need for this dark picture content too 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 no straw 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.590
 that is clear 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.570
 very dependent on Maccabi Haifa 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.190
 you hear energy and energetic Roger Liebi changes in the picture here 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.060
 if i have a very bright picture of worker example i look at it now 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.350
 I would prefer to be relatively close to its maximum value 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.460
 But if I look at a game room Google often gets a lot of dark in the country up to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.460
 60 70 percent are demolished a spiritually republic 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.850
 Physical education teacher in place and in the buzzer because the TV watching it at 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.410
 Evening SR then about in this regard 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.640
 again a bit further 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 but we still do not let passengers get away with it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.260
 said we also want another option again and again groups 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.159
 and use 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.830
 that he can further reduce this power consumption 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 there is us 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.690
 one more thing 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.400
 he already knows that there are already some great NCAR in Boulder 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.120
 Watch TV 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.829
 yes, but only if he 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.600
 pro brought back as technology that was the TV in addition too 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.779
 still have a small sensor, the possibility never after the 

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:41.510
 To look at conversion 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.800
 So that means when a room 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.730
 Illuminated even almost not lit then I would like 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.620
 not so much brightness and contrast smoke send them to me and 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.100
 I'm exhausting for myself 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.140
 and then he liked to hear that say back a bit now 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.960
 also not new pleasant to see the sun, of course, very supportive 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.030
 in the case that these devices to a lowering of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.480
 Brightness and contrast trade 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.149
 Percent turn condition open 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.220
 to claim 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.869
 I then reconnect to a citizenship works and I have the sensor 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.969
 possibility 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.709
 over that sensor he finally had a little bit of courage again 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.919
 and there is only wonderful possibility 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.399
 that you can divide 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.639
 before we put in a demonstrative mode device the rest finally got that one 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:28.169
 bit about the condition of the TV in the current situation in 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.039
 Things sweeping smoke 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.229
 this so-called in a big hurry 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:35.949
 this big role that betrays us now 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.769
 the TV was terrestrial 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.550
 not quite as energetic as one feels in this room very bright 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.749
 this is 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.989
 but now if I just hide the TV through the brothers 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.159
 By using this small sensor Suitner that he is now in one place 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.449
 Dublin rumkriegt 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.619
 then he immediately feels technically much better 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.980
 So go to the side of the three Grünberg Tel 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.200
 provided the idyll is kept on the go the picture is now optimal 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.430
 adapted to a slightly darker neat play at the moment though 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.909
 again "died" breakthrough that we were always in great 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.799
 So that's another feature Homann 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.850
 basically everything can be read off 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.440
 that the devices percent in any case from the development ago so already died 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.579
 have developed the visibility 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.699
 that this one opinion 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.489
 Plasma is a power guzzler in no case would stand so close 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.469
 that would have happened a lot and we will also be in those of the measured 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.730
 Values ​​again every year 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.889
 and only 570 this year 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.620
 20 and 30 percent mobile Euro 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.780
 The real life in these technologies would be as well 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.029
 the Affected Government must 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.559
 So you can not make it invisible 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.269
 These devices are percent very high percentage percent 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.889
 Energy efficiency 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.269
 Own goal Badstuber on the other hand of course someday 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.980
 Michel Periard sales 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.849
 And if it was quiet, of course, I have to be light-headed 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.120
 in which he also be 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.919
 So I can be consensual and energy on the ground 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.280
 and of course now this 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.230
 big screen Raul the web are particularly suitable for his children 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.370
 Of course this is also a big area to provide with maturity and 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.749
 I lost that 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.969
 but always the victims stand Michael the percent duration percent
