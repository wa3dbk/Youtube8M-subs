00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.230
 and what do you have if you look she was born 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.610
 with profound deafness a problem 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.930
 congenital was what we have been told 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460
 doctors several doctors who have 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.020
 evaluated but I never lose faith 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.430
 they say he does not hear anything there is a mother 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.070
 always has its sixth sense I have that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.660
 my daughter if she listens to something but listens to what 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.130
 it seemed that it had to be done was the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.860
 cochlear implant but unfortunately 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.509
 we have a little something in our ears 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.399
 which is called the cochlea, it's like the 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.410
 switch and I have cable outside that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.880
 would be the cochlear implant is there that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.829
 connect it in the cochlea and she 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 pitifully was born or the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.760
 incomplete copy does not have it formed 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.260
 then there is no where to connect the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 cochlear implant and we're out there 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 inquiring other solutions other 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.770
 operation which we have investigated now 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 with the help of doctors it's called stem 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.210
 cerebral but that's not done here in 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.230
 ecuador that if I'm not wrong the cee in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.820
 usa venezuela chile spain and I think that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 a Cuban clearly remembers in these 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.270
 cases any grain of sand sum 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.659
 everything to add is super 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.460
 important we are fighting 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.620
 talking to foundations looking for 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.990
 way to save 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.870
 to make an event or another to get 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.310
 the money through social insurance me 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.710
 I said that how do you do to communicate 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.720
 with the baby for example I call her the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.040
 I play like that, I say mom, I imagine and I 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.050
 I look if I do not know a little far away 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.640
 key and how people when not 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.660
 listen they feel the vibrations because 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.190
 obviously they develop in others 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.410
 senses then there's something that I 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.640
 I applaud she turns me to look or if not in 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.730
 instead of telling Paula that he is a man 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.620
 long I tell you only for and that emits 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.660
 more vibration then that's why already returned 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.300
 to look at me and there is less so I explain the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.590
 equality and there was no need 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.490
 always very grateful with all the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.810
 people who are willing to 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.150
 collaborate you know that a mother always 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.860
 was born very grateful and what is with my 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.810
 daughter is with me so forward 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.460
 back or to catch momentum step to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.680
 step by step and sure we're going to 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.810
 get to the happy end here in detectives 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.810
