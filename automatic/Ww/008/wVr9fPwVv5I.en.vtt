00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
this one on which I find to be a much

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.330 
this one on which I find to be a much
nicer<00:02:15.989> clock<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:16.980> get<00:02:17.130> rid<00:02:17.280> of

nicer clock so you can just get rid of

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.020 
nicer clock so you can just get rid of
that<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.819> just<00:02:18.480> drag<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.260> up<00:02:19.760> there<00:02:20.760> you

some rubber bits as well that you can go

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.660 
some rubber bits as well that you can go
through<00:02:53.900> as<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.049> can<00:02:55.170> see<00:02:55.319> here<00:02:55.620> top<00:02:55.890> four<00:02:56.160> top

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
through as you can see here top four top

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.210 
through as you can see here top four top
processes<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.380> stuff<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.799> that

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
processes and stuff like that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.979 
processes and stuff like that
there's<00:02:59.400> also<00:02:59.580> another<00:02:59.880> pretty<00:03:00.360> useful<00:03:00.780> tool

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
there's also another pretty useful tool

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.910 
there's also another pretty useful tool
which<00:03:01.170> awful<00:03:01.560> whereas<00:03:02.370> remove<00:03:03.380> drive<00:03:04.380> safely

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
which awful whereas remove drive safely

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
you can actually stick that on there and

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.940 
you can actually stick that on there and
