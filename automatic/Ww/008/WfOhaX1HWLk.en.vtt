pretty<00:01:46.550> simple<00:01:46.820> here<00:01:47.330> I've<00:01:47.479> got<00:01:48.310> maple<00:01:49.310> and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
pretty simple here I've got maple and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.859 
pretty simple here I've got maple and
zebra<00:01:51.440> wood<00:01:52.720> which<00:01:53.720> would<00:01:53.929> go<00:01:54.110> like<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.750> we

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
zebra wood which would go like so and we

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.830 
zebra wood which would go like so and we
get<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.170> all<00:01:57.350> glued<00:01:57.619> up<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.220> set<00:01:58.610> up<00:01:58.759> we<00:01:59.690> end

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
get that all glued up and set up we end

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.600 
get that all glued up and set up we end
up<00:01:59.990> with<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.200> block<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:00.770> looks<00:02:01.369> something

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
up with a block that looks something

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
if you look really closely you can see a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.820 
if you look really closely you can see a
piece<00:02:08.620> of<00:02:08.830> veneer<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.580> here<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.300> we<00:02:10.960> go<00:02:11.110> from<00:02:11.500> a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
piece of veneer in here and we go from a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.780 
piece of veneer in here and we go from a
real<00:02:12.220> basic<00:02:12.760> system<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:15.280> same<00:02:15.520> basic

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
real basic system here to the same basic

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.600 
real basic system here to the same basic
system<00:02:16.360> except<00:02:17.200> we've<00:02:17.350> added<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.860> second<00:02:18.460> layer

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
system except we've added a second layer

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.610 
system except we've added a second layer
we've<00:02:18.880> had<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> layer<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.540> veneer<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.260> what

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
we've had a layer of veneer and what

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.160 
we've had a layer of veneer and what
that<00:02:20.800> does<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.400> give<00:02:22.150> us<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.420> picture<00:02:22.750> frame<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
that does is give us a picture frame the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.540 
that does is give us a picture frame the
fact<00:02:23.380> around<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:25.300> material<00:02:26.230> for<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.280> picture

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
fact around the material for the picture

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.420

some examples this is shot mate veneer
but<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:34.510> about<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.930> same<00:02:35.140> thickness<00:02:35.440> of

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
but it's about the same thickness of

under a fortieth of an inch it's very
very<00:02:44.200> thin<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.180> that's<00:02:46.180> what<00:02:46.360> we'd<00:02:46.510> end<00:02:46.660> up

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
very thin and that's what we'd end up

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.900 
very thin and that's what we'd end up
using<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.740> something<00:02:48.160> like<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.550> it's<00:02:48.790> going

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
using on something like this it's going

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
using on something like this it's going
to<00:02:48.970> give<00:02:49.120> us<00:02:49.240> a<00:02:49.330> very<00:02:49.540> delicate<00:02:49.780> very<00:02:50.650> fine

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
to give us a very delicate very fine

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.960 
to give us a very delicate very fine
picture<00:02:51.430> frame<00:02:51.670> effect

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.810 

you<00:02:56.960> need<00:02:57.110> some<00:02:57.380> way<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.530> grip<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.640> what<00:02:58.790> I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
you need some way to grip it and what I

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.510 
you need some way to grip it and what I
like<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.120> do<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.140> take<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.500> waste<00:03:00.800> block<00:03:01.130> some

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
like to do is to take a waste block some

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.000 
like to do is to take a waste block some
less<00:03:01.760> expensive<00:03:01.790> wood<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.660> this<00:03:02.780> case<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:03.800> I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
less expensive wood in this case this I

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.950 
less expensive wood in this case this I
think<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.340> recycled<00:03:04.910> mahogany<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.750> got

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
think is recycled mahogany that I got

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.820 
think is recycled mahogany that I got
off<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> pallet<00:03:06.590> somewhere<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:08.710> glue<00:03:09.710> this

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
off a pallet somewhere I glue this

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.400 
off a pallet somewhere I glue this
together<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.430> ingrained<00:03:10.790> in<00:03:11.120> grain<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.140> as

a liberal amount yellow glue on here

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.520 
a liberal amount yellow glue on here
Center<00:03:28.520> it<00:03:28.580> up<00:03:28.640> really<00:03:29.270> really<00:03:29.870> well<00:03:30.170> because

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
Center it up really really well because

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.470 
Center it up really really well because
that<00:03:30.950> makes<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.430> dramatic<00:03:31.640> difference<00:03:31.940> these

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
that makes a dramatic difference these

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.750 
that makes a dramatic difference these
will<00:03:32.660> be<00:03:32.750> lopsided<00:03:33.040> one<00:03:34.040> side<00:03:34.280> will<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.459> bigger

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
will be lopsided one side will be bigger

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.880 
will be lopsided one side will be bigger
the<00:03:34.970> other<00:03:35.060> side<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.450> be<00:03:35.480> smaller<00:03:35.959> they'll<00:03:36.709> be

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
the other side to be smaller they'll be

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.510 
the other side to be smaller they'll be
all<00:03:37.180> they<00:03:38.180> won't<00:03:38.390> work<00:03:38.570> very<00:03:38.870> well<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.520> pay

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
all they won't work very well so pay

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.170 
all they won't work very well so pay
very<00:03:40.820> very<00:03:41.830> strict<00:03:42.830> attention<00:03:43.010> get<00:03:43.970> this

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
very very strict attention get this

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.540 
very very strict attention get this
thing<00:03:44.420> centered<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:45.020> usually<00:03:45.770> use<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:45.950> six<00:03:46.310> inch

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
thing centered I usually use a six inch

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.570 
thing centered I usually use a six inch
or<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:47.360> C<00:03:47.630> clamp<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.830> is<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.040> little<00:03:49.280> bit<00:03:49.400> long

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
or so C clamp this is a little bit long

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.880 
or so C clamp this is a little bit long
we<00:03:50.030> could<00:03:50.209> usually<00:03:50.420> get<00:03:50.720> away<00:03:50.810> with<00:03:51.170> with<00:03:51.680> two

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
we could usually get away with with two

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.460 
we could usually get away with with two
inches<00:03:52.190> instead<00:03:52.520> of<00:03:52.760> three<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:53.840> glue<00:03:54.080> this<00:03:54.230> on

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
inches instead of three but glue this on

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.670 
inches instead of three but glue this on
here<00:03:54.800> this<00:03:55.370> needs<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.850> set<00:03:56.060> overnight<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:57.470> can

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
here this needs to set overnight you can

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.100 
here this needs to set overnight you can
use<00:03:57.950> CA<00:03:58.220> glue<00:03:58.520> but<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:58.940> find<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.570> liberal<00:03:59.900> amount

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
use CA glue but I find a liberal amount

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.440 
use CA glue but I find a liberal amount
of<00:04:00.260> yellow<00:04:00.440> glue<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:01.400> be<00:04:01.519> much<00:04:01.790> much<00:04:02.090> stronger

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
of yellow glue to be much much stronger

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.990 
of yellow glue to be much much stronger
what<00:04:03.290> I've<00:04:03.410> done<00:04:03.680> I'm<00:04:03.980> going<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.610> end<00:04:04.730> up<00:04:04.850> with

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
what I've done I'm going to end up with

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.690 
what I've done I'm going to end up with
something<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.600> looks<00:04:06.170> like<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.620> this<00:04:06.980> what

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
something that looks like this this what

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.040 
something that looks like this this what
happens<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.180> be<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.330> little<00:04:08.510> bit<00:04:08.630> longer<00:04:08.870> I

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
happens to be a little bit longer I

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.199 
happens to be a little bit longer I
think<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.350> was<00:04:09.440> made<00:04:09.650> out<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.860> some<00:04:10.760> leftover

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
think it was made out of some leftover

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.940 
think it was made out of some leftover
material<00:04:11.720> but<00:04:12.170> that's<00:04:12.350> what<00:04:12.530> you're<00:04:12.680> shooting

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
material but that's what you're shooting

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.890 
material but that's what you're shooting
for<00:04:13.100> right<00:04:13.340> there<00:04:13.610> so<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.120> can<00:04:14.330> put<00:04:14.510> this<00:04:14.630> in<00:04:14.840> a

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
for right there so you can put this in a

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.229 
for right there so you can put this in a
four<00:04:15.080> jaw<00:04:15.290> Chuck<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:16.340> don't<00:04:16.489> even<00:04:16.700> have<00:04:16.970> to

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
four jaw Chuck you don't even have to

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.570 
four jaw Chuck you don't even have to
turn<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:17.690> round<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.590> can<00:04:18.709> just<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.130> can<00:04:19.310> clamp

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
turn it round you can just you can clamp

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.920 
turn it round you can just you can clamp
this<00:04:19.640> very<00:04:20.090> securely<00:04:20.570> into<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.500> four<00:04:21.830> jaw<00:04:22.040> Chuck

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
this very securely into a four jaw Chuck

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:46.350 
this very securely into a four jaw Chuck
is<00:04:23.350> fine

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.140 

with<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.569> laser-cut<00:04:47.990> kits<00:04:48.530> I<00:04:48.830> find<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:49.759> much

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
with the laser-cut kits I find it much

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.050 
with the laser-cut kits I find it much
easier<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:51.590> make<00:04:51.830> my<00:04:52.069> core<00:04:52.400> block<00:04:52.669> four

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
easier to just make my core block four

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.570 
easier to just make my core block four
and<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.180> half<00:04:53.419> inches<00:04:53.810> instead<00:04:54.379> of<00:04:54.530> three<00:04:54.830> this

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
and a half inches instead of three this

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.879 
and a half inches instead of three this
works<00:04:55.909> fine<00:04:56.210> unless<00:04:56.689> you're<00:04:56.930> using<00:04:57.169> exotic

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
works fine unless you're using exotic

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.300 
works fine unless you're using exotic
material<00:04:58.490> real<00:04:59.240> expensive<00:04:59.719> core<00:05:00.319> material<00:05:00.949> or
