in<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.719> lesson<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.230> will<00:00:01.260> cover<00:00:01.500> four

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
in this lesson we will cover four

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.260 
in this lesson we will cover four
different<00:00:01.890> ways<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> play<00:00:02.669> outside<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.149> blue

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
different ways to play outside the blue

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.019 
different ways to play outside the blue
scale<00:00:03.600> for<00:00:04.589> each<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.859> these<00:00:04.950> four<00:00:05.190> ways<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.879> me

them however you want to take into a
blue<00:00:10.800> scale<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.910> will<00:00:12.030> use<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.389> as<00:00:12.599> a

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
blue scale we will use this as a

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.289 
blue scale we will use this as a
reference<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.380> lesson<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:15.059> first

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
reference for the lesson the first

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.180 
reference for the lesson the first
approach<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.109> adding<00:00:16.379> notes<00:00:16.560> around<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.039> blue

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
approach to adding notes around the blue

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.790 
approach to adding notes around the blue
scale<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.420> add<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> major<00:00:18.930> sixth<00:00:19.470> which

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
scale is to add the major sixth which

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.980 
scale is to add the major sixth which
will<00:00:20.010> create<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> dorian<00:00:20.699> sound<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.539> reference

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
will create a dorian sound in reference

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.609 
will create a dorian sound in reference
to<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.650> blue<00:00:22.890> scale<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:24.119> major<00:00:24.359> six<00:00:24.779> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to the a blue scale the major six this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.849 
to the a blue scale the major six this
can<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.070> F<00:00:26.220> sharp<00:00:27.019> and<00:00:28.019> you'll<00:00:28.140> find<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.560> F

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
can be an F sharp and you'll find this F

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.450 
can be an F sharp and you'll find this F
sharp<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.670> fourth<00:00:30.269> fret<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.810> D<00:00:31.460> as

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
sharp on the fourth fret of the D as

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.650 
sharp on the fourth fret of the D as
well<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.420> seventh<00:00:34.350> fret<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.100> B<00:00:35.610> string

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
well as the seventh fret of the B string

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.740 
well as the seventh fret of the B string
when<00:00:36.660> you're<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.440> position<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
when you're in this position and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.990 
when you're in this position and
basically<00:00:40.010> it's<00:00:41.010> gonna<00:00:41.129> create<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> dorian

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
basically it's gonna create a dorian

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.549 
basically it's gonna create a dorian
sound<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:43.590> things<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.280> are

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.290 

the<00:00:52.559> second<00:00:52.920> approach<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.820> add<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> major

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the second approach is to add the major

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
the second approach is to add the major
third<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> scale<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.649> create<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
third of the scale which will create a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.880 
third of the scale which will create a
mixolydian<00:00:56.489> sound<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:58.140> relation<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
mixolydian sound in relation to the a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.720 
mixolydian sound in relation to the a
blue<00:00:59.280> scale<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.270> major<00:01:00.420> third<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> c-sharp

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
blue scale the major third is a c-sharp

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
blue scale the major third is a c-sharp
which<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.910> find<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.719> sixth<00:01:04.350> fret<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which will find on the sixth fret of the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.770 
which will find on the sixth fret of the
g<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.580> well<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:07.040> 4th<00:01:08.040> fret<00:01:08.310> today<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.630> also

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
g as well as the 4th fret today and also

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.160 
g as well as the 4th fret today and also
on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.490> ninth<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> high<00:01:12.630> E

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on the ninth of the high E

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:24.380 
on the ninth of the high E
so<00:01:13.470> using<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.920> you'll<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.729> sound<00:01:23.390> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so using this you'll get this sound the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.380 
so using this you'll get this sound the
third<00:01:24.659> approach<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.500> add<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> ninth<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
third approach is to add the ninth the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999 
third approach is to add the ninth the
ninth<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.900> relation<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.500> blues<00:01:28.770> scale

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
ninth in relation to the a blues scale

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.999 
ninth in relation to the a blues scale
is<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.610> B<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.840> you'll<00:01:30.960> find<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.290> note<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
is a B and you'll find this note on the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.450 
is a B and you'll find this note on the
seventh<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> high<00:01:32.970> E<00:01:33.710> as<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
seventh of the high E as well as the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.499 
seventh of the high E as well as the
fourth<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> G<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.159> with<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> ninth<00:01:38.520> your

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
fourth on the G and with the ninth your

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:49.160 
fourth on the G and with the ninth your
plane<00:01:39.750> will<00:01:39.900> sound<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:48.270> fourth<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.840> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
plane will sound like the fourth way is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.889 
plane will sound like the fourth way is
to<00:01:49.740> add<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> flat<00:01:50.520> nine<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.540> create<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
to add the flat nine which will create a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.249 
to add the flat nine which will create a
diminished<00:01:52.320> sound<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:53.990> relation<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
diminished sound in relation to the a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.640 
diminished sound in relation to the a
blues<00:01:55.500> scale<00:01:55.619> flat<00:01:56.579> nine

of<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.130> low<00:02:10.340> E<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.680> didn't<00:02:13.280> flat<00:02:13.460> 9<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:14.300> is

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
of the low E so I didn't flat 9 this is

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.440 
of the low E so I didn't flat 9 this is
what<00:02:14.720> it'll<00:02:14.990> sound<00:02:15.080> like
