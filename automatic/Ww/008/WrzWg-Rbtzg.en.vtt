Philippa what do you think thanks Armand
the<00:01:59.070> era<00:01:59.280> pro<00:01:59.549> team<00:01:59.850> GT<00:02:00.390> has<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> slightly

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the era pro team GT has a slightly

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.170 
the era pro team GT has a slightly
larger<00:02:01.409> head<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.399> allows<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.969> deep

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
larger head which allows for deep

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.270 
larger head which allows for deep
penetrating<00:02:03.750> ground<00:02:04.140> strokes<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.950> let's<00:02:05.100> see

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
penetrating ground strokes but let's see

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.770 
penetrating ground strokes but let's see
how<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> did<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.820> court

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.360 

this<00:02:09.780> racket<00:02:10.200> was<00:02:10.410> easier<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> move<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
this racket was easier to move on the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.979 
this racket was easier to move on the
court<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.030> its<00:02:12.239> light<00:02:12.420> weight<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
court because of its light weight and

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.740 
court because of its light weight and
its<00:02:13.170> aerodynamic<00:02:13.920> shape<00:02:14.190> i<00:02:14.330> noticed<00:02:15.330> i<00:02:15.540> could

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
its aerodynamic shape i noticed i could

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.690 
its aerodynamic shape i noticed i could
get<00:02:15.870> cleaner<00:02:16.170> hits<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:18.860> on<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.310> volleys

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
get cleaner hits with it on the volleys

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.670 
get cleaner hits with it on the volleys
i<00:02:20.910> could<00:02:21.209> move<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> racket<00:02:21.720> head<00:02:21.959> fast<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
i could move the racket head fast to the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.630 
i could move the racket head fast to the
ball<00:02:22.830> allowing<00:02:23.310> lightning<00:02:23.819> hands<00:02:24.060> i<00:02:25.640> could

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
ball allowing lightning hands i could

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
ball allowing lightning hands i could
pull<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> head<00:02:27.120> back<00:02:27.300> quickly<00:02:27.569> for<00:02:27.750> powerful

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
pull the head back quickly for powerful

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.090 
pull the head back quickly for powerful
overheads<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.080> serve<00:02:31.290> i<00:02:31.680> could<00:02:31.980> produce

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
overheads on the serve i could produce

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.680 
overheads on the serve i could produce
great<00:02:32.520> spin<00:02:32.910> power<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.870> precision<00:02:35.690> well

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
great spin power and precision well

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.630 
great spin power and precision well
those<00:02:36.840> are<00:02:36.959> my<00:02:37.080> opinions<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.890> racket<00:02:38.280> but

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
those are my opinions on the racket but

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.160 
those are my opinions on the racket but
