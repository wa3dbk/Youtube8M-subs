is not so great it's uh not like a super
interesting<00:01:19.110> fruit<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.310> my<00:01:20.580> opinion<00:01:20.940> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
interesting fruit and in my opinion I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580 
interesting fruit and in my opinion I
mean<00:01:21.030> I've<00:01:21.210> had<00:01:21.360> kumquats<00:01:21.930> before<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.440> can

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
mean I've had kumquats before you can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.580 
mean I've had kumquats before you can
get<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.040> u.s.<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:24.500> fairly<00:01:25.500> easily

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
get them in the u.s. like fairly easily

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.960 
get them in the u.s. like fairly easily
so<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.920> something<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.399> think<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.670> would<00:01:29.820> do

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so it's not something I think I would do

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
so it's not something I think I would do
like<00:01:30.119> an<00:01:30.240> episode<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.350> its<00:01:31.590> own<00:01:31.970> but

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
like an episode on on its own but

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.139 
like an episode on on its own but
because<00:01:33.990> I'm<00:01:34.229> talking<00:01:34.410> about<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.759> fruit

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
because I'm talking about you know fruit

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.150 
because I'm talking about you know fruit
for<00:01:36.810> Chinese<00:01:37.200> New<00:01:37.410> Year<00:01:37.649> I<00:01:37.680> thought<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
for Chinese New Year I thought this

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.060 
for Chinese New Year I thought this
would<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.899> review<00:01:40.289> now<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
would be a good one to to review now the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.320 
would be a good one to to review now the
interesting<00:01:41.369> thing<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.180> you're

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
interesting thing with this is you're

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.790 
interesting thing with this is you're
supposed<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.690> pop<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> whole<00:01:43.320> thing<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.770> your

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
supposed to pop the whole thing in your

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.730 
supposed to pop the whole thing in your
mouth<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.580> don't<00:01:44.820> eat<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> inside

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
mouth like you don't eat just the inside

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
mouth like you don't eat just the inside
and<00:01:47.550> actually<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.300> kind<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.600> reverse

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and actually it's kind of like reverse

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.930 
and actually it's kind of like reverse
what<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.350> would<00:01:49.500> think<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.979> inside<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.820> very

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
what you would think the inside is very

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.630 
what you would think the inside is very
very<00:01:51.330> sour<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.500> outside<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.190> very<00:01:53.399> very

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
very sour and the outside is very very

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.340 
very sour and the outside is very very
sweet<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.240> when<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.420> eat<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.690> together<00:01:54.840> it's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
sweet so when you eat it together it's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
sweet so when you eat it together it's
actually<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.920> nice<00:01:56.630> I'm<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.810> kind<00:01:58.050> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
actually really nice I'm gonna kind of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.520 
actually really nice I'm gonna kind of
put<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:58.979> test<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.910> I<00:02:00.660> don't

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
put that to the test because I don't

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.949 
put that to the test because I don't
know<00:02:01.590> why<00:02:01.800> not<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.179> we<00:02:03.330> take<00:02:03.929> a

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
know why not and actually like we take a

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.990 
know why not and actually like we take a
bite<00:02:04.289> out<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.860> middle<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.490> which<00:02:05.819> is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
bite out of the middle of it which is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.699 
bite out of the middle of it which is
something<00:02:06.209> that<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.569> normally<00:02:06.750> would<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.319> be

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
something that you normally would not be

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.900 
something that you normally would not be
doing<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:09.479> here's<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.819> cross-section<00:02:11.819> of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
doing so here's like a cross-section of

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.750 
doing so here's like a cross-section of
it<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.480> not<00:02:12.630> very<00:02:12.930> juicy<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> also<00:02:14.489> has

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it it's not very juicy and it also has

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.600 
it it's not very juicy and it also has
four<00:02:15.000> rather<00:02:15.180> large<00:02:15.599> seeds<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:17.099> seeds<00:02:17.370> are

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
four rather large seeds the seeds are

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.660 
four rather large seeds the seeds are
they<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.630> range<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.890> small<00:02:20.430> but

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
they can range like that one small but

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.490 
they can range like that one small but
they<00:02:20.819> get<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.569> size<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:22.050> an<00:02:22.200> orange

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
they get to the size of like an orange

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.089 
they get to the size of like an orange
seed<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.300> might<00:02:24.989> eat<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> whole<00:02:25.770> thing

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
seed so you might eat the whole thing

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.780 
seed so you might eat the whole thing
you<00:02:26.220> do<00:02:26.370> need<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.670> spit<00:02:26.940> those<00:02:27.090> things<00:02:27.450> out<00:02:28.790> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you do need to spit those things out so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.290 
you do need to spit those things out so
I'm<00:02:30.000> gonna<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:31.860> take<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.099> bite<00:02:32.430> out<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
I'm gonna just take a bite out of the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:47.790 
I'm gonna just take a bite out of the
sour<00:02:33.750> bit

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.180 

well<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:49.150> might<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.630> special<00:02:50.560> variety<00:02:50.740> or

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
well this might be a special variety or

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.220 
well this might be a special variety or
something<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.790> if<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.510> middle<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.840> also

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
something but if the middle is also

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:02.190 
something but if the middle is also
sweet<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:54.370> not<00:02:54.550> very<00:02:54.760> sour<00:02:55.030> at<00:02:55.270> all

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.680 

the<00:03:02.830> inside<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.190> kind<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.580> like<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.360> texture

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
the inside is kind of like the texture

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.199 
the inside is kind of like the texture
is<00:03:04.750> kind<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.959> weird<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.860> like<00:03:06.060> got<00:03:07.060> like<00:03:07.180> a

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.720 
is kind of weird it's like got like a
firm<00:03:07.680> texture<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:08.950> it's<00:03:09.250> not<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:09.580> really

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
firm texture to it it's not like really

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.110

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
it also comes with that bitterness this

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.770 
it also comes with that bitterness this
it<00:04:58.960> has<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.980> kind<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.310> like<00:05:00.430> peel<00:05:00.910> flavor<00:05:01.420> but

without<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.320> bitterness<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:04.450> know

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
without the bitterness so you know

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.450

without that bitter taste it's actually

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.420 
without that bitter taste it's actually
really<00:05:06.610> good<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.210> think<00:05:07.420> that<00:05:07.930> eating<00:05:08.430> citrus

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
really good I think that eating citrus

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.100 
really good I think that eating citrus
peels<00:05:09.700> is<00:05:10.150> fine<00:05:11.730> preferably<00:05:12.730> in<00:05:13.540> something

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
peels is fine preferably in something

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.650 
peels is fine preferably in something
like<00:05:14.410> using<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.980> lemon<00:05:15.310> zest<00:05:15.580> or<00:05:16.000> an<00:05:16.240> orange

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
like using a lemon zest or an orange

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.110 
like using a lemon zest or an orange
peel<00:05:17.170> that's<00:05:17.500> been<00:05:17.710> candied<00:05:18.400> like<00:05:18.970> that

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
peel that's been candied like that

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.850 
peel that's been candied like that
there's<00:05:19.420> a<00:05:19.480> lot<00:05:19.600> of<00:05:19.690> use<00:05:19.900> for<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.410> think

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
there's a lot of use for that I think

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.970 
there's a lot of use for that I think
you<00:05:21.400> can<00:05:21.580> do<00:05:21.700> a<00:05:21.730> lot<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.030> appeal<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.020> instead

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
you can do a lot with appeal and instead
