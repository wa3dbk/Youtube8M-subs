you a good machine or that's not really
bright<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:59.809> you<00:01:00.809> know<00:01:00.899> I've<00:01:01.019> been<00:01:01.410> told

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
bright is it you know I've been told

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.319 
bright is it you know I've been told
I've<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.129> biomechanics<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.179> my

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
I've got good biomechanics that my

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
I've got good biomechanics that my
alignment<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.870> good<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:05.009> pronator

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
alignment is good I don't pronator

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.330 
alignment is good I don't pronator
supinate<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:07.259> believe<00:01:08.220> in

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
supinate right and I just believe in

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.910 
supinate right and I just believe in
that<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.300> your<00:01:09.420> resting<00:01:09.720> pulse<00:01:09.920> it's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that and what is your resting pulse it's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.820 
that and what is your resting pulse it's
about<00:01:11.399> 40<00:01:11.910> well<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:12.990> remarkable<00:01:13.530> isn't<00:01:13.679> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
about 40 well that's remarkable isn't it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.290 
about 40 well that's remarkable isn't it
that's<00:01:14.160> pretty<00:01:14.369> good<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
that's pretty good because I think the

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.120 
that's pretty good because I think the
average<00:01:15.479> resting<00:01:16.080> pulse<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.649> 70

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
average resting pulse is like 70

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
average resting pulse is like 70
something<00:01:17.369> yeah<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.539> when<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> wouldnt

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
something yeah and when you wouldnt

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
something yeah and when you wouldnt
you're<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.289> your<00:01:19.500> maximum<00:01:19.950> stress<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.550> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you're at your maximum stress what is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.840 
you're at your maximum stress what is
your<00:01:20.850> pulse<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.259> goes<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> 180<00:01:23.340> 185

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
your pulse then it goes up to 180 185

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.419 
your pulse then it goes up to 180 185
whoa<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.440> extremely<00:01:25.830> high<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.250> well

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
whoa my so that's extremely high as well

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.249 
whoa my so that's extremely high as well
isn't<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.819> yeah<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> high<00:01:28.229> end

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
isn't it yeah that's on the high end

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.749 
isn't it yeah that's on the high end
yeah<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.800> what<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.069> pushing<00:01:29.340> yeah

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
yeah that's what I'm really pushing yeah

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.690 
yeah that's what I'm really pushing yeah
and<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.539> when<00:01:30.960> you're<00:01:31.110> running<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.890> 262

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and and so when you're running like 262

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
and and so when you're running like 262
miles<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.630> time<00:01:33.960> per<00:01:34.259> mile<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.829> an

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
miles what is your time per mile in an

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010 
miles what is your time per mile in an
event<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.399> is<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.360> pretty<00:01:36.630> impressive

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
event like that is it pretty impressive

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440 
event like that is it pretty impressive
or<00:01:37.350> these<00:01:37.649> varies<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.850> running<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.270> hill

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
or these varies if I'm running up a hill

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.459 
or these varies if I'm running up a hill
I<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.850> 1819<00:01:41.850> minute<00:01:42.090> miles<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> last

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
I can be 1819 minute miles when I last

that<00:05:32.199> your<00:05:32.409> most<00:05:32.650> physically<00:05:33.220> challenging<00:05:33.250> of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
that your most physically challenging of

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.309 
that your most physically challenging of
event<00:05:35.080> so<00:05:35.349> far<00:05:35.560> I<00:05:35.800> think<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.759> 262<00:05:37.750> Mile<00:05:37.930> was<00:05:38.139> a

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
event so far I think the 262 Mile was a

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.719 
event so far I think the 262 Mile was a
little<00:05:38.620> more<00:05:38.740> challenging<00:05:38.770> because<00:05:39.460> that

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
little more challenging because that

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.830 
little more challenging because that
third<00:05:39.940> night<00:05:40.150> without<00:05:40.300> sleep<00:05:40.810> yeah<00:05:42.840> go

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
third night without sleep yeah go

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.200 
third night without sleep yeah go

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.659 
absolutely and and the goal now I guess
is<00:05:49.240> 300<00:05:49.810> run<00:05:49.930> 300<00:05:50.169> continuous<00:05:50.889> continual

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
is 300 run 300 continuous continual

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.520 
is 300 run 300 continuous continual
miles<00:05:51.879> I'm<00:05:52.060> going<00:05:52.180> to<00:05:52.240> try<00:05:52.449> 300<00:05:52.990> all<00:05:53.139> right<00:05:53.319> and

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
miles I'm going to try 300 all right and

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.149 
miles I'm going to try 300 all right and
and<00:05:54.330> are<00:05:55.330> you<00:05:56.139> questioning<00:05:56.530> my<00:05:56.590> intelligence

and are you questioning my intelligence
what<00:05:57.669> I<00:05:58.710> think<00:05:59.710> that<00:05:59.860> was<00:05:59.979> established

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
what I think that was established

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.710

earlier

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.610 

but<00:06:08.350> no<00:06:09.120> the<00:06:10.120> 300<00:06:10.720> miles<00:06:10.900> use<00:06:11.080> that<00:06:11.290> key<00:06:11.470> are

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
but no the 300 miles use that key are

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.270 
but no the 300 miles use that key are
you<00:06:11.740> capable<00:06:11.950> of<00:06:12.220> doing<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.610> I<00:06:13.530> will<00:06:14.530> see<00:06:14.740> ya
