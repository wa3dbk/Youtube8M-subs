00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.910
 I arrived from Mogi Mirim in São Paulo in 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:10.129
 2002 to go to college and those that 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.709
 in those ten years that have passed between 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.450
 my arrival with 18 hotel as 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.259
 to record a record I played 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.259
 with enough people 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.840
 This, I think, is precisely what 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.080
 doing the idea of ​​recording a 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.390
 own if it crystallizes rafa people are already 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.059
 has known for a long time since the time 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.040
 that he studied in tatuí we already left 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.930
 always touched on other occasions and he 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.180
 called to do this project there dodo 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.180
 his disc I was very happy because 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.980
 wonderful compositions 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.690
 It's a song that has a certain 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.989
 complexity but it is all in favor of 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.989
 music 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.370
 it's a funny thing in the compositions 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.520
 this disk which, with the exception of one 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.410
 or two they are days with an order 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.660
 that they were compounded by a 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.729
 disk is a record of a period ne 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.590
 so there's nothing much behind there 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.840
 things were all entered in a 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.910
 ten months or so I think 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.640
 if you are determined to sound a 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.310
 type of sound in the head and has a 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.560
 creative process that is in that time 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.350
 will not change this unit that this 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.300
 disco that I see on this record I think 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.020
 which comes precisely in this short period 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.020
 that it was written 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.840
 It's a challenging job so not only I 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.459
 I say this with all the other musicians. 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.560
 who played cd also spoke the same 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.780
 thing and what I found most 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 impressive work was the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.530
 design of counterpoint 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.099
 is also very large hand ranges 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.340
 left and things that make sense with 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.049
 instruments is the timbre knows 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.700
 he 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.519
 He took very good advantage of it. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.290
 which he called the Tinguis 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.150
 He thought of a business the same question. 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.590
 where there was business work very well 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.129
 thought very well explained to china 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.129
 musically 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.459
 even because of the process of how to 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.790
 always playing the piano and 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.770
 singing you will reap by putting in the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 paper goes in fact I've always been 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.810
 recording and then writing things down 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.420
 the sound that is on the head and was not a 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:24.250
 complexity I searched for a disk with 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:27.849
 compositions such elaborate the same time is 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:32.540
 mature but accessible at the same time. 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:36.760
 not only looking for the musical audience 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.519
 the beautiful melodies and arrangements 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.709
 that I'm happy to be a 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:48.410
 complement and serve as a locomotive 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.470
 rhythmic to these guys that I have one 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.459
 respect and admiration is to record a 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:01.849
 I think for practically everything 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:03.650
 musician is a dream that comes from afar 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.829
 so not always this project is in 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.829
 future
