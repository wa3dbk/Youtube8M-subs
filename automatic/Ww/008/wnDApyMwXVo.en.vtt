individual pieces under the front and
back<00:01:04.540> mounting<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.440> what<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:08.620> does<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.880> that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
back mounting and what that does is that

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.810 
back mounting and what that does is that
raises<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.690> seat<00:01:10.930> enough<00:01:11.610> don't<00:01:12.610> mind<00:01:12.760> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
raises the seat enough don't mind the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.040 
mask that allows the seat back to unhook
and<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:18.250> hook<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.490> seat<00:01:18.700> back<00:01:18.880> up<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.750> lean<00:01:19.930> it

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
and to hook the seat back up you lean it

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.749 
and to hook the seat back up you lean it
forward<00:01:20.080> you<00:01:20.790> lift<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:21.880> rear<00:01:22.090> seat<00:01:23.759> latches

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
forward you lift the rear seat latches

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:38.680 
forward you lift the rear seat latches
and<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.710> as<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:28.030> can<00:01:28.180> see<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.979> locked<00:01:30.280> in

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:47.640 

all<00:01:39.690> right<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.760> is<00:01:41.790> installed

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.900 

and<00:01:48.650> I<00:01:49.160> think<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.430> just<00:01:49.550> looks<00:01:49.790> great<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
and I think it just looks great is the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:04.929 
and I think it just looks great is the
RAM<00:01:53.240> logos<00:01:54.250> if<00:01:55.250> we<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.520> see<00:01:55.730> that<00:01:55.910> very<00:01:56.180> well

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:13.960 

and<00:02:05.119> then<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.049> feature<00:02:09.640> boost<00:02:10.640> up<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.610> pull

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
and then this feature boost up you pull

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:31.590 
and then this feature boost up you pull
forward<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:17.180> seats<00:02:17.420> fold<00:02:17.720> down<00:02:17.810> there

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.660
