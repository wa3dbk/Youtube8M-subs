I really don't think I believed it still

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:12.070 
I really don't think I believed it still
was<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.780> existence<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.660> Bible<00:03:11.080> they're

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
was in existence like the Bible they're

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.050 
was in existence like the Bible they're
just<00:03:12.110> left<00:03:12.650> up<00:03:12.920> there<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.460> they<00:03:13.700> just<00:03:13.880> have<00:03:14.030> to

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
just left up there and they just have to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.710 
just left up there and they just have to
beg<00:03:14.480> for<00:03:14.900> money<00:03:15.080> or<00:03:15.500> food<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:17.390> then<00:03:17.510> I'm

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
beg for money or food and then I'm

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.360 
beg for money or food and then I'm
medicine<00:03:18.350> because<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.800> government<00:03:19.250> won't

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
medicine because the government won't

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.810 
medicine because the government won't
support<00:03:19.850> them<00:03:20.120> won't<00:03:20.570> give<00:03:20.840> them<00:03:21.020> medicine

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
support them won't give them medicine

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.320 
support them won't give them medicine
because<00:03:22.820> it's<00:03:23.120> too<00:03:23.360> costly<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.930> guess<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:26.120> I'm

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
because it's too costly I guess so I'm

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.320 
because it's too costly I guess so I'm
on<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.110> mission<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:28.190> try<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.490> be<00:03:29.060> something

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
on a mission to try to be something

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:53.370 
on a mission to try to be something
about<00:03:29.540> that

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.800 

I<00:03:53.440> guess<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.520> crazy<00:03:54.760> disease<00:03:55.120> like<00:03:55.330> leprosy

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
I guess the crazy disease like leprosy

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.320 
I guess the crazy disease like leprosy
is<00:03:55.900> still<00:03:56.110> around<00:03:56.200> then<00:03:56.730> God's<00:03:57.730> power<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.150> heal

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
is still around then God's power to heal

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:12.370 
is still around then God's power to heal
them<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.600> still<00:03:58.780> around

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380
