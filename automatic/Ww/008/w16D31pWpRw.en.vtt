 Diode tee is this time had made a vending machine in Lego 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.700
 This time is a simple vending machine 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.110
 I feel like this around here 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.450

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.410
 At the exit of the product 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.050
 The upper part of here is 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.610
 It is a place to put the product 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.020

 It is the purchase purchase place to put money in 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:43.820
 This is a purchase lever so I would like to go there soon 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.000
 This is this guy 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Even if you first press with this purchase labor 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.370
 I can not do marbles 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.370

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.170
 Three are coming out 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.170
 So that's how it works 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.590
 The 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.780
 The mechanism is 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.540

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.740
 The 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:41.700
 Just because it's here 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:45.700

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.860
 The flame or center of gravity I guess I say 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.950
 If you hit 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.700
 I just want to buy something with a certain pattern, but they clash 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.190
 Even I cried to Yo not a 10-yen coin 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.360
