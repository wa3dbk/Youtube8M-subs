00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.170
 saving dean of games spaces are 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.180
 Dr. White we are here today with a video 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.459
 particular features you will find a 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.070
 nba 2k 14 game with two teams of 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.510
 eurolega but this will not be a video there 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.369
 the knot seems to have wanted to put me one 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.910
 game at home to not make a video a 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.660
 black screen 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.510
 in any case, first of all, I care about 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.300
 thank you all for the 50,000 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.860
 subscribers reaches an absurd goal 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.870
 personally always spaces that 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.430
 we risked 16,000 more or less members 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.970
 June last year now 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.010
 we have 50 thousand so really thank you for 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.380
 I also thank you in the editorial staff 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.960
 even those who follow the live strips are 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.730
 now the third channel in Italy that does 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.680
 South curly stream I understand that the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.120
 competition is not very high because 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.370
 however due to the connections not 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.410
 many can observe however always does 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.750
 pleasure to get these great results 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.329
 some live shows are also followed by more than 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.850
 500 people connected in the same 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.559
 now anyway because I 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.360
 this video because as you have seen 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.000
 maybe already on the site since last night we have 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.009
 opened an ad to search for new ones 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.619
 collaborators for our channel 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.999
 so generally for our site 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.119
 we are not looking for i 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:19.219
 journalists or reviewers, or rather not me 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.450
 I will take care of it in this case on the video 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.310
 so if you need those 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.569
 people have to write them to another 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.459
 the editorial staff 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.100
 in any case we are looking for are 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:30.979
 looking for two types of people in the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.020
 streamer are people who do workflows 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.329
 let's start with the streamer what is needed 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.130
 to become a stream you must 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.289
 definitely be experts in the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.439
 video game having a good gab 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.090
 so don't jam them anyway it's going to 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.279
 speak well of the game don't do maybe 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.679
 a sentence then ten minutes pause e 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:49.789
 make another one, et cetera, et cetera 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.639
 you obviously need one 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.259
 fast internet connection 

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:55.849
 usually a fiber connection 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.819
 it would be ideal because they want it 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.529
 however at least one megabit but blog 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.289
 anyway if you don't have that high 

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:05.359
 maybe you have 08 09 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.799
 we can try and see also 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.950
 which table with the stars maybe you can 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.140
 try to exhaust instead at 720p at 480p 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.930
 in any case besides all these things 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.900
 you need a webcam that can 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.840
 be if you have an xbox one a ps4 la 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.430
 ps camera or kinect or one 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.470
 simple webcam if instead of using 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.830
 maybe streaming software already 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.330
 integrated into xbox and creed and also 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.950
 so in the playstation 4 you can 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.150
 express on three of networks from the console 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.390
 if you have even a card 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.370
 acquiring use of the programs 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.630
 extremes as the broadcaster operates 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.030
 etc. etc. 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.980
 this is the first category the second 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.290
 category is the most classic one 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.900
 people who do the workflows of some 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.450
 video games so you have to prepare 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.360
 of the guides that can be on how 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.560
 solve a certain boss like 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.579
 unravel some secrets no easter egg 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.290
 maybe a guide a goal 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.400
 there are particularly complicated 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 goals that really are 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.650
 very complicated for example I'm thinking 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.900
 to some the zombie arrows because 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.120
 a procedure was to be done in four 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.700
 so players had to be explained in a way 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.859
 thorough and it was a nice job a 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.200
 quite long work perhaps as an example 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.850
 if you have a super mario for example a 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.670
 game for wii u you could explain how 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.350
 exceed a given in 30 seconds 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.410
 level things like this for 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.810
 understand what you need 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.980
 obviously a microphone because you have to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.130
 comment on this video then also here 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.650
 you have to be good enough to talk 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.200
 while meditation given to acquire the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.459
 video so mobile phones are not good either 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.920
 video cameras that go to shoot 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.650
 TV set you need if you are on PC 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.970
 of a program then as fraps 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.980
 etc 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.359
 if you are on a console, you need one 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.700
 name acquisition card can be 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.310
 denied an hd pvr for the zither pair 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.639
 now I see that they are very common in 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.769
 italy because a lot of people lea and owe 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.019
 be good at loading okay videos on 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.599
 youtube is an idiotic thing to employ 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.030
 five minutes to learn and maybe learn 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.980
 to avoid the very basis for cutting 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.280
 we don't ask you for a clip 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.720
 of tage sniper montages with everyone 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.229
 the millions of special effects and so on 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.599
 etc 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.690
 some personal considerations first 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.860
 to close that in the article 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:29.120
 you must obviously send yours 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.010
 snail staff at spazioogames.it 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.560
 indicating in the object the position of 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.570
 interest then or streamer or people 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.930
 interested in making the goals flu and attaching 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.640
 a video that doesn't mean you have to 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.620
 upload it to the email you can too 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.210
 put a link to youtube indeed maybe it is 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.450
 better but loaded on youtube as not 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.130
 listed and then you put the link in the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.650
 apples we go to look at it 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.660
 obviously there is a compensation but not 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.090
 it is out of malice that I cannot tell you 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.470
 because it is simply varies depending on 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.170
 of the visuals that the video receives then 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.500
 I can't tell you that you'll earn 3,000 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.760
 euros per month though maybe if you make millions 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.130
 of views of your videos 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.780
 could be a case 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.740
 a personal consideration if not 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.170
 maybe you already have the cards 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.540
 acquisition, however, I see that you are perhaps 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.640
 experts before buying then risking 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.830
 not to be taken because there can be 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.010
 this too we cannot all take 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.840
 I suggest you maybe to download up 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.930
 youtube now there are millions of videos 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.530
 downloaded a video from youtube and it 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.240
 comment yourself maybe if he is a monster of 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.390
 do so many of you know how to beat it 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.250
 upload and download the video in which 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.960
 shows how it works with this box 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.820
 and you commented and gave me yours 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.410
 impressions is a suggestion that can give you 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.270
 then you can decide later if 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.930
 buy you in the eight etcetera 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.180
 so if you have any questions or comments or 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.250
 however, the article by spazioogames e 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.350
 I will try to answer I don't decide 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.030
 so don't get angry, not orders 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.140
 you will be taken because the decision comes 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.900
 taken much higher 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.300
 if it doesn't respond to comments all of me 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.770
 sorry but right now i have one 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.240
 powe exam session you end I 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.540
 a lot to do is ok in any case 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.840
 I leave you so we decide soon hello a
