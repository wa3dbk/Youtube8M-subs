an error there have been speculations

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.550 
an error there have been speculations
that<00:01:31.049> maybe<00:01:31.680> 5000<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> these<00:01:32.670> were<00:01:32.820> printed

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
that maybe 5000 of these were printed

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this is uh one of the fewer errors that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
this is uh one of the fewer errors that
were<00:02:10.830> corrected<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> mean

I<00:02:26.130> could<00:02:26.370> find<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> ninetails<00:02:27.120> error<00:02:27.540> with

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
I could find the ninetails error with

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.440 
I could find the ninetails error with
