 I'm really excited about that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.979

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.060
 lipstick 29 colors so a so-called 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.970
 color updates not a new product but 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.950
 just owed to the current color trends 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.540
 Then there are these two new colors 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.040
 I appear to you now 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.080
 have and now we come to my 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.850
 personal favorite highlight 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.620
 I'm really looking forward to this product 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.959
 on it and a highlight it is in 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.780
 truest sense of the word for it 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.810
 is the highlight powder 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.760
 this is a green power highlighter and 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.650
 if s ens 1 can then is the quintet 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.660
 or texture so there they are in the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.510
 The past really is that way 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.940
 get great textures that I can 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.200
 really pray that this one here at the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.090
 highlighter is also like that and that he 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.160
 please do not be so happy because then 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.650
 is this a product that i put you on 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.020
 Anyone can also recommend in 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.170
 there are two new in town leds 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.030
 glitter paints so effect paints there it is 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.190
 yes, always a very big pioneer 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.920
 and now they just have two new ones 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.209
 colors or glitter types with ins 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.340
 assortment included 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.930
 I suspect that as synonymous with the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.970
 assortments change a lot 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.680
 does because nailart is also at essence 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.200
 something that is written very big 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.090
 as well as the nail art basel in saint 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.820
 top coat so you can 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.520
 apparently every nail polish 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.450
 I turn into a cent nail polish 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.250
 I can not always do that 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.920
 Imagine how things work then 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.000
 but it is great that they are more so 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.590
 Going universality is you know what 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.880
 So I want to say that you are 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.770
 virtually no cent you have to buy but 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.320
 that they are from each of your favorite 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.300

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.010
 that would like how do you like that 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.960
 products so I think there is 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.600
 really exciting with it 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.160
 and that promises to be an exciting one 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.050
 getting a position as it gets 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.510
