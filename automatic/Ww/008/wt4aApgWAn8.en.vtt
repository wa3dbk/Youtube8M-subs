00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hello everyone, Internet connection 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.110
 micro gadgets shop . iphone i'm artyom 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.599
 today's Galagan video we will check 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 how does a metal detector react to micro 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.600
 headphones and maybe scatter some 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.590
 myths and delusions that we have 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.580
 such 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 handheld metal detector from this side we 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.859
 we have a button that is transported 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.540
 metal detector in vibration mode 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.469
 but it is convenient where it is not necessary that he 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.390
 managed to peak the socket for charging holes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.840
 for a sound speaker that picks up 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 default LED but not on 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.090
 default when everything is ok it burns 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.140
 green when something finds lights up 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.620
 red and beeps from this side we see 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.309
 power button and select button and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.309
 sensitivity 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.970
 if the button is not clamped then the metal detector 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 will be in high mode 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.600
 sensitivity and respond to everything 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 contract for any metal objects 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.939
 even the smallest on all sorts of earrings 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.590
 pins needles clips micro headphones 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.710
 so look here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 ordinary pin turned on metal detector 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.600
 in high sensitivity mode 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:39.299
 we should bring a little later to drink 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:41.970
 out of a capsule on the capsules kicks 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.250
 roughly able closer than one 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.180
 centimeter that is almost close up if 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.740
 it will be in your ear, but nobody is close to 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.680
 you will not bring a metal detector 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.680
 brother is bad so there will be no pick 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:13.599
 and girls are so lucky to get dressed 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.819
 earrings will not see anything with micro 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.120
 headset sorted out now moving 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.769
 farther further we need to figure out how 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.590
 will behave a metal detector with 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.700
 a set of them about headphones understandable 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.379
 the thing is that in high mode 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.049
 sensitivity work for everything 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.280
 even on the wires so we will 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.260
 view in normal mode 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.670
 sensitivity, that is, holding this one 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:42.879
 button so we have to start the load 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.660
 set mode usually 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:52.750
 not really reacting from worth 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.780
 release the button will start squeaking kit 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.220
 virtus is also in normal mode 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.549
 sensitive with normal what not 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.680
 reacting in high glasses mode are known and 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.590
 are understandable 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.440
 react to everything interesting 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.880
 golden oak react no who 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.880
 checked post comments 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.870
 the classic kit doesn't react either 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:27.250
 another conflict in classic friendly 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:30.180
 reacts this is understandable but not everything is so 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.109
 cool to react to your phone and 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.859
 will react to any phone on the big 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:42.880
 even in normal mode 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:46.959
 less responsiveness even 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.459
 take my phone which we sell from 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:55.180
 the headset kit also responds to the same 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:59.410
 it is necessary to do where to hide 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.530
 hide I would put this phone 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.519
 barbell in shit 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.110
 Affairs would be a great big belt buckle well 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.400
 and then it is clear that the metal detector 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.810
 will react to the belt 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.269
 we will go on without much watering 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.130
 exam phone then find 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:21.430
 right moment and shift it to 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.430
 chest pocket is great further graces 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:32.169
 also does not respond to the headset at all 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.930
 normal tire sensitivity mode 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:43.460
 but in Russia itself 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.360
 still react what to do 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.669
 you have to hide and hiding the radio 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.900
 deeper that's all for today you now 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.970
 know how it came 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.970
 metal and as the market reacts 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.760
 on different sets of earpieces I wish 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.680
 you successfully find on the exam a clear and 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.080
 continuous signal and good 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.370
 assistant on the other end of the wire good luck on 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.370
 exams all bye
