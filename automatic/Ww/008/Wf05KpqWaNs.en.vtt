you

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.220 

so<00:00:34.329> this<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:36.580> chem<00:00:36.880> lab<00:00:37.090> which<00:00:37.960> is<00:00:37.989> where

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
so this is the chem lab which is where

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.650 
so this is the chem lab which is where
I'm<00:00:38.380> doing<00:00:38.530> my<00:00:38.770> art<00:00:38.920> project<00:00:39.340> this<00:00:39.820> is<00:00:40.180> the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
I'm doing my art project this is the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.830 
I'm doing my art project this is the
fume<00:00:41.020> hood<00:00:41.080> fume<00:00:41.830> hood<00:00:42.239> pulls<00:00:43.239> up<00:00:43.420> all<00:00:43.660> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
fume hood fume hood pulls up all the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.430 
fume hood fume hood pulls up all the
extra<00:00:44.050> gases<00:00:44.590> so<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.160> I<00:00:45.370> don't<00:00:45.550> breathe<00:00:46.090> in

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
extra gases so that I don't breathe in

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.110 
extra gases so that I don't breathe in
that<00:00:47.440> gas<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:48.489> way<00:00:48.519> we<00:00:48.760> set<00:00:48.940> up<00:00:48.970> this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
that gas the way we set up this

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.640 
that gas the way we set up this
experiment<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:51.100> first<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.960> take<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.230> piece<00:00:53.620> of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
experiment is first we take a piece of

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.070 
experiment is first we take a piece of
aluminum<00:00:54.010> from<00:00:54.850> my<00:00:55.120> grand<00:00:55.449> old<00:00:55.629> box<00:00:55.930> of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
aluminum from my grand old box of

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.110 
aluminum from my grand old box of
supplies

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.170 

I<00:01:01.820> have<00:01:02.820> already<00:01:03.890> sanded<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.760> shape<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.150> want

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I have already sanded the shape I want

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.180 
I have already sanded the shape I want
them<00:01:06.480> out<00:01:06.570> nice<00:01:07.500> round<00:01:07.860> corners<00:01:10.010> now<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.160> I

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
them out nice round corners now what I

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.460 
them out nice round corners now what I
need<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:12.690> can<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.020> nice<00:01:13.200> piece

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
need to do you can see this nice piece

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
need to do you can see this nice piece
is<00:01:13.920> sand<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.820> down<00:01:15.380> now<00:01:17.300> in<00:01:18.300> aluminum<00:01:18.780> is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
is sand that down now in aluminum is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.940 
is sand that down now in aluminum is
that<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.400> readily<00:01:21.030> forms<00:01:21.630> an<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.050> little<00:01:22.380> oxide

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that it readily forms an a little oxide

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
that it readily forms an a little oxide
with<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.660> rid<00:01:24.660> of<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.960> oxide<00:01:25.470> layer<00:01:26.479> sand<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with the rid of that oxide layer sand it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.910 
with the rid of that oxide layer sand it
down<00:01:29.180> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.240> easiest<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.869> before<00:01:31.410> I<00:01:31.440> put

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
down this is easiest to do before I put

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.180 
down this is easiest to do before I put
on<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.070> nice<00:01:32.729> rubber<00:01:33.090> Chemical<00:01:33.600> glove<00:01:34.130> try<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
on my nice rubber Chemical glove try to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.100 
on my nice rubber Chemical glove try to
do<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.399> earlier<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.300> cold<00:01:36.570> with

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
do the earlier and make the cold with

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.430 
do the earlier and make the cold with
their<00:01:37.410> claws<00:01:38.660> so<00:01:39.660> what<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
their claws so what I have here I

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.630 
their claws so what I have here I
finished<00:01:40.800> my<00:01:41.009> sanding<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:43.640> nice

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
finished my sanding and in this nice

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.859 
finished my sanding and in this nice
little<00:01:44.670> beaker<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:46.759> nitric<00:01:47.759> acid<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.690> will<00:01:48.810> be

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
little beaker is nitric acid and will be

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
little beaker is nitric acid and will be
very<00:01:49.050> careful<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
very careful to not get that on the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
very careful to not get that on the
camera<00:01:50.660> now<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:52.020> race<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.380> nitric<00:01:52.649> acid

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
camera now the race of the nitric acid

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.350 
camera now the race of the nitric acid
is<00:01:53.039> once<00:01:53.190> again<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.580> get<00:01:53.670> rid<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.970> alumina

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
is once again to get rid of that alumina

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.359 
is once again to get rid of that alumina
oxide<00:01:54.450> layer<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.289> step<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> surprisingly

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
oxide layer this step is surprisingly

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.779 
oxide layer this step is surprisingly
important<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.539> not<00:01:57.810> done<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:59.130> well<00:01:59.490> it's

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
important if not done then well it's

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.430 
important if not done then well it's
like<00:01:59.910> Amanda<00:02:00.210> died<00:02:00.300> as<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> have

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
like Amanda died as well but what I have

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.880 
like Amanda died as well but what I have
is<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.399> 12<00:02:02.970> volt<00:02:03.090> power<00:02:03.810> supply<00:02:04.170> now

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
is I have a 12 volt power supply now

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.430 
is I have a 12 volt power supply now
this<00:02:05.190> power<00:02:05.429> supply<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.420> essence<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.259> my

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
this power supply is the essence of my

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.160 
this power supply is the essence of my
experiment<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.100> also<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.580> my<00:02:09.060> goggles<00:02:09.420> now

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
experiment I also have my goggles now

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.920 
experiment I also have my goggles now
the<00:02:10.920> power<00:02:11.220> supply<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:12.060> basically<00:02:12.660> what

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the power supply is basically what

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.480 
the power supply is basically what
anodizing<00:02:13.530> here<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> nice<00:02:15.140> speaker<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
anodizing here we have a nice speaker of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.949 
anodizing here we have a nice speaker of
for<00:02:17.490> uric<00:02:17.790> acid<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.330> other<00:02:18.360> sulphuric<00:02:18.930> acid

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
for uric acid the other sulphuric acid

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.610 
for uric acid the other sulphuric acid
acts<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.810> catalyst<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.020> medium<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
acts as a catalyst and a medium to the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160 
acts as a catalyst and a medium to the
anodizing<00:02:22.860> purpose<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.020> negative

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
anodizing purpose this is the negative

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.830 
anodizing purpose this is the negative
anode<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.490> our<00:02:26.640> base<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.480> doesn't<00:02:27.780> get

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
anode this is our base this doesn't get

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.210 
anode this is our base this doesn't get
anodized<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.500> doesn't<00:02:28.800> make<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.920> nice

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
anodized but it doesn't make a nice

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.490 
anodized but it doesn't make a nice
effect<00:02:29.490> as<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.150> see<00:02:30.300> over<00:02:30.390> here<00:02:30.780> when

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
this one gets put through the dyeing

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.180 
this one gets put through the dyeing
it's<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.000> nice<00:02:33.150> kind<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.690> grainy<00:02:34.440> effect<00:02:34.770> with

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it's a nice kind of grainy effect with

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.339 
it's a nice kind of grainy effect with
color<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> times<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.900> was<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.170> for

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
color not a times that I was going for

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.699 
color not a times that I was going for
but<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.650> cool<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:39.140> only<00:02:40.140> requirement<00:02:40.650> is

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
but it's cool and only requirement is

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.620 
but it's cool and only requirement is
that<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.700> put<00:02:41.849> this<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.209> asset<00:02:42.540> is

positive power supply this one has been

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.800 
positive power supply this one has been
well<00:02:48.650> corroded<00:02:49.650> because<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.810> can't

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
well corroded because of that I can't

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.180 
well corroded because of that I can't
put<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> acid<00:02:52.410> anymore<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.130> do

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
put it in the acid anymore so what I do

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.680 
put it in the acid anymore so what I do
is<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.520> take<00:02:53.670> some<00:02:53.730> lumen<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.209> wire<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.510> can't

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
is I take some lumen and wire you can't

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.880 
is I take some lumen and wire you can't
you<00:02:54.930> don't<00:02:55.110> want<00:02:55.230> really<00:02:55.440> anything<00:02:55.620> but

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
you don't want really anything but

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.839 
you don't want really anything but
aluminum<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.610> acid<00:02:57.599> or<00:02:57.720> else<00:02:57.870> okay<00:02:58.849> and

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
aluminum in the acid or else okay and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.680 
aluminum in the acid or else okay and
what<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.390> do<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.260> turn<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.860> into<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.130> little

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
what I do is I turn that into a little

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.450 
what I do is I turn that into a little
of<00:03:02.930> connection<00:03:03.380> wire<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> current<00:03:04.340> can

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
of connection wire so the current can

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.930 
of connection wire so the current can
flow<00:03:04.490> directly<00:03:05.060> from<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.390> wire<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.870> piece

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
flow directly from the wire to the piece

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.270 
flow directly from the wire to the piece
okay<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.510> I've<00:03:08.840> put<00:03:09.140> my<00:03:09.380> nice<00:03:09.920> piece<00:03:10.250> of

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
okay so I've put my nice piece of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.550 
okay so I've put my nice piece of
aluminum<00:03:10.820> with<00:03:11.030> wire<00:03:11.270> into<00:03:11.780> my<00:03:11.990> beaker<00:03:12.470> of

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
aluminum with wire into my beaker of

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.500 
aluminum with wire into my beaker of
sulfuric<00:03:12.950> acid<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.760> anode<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.270> black

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
sulfuric acid the anode is the black

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.140 
sulfuric acid the anode is the black
wire<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.440> cathode<00:03:15.860> is<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.070> red<00:03:16.250> wire<00:03:16.460> it's

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
wire the cathode is the red wire it's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.340 
wire the cathode is the red wire it's
very<00:03:17.330> important<00:03:17.720> at<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.870> anode<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.200> cathode

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
very important at the anode and cathode

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.250 
very important at the anode and cathode
do<00:03:18.800> not<00:03:19.010> touch<00:03:19.280> because<00:03:19.880> if<00:03:20.090> they<00:03:20.300> touch<00:03:20.630> so

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
do not touch because if they touch so

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.600 
do not touch because if they touch so
far<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.560> will<00:03:21.620> just<00:03:21.800> go<00:03:21.890> right<00:03:22.040> through<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
far it will just go right through and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.570 
far it will just go right through and
there<00:03:23.060> will<00:03:23.300> be<00:03:23.330> no<00:03:23.830> innovation<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.370> anode

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
there will be no innovation the anode

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.220 
there will be no innovation the anode
ization<00:03:25.790> works<00:03:26.150> because<00:03:26.600> of<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.780> electrons

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
ization works because of the electrons

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.620 
ization works because of the electrons

unfortunately<00:04:30.170> this<00:04:30.260> color<00:04:30.530> rubs<00:04:30.830> off

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
unfortunately this color rubs off

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.080 
unfortunately this color rubs off
you<00:04:33.069> can<00:04:33.190> see<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.430> color<00:04:33.610> right<00:04:33.789> on<00:04:33.849> my<00:04:34.030> finger

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
you can see the color right on my finger

you can see the color right on my finger
now<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.840> way<00:04:35.139> we<00:04:35.289> get<00:04:35.440> rid<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:36.099> that

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
now the way we get rid of that is that

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.540 
now the way we get rid of that is that
we<00:04:37.509> rinse<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.900> with<00:04:38.020> distilled<00:04:38.919> water<00:04:39.039> it's

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
we rinse it with distilled water it's

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.890 
we rinse it with distilled water it's
important<00:04:39.849> to<00:04:39.909> use<00:04:40.030> distilled<00:04:40.389> in<00:04:40.629> all<00:04:40.720> your

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
important to use distilled in all your

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.409 
important to use distilled in all your
experience<00:04:41.500> because<00:04:42.220> if<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.819> don't<00:04:43.030> then<00:04:43.330> you

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
experience because if you don't then you

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.510 
experience because if you don't then you
can<00:04:43.569> get<00:04:43.690> contaminations<00:04:44.379> tap<00:04:44.650> water<00:04:44.919> is<00:04:45.039> full

really nicely well blues and greens can
just<00:05:35.469> seem<00:05:35.710> darker<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:36.699> might<00:05:36.909> have<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.090> do

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
just seem darker this might have to do

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.899 
just seem darker this might have to do
with<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.479> silver<00:05:38.319> nature<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:39.250> aluminum

with the silver nature of the aluminum

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.120 
with the silver nature of the aluminum

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
and how it shines through widen or you

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.499 
and how it shines through widen or you
leave<00:05:42.279> it<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.490> dye<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:42.669> better<00:05:43.029> color<00:05:43.330> you

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
leave it the dye the better color you

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.450 
leave it the dye the better color you
will<00:05:43.659> get<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:44.199> blue<00:05:44.440> dyes<00:05:44.740> giving<00:05:45.190> me<00:05:45.279> some

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
will get the blue dyes giving me some

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.430 
will get the blue dyes giving me some
problems<00:05:45.699> it<00:05:46.090> hasn't<00:05:46.389> taken<00:05:46.569> very<00:05:46.900> well

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
problems it hasn't taken very well

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.830 
problems it hasn't taken very well
oh<00:05:47.469> it's<00:05:48.190> clearly<00:05:48.550> blue<00:05:48.969> as<00:05:49.120> I<00:05:49.270> would<00:05:49.419> like<00:05:49.599> it

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
oh it's clearly blue as I would like it

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.300 
oh it's clearly blue as I would like it
to<00:05:49.870> be<00:05:50.069> that'll<00:05:51.069> be<00:05:51.190> a<00:05:51.219> lesson<00:05:51.430> for<00:05:51.550> next<00:05:51.729> time

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
to be that'll be a lesson for next time

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.689 
to be that'll be a lesson for next time
but<00:05:54.659> on<00:05:55.659> this<00:05:55.810> side

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.629 

it's<00:05:59.270> only<00:05:59.509> got<00:05:59.810> splotches<00:06:00.110> of<00:06:00.349> blue<00:06:00.650> still<00:06:01.520> in

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
it's only got splotches of blue still in

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.369 
it's only got splotches of blue still in
high<00:06:01.729> school<00:06:01.759> effect<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:02.569> kind<00:06:02.930> of<00:06:02.990> like<00:06:03.139> it<00:06:03.169> a

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:03.379 
high school effect I kind of like it a

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:04.989 
high school effect I kind of like it a
lot<00:06:03.650> of<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.800> energization<00:06:04.219> processes<00:06:04.819> will

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:04.999 
lot of the energization processes will

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:07.420 
lot of the energization processes will
tell<00:06:05.240> you<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.539> boil<00:06:05.780> them<00:06:06.080> I<00:06:06.289> find<00:06:06.889> there<00:06:07.129> is<00:06:07.249> no

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
tell you to boil them I find there is no

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.429 
tell you to boil them I find there is no
benefit<00:06:07.879> to<00:06:07.939> boiling<00:06:08.479> it<00:06:08.779> might<00:06:08.960> just<00:06:09.229> be<00:06:09.319> the

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:09.439 
benefit to boiling it might just be the

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.529 
benefit to boiling it might just be the
pieces<00:06:09.740> are<00:06:09.949> so<00:06:10.129> small<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.580> mostly<00:06:10.879> just<00:06:11.060> saps

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
pieces are so small it mostly just saps

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.480 
pieces are so small it mostly just saps
all<00:06:11.719> the<00:06:11.870> color<00:06:12.080> if<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:12.830> simply<00:06:13.159> just<00:06:13.310> let

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
all the color if you simply just let

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.969 
all the color if you simply just let
them<00:06:13.669> dry<00:06:14.180> after<00:06:14.689> it<00:06:14.840> being<00:06:15.169> in<00:06:15.349> the<00:06:15.379> dye<00:06:15.620> and

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
them dry after it being in the dye and

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.800 
them dry after it being in the dye and
then<00:06:16.400> rinse<00:06:16.550> them<00:06:16.759> off<00:06:16.849> the<00:06:17.090> next<00:06:17.300> day<00:06:17.360> they

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
then rinse them off the next day they

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.429 
then rinse them off the next day they
will<00:06:17.930> be<00:06:18.050> fine

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 
will be fine

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.689 
will be fine
there<00:06:18.680> are<00:06:18.770> finished<00:06:19.009> rinsing<00:06:19.159> means<00:06:19.490> they

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
there are finished rinsing means they

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.429 
there are finished rinsing means they
look<00:06:19.819> for<00:06:19.939> other<00:06:19.999> nights<00:06:20.330> I'm<00:06:20.629> quite<00:06:21.169> proud<00:06:21.379> of

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:21.439 
look for other nights I'm quite proud of

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.140 
look for other nights I'm quite proud of
them<00:06:21.620> now<00:06:22.039> over<00:06:22.219> here<00:06:22.460> we<00:06:22.639> can<00:06:22.759> see<00:06:22.939> some<00:06:23.120> of

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
them now over here we can see some of

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.670 
them now over here we can see some of
the<00:06:23.330> attempts<00:06:23.659> of<00:06:23.719> my<00:06:23.840> family<00:06:24.139> experiment<00:06:24.529> I

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
the attempts of my family experiment I

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.189 
the attempts of my family experiment I
was<00:06:25.129> using<00:06:25.310> just<00:06:25.699> a<00:06:25.789> woman<00:06:26.060> foil<00:06:26.330> as<00:06:26.599> an<00:06:26.870> anode

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
was using just a woman foil as an anode

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.950 
was using just a woman foil as an anode
and<00:06:28.150> it's<00:06:29.150> actually<00:06:29.360> very<00:06:29.479> nicely<00:06:29.659> colored

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
and it's actually very nicely colored

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.929 
and it's actually very nicely colored
I'm<00:06:30.259> just<00:06:30.379> maybe<00:06:30.590> incorporated<00:06:31.460> the<00:06:31.610> project

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:31.939 
I'm just maybe incorporated the project

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.909 
I'm just maybe incorporated the project
later<00:06:32.090> though<00:06:32.719> our<00:06:32.960> reaction<00:06:33.439> is<00:06:33.500> still<00:06:33.680> going

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
later though our reaction is still going

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.649 
later though our reaction is still going
it's<00:06:34.129> still<00:06:34.250> fizzing<00:06:34.759> nicely<00:06:35.150> it's<00:06:35.449> been

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:35.659 
it's still fizzing nicely it's been

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:37.809 
it's still fizzing nicely it's been
about<00:06:35.870> 10<00:06:36.199> minutes<00:06:36.229> but<00:06:36.889> because<00:06:37.490> of<00:06:37.520> the

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
about 10 minutes but because of the

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.209 
about 10 minutes but because of the
nature<00:06:38.000> of<00:06:38.150> how<00:06:38.419> well<00:06:38.659> it<00:06:39.259> is<00:06:39.590> fizzing<00:06:40.009> at<00:06:40.129> the

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
nature of how well it is fizzing at the

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.059 
nature of how well it is fizzing at the
moment<00:06:40.520> I'm<00:06:40.699> going<00:06:40.939> to<00:06:41.150> leave<00:06:41.300> it<00:06:41.569> this<00:06:42.259> is<00:06:42.620> a

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
moment I'm going to leave it this is a

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.909 
moment I'm going to leave it this is a
little<00:06:44.060> over<00:06:44.479> 150<00:06:44.900> degrees<00:06:45.379> for<00:06:45.650> the<00:06:45.740> dial

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
little over 150 degrees for the dial

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.769 
little over 150 degrees for the dial
down<00:06:46.009> three<00:06:46.520> and<00:06:46.550> a<00:06:46.639> half<00:06:46.729> three<00:06:47.150> maybe<00:06:47.569> it<00:06:47.689> was

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:47.779 
down three and a half three maybe it was

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.510 
down three and a half three maybe it was
a<00:06:47.810> little<00:06:47.960> overexcited<00:06:48.469> I'm<00:06:49.039> done<00:06:49.250> as<00:06:49.400> I

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
a little overexcited I'm done as I

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.240 
a little overexcited I'm done as I
turned<00:06:49.849> off<00:06:50.060> the<00:06:50.539> power<00:06:50.569> supply<00:06:50.930> turn<00:06:51.889> off<00:06:52.099> the

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
turned off the power supply turn off the

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.740 
turned off the power supply turn off the
power<00:06:52.430> supply<00:06:52.550> before<00:06:52.879> you<00:06:53.060> even<00:06:53.270> think<00:06:53.629> of

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
power supply before you even think of

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.659 
power supply before you even think of
touching<00:06:53.930> your<00:06:54.259> jar<00:06:54.529> as<00:06:55.099> I've<00:06:55.250> rinsed<00:06:55.430> this

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
touching your jar as I've rinsed this

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:57.519 
touching your jar as I've rinsed this
off<00:06:55.879> with<00:06:56.089> distilled<00:06:56.419> water<00:06:56.539> I'm<00:06:56.930> putting

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:57.529 
off with distilled water I'm putting

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.249 
off with distilled water I'm putting
this<00:06:57.710> in<00:06:57.949> the<00:06:58.009> dye<00:06:58.370> let<00:06:59.360> that<00:06:59.479> sit<00:06:59.719> there<00:06:59.749> for

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
this in the dye let that sit there for

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.439 
this in the dye let that sit there for
maybe<00:07:00.680> half<00:07:00.889> an<00:07:01.310> hour<00:07:01.430> longer<00:07:01.849> you<00:07:02.060> let<00:07:02.150> it<00:07:02.270> sit

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
maybe half an hour longer you let it sit

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.420 
maybe half an hour longer you let it sit
in<00:07:02.539> the<00:07:02.599> dye<00:07:02.719> the<00:07:02.779> better<00:07:03.169> so<00:07:03.589> here<00:07:03.979> our<00:07:04.159> piece

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
in the dye the better so here our piece

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.409 
in the dye the better so here our piece
has<00:07:04.699> actually<00:07:05.150> been<00:07:05.270> in<00:07:05.419> the<00:07:05.509> dye<00:07:06.219> now<00:07:07.219> it<00:07:08.000> is

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419 
has actually been in the dye now it is

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.960 
has actually been in the dye now it is
turning<00:07:08.629> purple
