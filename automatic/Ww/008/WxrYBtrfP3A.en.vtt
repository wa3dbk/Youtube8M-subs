00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Samsung has been equipping its smartphone 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.819
 some time already with the utmost 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.189
 practical multivendor feature from that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.990
 you can use two apps at the same time 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.910
 to display on the display and thus 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 Almost with your smartphone too multi 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.330
 feel and how it works like you 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.070
 to activate it and how he can do it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.529
 can turn off again when needed 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.109
 Let's show you now, first he goes 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.330
 into the settings menu and search there 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.849
 multi window entry which hides it in the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.160
 area sound and display and then here 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.599
 You have to be there first of all 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.460
 enable multivendor if you like that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.559
 not already done afterwards 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.440
 you can use the multi vendor feature through 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 Long pressing of the buttons back a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.960
 and hide 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.570
 you see here on the left edge of the screen 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.110
 this little arrow that fades in 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.340
 if multivendor is active from the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.079
 homescreen and from each other 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.270
 screen synonymous you can then through 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.610
 move the arrow to the right 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.059
 the multi vendor bar with the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.550
 call different apps and then 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 Here are two apps you can choose in the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.640
 display simultaneously 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.570
 wanted to accept here for example 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 once gmail and google maps short 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 hold down and then the app on the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 corresponding screen area 10 above 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.189
 or below both is possible and yes 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 Both apps will be displayed at the same time 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.200
 if you press this round button here 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.939
 can you change the aspect ratio 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.530
 depending on which app maybe bigger 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.670
 should be displayed at a large 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 This is an example of a map cut-out 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.869
 very practical to choose for the multi 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.729
 vendor function are different apps 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.950
 which we afford here in a playable way 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.150
 see left screen border when needed 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 you can also add other apps 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.200
 Just add a tip for it here 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 at the bottom of the arrow symbol and then up 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.939
 this pen with the inscription 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.430
 edit underneath then you have 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.380
 more apps you can drag and drop 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.659
 add to the list 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.640
 unfortunately there are not all installed 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.290
 apps on the smartphone just just 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.540
 these apps are great 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.340
 or samsung if you have two apps 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.080
 open at the same time we have that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.080
 here always hang us around youtube 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 you can prepare this attitude 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.420
 if you wanted to use it more often 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.340
 to save 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 in which you also down here on the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.080
 symbol taps and then goes on create 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.430
 Now you have a new window here 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200
 group you can name like you 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.640
 you want the two apps like that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.110
 let stand or any other 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 enter any name 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.810
 then you tap ok and you will 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.910
 the new window group at the top 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.400
 in the small were displayed app list 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.250
 a tip on it then goes directly to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 launch both apps at the same time 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.370
 back to homescreen as I said on 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.130
 left screen edge you see this 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.720
 case with the multi vendor apps in case of that 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.650
 arrow bothers you and you this it 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 maybe not used that often 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.280
 Just a long tap on the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.000
 back button and already he is 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.690
 disappeared 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 That's it
