trying<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> destroy<00:00:56.789> them<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.539> really

chaotic<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.320> least<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> some<00:00:58.800> fun<00:00:59.010> imagery<00:01:05.299> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

chaotic at least to some fun imagery the
one<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> probably<00:01:06.750> stands<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> most<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
incredible yeah it's still a little

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.999 
incredible yeah it's still a little
corny<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.140> make<00:01:25.350> fun<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.799> sometimes

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.030 
corny and I do make fun of it sometimes
but<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.790> still<00:01:27.090> holds<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> size<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
but it still holds up it's the size and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.289 
but it still holds up it's the size and
scope<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:29.579> give<00:01:29.880> something<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
scope that they give something that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
scope that they give something that
seems<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.869> relatively<00:01:31.470> simple<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.040> yet<00:01:32.430> they

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
seems so relatively simple and yet they

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.580 
seems so relatively simple and yet they
show<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.939> took<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.360> much<00:01:33.479> dedication<00:01:33.720> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
show that took so much dedication that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
show that took so much dedication that
image<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> apple<00:01:35.460> trees<00:01:35.700> becoming<00:01:36.119> the

image of the apple trees becoming the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.460 
image of the apple trees becoming the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
clouds that's one of the most surreal

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.810
