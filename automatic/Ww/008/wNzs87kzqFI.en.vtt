00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
John one of the main areas of concern

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130 
John one of the main areas of concern
you've<00:01:05.130> got<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.759> locomotive<00:01:06.390> what's<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you've got for the locomotive what's the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
you've got for the locomotive what's the
first<00:01:07.500> step<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:07.860> gonna<00:01:07.920> make<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.790> right

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
first step you're gonna make on it right

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.430 
first step you're gonna make on it right
well<00:01:09.680> there's<00:01:10.680> five<00:01:11.479> sort<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> major<00:01:12.810> areas

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
well there's five sort of major areas

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.240 
well there's five sort of major areas
that<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:14.520> need<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.729> look<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.830> see<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.039> can

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that we need to look at and see what can

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.330 
that we need to look at and see what can
be<00:01:17.280> done<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:18.660> first<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.290> boiler<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
be done the first is the boiler in the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
be done the first is the boiler in the
firebox<00:01:20.990> which<00:01:23.210> obviously<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> loco<00:01:24.570> hasn't

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
firebox which obviously the loco hasn't

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.160 
firebox which obviously the loco hasn't
worked<00:01:25.020> since<00:01:25.940> 1939<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:30.020> local<00:01:31.020> was

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
worked since 1939 and it was local was

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
worked since 1939 and it was local was
taken<00:01:31.830> out<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
taken out of use at that time because of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.130 
taken out of use at that time because of
a<00:01:33.810> failure<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> firebox<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.810> having<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
a failure of the firebox it was having a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.370 
a failure of the firebox it was having a
hydraulic<00:01:37.619> test<00:01:37.860> which<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.479> water<00:01:39.479> tests<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
hydraulic test which is a water tests to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.429 
hydraulic test which is a water tests to
see<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.880> weather<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.659> structurally<00:01:43.200> sound

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
see if the weather is structurally sound

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
see if the weather is structurally sound
and<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.799> failed<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.549> think<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.540> on

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and it failed and we think we can see on

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.370 
and it failed and we think we can see on
the<00:01:46.200> inner<00:01:46.380> firebox<00:01:46.890> where<00:01:47.450> where<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.689> area

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the inner firebox where where that area

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.030 
the inner firebox where where that area
of<00:01:49.530> leakage<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:51.439> it's<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.740> its<00:01:52.979> original

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
of leakage was it's got its original

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.870 
of leakage was it's got its original
copper<00:01:53.670> firebox<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
copper firebox in there you see this is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.800 
copper firebox in there you see this is
the<00:01:56.970> outside<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.659> firebox<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:59.810> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the outside of the firebox just here the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.770 
the outside of the firebox just here the
inner<00:02:00.990> firebox<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.950> inside<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:03.090> we're

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
inner firebox is inside there we're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.929 
inner firebox is inside there we're
actually<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.170> obviously<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> fire<00:02:05.070> burns

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
actually the obviously the fire burns

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.789 
actually the obviously the fire burns
that's<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.020> an<00:02:07.170> original<00:02:07.350> copper

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that's a that's an original copper

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.420 
that's a that's an original copper
firebox

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.370 

the<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.299> course<00:02:12.360> it'll<00:02:12.630> be<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.780> lot<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> work

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the and of course it'll be a lot of work

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.910 
the and of course it'll be a lot of work
on<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:14.579> rest<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> boiler<00:02:15.239> as<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:15.920> if

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
on the rest of the boiler as well if if

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.150 
on the rest of the boiler as well if if
it<00:02:17.340> could<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.940> reused<00:02:18.570> which<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.170> by<00:02:19.560> no<00:02:19.829> means

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it could be reused which is by no means

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.670 
it could be reused which is by no means
certain<00:02:20.940> at<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:21.299> point<00:02:21.480> until<00:02:21.959> we've

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
certain at this point until we've

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.479 
certain at this point until we've
dismantled<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> loco<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.570> had<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.489> proper

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
dismantled the loco and had a proper

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.640 
dismantled the loco and had a proper
look<00:02:26.639> at<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.940> boiler<00:02:27.359> we<00:02:27.989> don't<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:28.440> know

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
look at the boiler we don't really know

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.410 
look at the boiler we don't really know
whether

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
whether

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.190 
whether
it's<00:02:30.420> feasible<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.530> restore<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.190> or<00:02:32.340> whether

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
it's feasible to restore it or whether

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.780 
it's feasible to restore it or whether
it<00:02:34.200> will<00:02:34.350> be<00:02:34.380> more<00:02:34.680> sensible<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.550> new

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
it will be more sensible to have a new

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.240 
it will be more sensible to have a new
boiler<00:02:36.180> which<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.790> alternative<00:02:40.250> where

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
boiler which is the alternative where

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
boiler which is the alternative where
would<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.460> get<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.670> boiler<00:02:41.940> from<00:02:42.230> well<00:02:43.230> we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
would you get the boiler from well we

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.460 
would you get the boiler from well we
would<00:02:43.800> build<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.760> boiler<00:02:44.940> here<00:02:45.240> we've<00:02:46.050> built

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
would build the boiler here we've built

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.010 
would build the boiler here we've built
a<00:02:46.950> couple<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.880> boilers<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.330> past<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.870> done

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
a couple of boilers in the past and done

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.510 
a couple of boilers in the past and done
extensive<00:02:49.890> repairs<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:52.980> would<00:02:53.190> probably

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
extensive repairs so we would probably

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.880 
extensive repairs so we would probably
build<00:02:53.970> build<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> boiler<00:02:54.780> here<00:02:54.990> we've<00:02:55.710> got

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
build build the boiler here we've got

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.390 
build build the boiler here we've got
the<00:02:56.040> skills<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.780> facilities<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.800> do<00:02:59.130> that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the skills and the facilities to do that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.550 
the skills and the facilities to do that
if<00:03:00.210> we<00:03:00.360> built<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.600> completely<00:03:00.930> new<00:03:01.170> one<00:03:01.410> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
if we built a completely new one it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.310 
if we built a completely new one it
would<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> an<00:03:02.390> absolute<00:03:03.390> replica<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:03.960> this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
would be a an absolute replica of this

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.650 
would be a an absolute replica of this
one<00:03:04.620> only<00:03:05.090> varying<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:07.970> modern<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.480> some

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
one only varying in modern with some

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.230 
one only varying in modern with some
modern<00:03:09.870> constructional<00:03:10.770> details<00:03:11.280> but

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
modern constructional details but

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.850 
modern constructional details but
basically<00:03:12.570> we<00:03:12.750> will<00:03:12.900> make<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.260> new<00:03:13.380> boiler<00:03:13.590> to

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
basically we will make the new boiler to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.210 
basically we will make the new boiler to
fit<00:03:14.130> exactly<00:03:14.670> where<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.440> fits<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.070> that

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
fit exactly where this one fits so that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.860 
fit exactly where this one fits so that
we<00:03:17.310> didn't<00:03:17.550> compromise<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.480> rest<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
we didn't compromise the rest of the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:28.010 
we didn't compromise the rest of the
lobe

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.080
