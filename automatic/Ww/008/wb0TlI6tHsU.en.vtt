00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.800
 well everyone the sergeant so from the side 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.149
 Visitor you all very 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.039
 well today between you for a 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.359
 pretty special video no city or 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.070
 information that will really be a 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.329
 big video finally we 're not going to be 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.800
 very long but necessary a video 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.300
 very important about my channel 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.949
 so I have several ads to you 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.899
 to make announcements that they totally 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.149
 changed my channel so as you 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.970
 doubt I think so because this volume 3 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.500
 is coming very fast so the videos 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.280
 of generation on my motel chain 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.600
 finished so there recently at the same time 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 that recently a few days ago then 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.170
 that I make you this city where I had 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.610
 claude is the last city to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.430
 generations whose he was the tutor of 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.140
 lv2 kisame so that was my last 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.280
 of the last generations so everything 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.229
 just to tell you that it does not serve 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.970
 nothing to offer me challenges on 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.400
 generation because the challenges I'm going 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.079
 take over this project on 33 and that's 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.250
 same for tutorials so some 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.659
 tutorials that I was asked again on 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.400
 generation unfortunately china then 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.200
 do them so I'll do them too 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.540
 on three is to tell you also a 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.070
 little my projects on 103 so I have not 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.049
 a lot a lot to think again I 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.970
 some ideas but it will deepen I 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.300
 will see the exit of the game but in all 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.680
 case I'm going to relaunch the project that 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.880
 I had started on a generation of which I 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.310
 spoken several times lately 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.479
 so really lajous I'm doing this video 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.850
 really for you really you 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.820
 announce it as first 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.070
 I deferred or two eyes so you 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.780
 on this volume iii you can 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.430
 start right now I think because 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.890
 that recently I also put the roster 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.860
 official naruto storm iii game there he 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.119
 is meant completely legitimate 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.979
 so that it is indeed the original in 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.020
 revenge it's true they made me a lot 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.460
 Note the call to arms myself 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.450
 I noticed that the notebooks were missing 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.740
 on it so it's true 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.170
 the four fashion and autumn fogging cases 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.580
 it may be that they will be in a 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.200
 secondary page or what I do not know 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.110
 in any case I know that the camilla type 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.369
 the picture did indeed have the game so it's 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.470
 well and truly official images 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.940
 so you have an idea of ​​the characters 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.750
 available on the eyes so you 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.250
 can start now 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.110
 to send your combat queries you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.450
 will want wood so why am I doing this 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.880
 I do not do it I prefer buses or 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.170
 anything is simply 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.580
 because the game as I wanted 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.680
 often said I would have it well in advance 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.450
 before the official release is March 8 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.819
 in Europe 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.739
 I might have it on the 28th or the 1st 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.299
 March I do not know so that's why 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.850
 that I would like to propose the 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.890
 galettes you will want to see my opinion 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.600
 a lot of people who are crazy about beginnings 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.370
 on the game also for that I liked it 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.500
 put one more match I invite to be in 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.320
 vacation so start it's the top one 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.640
 makes a flow of water and so that's it 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.230
 so suddenly you can offer me your 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.959
 combat queries you will want to see on 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.370
 the game so I'll do with a friend 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.930

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.829

 what will help me on this small project 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.150
 so here are other things to know 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.250

 anyway not for now 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.450
 maybe later in the months to 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.390

 which will be filmed but not comment 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.390
 on the one hand it's not bad anymore 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.970

 here she will not comment for 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.730
 the moment but perhaps in the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.319
 next few months 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.550
 she will be I want it is true you want 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.959
 to put it as soon as possible is 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.090
 true that the club is likely to be very, very 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.260
 long as the videos will last 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.489
 average one hour an hour and a half 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.900
 short for those who want 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.489
 look in any case the story that are 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.959
 really very curious they can those 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.290
 who do not want to eat anything to you 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.760
 to say you do what you want 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.769
 lastly last thing I'm going to you 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.799
 speak who does not have 33.60 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.870
 rather constructor my string so that 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.500
 first I will talk about the actors who 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.360
 are on my channel 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.920
 no I do not know if you look at this 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.720
 video so small and all alone that you 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.069

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.829

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.069
 I do not like you honestly I think 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.810
 it's not my videos that you do not like 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.670
 it's more like me because when I see 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.620
 that I put a video and that that lasts 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.910
 15 minutes usually on a tutorial and 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.470
 when I see two minutes after I get 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.760
 take 10 inches russia anyway 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.489

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.810

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.700

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.440
 do not know I do not know why you 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.150
 would you be mad or what I 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.919
 do not do that to get rid of rabies 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.200
 some people not at all 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.460

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.330

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.020

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.190
 computer to put red thumbs and 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.420
 I would like you to explain to me 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.680
 if it really is 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.310
 a thing you do not like at home on 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.540
 my videos or what because in the end 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.760
 it's not really even knowing 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.140
 now if there are really any real 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.820
 Beaune to me because I really 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.900
 consider not a subscriber to me I 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.550

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.290
 interest 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.300
 in short, you do what you want 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.070
 Anyway, I'm not sure I did not continue 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.720

 this moment I do not know why 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.640
 maybe it's my subscribers who 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.620
 share my videos on several 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.590
