 very good we are all here in a 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.280
 new play and this time we are here in a 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.950
 direct gameplay of broth aunt mans 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.580
 warfare that good today I bring you a 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.890
 new series that came to my mind 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.170
 and it's about opening supplies and I'm going to 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.250
 do a guy I do not know a kind of road 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.840
 and this time I'm going to do a little while at 27 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.910
 oxidize that for me is the best weapon of the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.930
 game and well I'm going to open three 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 supplies until I touch that 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.980
 that weapon that I want and another thing like 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.500
 he saw before beginning is that 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.210
 the game allows you to store 3 or 4 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.340
 supply I do not remember it seems to me that 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 are 3 then what I'm going to do is 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.840
 open these three to a little cut and I 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.030
 I start playing games got three 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.790
 more I open and another three more opens and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.769
 then I'm going to open nine and I'm going to do 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.870
 this is the first chapter and I'm going to 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.970
 make chapters until I touch the 27 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.860

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.660
