lot<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.280> points<00:01:27.580> even<00:01:27.970> against<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.509> good

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.160 
lot of points even against a good
defense<00:01:28.720> as<00:01:29.229> Ohio<00:01:29.590> State<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:30.720> card<00:01:31.720> would<00:01:31.990> key

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
defense as Ohio State a card would key

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.319 
defense as Ohio State a card would key
players<00:01:32.409> on<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.650> Razorback<00:01:33.070> defense<00:01:33.549> need<00:01:34.150> to

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
players on the Razorback defense need to

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.780 
players on the Razorback defense need to
step<00:01:35.200> up<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.470> contain<00:01:35.799> this<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.400> Buckeye

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
step up to contain this this Buckeye

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.969 
step up to contain this this Buckeye
offense<00:01:37.210> led<00:01:37.420> by<00:01:37.600> its<00:01:37.720> real<00:01:37.900> prior<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.530> a

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
offense led by its real prior this is a

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.350 
offense led by its real prior this is a
dual<00:01:39.220> threat<00:01:39.579> I<00:01:39.759> don't<00:01:39.939> think<00:01:39.970> it's<00:01:40.180> gonna<00:01:40.299> be

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
dual threat I don't think it's gonna be

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.910 
dual threat I don't think it's gonna be
any<00:01:40.509> key<00:01:40.720> players<00:01:41.020> itself<00:01:41.500> i<00:01:41.619> think<00:01:41.650> it's

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
any key players itself i think it's

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.460 
any key players itself i think it's
going<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.070> be<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.280> defense<00:01:42.670> itself<00:01:43.470> because

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
going to be the defense itself because

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.499 
going to be the defense itself because
if<00:01:44.740> if<00:01:45.220> you're<00:01:45.520> putting<00:01:45.759> pressure<00:01:46.119> on<00:01:46.270> him

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
if if you're putting pressure on him

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.120 
if if you're putting pressure on him
he's<00:01:46.659> going<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.899> run<00:01:47.110> we<00:01:47.560> all<00:01:47.680> know<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:47.890> he's

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
he's going to run we all know that he's

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.850 
he's going to run we all know that he's
got<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> arm<00:01:48.399> he<00:01:49.180> got<00:01:49.420> legs<00:01:49.689> he's<00:01:50.290> got<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.619> tools

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
got a arm he got legs he's got the tools

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.710 
got a arm he got legs he's got the tools
and<00:01:51.159> if<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.610> get<00:01:51.729> pressure<00:01:52.030> on<00:01:52.149> you<00:01:52.299> gotta<00:01:52.479> run

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
and if you get pressure on you gotta run

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.080 
and if you get pressure on you gotta run
but<00:01:53.140> if<00:01:53.259> you<00:01:53.380> see<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.829> safeties<00:01:54.340> making

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
but if you see the safeties making

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.120 
but if you see the safeties making
tackle<00:01:55.509> after<00:01:55.659> taco<00:01:56.020> after<00:01:56.380> tackle<00:01:56.799> that's<00:01:57.040> a

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
tackle after taco after tackle that's a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.039 
tackle after taco after tackle that's a
bad<00:01:57.250> thing<00:01:57.310> for<00:01:57.579> us<00:01:58.030> all<00:01:58.210> it's<00:01:58.659> going<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:58.960> be<00:01:59.020> a

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
bad thing for us all it's going to be a

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.020 
bad thing for us all it's going to be a
long<00:01:59.259> day<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.829> think<00:02:00.250> one<00:02:00.430> thing<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.700> look<00:02:00.820> at<00:02:00.969> is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
long day I think one thing to look at is

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.209 
long day I think one thing to look at is
it's<00:02:01.270> going<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.479> it's<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.079> dome<00:02:02.290> so

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
it's going to it's in a dome so

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.560 
it's going to it's in a dome so
weather's<00:02:03.610> not<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:03.969> be<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.090> factor<00:02:04.540> here

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
weather's not going to be a factor here

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.420 
weather's not going to be a factor here
and<00:02:04.990> you've<00:02:05.200> got<00:02:05.409> two<00:02:05.619> quarterbacks<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.280> got

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
and you've got two quarterbacks you got

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.740 
and you've got two quarterbacks you got
the<00:02:06.579> gunslinger<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.450> got

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
the gunslinger and you got

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.900 
the gunslinger and you got
when<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:07.990> can<00:02:08.110> swing<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.590> run<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.250> you

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
when it can swing it and run it and you

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.280 
when it can swing it and run it and you
know<00:02:09.940> with<00:02:10.149> know<00:02:10.300> whether<00:02:10.570> throw<00:02:10.869> minutes

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
know with know whether throw minutes

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.100 
know with know whether throw minutes
it's<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.890> be<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.040> high<00:02:12.250> scoring<00:02:12.490> game

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's going to be a high scoring game

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.540 
it's going to be a high scoring game
don't<00:02:14.110> reduce<00:02:14.350> your<00:02:14.560> prediction<00:02:15.010> well<00:02:15.400> I'm

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
don't reduce your prediction well I'm

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.530 
don't reduce your prediction well I'm
looking<00:02:15.670> around<00:02:15.910> here<00:02:16.150> i'm<00:02:16.240> looking<00:02:16.480> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
looking around here i'm looking to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.200 
looking around here i'm looking to
arkansas<00:02:16.900> 42<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.740> Ohio<00:02:18.370> State<00:02:18.640> 35<00:02:19.060> i<00:02:19.090> think

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
arkansas 42 and Ohio State 35 i think

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.180 
arkansas 42 and Ohio State 35 i think
Ron<00:02:19.660> Mallett's<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.290> too<00:02:20.530> much<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:20.950> he

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
Ron Mallett's just too much I think he

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.120 
Ron Mallett's just too much I think he
wears<00:02:21.400> down<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.880> Ohio<00:02:22.120> State<00:02:22.390> defense<00:02:22.800> yeah<00:02:23.800> i

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
wears down on Ohio State defense yeah i

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.620 
wears down on Ohio State defense yeah i
agree<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> think<00:02:24.820> or<00:02:25.060> Gasol<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:25.570> to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
agree we I think or Gasol is going to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.480 
agree we I think or Gasol is going to
put<00:02:25.780> up<00:02:25.870> all<00:02:26.050> kinds<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.440> points<00:02:26.800> Ohio<00:02:27.190> State's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
put up all kinds of points Ohio State's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.130 
put up all kinds of points Ohio State's
defense<00:02:27.880> hasn't<00:02:28.120> seen<00:02:28.360> anything<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:28.900> this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
defense hasn't seen anything like this

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.800 
defense hasn't seen anything like this
all<00:02:29.620> season<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.120> flip<00:02:31.330> side<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:31.660> I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
all season on the flip side of that I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.020 
all season on the flip side of that I
think<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.680> Arkansas's<00:02:33.310> defense<00:02:33.760> kind<00:02:33.970> of

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
think that Arkansas's defense kind of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.060 
think that Arkansas's defense kind of
got<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> bad<00:02:34.360> name<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> little<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:34.990> giving<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.380> 65

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
got a bad name a little bit giving up 65

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.770 
got a bad name a little bit giving up 65
points<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.640> Auburn<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.450> think<00:02:37.510> they're<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
points to Auburn but I think they're a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.420 
points to Auburn but I think they're a
lot<00:02:37.900> better<00:02:38.080> than<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.470> they're<00:02:38.680> ranked<00:02:38.920> 34th

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
lot better than that they're ranked 34th

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.060 
lot better than that they're ranked 34th
nationally<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.180> defense<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.200> i<00:02:41.230> don't<00:02:41.830> i<00:02:42.010> don't

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
nationally in defense so i don't i don't

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.580 
nationally in defense so i don't i don't
see<00:02:42.400> them<00:02:42.580> giving<00:02:42.910> up<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.150> ton<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.480> point<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.470> in

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
see them giving up a ton of point and in

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.680 
see them giving up a ton of point and in
fact<00:02:44.739> i<00:02:44.920> don't<00:02:45.100> i<00:02:45.310> think<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> good<00:02:46.630> game

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
fact i don't i think this is a good game

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.570 
fact i don't i think this is a good game
going<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.380> but<00:02:47.590> i<00:02:47.650> don't<00:02:47.890> i<00:02:48.070> don't<00:02:48.130> have<00:02:48.459> that

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580
