00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.210 
gray layer and then you have the teal
and<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.430> white<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.330> inside<00:02:22.020> people<00:02:22.980> asked

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and the white is the inside people asked

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.949 
and the white is the inside people asked
me<00:02:23.310> if<00:02:23.490> these<00:02:23.670> are<00:02:23.910> painted<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.510> no<00:02:24.690> they're

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
me if these are painted and no they're

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.350 
me if these are painted and no they're
not<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.830> natural<00:02:26.280> colors<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.180> egg

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
not it's a natural colors of the egg

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.800 
not it's a natural colors of the egg
itself<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.670> white<00:02:29.880> layer<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.450> something

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
itself and the white layer is something

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.780 
itself and the white layer is something
like<00:02:30.959> five<00:02:31.290> or<00:02:31.530> six<00:02:31.800> one<00:02:32.070> thousand<00:02:32.610> seven

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
like five or six one thousand seven

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.759 
like five or six one thousand seven
eight<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.510> very<00:02:33.720> fragile<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.530> that's

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
eight so it's very fragile and that's

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.340 
eight so it's very fragile and that's
why<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> reinforce<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.269> glue<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:37.170> use<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
why I reinforce it with the glue I use a

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.410 
why I reinforce it with the glue I use a
sock<00:02:40.350> filled<00:02:40.739> with<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.190> karyam<00:02:42.500> gravel<00:02:43.500> I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
sock filled with the karyam gravel I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.199 
sock filled with the karyam gravel I
used<00:02:45.420> one<00:02:45.690> sometimes<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.530> hand<00:02:46.830> rest<00:02:47.130> but<00:02:48.120> I

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
used one sometimes for a hand rest but I

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.210 
used one sometimes for a hand rest but I
always<00:02:48.300> have<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:48.870> underneath<00:02:49.230> my<00:02:49.530> egg<00:02:49.769> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
always have one underneath my egg and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.160 
always have one underneath my egg and
it's<00:02:50.790> loose<00:02:51.030> enough<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.840> move<00:02:52.019> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
it's loose enough that I can move it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
it's loose enough that I can move it
around<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.890> can<00:02:53.130> have<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.550> egg

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
around so that I can have the egg

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.780 
around so that I can have the egg
exactly<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.780> want<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.739> when<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.550> turn

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
exactly like I want it and when I turn

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.640 
exactly like I want it and when I turn
it<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:58.170> air<00:02:58.320> will<00:02:58.560> flow<00:02:58.590> through<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.489> and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
it on the air will flow through here and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.500 
it on the air will flow through here and
got<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> filter<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.459> people<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.239> know<00:03:03.300> you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
got a filter so that people you know you

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.180 
got a filter so that people you know you
don't<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:04.050> contaminated<00:03:04.470> they're<00:03:05.010> not

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
don't get contaminated they're not

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.900 
don't get contaminated they're not
breathing

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
breathing

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.600 
breathing
the<00:03:06.420> calcium<00:03:07.019> does<00:03:07.230> dust<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.100> comes<00:03:08.340> from

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the calcium does dust that comes from

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.730 
the calcium does dust that comes from
the<00:03:08.760> egg

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.040 

hopefully<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:17.300> turned<00:03:17.630> out<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.810> realize<00:03:18.650> egg
