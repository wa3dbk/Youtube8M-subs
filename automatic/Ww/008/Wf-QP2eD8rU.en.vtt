00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
with him what did he expect to see when

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.910 
with him what did he expect to see when
he's<00:04:53.860> about<00:04:53.980> 67<00:04:54.760> years<00:04:55.000> old<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.740> mean<00:04:56.740> he's

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
he's about 67 years old I mean he's

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.220 
he's about 67 years old I mean he's
still<00:04:57.100> kind<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.490> naive<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.180> having<00:04:58.990> this<00:04:59.050> good

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
still kind of naive and having this good

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.690 
still kind of naive and having this good
time<00:04:59.470> in<00:04:59.620> his<00:04:59.710> life<00:04:59.920> and<00:05:00.160> stuff<00:05:00.340> like<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.670> I

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
time in his life and stuff like that I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.010 
time in his life and stuff like that I
don't<00:05:00.820> think<00:05:01.060> he's<00:05:01.150> thinking<00:05:01.450> too<00:05:01.570> much<00:05:01.600> about

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
don't think he's thinking too much about

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.920 
don't think he's thinking too much about
it<00:05:02.260> but<00:05:02.410> I'm<00:05:02.560> thinking<00:05:02.590> about<00:05:02.950> it<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.910> I<00:05:04.780> think

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
it but I'm thinking about it and I think

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.490 
it but I'm thinking about it and I think
that<00:05:05.520> we<00:05:06.520> got<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:06.790> get<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.000> right<00:05:07.210> we<00:05:08.200> got<00:05:08.350> it

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
that we got to get it right we got it

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.460 
that we got to get it right we got it
just<00:05:08.680> gives<00:05:08.860> me<00:05:08.950> more<00:05:09.220> motivation<00:05:10.260> so<00:05:11.260> there's

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
just gives me more motivation so there's

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.920 
just gives me more motivation so there's
no<00:05:11.650> way<00:05:11.890> I<00:05:11.920> used<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.670> say<00:05:12.850> when<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.060> was<00:05:13.180> young<00:05:13.750> I

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
no way I used to say when I was young I

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.190 
no way I used to say when I was young I
think<00:05:14.230> like<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.470> lot<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:14.800> people<00:05:15.190> do<00:05:15.580> if<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.930> had<00:05:17.170> a

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
think like a lot of people do if I had a

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.780 
think like a lot of people do if I had a
thought<00:05:17.560> when<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:17.770> was<00:05:18.010> young<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.340> said<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.700> to

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
thought when I was young I said it to

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.720 
thought when I was young I said it to
myself<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.270> know<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:19.480> did<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:20.400> was<00:05:21.400> very<00:05:21.460> close<00:05:21.700> to

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
myself I know I did I was very close to

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.300 
myself I know I did I was very close to
my<00:05:21.970> father<00:05:22.240> was<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.600> oldest<00:05:22.930> son<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.170> he<00:05:23.980> was

my father was the oldest son and he was

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.950 
my father was the oldest son and he was
a<00:05:24.340> great<00:05:24.670> example<00:05:24.820> for<00:05:25.180> me<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.480> only<00:05:25.690> had<00:05:25.930> a

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
a great example for me I only had a

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.770 
a great example for me I only had a
couple<00:05:26.200> years<00:05:26.470> education<00:05:26.950> but<00:05:27.430> he<00:05:28.300> left<00:05:28.630> me
