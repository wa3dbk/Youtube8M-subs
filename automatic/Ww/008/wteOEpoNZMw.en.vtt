00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
have to get out on the engine 888 DS I'm

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.939 
have to get out on the engine 888 DS I'm
not<00:04:44.820> sure<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.930> can<00:04:46.050> see<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.500> let's<00:04:46.740> see<00:04:46.830> if<00:04:46.860> I

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
not sure you can see that let's see if I

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:54.980 
not sure you can see that let's see if I
can<00:04:47.130> zoom<00:04:47.159> in<00:04:53.270> see<00:04:54.270> if<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.419> can<00:04:54.599> get<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.780> better

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
can zoom in see if I can get a better

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.790 
can zoom in see if I can get a better
view<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.440> those<00:04:56.900> okay<00:04:57.900> wants<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.289> focus<00:04:58.469> on

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
view of those okay wants to focus on

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.440 
view of those okay wants to focus on
those

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.670 

oh<00:05:02.820> right<00:05:03.820> there<00:05:04.270> there's<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.230> engines<00:05:05.530> right

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
oh right there there's the engines right

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.260 
oh right there there's the engines right
there<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:08.470> doubt<00:05:09.100> this<00:05:09.250> spin<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.850> fan<00:05:10.030> blades

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
there I doubt this spin the fan blades

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.680 
there I doubt this spin the fan blades
but<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:12.190> on<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.370> top<00:05:12.580> there's<00:05:12.880> some<00:05:13.390> antennas

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
but the on the top there's some antennas

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.280 
but the on the top there's some antennas
right<00:05:13.900> there

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
right there

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.360

all right there this one on the bottom
right<00:05:18.580> there<00:05:19.440> um<00:05:20.820> beacon<00:05:21.820> right<00:05:21.940> there<00:05:23.040> um<00:05:24.040> red

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
right there um beacon right there um red

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.980 
right there um beacon right there um red
tail<00:05:25.030> I<00:05:25.240> lost

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
tail I lost

other stuff there's an antenna right

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.140 
other stuff there's an antenna right
there<00:06:30.960> judge<00:06:31.960> its<00:06:32.260> logo<00:06:32.680> stand<00:06:33.130> whole<00:06:33.370> aisle

there judge its logo stand whole aisle
main<00:06:34.480> gear<00:06:34.920> yeah<00:06:35.920> there's<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.370> exit

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
main gear yeah there's the exit

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.840 
main gear yeah there's the exit
underneath<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.830> fuselage<00:06:39.250> I<00:06:39.280> was<00:06:39.520> talking

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
underneath the fuselage I was talking

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.750 
underneath the fuselage I was talking
about<00:06:39.880> the<00:06:40.690> stairs<00:06:40.990> that<00:06:41.080> come<00:06:41.260> down<00:06:41.410> so

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
about the stairs that come down so

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.820 
about the stairs that come down so
that's<00:06:42.760> basically<00:06:43.120> it<00:06:43.330> oh<00:06:43.450> yeah<00:06:43.710> once<00:06:44.710> a

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
that's basically it oh yeah once a

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.530 
that's basically it oh yeah once a
second<00:06:46.200> see<00:06:47.200> if<00:06:47.290> the<00:06:47.380> real<00:06:47.560> wheels<00:06:48.010> roll<00:06:48.540> and

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
second see if the real wheels roll and

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.050 
second see if the real wheels roll and
they<00:06:49.780> do<00:06:49.840> which<00:06:50.740> I<00:06:50.950> it<00:06:51.010> will<00:06:51.160> not<00:06:51.340> roll<00:06:52.000> I

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
they do which I it will not roll I

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.130 
they do which I it will not roll I
usually<00:06:52.390> don't<00:06:52.480> roll<00:06:52.690> them<00:06:52.780> though<00:06:52.930> cuz

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
usually don't roll them though cuz

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.500 
usually don't roll them though cuz
that's<00:06:53.380> I<00:06:53.650> can<00:06:54.370> get<00:06:54.490> them<00:06:56.940> damaged<00:06:57.940> if<00:06:58.270> you<00:06:58.360> do

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
that's I can get them damaged if you do

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.230 
that's I can get them damaged if you do
too<00:06:58.660> much<00:06:58.810> so<00:06:59.050> anyways<00:06:59.670> that's<00:07:00.670> basically<00:07:01.060> it

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
too much so anyways that's basically it

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.460 
too much so anyways that's basically it
so

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
so

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.160 
so
yeah<00:07:04.300> policy<00:07:05.300> makes<00:07:05.480> it<00:07:05.600> on<00:07:05.690> the<00:07:05.750> standard

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.170 
yeah policy makes it on the standard

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:11.140 
yeah policy makes it on the standard
book<00:07:06.320> actually<00:07:08.830> sometimes<00:07:09.830> like<00:07:10.280> it<00:07:10.910> won't

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
book actually sometimes like it won't

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.680 
book actually sometimes like it won't
really<00:07:11.780> work<00:07:12.220> if<00:07:13.220> I<00:07:13.370> put<00:07:13.640> it<00:07:13.730> on<00:07:13.820> this<00:07:13.940> hand<00:07:14.210> or

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
really work if I put it on this hand or

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.210 
really work if I put it on this hand or
not<00:07:14.780> this<00:07:15.050> model<00:07:15.410> but<00:07:15.500> other<00:07:15.680> ones<00:07:15.830> that<00:07:16.070> have
