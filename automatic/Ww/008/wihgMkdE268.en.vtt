00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:24.539
 do believe you tube roleplaying will he 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.460
 At the first time get wet 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.920
 eyes because of course they recognize here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.289
 Baldur's Gate 2 again have just returned 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.930
 a dialogue belongs to where the good john 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.989
 deere amicus what the best there is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 not the villain from baulos kat2 and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 that's the meanwhile johnny 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 still a talk of mine 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
 favorite villains on the game because 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.039
 it still works for me one of the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.050
 best role playing games 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.760
 so far it is not in Hessian 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.469
 really so enhanced you can already see it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 the game has not changed much 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 the biggest change is just that one 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.840
 it now has with widescreen immediately so 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.239
 you can use the high resolution 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.220
 quite a bit zoom in why too 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.439
 always 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.970
 and that was it so it has a textures 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.140
 Do not hold big what you do zooms 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.520
 then just a little bit 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080
 worse resolved when you get closer 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.000
 is 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.409
 also the menu structure you see 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
 is actually what the balance g2 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.450
 also know veteran batteries from that time 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.369
 and to take all that in hens 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.270
 freedom of association first yes the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.460
 developers have it also be 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 focused and even more new content 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.189
 There's four new ones 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.740
 characters vary as well as 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.070
 sympathetic they are so what two evil 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.560
 types that are too evil for me they are 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.170
 do not have any deep just this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.240
 just bad and then , though 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 even the monk of from the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 the first knows the ugly to 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.549
 also has a very fast 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.619
 interesting quest series because you have in 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 dialogues that revolve around faith 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.729
 and so on and so on, so typical 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.979
 baldur's gate so that this situation again 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.340
 always read a lot because not everything 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.670
 is set to music and you can then too 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.229
 the romances start that very cool so 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.550
 This could sign at the beginning of the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.350
 main herds then 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.790
 gather a group around you and with you 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.980
 which you can then just interview that 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.150
 was the great thing because the g2 yes that 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.740
 Can we still have it there? 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.340
 not much changed by the way of playing 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.140
 what chris even the old ones 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.210
 characters react to the 9 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.440
 it all works in text form because one 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.300
 logically old dubbing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.950
 of course, but not anymore 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.330
 example of such a waiter of the paladin 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.490
 upright quarrels that is not so 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.490
 Excited about being with the vampire in 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.110
 rom draws the nice already says a lot 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.670
 You may have to read this 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.950
 work out a little bit that there is 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.990
 tons of text in balance g2 like you 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.240
 Saxony is not all set to music for a long time 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.280
 but already the text screen is 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.840
 big and there you will be very 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.880
 have to read a lot without saying everything 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.240
 English because there is no German 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.770
 language with the hessian and what would be 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.020
 I was also a bit disturbed 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.020
 Dialoge are synonymous not so cool so before 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.880
 all the new the old good but what 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.760
 now everything that is new in the meantime 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.640
 there is often too much of this humor 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.950
 has draufgesetzt is inappropriate acts 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.810
 then every one of them and so on 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.370
 the opponents bicker and so on 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.360
 is about the atmosphere lost it 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.650
 Not for me soon 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.980
 just as the charm of the old 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.320
 dialogue and still the story 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.360
 a bit slow for today tells 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.880
 conditions so if we are there now 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.680
 start what is for today from the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.450
 because of course you can go there big 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.430
 discusses whether that is still good now 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.070
 is or worse or many people 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.060
 that's just what you want to say and therefore 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.989
 I once vienna fits on the market 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.760
 the people, however, still the 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.920
 from that time want that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.380
 continue to ask because there is yes 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.970
 not really done much 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.739
 is playing very, very old-fashioned yes 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.810
 the worst is actually for me 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.480
 the inventory and, above all, that it 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.730
 no mouse over or no tooltips 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.140
 Actually, you always have to go with that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.370
 right-click on objects on magic 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.920
 Click to get out for that 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.090
 at all and you realize that very much 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.010
 the game is geared up only 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.330
 these old guys he did before 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.900
 have already played and know what 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.989
 expects newcomers to the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.180
 yes, the puke I complain hopelessly 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.919
 outdated hardly needs any comfort functions 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.449
 by clicking menu again 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.889
 and compare character values 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.780
 and it's just like that 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.919
 also awkward one would have thanks 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.449
 just think five minutes 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.090
 he should have the better possibility 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.050
 found and then s then goes as 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.940
 things that me already in the original 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.350
 have put the wayfinding to 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.600
 example , there was times here 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.090
 unexpected on the red character 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.919
 jÃ¶rg berger thinks right , thinks 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.449
 on the left , he turns back and that 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.789
 can fight a lot at the moment, of course 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:58.520
 be fatal if someone for agency 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:05:00.260
 is dungeons yes who knows this 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.630
 he knows that's the intro 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.449
 throne of choice and the addon is 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.340
 of course , so what you something 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.260
 One size is in the game there can 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.820
 you do not really complain now 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.280
 100 hours minimum I say until you 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.410
 200 years per year 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.630
 but really all questreihen material 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.770
 and everything if you like this old party 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.599
 roleplay market there you have there too 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.210
 still fun with just the fights 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.770
 are very tactically very challenging 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.740
 that is here is real-time system with 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.930
 Break very often also uses sour 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.520
 because otherwise know totally able 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.180
 and kites and light do not see that 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.120
 all and that makes it even bock 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.500
 Unfortunately, the Hessian is not 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.240
 as immense as just said and she does 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.250
 also things worse than the game that 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.010
 main game because there are, for example, a lot 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.199
 I had bugs for example space tobacco 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.440
 Calm right the console of the trouble 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.810
 just had to go further 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.479
 Crashes when loading the score gave 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.070
 There are hardly any problems and it is missing 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.180
 even such things as graphic 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.650
 attitude may also be possible 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.849
 it can not be self-determined 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.919
 set hotkeys 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.760
 very bad for a game it comes today 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.560
 because it really keeps a bit 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.940
 can give more effort 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.040
 So really something nostalgic 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.510
 maybe that is maybe again 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.260
 want to play and somehow the cds 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.230
 have lost 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.610
 newcomers genre yes and even then 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.860
 you can just open it up 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.160
 gog.com you can also buy the game 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.840
 for $ 10 and not for 25 like that 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.950
 here and then just a few mans too 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.820
 Do you actually lose the same? 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.980
 experience 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.980
 First of all, that is
