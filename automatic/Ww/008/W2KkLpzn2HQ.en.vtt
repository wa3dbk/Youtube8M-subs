very<00:00:31.439> disappointing<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> way<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.399> played

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
very disappointing the way they played

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.280 
very disappointing the way they played
last<00:00:32.790> Sunday<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.239> I'm<00:00:33.870> sure<00:00:34.050> they're<00:00:34.200> going

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
last Sunday but I'm sure they're going

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.720 
last Sunday but I'm sure they're going
to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.440> much<00:00:34.590> improved<00:00:34.770> tomorrow<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> they're

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to be much improved tomorrow and they're

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.680 
to be much improved tomorrow and they're
going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> cause<00:00:36.120> us<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.360> awful<00:00:36.540> lot<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
going to cause us an awful lot of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
going to cause us an awful lot of
problems<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.829> play<00:00:37.980> some<00:00:38.129> good

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
problems I think they play some good

rugby<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> answer<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> lot<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> games<00:00:39.450> i

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
rugby the answer in a lot of the games i

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.270 
rugby the answer in a lot of the games i
think<00:00:39.840> there's<00:00:40.260> nip<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.559> tuck<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.920> landed

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
think there's nip and tuck with I landed

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
think there's nip and tuck with I landed
on<00:00:41.489> our<00:00:41.670> first<00:00:41.790> game<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.329> probably<00:00:42.840> just

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
on our first game and probably just

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.240 
on our first game and probably just
lacked<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> bit<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> possession<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.100> any

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
lacked a bit of possession for any

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.369 
lacked a bit of possession for any
pressure<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.670> island<00:00:45.120> please<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.230> good

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
pressure on island please some good

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.139

redwings<00:00:46.860> England<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> second<00:00:47.940> test

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
redwings England in that second test

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.139 
redwings England in that second test
then<00:00:48.360> obviously<00:00:48.539> had<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> fantastic<00:00:49.140> win<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:50.149> in

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
then obviously had a fantastic win in in

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
then obviously had a fantastic win in in
Edinburgh<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.260> Scotland<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.219> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
Edinburgh in Scotland and you know I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
Edinburgh in Scotland and you know I
think<00:00:53.520> they'd<00:00:53.760> probably<00:00:54.000> say<00:00:54.300> themselves

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
think they'd probably say themselves

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
think they'd probably say themselves
with<00:00:55.199> disappointedly<00:00:55.770> performance<00:00:56.340> last

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
with disappointedly performance last

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.970 
with disappointedly performance last
week<00:00:56.879> against<00:00:57.210> France<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.620> we'd<00:00:58.770> win

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
week against France so I like we'd win

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.410

the<00:01:31.409> same<00:01:31.590> game<00:01:31.799> plan<00:01:31.829> tomorrow<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.460> terms<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the same game plan tomorrow in terms of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.219 
the same game plan tomorrow in terms of
trying<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.329> accurate<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.840> did<00:01:34.020> not

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
trying to be as accurate as we did not

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.800 
trying to be as accurate as we did not
first<00:01:34.490> 10<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> 15<00:01:35.939> minutes<00:01:36.119> last<00:01:36.390> week<00:01:36.509> well<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
first 10 to 15 minutes last week well I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.940 
first 10 to 15 minutes last week well I
think<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.350> ourselves<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> good

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
think we put ourselves in a good

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.080 
think we put ourselves in a good
position<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.850> tomorrow

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
position and if we can do that tomorrow

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.850 
position and if we can do that tomorrow
I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.020> all<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.350> trying<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.770> out

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
I think it's all about trying to get out

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.380
