this<00:00:27.300> I'm<00:00:27.449> sure<00:00:27.480> technology<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.500> improve

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
this I'm sure technology will improve

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and performance tweaks which means there

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.590 
and performance tweaks which means there
hasn't<00:00:35.460> been<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.700> whole<00:00:35.880> lot<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> dicking

really really like so let's jump in to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.000 
really really like so let's jump in to
build<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.449> tweaks<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.229> start<00:01:04.860> out<00:01:04.949> with

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
build and tweaks here and start out with

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
build and tweaks here and start out with
the<00:01:05.159> status<00:01:05.430> bar<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.240> everything<00:01:06.900> you'll

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the status bar so everything you'll

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.240 
the status bar so everything you'll
notice<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.770> actually<00:01:08.070> quite

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
notice actually it's actually quite

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
notice actually it's actually quite
minimal<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.939> terms<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> customisation

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
minimal in terms of the customisation

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
minimal in terms of the customisation
options<00:01:10.460> everything's<00:01:11.460> laid<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.939> very

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
options everything's laid out very

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 
options everything's laid out very
nicely<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.110> they're<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.350> completely<00:01:13.860> packed

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
nicely and they're not completely packed

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.649 
nicely and they're not completely packed
with<00:01:14.850> things<00:01:15.090> where<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
with things where you're just going to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.810 
with things where you're just going to
forget<00:01:15.840> about<00:01:16.170> half<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.729> customizations<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
forget about half the customizations and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.690 
forget about half the customizations and
to<00:01:18.509> begin<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.650> that's<00:01:19.890> cool<00:01:19.979> let<00:01:20.400> jumping

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to begin with so that's cool let jumping

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.800 
to begin with so that's cool let jumping
