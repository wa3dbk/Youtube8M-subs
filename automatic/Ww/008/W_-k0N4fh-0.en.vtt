00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
metro last light is one of the more

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.120 
metro last light is one of the more
demanding<00:01:43.690> FPS<00:01:44.020> games<00:01:44.260> that<00:01:44.500> uses<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.920> lot<00:01:45.070> of

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
demanding FPS games that uses a lot of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.770 
demanding FPS games that uses a lot of
lighting<00:01:45.610> effects<00:01:45.880> particle<00:01:46.330> effects<00:01:46.600> as

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
lighting effects particle effects as

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.540 
lighting effects particle effects as
well<00:01:46.810> as<00:01:47.020> heavy<00:01:47.200> tessellation<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:48.400> I<00:01:48.430> can

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
well as heavy tessellation so I can

00:01:48.550 --> 00:02:04.180 
well as heavy tessellation so I can
really<00:01:48.730> push<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.910> gpo<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.420> its<00:01:49.510> limits

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.250 

No

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:28.660 

not<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> different

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.759 

so<00:02:29.670> next<00:02:29.819> up<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:30.180> have<00:02:30.209> crysis<00:02:30.630> 3<00:02:30.870> crysis<00:02:31.470> 3<00:02:31.650> is

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
so next up we have crysis 3 crysis 3 is

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.710 
so next up we have crysis 3 crysis 3 is
pretty<00:02:31.980> much<00:02:32.099> one<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.060> games<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.330> pushes

with<00:04:01.640> FPS<00:04:01.970> way<00:04:02.090> above<00:04:02.300> 60<00:04:02.660> we<00:04:03.500> have<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:03.770> one<00:04:03.890> a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
with FPS way above 60 we have this one a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.979 
with FPS way above 60 we have this one a
vsync<00:04:04.310> on<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.030> actually<00:04:05.150> locks<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.600> at<00:04:05.690> 60

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
vsync on so it actually locks it at 60

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.690 
vsync on so it actually locks it at 60
to<00:04:06.200> remove<00:04:06.590> tearing<00:04:06.980> but<00:04:07.459> if<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.580> turn

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
to remove tearing but if you turn

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.900 
to remove tearing but if you turn
pissing<00:04:08.030> off<00:04:08.150> your<00:04:08.180> easily<00:04:08.660> get<00:04:08.810> about<00:04:08.959> 60<00:04:09.230> FPS

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.979 

so<00:04:16.910> we'll<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.090> show<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.570> little<00:04:17.690> bit<00:04:17.810> more

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
so we'll just show you a little bit more

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.780 
so we'll just show you a little bit more
information<00:04:18.260> about<00:04:18.590> our<00:04:18.739> systems<00:04:19.100> one<00:04:19.639> of<00:04:19.729> the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
information about our systems one of the

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.580 
information about our systems one of the
things<00:04:19.970> were<00:04:20.090> most<00:04:20.120> part<00:04:20.690> of<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:21.019> extra<00:04:21.229> 15<00:04:21.500> is

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
things were most part of the extra 15 is

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.560 
things were most part of the extra 15 is
just<00:04:21.769> how<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:21.979> handles<00:04:22.280> heat<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:23.150> we<00:04:23.330> have<00:04:23.450> with

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
just how it handles heat so we have with

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.409 
just how it handles heat so we have with
us<00:04:23.690> here<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:24.110> heat<00:04:24.470> gun<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:24.970> what<00:04:25.970> this<00:04:26.090> does<00:04:26.150> is

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
us here a heat gun and what this does is

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.550 
us here a heat gun and what this does is
it<00:04:26.479> tells<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.810> surface<00:04:27.139> temperature

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
it tells you the surface temperature

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.230 
it tells you the surface temperature
when<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:28.130> point<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.520> gun<00:04:28.550> at<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.940> area<00:04:29.180> of

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
when you point the gun at the area of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.659 
when you point the gun at the area of
the<00:04:29.330> notebook<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.889> what<00:04:31.010> we<00:04:31.130> have<00:04:31.250> as<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.580> can

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
the notebook so what we have as you can

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.140 
the notebook so what we have as you can
see<00:04:31.880> every<00:04:32.419> point<00:04:32.600> at<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.810> palm<00:04:32.990> area<00:04:34.150> primary

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
see every point at the palm area primary

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.340 
see every point at the palm area primary
of<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.360> system<00:04:35.660> actually<00:04:35.780> fluctuates

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
of the system actually fluctuates

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.780 
of the system actually fluctuates
between<00:04:36.820> 27<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:39.020> 29<00:04:39.320> degrees<00:04:39.680> Celsius<00:04:40.100> which

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
between 27 to 29 degrees Celsius which

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.000 
between 27 to 29 degrees Celsius which
is<00:04:40.940> actually<00:04:41.090> below<00:04:41.510> body<00:04:42.440> temperature<00:04:42.830> or

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
is actually below body temperature or

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.090 
is actually below body temperature or
even<00:04:43.190> below<00:04:43.400> room<00:04:43.550> temperature<00:04:44.830> if<00:04:45.830> we<00:04:45.979> go<00:04:46.070> on

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
even below room temperature if we go on

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.440 
even below room temperature if we go on
to<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.340> keyboard<00:04:46.729> you<00:04:46.789> can<00:04:46.850> see<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.090> keyboard

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
to the keyboard you can see the keyboard

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.719 
to the keyboard you can see the keyboard
that's<00:04:47.600> actually<00:04:48.100> in<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.250> thirties<00:04:49.490> range

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
that's actually in the thirties range

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.240 
that's actually in the thirties range
which<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:50.479> really<00:04:50.720> awesome<00:04:51.039> so<00:04:52.039> we're

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
which is really awesome so we're

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.969 
which is really awesome so we're
extremely<00:04:52.810> proud<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.990> show<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.680> cooling

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
extremely proud the show the cooling

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.770 
extremely proud the show the cooling
capabilities<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.460> action<00:04:55.820> 15<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.510> system

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
capabilities of action 15 the system

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.210 
capabilities of action 15 the system
will<00:04:56.900> be<00:04:56.960> cool<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.260> chart<00:04:57.500> touch<00:04:57.710> even<00:04:58.070> during

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
will be cool to chart touch even during

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.850 
will be cool to chart touch even during
intense<00:04:59.030> gaming<00:04:59.270> and<00:05:00.080> so<00:05:00.380> if<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:00.530> move<00:05:00.710> this

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
intense gaming and so if I move this

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.860 
intense gaming and so if I move this
laser<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.640> top<00:05:01.820> this<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.450> where<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.720> heat

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
laser to the top this is where the heat

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.090 
laser to the top this is where the heat
Singh<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.229> that's<00:05:03.410> one<00:05:03.560> hot<00:05:03.710> spot<00:05:03.919> on<00:05:04.010> the

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
Singh is so that's one hot spot on the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.980 
Singh is so that's one hot spot on the
system<00:05:04.400> that's<00:05:04.970> where<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.390> heat<00:05:05.510> Singh<00:05:05.660> is<00:05:05.690> at

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
system that's where the heat Singh is at

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.050 
system that's where the heat Singh is at
the<00:05:06.140> top<00:05:06.260> left<00:05:06.440> corner<00:05:06.680> so<00:05:07.340> that's<00:05:07.490> 42<00:05:07.880> which

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
the top left corner so that's 42 which

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.670 
the top left corner so that's 42 which
is<00:05:08.180> still<00:05:08.330> not<00:05:08.479> very<00:05:08.690> hot<00:05:09.140> when<00:05:09.289> you<00:05:09.350> compared

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
is still not very hot when you compared

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.409 
is still not very hot when you compared
to<00:05:09.770> most<00:05:09.890> gaming<00:05:10.160> systems<00:05:10.430> on<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.580> market<00:05:10.610> and

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
to most gaming systems on the market and

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.850 
to most gaming systems on the market and
if<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.660> move<00:05:11.780> along<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.200> top<00:05:12.380> you'll<00:05:12.620> find

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
if you move along the top you'll find

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.590 
if you move along the top you'll find
that<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.669> rest<00:05:13.850> of<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.060> area's<00:05:14.300> actually

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
that the rest of the area's actually

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.180 
that the rest of the area's actually
cooler<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.590> won't<00:05:15.770> when<00:05:15.890> you<00:05:15.979> move<00:05:16.070> away

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
cooler and you won't when you move away

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.940 
cooler and you won't when you move away
from<00:05:16.310> eating<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.810> in<00:05:17.930> general<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.710> cooling

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
from eating so in general the cooling

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.290 
from eating so in general the cooling
system<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.280> HTTP<00:05:19.700> is<00:05:19.789> actually<00:05:20.120> something

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
system the HTTP is actually something

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300 
system the HTTP is actually something
that<00:05:20.419> we<00:05:21.080> really<00:05:21.110> want<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.860> be<00:05:21.950> able<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:22.160> show

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
that we really want to be able to show

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.610 
that we really want to be able to show
