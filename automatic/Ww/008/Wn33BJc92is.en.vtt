extremely detrimental to your strength
training<00:00:25.859> most<00:00:26.340> likely<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.660> don't

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
training most likely because you don't

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.670 
chalk the quality of the bars are much
worse<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.660> people<00:00:39.960> don't<00:00:40.110> realize<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
worse see people don't realize that that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the bar is of much higher quality than

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.660 
the bar is of much higher quality than
in<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.840> standard<00:00:46.289> gym<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.980> unless<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
in your standard gym so unless if you

then<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.610> are<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> need<00:00:51.420> straps<00:00:51.960> it's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then you are going to need straps it's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.569 
then you are going to need straps it's
just<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.890> simple

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
just that simple

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
just that simple
if<00:00:53.640> you're<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.030> using<00:00:54.239> straps<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.320> using

if you're not using straps and not using

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.860 
if you're not using straps and not using
chalk<00:00:55.980> you're<00:00:56.550> simply<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> able

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
chalk you're simply not going to be able

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.260 
chalk you're simply not going to be able
to<00:00:58.050> properly<00:00:58.559> train<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> deadlift<00:00:59.520> because

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
to properly train the deadlift because

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.150 
to properly train the deadlift because
the<00:01:00.600> grip<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.230> limiting<00:01:01.590> factor<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the grip will be your limiting factor in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.030 
the grip will be your limiting factor in
the<00:01:02.550> posterior<00:01:02.940> chain<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.559> limits

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the posterior chain will not this limits

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
the posterior chain will not this limits
how<00:01:05.250> strong<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.850> glutes<00:01:06.180> hamstrings<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
how strong your glutes hamstrings and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
how strong your glutes hamstrings and
lower<00:01:07.200> back<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.950> simply<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
lower back can get simply because you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.210 
lower back can get simply because you
would<00:01:09.420> refuse<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.290> straps<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.950> just

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
would refuse to use straps it's just

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
would refuse to use straps it's just
extremely<00:01:11.670> silly<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.270> me<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
extremely silly to me and I think it's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.050 
extremely silly to me and I think it's
one<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> most<00:01:13.830> common<00:01:14.369> mistakes<00:01:14.820> I've

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
one of the most common mistakes I've

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060 
one of the most common mistakes I've
seen<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:15.990> why<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.439> use<00:01:16.770> straps

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
seen so that's why you see I use straps

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
seen so that's why you see I use straps
because<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.880> train<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.330> powerlifting

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
because I don't train in a powerlifting

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
because I don't train in a powerlifting
gym<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.350> trained<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.159> standard<00:01:20.549> fitness

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
gym I trained in a standard fitness

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
gym I trained in a standard fitness
training<00:01:21.390> center<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.950> that's<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.220> I'm<00:01:23.310> left

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
training center so that's what I'm left

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.940 
training center so that's what I'm left
with<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.509> allows<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> same

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
with and this allows me to get the same

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.770 
with and this allows me to get the same
overload<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> same<00:01:27.150> work<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
overload to get the same work in and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
overload to get the same work in and
what<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.070> continue<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> train

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
what I actually do to continue to train

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.420 
what I actually do to continue to train
my<00:01:30.119> grip<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.380> warm<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.070> double

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
my grip is that just warm up with double

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.460 
my grip is that just warm up with double
overhand<00:01:32.820> grip<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.170> you'll

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
overhand grip and if you do this you'll

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
overhand grip and if you do this you'll
still<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.280> grip<00:01:35.490> strength<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
still have the grip strength or if you

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
still have the grip strength or if you
do<00:01:36.509> pull-ups<00:01:36.840> weighted<00:01:37.470> pull-ups<00:01:37.680> especially
