the<00:01:19.950> four<00:01:20.220> colors<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> controller<00:01:21.330> are

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the four colors on the controller are

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
the four colors on the controller are
now<00:01:21.630> white<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.590> gray<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.970> looks<00:01:24.180> slick

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
now white and gray and it looks slick

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
now white and gray and it looks slick
but<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.290> easy<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.650> games<00:01:25.830> where<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
but it's not so easy for games where the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.710 
but it's not so easy for games where the
colors<00:01:26.700> correlate<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> button<00:01:27.479> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
colors correlate the button so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
colors correlate the button so
especially<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.799> fighting<00:01:29.220> game<00:01:29.400> so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
combos etc etc no i never had a problem
of<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:31.979> d-pad<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.549> honest<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.659> people

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
of my d-pad to be honest but people

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.590 
of my d-pad to be honest but people
apparently<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.280> wanted<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.729> change<00:01:36.030> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
apparently have wanted a change so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
apparently have wanted a change so
microsoft's<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.439> cleverly<00:01:38.100> allowed

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
microsoft's have now cleverly allowed

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.569 
microsoft's have now cleverly allowed
you<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> twist<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.200> d-pad<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.829> change<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
you to twist the d-pad and change it so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.039 
you to twist the d-pad and change it so
at<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> moment<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.329> multi-directional

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
at the moment it's a multi-directional

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
at the moment it's a multi-directional
in<00:01:43.649> each<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.909> will<00:01:45.149> be

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
in each way and then what you will be

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.460 
in each way and then what you will be
able<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.720> new<00:01:45.899> controller<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
able to do with this new controller is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.240 
able to do with this new controller is
rotated<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.670> rise<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.979> front<00:01:49.979> the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
coming out very very soon so this is

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.820 
coming out very very soon so this is
effectively<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.540> paid<00:04:18.900> demo<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.650> could

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
effectively like a paid demo you could

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.029 
effectively like a paid demo you could
say<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:21.630> see<00:04:21.810> what<00:04:22.080> is<00:04:22.289> because<00:04:22.590> it's<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> same

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
say to see what is because it's the same

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.800 
say to see what is because it's the same
system<00:04:23.460> which<00:04:23.610> is<00:04:23.729> in<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.910> main<00:04:24.030> game

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
system which is in the main game

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.030 
system which is in the main game
to<00:04:24.930> see<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.230> what's<00:04:25.350> coming<00:04:25.590> up<00:04:25.650> but<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.889> also

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
to see it's what's coming up but it also

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.230 
to see it's what's coming up but it also
has<00:04:26.190> enough<00:04:26.430> content<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.820> make<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.090> worthwhile

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
has enough content to make it worthwhile

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.030 
has enough content to make it worthwhile
it's<00:04:27.930> not<00:04:28.050> like<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.200> demo<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.590> was<00:04:28.740> just<00:04:28.919> one

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
it's not like a demo I was just one

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.500 
it's not like a demo I was just one
level<00:04:29.370> it's<00:04:29.520> actually<00:04:29.880> its<00:04:30.000> own<00:04:30.120> sort<00:04:30.419> of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
level it's actually its own sort of

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.440 
level it's actually its own sort of
story<00:04:30.780> arc<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.669> it's<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.910> think<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.180> really

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
story arc and it's I think it's really

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.700 
story arc and it's I think it's really
worth<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.810> mean<00:04:33.960> it's<00:04:34.110> an<00:04:34.200> interesting<00:04:34.440> idea

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
worth it I mean it's an interesting idea

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.820 
worth it I mean it's an interesting idea
I<00:04:35.700> really<00:04:36.570> think<00:04:36.690> it's<00:04:37.169> good<00:04:37.320> as<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.500> standalone

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
I really think it's good as a standalone

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.010 
I really think it's good as a standalone
game<00:04:38.190> as<00:04:38.310> its<00:04:38.460> own<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.030> if<00:04:39.600> it's<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:39.990> you

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
game as its own so if it's there you

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.690 
game as its own so if it's there you
might<00:04:40.350> as<00:04:40.440> well<00:04:40.500> is<00:04:40.800> remember<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.430> have<00:04:41.580> to

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
might as well is remember you have to

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.640 
might as well is remember you have to
pay<00:04:41.880> for<00:04:41.940> this<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.750> I've<00:04:42.960> have<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> look<00:04:43.470> at<00:04:43.560> that

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
pay for this so I've have a look at that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.650
