hey<00:00:04.110> what's<00:00:04.290> up<00:00:04.380> YouTube<00:00:05.120> I'm<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.420> today

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
hey what's up YouTube I'm here today

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.589 
hey what's up YouTube I'm here today
because<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.259> want<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.500> do<00:00:08.120> waiving<00:00:09.120> tutorial

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
because I want to do waiving tutorial

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.190 
because I want to do waiving tutorial
and<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.620> hope<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.950> guys<00:00:11.070> expand<00:00:11.759> from<00:00:12.210> your

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and I hope you guys expand from your

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.859 
and I hope you guys expand from your
basic<00:00:13.440> waves<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:16.039> help<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.160> find<00:00:17.460> ways<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
basic waves and help you find ways to

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.890 
basic waves and help you find ways to
build<00:00:18.869> from<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:21.180> one<00:00:21.390> thing<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
build from that so one thing I like to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.340 
build from that so one thing I like to
teach<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:23.060> tracing<00:00:24.060> concept<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.840> tracing

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
teach is a tracing concept of tracing

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.400 
teach is a tracing concept of tracing
you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.130> trace<00:00:26.400> your<00:00:26.430> waves<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:28.199> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
you can trace your waves and this is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.220 
you can trace your waves and this is
probably<00:00:29.900> one<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> most<00:00:31.260> helpful<00:00:32.809> ways<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
probably one of the most helpful ways to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
probably one of the most helpful ways to
grow<00:00:34.969> to<00:00:35.969> make<00:00:36.120> your<00:00:36.300> waving<00:00:36.690> girl<00:00:38.059> it<00:00:39.059> could

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
grow to make your waving girl it could

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.430 
grow to make your waving girl it could
be<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.570> simple<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:40.170> using<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.250> pointy<00:00:41.579> finger<00:00:42.440> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
be as simple as using a pointy finger so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
be as simple as using a pointy finger so
it<00:00:43.649> could<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.489> finger<00:00:44.879> right<00:00:44.910> here

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it could be just this finger right here

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.410 
it could be just this finger right here
if<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.980> regular<00:00:48.590> arm<00:00:49.590> wave<00:00:50.420> that's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
if I just do a regular arm wave that's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.810 
if I just do a regular arm wave that's
that's<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.160> add<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that's what it is but if I just add this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.940 
that's what it is but if I just add this
it's<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:55.170> detail<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.890> gives

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
it's just detail right here it gives

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.980 
it's just detail right here it gives
it<00:01:01.310> gives<00:01:02.380> your<00:01:03.380> waves<00:01:04.160> more<00:01:05.090> detail<00:01:05.570> and

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
it gives your waves more detail and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.400 
it gives your waves more detail and
makes<00:01:06.410> it<00:01:06.560> look<00:01:06.770> even<00:01:06.920> more<00:01:07.070> than<00:01:07.730> what<00:01:07.910> it<00:01:08.030> is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
makes it look even more than what it is

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.230 
makes it look even more than what it is
really<00:01:09.410> I'm<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:09.590> doing<00:01:09.980> this<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.460> was<00:01:11.180> just

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
really I'm just doing this I was just

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.160 
really I'm just doing this I was just
doing<00:01:11.600> basic<00:01:11.810> Conway<00:01:12.380> but<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.490> finger<00:01:14.920> was

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
doing basic Conway but the finger was

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.640 
doing basic Conway but the finger was
giving<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.520> different<00:01:19.210> look<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
giving it a different look and it

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.080 
giving it a different look and it
doesn't<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.040> stop<00:01:21.280> there<00:01:21.520> obviously<00:01:21.880> that's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
doesn't just stop there obviously that's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.980 
doesn't just stop there obviously that's
just<00:01:22.210> one<00:01:22.659> you<00:01:23.440> can<00:01:23.590> also<00:01:23.770> trace<00:01:24.190> with<00:01:24.640> like

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
just one you can also trace with like

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.640 
just one you can also trace with like
you<00:01:25.990> know<00:01:26.020> this

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.620 

if<00:01:31.160> you<00:01:31.340> want<00:01:31.550> however<00:01:31.730> you<00:01:32.030> want<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.360> shape

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
if you want however you want to shape

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.470 
if you want however you want to shape
your<00:01:32.810> waves<00:01:33.110> do<00:01:33.440> you<00:01:33.500> basically<00:01:34.100> have<00:01:34.460> all<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
your waves do you basically have all the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.270 
your waves do you basically have all the
freedom<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:36.680> do<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:36.980> okay

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
freedom to do it okay

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.820 
freedom to do it okay
there<00:01:40.280> are<00:01:40.370> seriously<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.300> many<00:01:41.510> ways<00:01:41.830> like

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
there are seriously so many ways like

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.110 
there are seriously so many ways like
even<00:01:43.250> if<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:45.440> know<00:01:45.590> like<00:01:45.890> or<00:01:46.190> even

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
even if I just and you know like or even

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.090 
even if I just and you know like or even
with<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.450> like<00:01:47.750> flat<00:01:48.050> hand<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:49.040> could<00:01:49.190> just

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
with this like flat hand you could just

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.850 
with this like flat hand you could just
you<00:01:52.100> know

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.870 

it<00:01:55.370> gives<00:01:55.700> dimension<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.780> your<00:01:56.810> waves<00:01:57.880> right

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
it gives dimension to your waves right

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.730 
it gives dimension to your waves right
it<00:01:59.090> could<00:01:59.210> be<00:01:59.300> big<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.840> be<00:01:59.870> small<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.470> could<00:02:00.620> be

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
it could be big to be small it could be

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:09.730 
it could be big to be small it could be
really<00:02:01.520> close<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:04.670> be<00:02:04.820> really<00:02:05.180> close<00:02:06.280> right

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.470 

could<00:02:10.190> be<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:10.550> close<00:02:10.730> to<00:02:10.790> your<00:02:10.940> body<00:02:11.180> be

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
could be really close to your body be

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.220 
could be really close to your body be
really<00:02:11.810> big<00:02:13.390> whatever<00:02:14.780> you're<00:02:15.110> gonna

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
really big whatever you're gonna

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:24.330 
really big whatever you're gonna
you<00:02:15.920> want<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.670> create

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.290 

you<00:02:24.519> know<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.019> have<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.440> visualize<00:02:26.680> it

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
you know you just have to visualize it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300 
you know you just have to visualize it
and<00:02:28.300> really<00:02:29.019> that's<00:02:29.140> how<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.410> expand<00:02:30.010> from

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
and really that's how you expand from

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.900 
and really that's how you expand from
that<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:32.200> that's<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.099> beauty<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.730> you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
that and that's the beauty of it you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.850 
that and that's the beauty of it you
can't<00:02:34.330> really<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.840> complete<00:02:35.620> freedom

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
can't really you have complete freedom

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.559 
can't really you have complete freedom
to<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.250> whatever<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.849> is<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.060> want<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.330> do<00:02:37.420> with

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
to do whatever it is you want to do with

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.250 
to do whatever it is you want to do with
it<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:40.660> also<00:02:40.810> use<00:02:41.110> fixed<00:02:41.590> points<00:02:43.260> you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
it and you can also use fixed points you

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.960 
it and you can also use fixed points you
don't<00:02:44.410> know<00:02:44.470> what<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.650> fixed<00:02:44.950> point<00:02:45.129> is<00:02:45.400> it's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
don't know what a fixed point is it's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.720 
don't know what a fixed point is it's
basically<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:49.510> almost<00:02:49.780> like<00:02:49.959> isolating<00:02:50.590> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
basically it's almost like isolating a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.820 
basically it's almost like isolating a
little<00:02:51.730> different<00:02:52.090> because<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.750> say<00:02:53.349> this<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.799> a

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
little different because I say this is a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.610 
little different because I say this is a
fixed<00:02:54.370> point<00:02:54.549> right<00:02:54.730> here<00:02:54.849> right<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.239> this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
fixed point right here right this this

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.970 
fixed point right here right this this
hand<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.769> fixed<00:02:57.310> right<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> fixed

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
hand is fixed right this is the fixed

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.130 
hand is fixed right this is the fixed
point<00:03:00.010> because<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.390> move<00:03:01.540> around<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.989> but

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
point because I can move around it but

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.520 
point because I can move around it but
it's<00:03:02.290> still<00:03:02.410> there

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
it's still there

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.340 
it's still there
you<00:03:04.069> didn't<00:03:04.310> add<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.670> with<00:03:04.880> your<00:03:05.030> waves<00:03:06.580> so<00:03:07.580> a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
you didn't add that with your waves so a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.030 
you didn't add that with your waves so a
lot<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.380> times<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:10.160> like<00:03:11.560> when<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.590> used<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.830> fix

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
lot of times I like when I used to fix

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.850 
lot of times I like when I used to fix
points<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.520> waves<00:03:14.170> sometimes<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.440> do<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.680> like

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
points in waves sometimes I do it like

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.740 
points in waves sometimes I do it like
if<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.520> do<00:03:16.640> a<00:03:16.670> regular<00:03:17.240> or<00:03:17.360> maybe<00:03:17.600> like

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
if I just do a regular or maybe like

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.550 
if I just do a regular or maybe like
that<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:19.010> if<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.250> stop<00:03:19.550> here<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.350> now<00:03:21.530> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
that and if I stop here this is now a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:30.010 
that and if I stop here this is now a
fixed<00:03:21.950> point<00:03:22.480> right<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.750> can<00:03:28.000> see<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.030> left<00:03:29.780> it

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
fixed point right so I can see I left it

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.870 
fixed point right so I can see I left it
there<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.800> moved<00:03:31.069> towards<00:03:31.430> it

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
there and I moved towards it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.830 
there and I moved towards it
and<00:03:32.690> activated<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.350> again<00:03:34.420> no<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.540> doesn't

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
and activated it again no it doesn't

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.710 
and activated it again no it doesn't
stop<00:03:36.050> there<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:36.910> like<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:38.570> could

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
stop there you can like this this could

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.920 
stop there you can like this this could
be<00:03:38.840> your<00:03:38.959> fixed<00:03:39.260> point<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:40.250> move<00:03:40.430> towards<00:03:40.820> it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.690 

and<00:03:44.409> you<00:03:44.530> move<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.629> move<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:47.610> but<00:03:48.610> it

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
and you move it and you move it but it

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.330 
and you move it and you move it but it
becomes<00:03:48.939> a<00:03:49.150> fixed<00:03:49.360> point<00:03:49.689> and<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.709> can<00:03:51.129> play

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
becomes a fixed point and you can play

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.160 
becomes a fixed point and you can play
around<00:03:51.459> with<00:03:51.819> it<00:03:53.220> when<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.340> mix<00:03:54.610> all<00:03:54.819> of<00:03:54.879> that

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
around with it when you mix all of that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.619 
around with it when you mix all of that
with<00:03:56.170> your<00:03:56.349> waving

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
with your waving

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.459 
with your waving
it'll<00:03:58.319> just<00:03:58.400> expand<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.730> was<00:04:00.180> find<00:04:01.109> so<00:04:01.379> many
