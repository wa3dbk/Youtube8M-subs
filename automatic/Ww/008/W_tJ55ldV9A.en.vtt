00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.430
 super super cute flavor so if you do not 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.760
 they want to lose this fantastic tutorial 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.250
 for life follow me forget me 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.740
 for this time there we are going to need 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.360
 newspaper or magazine paper or paper 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.110
 that you have at hand some 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.440
 scissors a stick of these sticks or 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.540
 white glue spikes and paint on 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.480
 spray or paint that you have 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.250
 at your fingertips we will start by folding 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.010
 the newspaper a newspaper sheet by 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.320
 half and balmÃ³n if we doubled it by 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.550
 half we're going to cut through the center 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.700
 and we go back and we fold in half 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.470
 here again we go back and cut and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.630
 now we're going to get these bands of 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.230
 paper that is what we are going to do 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.330
 the rods or the paper sticks for 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.520
 make the star the super simple 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.430
 we take the tip of the toothpick and go to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.730
 start folding the newspaper and we're going to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.360
 start turning the stick and so 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.520
 will be forming the paper wands is 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
 super simple to do home there was a 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.140
 bit complicated but it's super super 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.850
 easy here we take white glue and 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.550
 we are going to stick this tip so that 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.160
 stay very fixed and you do not know all the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.260
 wand that we made of these wands 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.710
 let's do at least 10 to do 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.470
 the star as you can see here I already 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.300
 I made a lot of them I'm going to take one I'm going to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.300
 cut the tip here so that it is 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.030
 straight and I'm going to bend it inwards are 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.700
 like 3 centimeters and up here 15 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.100
 and I'm going to start folding the whole wand 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.680
 I just got home on the wand then what 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.870
 What I'm going to do is add another wand 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.700
 paper I'm doing as an extension 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.349
 and one 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.620
 or mind or the double will have to be left 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.230
 as well as a kind of m and here what 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.319
 we are going to do is unfold all that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.590
 we turn inward and let's start 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.239
 to find the way between them I know 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.830
 that here you can see a little complicated 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.830
 but super easy we are going to make a 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.019
 star and here is this little tab that leaves 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.970
 this little one is to paste it with 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.010
 white glue or silicone what 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.860
 you have at your fingertips the will 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.709
 fix very well so that we remain armed 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.750
 our star and now we're going to 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.540
 hold it with a hook so it does not 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.970
 see do not know we should have something like that 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.769
 so that they do not move each of the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.980
 tips of the stars let's fix it 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.390
 with silicone and here we are going to start 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.340
 make the relief to the super star 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.110
 simple I do not know how to explain them with 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.209
 words how do you do each of these 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.060
 steps over here I'll leave the video 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.799
 so that you understand me the key 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.200
 to make this beautiful little star is 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.510
 in knowing how to give the money in each of 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.390
 the tips of the star and every time 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.760
 the paper wand is running out 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.640
 let's introduce another 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.379
 an extension to go around like that 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.680
 and round and round we are going to give three 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.390
 laps and that would be basically all for 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.390
 the structure of our star 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.320
 i 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.409
 ah 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.949
 no no 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.949
 i 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.810
 to finish with the braiding of 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.120
 our star we are going to take this 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.210
 tipita we are going to cut it and what we are going 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.680
 to do is hide this tip below 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.200
 all those folds we made 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.450
 previously we held them very well not 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.000
 If you want they can stick it with silicone 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.040
 so that the star does not melt now 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.080
 we go with the most important step of 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.670
 our star that is painting 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.790
 because this gives a very very touch 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.640
 important and an incredible finish to that 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.740
 paint it with golden spray paint and 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.470
 I hope it will dry very well and what 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.450
 I did was apply glitter frost on 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.610
 certain areas of the star not in all 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.520
 because I think he loses the grace and 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.440
 if you have pebbles or some kind 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.420
 of adornment can also be added 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.610
 to give a much more beautiful touch to 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.110
 to add these golden pebbles 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.140
 I think it looks super super 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.270
 cute to finish we take a rope 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.100
 or a ribbon and we will hold it in the 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.410
 top of the star for 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.300
 I can hang it anywhere in 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.300
 our house or in our little tree 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.150
 my love has been everything for today I hope 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.060
 that I really enjoyed this video to 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.010

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.080

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.580
