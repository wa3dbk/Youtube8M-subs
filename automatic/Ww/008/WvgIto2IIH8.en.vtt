situation for the sand trooper and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.250 
situation for the sand trooper and
that's<00:02:49.340> kind<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.360> interesting<00:02:50.540> how<00:02:50.780> his<00:02:50.930> legs

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that's kind of interesting how his legs

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.310 
that's kind of interesting how his legs
are<00:02:51.500> kind<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.920> spreading<00:02:52.610> apart<00:02:52.989> as<00:02:53.989> soon<00:02:54.110> as<00:02:54.230> I

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
are kind of spreading apart as soon as I

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.340 
are kind of spreading apart as soon as I
took<00:02:54.380> him<00:02:54.680> out<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> packaging<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:57.290> I

took him out of the packaging but I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.220 
took him out of the packaging but I
guess<00:02:57.560> that's<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.799> way<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:59.049> guess<00:03:00.049> it's

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
guess that's the way it is guess it's

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.410 
guess that's the way it is guess it's
normal<00:03:01.930> no<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.959> thought<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.500> would<00:03:03.650> be<00:03:04.420> closer
