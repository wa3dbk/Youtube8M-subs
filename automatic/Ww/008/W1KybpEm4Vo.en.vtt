00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and what the size is I'm going to change

the font here to something different and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.849 
the font here to something different and
there's<00:00:27.269> two<00:00:27.510> ways<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> make<00:00:28.050> sure<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.560> flash

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
there's two ways to make sure that flash

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.540 
there's two ways to make sure that flash
is<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.730> show<00:00:30.359> your<00:00:30.570> text<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
is going to show your text one is to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
is going to show your text one is to
embed<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.540> text<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.020> where<00:00:34.170> we'll<00:00:34.559> come<00:00:34.710> back

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
embed the text and where we'll come back

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.520 
embed the text and where we'll come back
to<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.820> another<00:00:36.059> would<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.930> break<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
to that but another would be to break it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
to that but another would be to break it
apart<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.329> becomes<00:00:39.420> actually

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
apart so that it becomes actually

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
apart so that it becomes actually
similar<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> outlines<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.579> you'd<00:00:41.760> have

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
similar to the outlines that you'd have

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.270 
similar to the outlines that you'd have
an<00:00:42.239> illustrator<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.320> no<00:00:43.440> longer<00:00:43.620> font<00:00:44.040> then

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
an illustrator it's no longer font then

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
an illustrator it's no longer font then
it's<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.579> shape<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.600> before<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it's a shape but before we do that I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
it's a shape but before we do that I
want<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.010> make<00:00:47.340> sure<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.059> little

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
want to make sure that we take a little

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.560 
want to make sure that we take a little
bit<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.620> kerning<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.420> get

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
bit of a look at the kerning not to get

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.020 
bit of a look at the kerning not to get
too<00:00:51.750> crazy<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.010> see<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
too crazy but you can see that the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.340 
too crazy but you can see that the
kerning<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.730> great

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
kerning here is really not so great

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
kerning here is really not so great
flash<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:59.609> known<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.149> good<00:01:00.270> kerning

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
flash is not well known for good kerning

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.270 
flash is not well known for good kerning
and<00:01:01.199> especially<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.920> problem

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and especially when you have problem

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
and especially when you have problem
winners<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> queue<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.019> going

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
winners like a queue so I'm just going

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.530 
winners like a queue so I'm just going
to<00:01:04.229> fix<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.400> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to fix that up a little bit not going to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.300 
to fix that up a little bit not going to
spend<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.869> whole<00:01:06.990> lot<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.290> time<00:01:07.470> making<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
spend a whole lot of time making it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
spend a whole lot of time making it
perfect<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> need<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> turn<00:01:09.689> over

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
perfect but if you need to turn over

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
perfect but if you need to turn over
here<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.619> letter<00:01:10.830> spacing<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
here at letter spacing you can do a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.640 
here at letter spacing you can do a
slider<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.680> minus<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.520> plus

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
slider or you can do minus and plus

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.770 
slider or you can do minus and plus
spaces<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.670> did<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> minus<00:01:18.180> two<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
spaces so I just did a minus two and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.940 
spaces so I just did a minus two and
that<00:01:19.439> brought<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.090> closer

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
that brought it in a little bit closer

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.850 
that brought it in a little bit closer
looks<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.220> better<00:01:23.930> okay<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.470> breaking

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
looks a little better okay so breaking

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
looks a little better okay so breaking
apart<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.340> text<00:01:26.790> when<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.810> word<00:01:28.020> like

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
apart the text when it's a word like

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.399 
apart the text when it's a word like
this<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.979> need<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> appleby<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.630> under

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
this I need to do appleby or under

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.270 
this I need to do appleby or under
modify<00:01:31.950> break<00:01:32.729> apart<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.009> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.100> notice

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
modify break apart and if you notice

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.910 
modify break apart and if you notice
this<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.790> still<00:01:36.470> text<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.560> could<00:01:37.710> still

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this is still text I could still

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.469 
this is still text I could still
highlight<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> change<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> letter<00:01:40.189> but<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479

want<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> become<00:01:43.020> shapes<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.189> addition

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
want it to become shapes so in addition

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
want it to become shapes so in addition
to<00:01:44.610> breaking<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.420> word<00:01:45.750> apart<00:01:46.110> need<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> break

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to breaking the word apart need to break

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
to breaking the word apart need to break
it<00:01:46.710> apart<00:01:46.799> again<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.720> the
