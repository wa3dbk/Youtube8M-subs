00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
had like like like a little switch in it

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.969 
had like like like a little switch in it
was<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.159> jutted<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.810> we<00:03:36.959> kept<00:03:37.169> like<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.859> was

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
was like jutted so we kept like it was

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.699 
was like jutted so we kept like it was
like<00:03:38.099> halfway<00:03:38.879> on<00:03:39.359> zoomed<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.349> like<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
like halfway on zoomed and like the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.589 
like halfway on zoomed and like the
little<00:03:40.919> monitor<00:03:41.280> screen<00:03:41.759> was<00:03:41.970> totally<00:03:42.359> black

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
little monitor screen was totally black

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.830 
little monitor screen was totally black
so<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.650> had<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.829> do<00:03:44.069> like<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> automatic<00:03:45.030> reset<00:03:45.629> on

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
so I had to do like a automatic reset on

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.119 
so I had to do like a automatic reset on
it<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.169> little<00:03:46.379> pin<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.949> it<00:03:47.040> was

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
it with a little pin and it was

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.490 
it with a little pin and it was
ridiculous<00:03:48.259> anyways<00:03:49.259> yeah<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:52.079> why

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
ridiculous anyways yeah so that is why

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.460 
ridiculous anyways yeah so that is why
this<00:03:52.560> camera<00:03:53.540> like<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.840> won't<00:03:55.049> be<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.319> most

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
