obviously<00:01:25.800> now<00:01:26.800> it's<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.009> 320<00:01:27.910> horsepower<00:01:28.240> so

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
obviously now it's a 320 horsepower so

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.140 
obviously now it's a 320 horsepower so
that's<00:01:29.380> actually<00:01:29.650> 25<00:01:30.340> horsepower<00:01:30.670> down<00:01:31.030> on

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
that's actually 25 horsepower down on

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.149 
that's actually 25 horsepower down on
the<00:01:31.240> Lotus<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.810> it's<00:01:31.930> got<00:01:32.080> 30<00:01:32.710> Newton<00:01:33.130> meters

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159

less<00:01:33.520> talk<00:01:33.790> than<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.060> Lotus<00:01:34.420> but<00:01:34.990> it's<00:01:35.080> 86

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
less talk than the Lotus but it's 86

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.040 
less talk than the Lotus but it's 86
kilograms<00:01:35.710> lighter<00:01:36.220> so<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.119> think<00:01:37.720> it's<00:01:37.960> gonna

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
kilograms lighter so I think it's gonna

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.690 
kilograms lighter so I think it's gonna
be<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.200> very<00:01:38.350> close<00:01:38.560> contest<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:39.399> it's<00:01:39.550> go

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
be a very close contest so it's go

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.460 
be a very close contest so it's go
around<00:01:39.910> this<00:01:40.030> first<00:01:40.300> lap<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.780> little<00:01:41.229> bit<00:01:41.320> heat

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
around this first lap a little bit heat

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.920 
around this first lap a little bit heat
into<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.740> tyres<00:01:42.039> now<00:01:42.759> that<00:01:42.940> Porsche<00:01:43.720> is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
into the tyres now that Porsche is

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.389 
into the tyres now that Porsche is
really<00:01:44.289> well<00:01:44.440> balanced<00:01:44.800> ops<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.070> feel<00:01:45.250> that

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
really well balanced ops you feel that

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.920 
really well balanced ops you feel that
was<00:01:45.520> very<00:01:45.729> better<00:01:45.940> with<00:01:46.119> throttle<00:01:46.240> cold<00:01:46.660> tires

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
was very better with throttle cold tires

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
was very better with throttle cold tires
you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.530> get<00:01:47.950> into<00:01:48.369> lose<00:01:48.580> traction<00:01:49.050> but

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
you can get into lose traction but

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.850 
you can get into lose traction but
with<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.280> engine<00:01:51.580> mid-mounted<00:01:51.939> it's<00:01:52.420> just

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
with that engine mid-mounted it's just

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.899 
with that engine mid-mounted it's just
so<00:01:53.860> well<00:01:54.070> balanced<00:01:54.430> in<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.640> high<00:01:54.850> speed

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
so well balanced in the high speed

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.550 
so well balanced in the high speed
corners<00:01:55.420> really<00:01:55.600> stable<00:01:55.960> under<00:01:56.110> braking<00:01:56.290> as

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
corners really stable under braking as

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.070 
corners really stable under braking as
well<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:57.790> quite<00:01:58.000> long<00:01:58.240> ratios<00:01:58.810> with<00:01:58.960> this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
well it's quite long ratios with this

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.139 
well it's quite long ratios with this
PDK<00:01:59.500> gearbox<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.130> some<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.670> these<00:02:00.759> corners<00:02:01.090> are

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
PDK gearbox so some of these corners are

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.249 
PDK gearbox so some of these corners are
actually<00:02:01.360> in<00:02:01.420> second<00:02:01.810> gear<00:02:01.899> even<00:02:02.080> though

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
actually in second gear even though

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.889 
actually in second gear even though
they're<00:02:02.380> relatively<00:02:02.770> quick<00:02:03.009> corners<00:02:03.899> here

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
they're relatively quick corners here

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.100 
they're relatively quick corners here
but<00:02:05.080> long<00:02:05.229> load<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.770> car<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.810> little<00:02:07.810> bit<00:02:08.020> of

but long load on the car a little bit of

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.240 
but long load on the car a little bit of
oversteer<00:02:08.380> as<00:02:08.590> I'm<00:02:08.709> trying<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.979> heating<00:02:09.190> the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.949 
oversteer as I'm trying to heating the

so<00:04:27.960> let's<00:04:28.110> see<00:04:28.230> how<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.440> Lotus<00:04:28.830> compares<00:04:29.190> I

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
so let's see how the Lotus compares I

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.810 
so let's see how the Lotus compares I
see<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.550> slightly<00:04:29.760> different

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
see it's a slightly different

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.100 
see it's a slightly different
proposition<00:04:30.510> for<00:04:30.660> starters<00:04:30.900> we've<00:04:30.990> got<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
proposition for starters we've got a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.080 
proposition for starters we've got a
manual<00:04:31.410> gearbox<00:04:31.620> rather<00:04:31.919> than<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.340> dual<00:04:33.000> clutch

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
manual gearbox rather than a dual clutch

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.970 
manual gearbox rather than a dual clutch
pedal<00:04:33.570> shift<00:04:33.720> gearbox<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:34.740> is<00:04:34.860> the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
pedal shift gearbox and this is the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.830 
pedal shift gearbox and this is the
sports<00:04:35.280> racer<00:04:35.820> version<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.330> warrior

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
sports racer version of the warrior

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.570 
sports racer version of the warrior
those<00:04:37.080> are<00:04:37.230> lots<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.770> extra<00:04:38.070> kick<00:04:38.220> thrown<00:04:38.430> at

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
those are lots of extra kick thrown at

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.940 
those are lots of extra kick thrown at
it<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:38.820> mechanically<00:04:39.389> it's<00:04:39.680> pretty<00:04:40.680> much<00:04:40.830> the

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
it but mechanically it's pretty much the

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.040 
it but mechanically it's pretty much the
same<00:04:41.070> as<00:04:41.220> you've<00:04:41.430> all<00:04:41.580> read<00:04:41.730> more<00:04:42.240> power<00:04:42.510> more

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
same as you've all read more power more

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.010 
same as you've all read more power more
torque<00:04:43.110> than<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.680> Porsche<00:04:44.480> but<00:04:45.480> it's<00:04:45.660> heavier

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
torque than the Porsche but it's heavier

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.900 
torque than the Porsche but it's heavier
and<00:04:46.320> crucially<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.160> big<00:04:47.340> difference<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.790> I've

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
and crucially the big difference is I've

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.180 
and crucially the big difference is I've
seen<00:04:48.000> leave<00:04:48.180> always<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.419> 2+2<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.770> engines

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
seen leave always a 2+2 so the engines

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.190 
seen leave always a 2+2 so the engines
mounted<00:04:50.370> quite<00:04:50.880> high<00:04:51.150> up<00:04:51.180> whereas<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.110> the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
mounted quite high up whereas in the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.080 
mounted quite high up whereas in the
Cayman<00:04:52.530> is<00:04:52.560> very<00:04:52.800> low<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.430> weight<00:04:53.760> of<00:04:53.790> it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
Cayman is very low so the weight of it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.090 
Cayman is very low so the weight of it
higher<00:04:54.360> in<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.600> Lotus<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.560> if<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:55.680> just<00:04:55.860> see

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
higher in the Lotus so if you just see

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.650 
higher in the Lotus so if you just see
with<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.370> raises<00:04:57.090> head<00:04:57.300> when<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.600> were

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
with that raises head when you were

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.659 
with that raises head when you were
driving<00:04:57.810> on<00:04:58.080> track<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.950> also<00:04:59.100> have<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.460> not

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
driving on track you also have to not

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.610 
driving on track you also have to not
rush<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.060> gear<00:05:00.210> shift<00:05:00.480> if<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.660> rush<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.110> it's

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
rush the gear shift if you rush it it's

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.490 
rush the gear shift if you rush it it's
easy<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.100> miss<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.310> shift<00:05:02.990> can<00:05:03.990> certainly<00:05:04.350> feel

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
easy to miss a shift can certainly feel

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.290 
easy to miss a shift can certainly feel
straightaway<00:05:05.040> that<00:05:05.220> there's<00:05:05.370> more<00:05:05.550> movement

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
straightaway that there's more movement

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.880 
straightaway that there's more movement
in<00:05:06.390> the<00:05:06.479> Lotus<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.020> when<00:05:07.140> you<00:05:07.229> break<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.620> nose

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
in the Lotus so when you break the nose

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.409 
in the Lotus so when you break the nose
dives<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.370> bit<00:05:08.490> more<00:05:08.669> you<00:05:08.820> can<00:05:08.850> feel<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.300> the

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
dives a bit more you can feel that the

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
weight transfer is a bit more obvious

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.730

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
ISM for the weight moving around more so

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.879 
ISM for the weight moving around more so
it<00:05:13.830> makes<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.070> car<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.250> little<00:05:14.310> bit<00:05:14.490> edgy<00:05:14.610> with

oversteer when it breaks away brakes may

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.780 
oversteer when it breaks away brakes may

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
be more dramatically than the Komen but

engine<00:05:23.729> sounds<00:05:24.120> pretty<00:05:25.020> good<00:05:25.229> so<00:05:25.470> there's

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
engine sounds pretty good so there's

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.780 
engine sounds pretty good so there's
quite<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.860> nice<00:05:26.010> exhaust<00:05:26.340> now

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
quite a nice exhaust now

the<00:05:28.790> steering<00:05:29.150> is<00:05:29.210> very<00:05:29.270> light<00:05:29.449> quite<00:05:30.169> fast<00:05:30.530> so
