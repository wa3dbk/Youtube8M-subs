 What is the guitar very different? 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.000
 The people who introduced us to the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.250
 explained how it works 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.440
 different from previous guitar heroes 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.579

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:56.090

 It's giving and he has a good scheme. 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.170
 different is it you use commands 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.120
 white and black commands have to play 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.460
 at the bottom of the guitar in the 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.460
 from above and buttons down all over 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.120
 so we have to use two 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.660
 buttons are very different much more 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.660
 difficult 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.850

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 O lines we just have to use the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.350
 transportation is basically this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.240
 three buttons are just those three here 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.370
 you have to black buttons without touching 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:21.880
 on the top and the white buttons on the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.880

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.730
 ah 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.170
 there at some point you need to use the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.170
 two buttons will toggle 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.659

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.780

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.069
