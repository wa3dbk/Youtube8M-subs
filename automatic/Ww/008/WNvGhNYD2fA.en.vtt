00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.010 
stretched it out um any see I have a
black<00:02:09.170> background<00:02:09.560> what's<00:02:09.979> gonna<00:02:10.190> do<00:02:11.020> anyway

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
black background what's gonna do anyway

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.230 
black background what's gonna do anyway
you<00:02:12.320> see<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> black<00:02:13.070> background<00:02:13.340> as

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
you see you have a black background as

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.449 
you see you have a black background as
well<00:02:14.300> it's<00:02:14.630> because<00:02:14.800> I'm<00:02:15.800> not<00:02:16.040> very<00:02:16.190> good<00:02:16.310> at

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
well it's because I'm not very good at

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.930 
well it's because I'm not very good at
making<00:02:16.790> me<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.050> did<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.530> got<00:02:18.940> black

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
making me so what I did is I got black

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.870 
making me so what I did is I got black
shapes<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.410> kind<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.650> fit<00:02:21.860> them<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:22.250> so

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
shapes and I just kind of fit them in so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.590 
shapes and I just kind of fit them in so
you<00:02:22.970> get<00:02:23.270> kind<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.930> nicer<00:02:25.060> kind<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.180> smoother

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
you get kind of a nicer kind of smoother

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.500 
you get kind of a nicer kind of smoother
look<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.520> don't<00:02:28.670> need<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
look to it so you don't need the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.570 
look to it so you don't need the
background<00:02:29.990> but<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.800> lot<00:02:30.920> easier<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.400> do

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
background but it's a lot easier to do

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.970 
background but it's a lot easier to do
that<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.030> can<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.240> fit<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:32.980> random

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
that and you can just fit in random

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.770 
that and you can just fit in random
shapes<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.370> same<00:02:34.580> colors<00:02:34.880> background<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
shapes the same colors background it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.500 
shapes the same colors background it
kind<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.050> covers<00:02:36.230> over<00:02:36.850> but<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:37.940> think<00:02:38.420> you

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
kind of covers over but you think you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.390 
kind of covers over but you think you
might<00:02:38.600> have<00:02:38.690> screwed<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:39.050> mon<00:02:39.230> or<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:40.190> like

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
might have screwed up mon or just like

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.060 
might have screwed up mon or just like
something<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.090> doesn't<00:02:41.300> look<00:02:41.330> too<00:02:41.570> good<00:02:42.070> so

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
something that doesn't look too good so

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.729 
something that doesn't look too good so
that's<00:02:43.370> pretty<00:02:44.209> much<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.390> easiest<00:02:44.900> way<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.530> do

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
that's pretty much the easiest way to do

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.949 
that's pretty much the easiest way to do
it<00:02:45.890> kind<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.820> secret<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.270> didn't<00:02:47.480> use<00:02:47.600> all<00:02:47.750> the

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
it kind of a secret I didn't use all the

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.250 
it kind of a secret I didn't use all the
layers<00:02:48.610> it's<00:02:49.610> 32<00:02:50.060> as<00:02:50.300> some<00:02:50.840> other<00:02:50.989> emblems

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
layers it's 32 as some other emblems

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
layers it's 32 as some other emblems
where<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.590> used<00:02:51.860> all<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.970> them<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.920> was

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
where I used all of them and that was

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.140 
where I used all of them and that was
kind<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.090> hard<00:02:56.269> making<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:57.200> 32<00:02:57.560> layer

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
kind of hard making it just a 32 layer

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.090 
kind of hard making it just a 32 layer
wish<00:02:59.150> there<00:02:59.330> was<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.450> actually<00:03:00.130> but<00:03:01.130> oh<00:03:01.810> well

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
wish there was more actually but oh well

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.870 
wish there was more actually but oh well
so<00:03:04.100> that's<00:03:04.730> how<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:04.940> make<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.120> fairytale<00:03:05.600> logo

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
so that's how you make a fairytale logo

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.360 
so that's how you make a fairytale logo
if<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.120> want<00:03:08.330> me<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.660> try<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.230> make<00:03:09.950> any<00:03:10.130> other

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
if you want me to try to make any other

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.360 
if you want me to try to make any other
kind<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.850> campbell<00:03:11.630> them<00:03:11.720> leave<00:03:12.260> message<00:03:13.250> in

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
kind of campbell them leave message in

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.550 
kind of campbell them leave message in
