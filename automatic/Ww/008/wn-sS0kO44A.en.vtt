to in the future for for my you know

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.209 
to in the future for for my you know
microphone<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.289> always<00:00:58.379> looking<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> try<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
microphone I'm always looking to try to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.090 
microphone I'm always looking to try to
it's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> upgrade<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:01.530> video<00:01:01.829> quality

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it's a kind of upgrade my video quality

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
it's a kind of upgrade my video quality
and<00:01:02.370> things<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and things like that I think this is a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
and things like that I think this is a
big<00:01:03.750> step<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.470> direction<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.920> think

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
big step in the right direction I think

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.560 
big step in the right direction I think
it's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.790> weird<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> little

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's a little bit weird it's a little

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.330 
it's a little bit weird it's a little
bit<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.260> different<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.010> used<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
bit kind of different to get used to it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
bit kind of different to get used to it
first<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:09.180> overall<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> good

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
first but overall I think it's a good

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.390 
first but overall I think it's a good
thing<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.590> guys<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.040> used<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thing I think you guys will get used to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
thing I think you guys will get used to
it<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:12.180> probably<00:01:12.390> won't<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it now we probably won't see this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
it now we probably won't see this
microphone<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:14.040> some<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> videos<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.880> TV
