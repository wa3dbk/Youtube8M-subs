00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
the deal we so involved in in LED

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.039 
the deal we so involved in in LED
lighting<00:01:32.740> what's<00:01:33.190> at<00:01:33.340> stake<00:01:33.640> here<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.659> LED

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
lighting what's at stake here the LED

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.740 
lighting what's at stake here the LED
products<00:01:35.650> can<00:01:36.040> can<00:01:36.549> create<00:01:36.909> an<00:01:37.090> awful<00:01:37.479> lot<00:01:37.570> of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
products can can create an awful lot of

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.780 
products can can create an awful lot of
energy<00:01:37.869> savings<00:01:38.409> which<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.130> department<00:01:39.760> is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
energy savings which the department is

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.180 
energy savings which the department is
interested<00:01:40.390> in<00:01:40.630> definitely<00:01:41.440> it's<00:01:41.950> part<00:01:42.130> of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
interested in definitely it's part of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.180 
interested in definitely it's part of
our<00:01:42.340> mission<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.600> we<00:01:44.380> did<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> report<00:01:44.920> recently

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
our mission the we did a report recently

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.080 
our mission the we did a report recently
that<00:01:46.110> forecasted<00:01:47.110> into<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.560> future<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.790> by

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
that forecasted into the future that by

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.830 
that forecasted into the future that by
2030<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.159> LED<00:01:51.729> products<00:01:52.090> would

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
2030 that the LED products would

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.350 
2030 that the LED products would
actually<00:01:53.710> reduce<00:01:53.860> lighting<00:01:54.490> consumption<00:01:55.210> by

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
actually reduce lighting consumption by

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.710 
actually reduce lighting consumption by
about<00:01:55.390> forty<00:01:55.930> six<00:01:56.200> percent<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.880> year<00:01:58.150> 2030

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
about forty six percent in the year 2030

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.510 
about forty six percent in the year 2030
what's<00:01:59.020> forty<00:01:59.350> six<00:01:59.590> percent<00:01:59.740> reduction<00:02:00.070> mean

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
what's forty six percent reduction mean

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.640 
what's forty six percent reduction mean
it<00:02:00.610> means<00:02:00.790> about<00:02:01.060> thirty<00:02:01.570> billion<00:02:01.900> dollars

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
it means about thirty billion dollars

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
it means about thirty billion dollars
that<00:02:03.310> would<00:02:03.430> go<00:02:03.580> back<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.450> consumer

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that would go back to the consumer

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.389 
that would go back to the consumer
so<00:02:05.909> I've<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.330> lot<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> upside<00:02:07.320> how<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.950> led

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so I've got a lot of upside how is led

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.309 
so I've got a lot of upside how is led
of<00:02:08.550> big<00:02:08.729> step<00:02:09.030> forward<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:09.720> traditional

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
of big step forward from traditional

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
yeah that was a lot of money but now you

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.620 
yeah that was a lot of money but now you

industry has this trend of opening at a
pretty<00:04:03.359> high<00:04:03.389> price<00:04:03.690> but<00:04:03.870> then<00:04:03.989> they<00:04:04.109> come

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
pretty high price but then they come

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.740 
pretty high price but then they come
down<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.519> will<00:04:05.700> be<00:04:05.880> going<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:06.420> with<00:04:06.600> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
down and this will be going on with the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.590 
down and this will be going on with the
LEDs<00:04:07.260> also<00:04:08.010> what<00:04:08.790> needs<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.150> be<00:04:09.239> done<00:04:09.269> within

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
LEDs also what needs to be done within

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.259 
LEDs also what needs to be done within
the<00:04:09.840> electrical<00:04:10.380> industry<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:11.190> provide<00:04:12.030> more

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
the electrical industry to provide more

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.530 
the electrical industry to provide more

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
this point in time education is really

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.670 
this point in time education is really
important<00:04:18.180> there's<00:04:18.540> lots<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.930> new<00:04:18.990> concepts
