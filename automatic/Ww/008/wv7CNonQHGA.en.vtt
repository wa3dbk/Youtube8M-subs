00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 hello friends youtube below 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.649
 I bring you a tutorial on how to make 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.740
 a sun in origami for this we need 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.830
 a square of paper can be the color 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.109
 and the size that you prefer well 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.590
 we started the first thing we will do will be 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.590
 Bend 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.660
 around the corner 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.830
 we unfolded and doubled 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.029
 on the other corner 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.699
 A) Yes 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.699
 we unfolded doubled in half 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 we unfold again and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020
 in the other side 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.720
 all right 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.030
 what we will do next will be 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.030
 bring the four corners to the center 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.530
 Y 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.530
 We will double the corners 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.740
 now 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.400
 we will double half of the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.150
 crossing the diagonals we can 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.150
 guide also 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.870
 we press a little and bend the other 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.870
 side 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.820
 in this way well now having like this 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.750
 we double them 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.750
 in half 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.530
 and the other 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.530
 in the same way half 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.750
 we press a little the following is 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.000
 take out the corners that are inside 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.380
 outward 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.870
 lifting and 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.670
 doubling in this way so we will get 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.690
 the four corners 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.690
 we doubled here 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.590
 and the last corner 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.980
 well up to get this figure to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.330
 then we will fold the corners 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.440
 to the other side 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.230
 in this way pressing very well and 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.800
 introducing what 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.370
 we put our finger to help us a little and 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.569
 we press in this way 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.049
 likewise we will do the other 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.049
 yes 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.780
 we do not have the finger to support us and 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.590
 we push 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.590
 the other 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.410
 and the last 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.290
 well already having this what we will do is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.390
 Bend 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.050
 these corners to the center 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.050
 of the 4 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.050
 squares 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:07.210
 well already folded 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.280
 we proceed to unfold 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.280
 and we will take the corner 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.060
 as follows 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.560
 and we will put a little finger and double 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.910
 A) Yes 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.910
 okay 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.740
 thus 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.260
 in this way we will double the four 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.260
 corners 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.699
 unfolding 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.510
 and pushing out 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.980
 and the last one open we put a little bit the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.980
 finger 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.080
 we open 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.080
 all right 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.410
 until you get this figure 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.410
 finally we flipped 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.509
 and that 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.509
 we will double it 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.590
 A) Yes 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.669
 from the four ends we will double them 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:02.039
 well then perform another of 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.110
 the same shape either the same color the 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.340
 square must be the same you 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.200
 they decide if they want to do it 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.640
 color or other color 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.770
 well already having two figures of these already 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.310
 be the same color of another color what 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:22.910
 we will lift these tabs 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:28.930
 any of the two and how will we give 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.930
 in this way and we will press again 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.449
 all right 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.490
 and this is the finished figure 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:48.029
 good friends do not forget to subscribe to 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.650
