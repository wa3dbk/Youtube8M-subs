00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.050
 unpacking is not a big package now 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.089
 the topic of parcels of unpacking reviews 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.250

 channels and here's one of those channels 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.210
 which in my opinion deserves 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.210
 attention is called Anton tea both and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.250
 here you can go to this link 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.470
 the channel is young like the guy who 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.730
 owns the channels but today 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.910

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.040

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.350
 there is something to watch the channel lives this 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.710

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.390
 and I will continue to discover what is not 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 parcel arrived valued at two dollars 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.520
 fifty eight cents 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.270
 Sent on April 20th I got it 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:12.250
 in about 40 days i will repeat i don't 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.510
 I know that that's why all along with 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.510
 and we will find out 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.600
 like a pickaxe ok so shook and this 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.240
 we have a watch 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 such are men's watches in the package here 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:42.010
 the boards are prone so tucked into the pack they 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:47.140
 heavy smoking like their root in general 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:51.160
 something like this shirt is called here here us 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.590
 type label company 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:01.000
 and the bag judging by the sensations plastic 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.660
 This is of course a minus but the iron clock itself 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.530
 plastic strap 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:12.330
 so we have an iron back cover 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:20.170
 it is written here resistant put caress running 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:24.370
 so let's bring the falsity of the dials 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.770
 that is, these buttons 2 do not work and the clock 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:32.020
 go it pleases 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.590
 can be set on the date and time so this 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.900
 time 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.770
 and so the date 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.770
 focus focus here 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.400
 who is configured by them and that's just what 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.680
 date to date 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:56.930
 described by the field here is not to learn buttons 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.930
 pressed but nothing happens 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.520
 here are the clock here I hope you 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.220
