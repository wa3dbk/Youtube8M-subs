00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
would be a two minute lesson from a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.950 
would be a two minute lesson from a
nursery<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.150> he<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.450> sell<00:01:15.689> me<00:01:15.869> the

nursery because he would sell me the
plant<00:01:16.819> and<00:01:17.819> today<00:01:18.179> I<00:01:18.210> become<00:01:18.569> known<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.649> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
plant and today I become known for the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.120 
plant and today I become known for the
lack<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:19.979> novice<00:01:21.409> because<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.649> I'd<00:01:22.829> have<00:01:22.950> had

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
lack of novice because if I'd have had

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
lack of novice because if I'd have had
it<00:01:23.969> hotter<00:01:24.240> culture<00:01:24.630> background<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.560> would

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it hotter culture background I would

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.309 
it hotter culture background I would
never<00:01:26.490> done<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:28.079> breaking

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
never done this because I was breaking

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.080 
never done this because I was breaking
too<00:01:28.530> many<00:01:28.710> rules<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.219> I<00:01:29.280> didn't<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
too many rules so I didn't know that I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
too many rules so I didn't know that I
was<00:01:30.240> breaking<00:01:30.569> the<00:01:30.600> rules<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.039> when

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
was breaking the rules and so when

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.129 
was breaking the rules and so when
people<00:01:32.219> finally<00:01:32.729> made<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.270> aware<00:01:33.359> that<00:01:33.960> this

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
people finally made me aware that this

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:35.480 
people finally made me aware that this
shouldn't<00:01:34.469> happen<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.920> shouldn't<00:01:35.219> do<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
shouldn't happen you shouldn't do this
