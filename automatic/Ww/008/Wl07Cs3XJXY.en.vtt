need<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.190> new<00:02:56.340> hair<00:02:56.580> care<00:02:56.790> leave<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.450> treatment

need a new hair care leave in treatment

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.720 
need a new hair care leave in treatment
although<00:02:57.989> whatever<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.890> included<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.670> I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
although whatever it's included so I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.729 
although whatever it's included so I
guess<00:02:59.940> I'll<00:03:00.120> try<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:00.690> um<00:03:00.959> I've<00:03:01.560> never

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
have a scent oh it got I that I'm at a

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.750 
have a scent oh it got I that I'm at a
loss<00:05:49.990> of<00:05:50.169> words<00:05:50.320> it<00:05:50.950> feels<00:05:51.340> sort<00:05:51.520> of<00:05:51.640> like

Vaseline<00:05:52.510> so<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:52.870> guess<00:05:53.200> I'll<00:05:53.440> use<00:05:53.680> it<00:05:53.710> when<00:05:54.039> my

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
Vaseline so I guess I'll use it when my

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.800 
Vaseline so I guess I'll use it when my
lips<00:05:54.370> get<00:05:54.580> dry<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.760> crack<00:05:55.060> just<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.419> test<00:05:55.570> it<00:05:55.750> out

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
lips get dry a crack just to test it out

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.450 
lips get dry a crack just to test it out
but<00:05:56.110> my<00:05:56.260> first<00:05:56.440> impression<00:05:56.979> is<00:05:57.130> that<00:05:57.160> it's

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
but my first impression is that it's

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.550 
but my first impression is that it's
nothing<00:05:57.760> special<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:58.539> I<00:05:59.110> feel<00:05:59.260> like<00:05:59.350> if<00:05:59.470> it

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
nothing special and I feel like if it

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.110 
nothing special and I feel like if it
was<00:05:59.710> we<00:05:59.979> would<00:06:00.370> have<00:06:00.460> heard<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.729> this<00:06:00.820> but

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
was we would have heard of this but

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.350 
was we would have heard of this but
again<00:06:01.419> I'm<00:06:01.570> not<00:06:01.599> going<00:06:01.720> to<00:06:01.930> judge

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
again I'm not going to judge
