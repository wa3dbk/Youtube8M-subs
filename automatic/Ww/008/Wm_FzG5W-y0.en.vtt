 for episode 2 alley käfig this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 class that I played a lot he has 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 created what I played the most in 2-3 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.730
 not when I tell you it's a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.060
 class known to be sure you ty has 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.500
 who hates her while being on the side 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 adversaries the cafes for example at 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.609
 colisée at the foot of the foot by the rebels 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.260
 if it's a class that's not very 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.669
 complicated to shoot down either a following 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.750
 which is a replica that is that a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.829
 invincible limit class that I 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.870
 not at all of these classes 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.280
 invincible already the cafes against unknown 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 I can tell you it's really hard 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.039
 with less cif jaundice but here 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 we will talk about that for the moment 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.200
 quite simply 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 and so here is a class that is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 reputed to be sure to quote as I 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.670
 already wanted to say it's the piece that I have 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.789
 could play that is also useful in pv she 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 parce coliseum where even in pvp in general 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.660
 we're going to say that a tdp to speak in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.650
 general 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.090
 already I can tell you that here is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.500
 like wanted to tell a cafe 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.750
 Uc contracts hard candy to beat at 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.180
 nude there are some who say criteria of 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 china cafes will contradict you it's 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.979
 not me who produce you since I 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.280
 plays but it's a class that can be 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.520
 very easily beaten since I have 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.500
 already has never fought a menu that's 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.270
 once I never beat an elected official who 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.479
 was about the same level as me 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.119
 or around 10 levels around 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.579
 I've never beaten eight ends tell 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.710
 a place that plays well ben coffee can 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.890
 not beat him 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.260
 I have already done pvp damage 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.360
 I was doing a little pdp do them to 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.560
 the occasion but here you will tell me 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.190
 maybe he's here by the institute 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.869
 pdp etc 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.720
 but it's not wrong it's not wrong 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.040
 pvp channel but I saw that denial 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.450
 when he makes withdrawals especially when 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.740
 you are earth because they are silent 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.390
 those who have gone maybe a little 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.040
 little simpler and can type without 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.530
 goal line good me I'm typing you with 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.420
 pink face and here it is not a scan 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.940
 read the heroism whose flaws are 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.770
 spells out their hits hard not 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.929
 for sure you line of credit that the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 coffees the fate that hits the lowest it's 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.370
 destiny of ear coffee to the flu kills 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.920
 happy for the captains of a hi hi 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.170
 stryfe there also lifeless city one 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.650
 it's pretty good, but it's because 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.510
 that there is better 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.340
 so here I am I can tell you that she 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.980
 is to flip with a place that makes 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.140
 many others and pm and the breakdown and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.489
 to treat the milk more expensive is 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.260
 in your sword m I can tell you that 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.400
 it's true it's really hard to beat 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.580
 and at the limit 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.140
 impossible in any case that's my opinion 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.180
 So there I could here just for you 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.459
 to say that caf riba to cut short 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.630
 to any support for the idea that who have 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.519
 maybe not necessarily hot and coffee 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.230
 who had the idea it's a place on 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.840
 everything and invincible balloon not at all 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.579
 so here we go bah I will you 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.370
 talk a little about the pl is beautiful barrick has 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.640
 set a very useful place in pdm our 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.540
 little sharika fiq who can really 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.250
 extremely useful in everything 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.049
 just cardon trash cans that the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.440
 perception the visible pogroms to 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.720
 some 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.030
 some to the little ones make themselves invisible 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.150
 a backlash that is quite interesting 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.470
 also pointed vitality memebers 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.470
 roulette too which can give you to 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.549
 take 400 in strength 400 in agility 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.170
 what luck or whiskey or yes 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.079
 predicted it also 50 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.320
 we are criticized for exciting damage 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.030
 damage or suppression if 52 26 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.030
 So here are the caps with wheels 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.250
 type is very interesting in pvl but 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.709
 I think that the whims of the little 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.900
 near also more interesting the others 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.880
 in pm pnc multi element graphs 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.769
 way for me i try to use mans 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.390
 it was him in pdm if you can type 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.489
 in all the elements simply 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.350
 or in several elements already two 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.060
 elements two elements it's already very 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.419
 interesting by the way less juice 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.239
 because with a flip earth agility with 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.970
 the skin of refugees or 1995 it's okay I 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.109
 still time for the moment here is me 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.970
 I think that if you want to make 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:03.169
 peele advises you four or six 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.880
 elements are green or low down to me 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.799
 mutilated the same land it's enough 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.169
 interesting and in pvp I advise you 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.120
 also indicative elements or term 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.010
 but if I had to make the distinction between 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.870
 both of which I say that but in the end 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.639
 to say little if the council 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.440
 gives elements form and 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.060
 advise but in the end if I had 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.889
 to do the part between the two of you 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.449
 advises value drawn makes me pdl and 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.150
 earth in pvp 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.880
 that's it that's it I trained myself on 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.710
 what I say and fire hell I fight it 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.930
 one can be as interesting in the 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.630
 two ways the coouse also interesting 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.360
 when when pdl is so interesting 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.340
 bp so here is what regards this 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.199
 video there trying to find the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.630
 answer to the question let's say ben I 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.120
 advise you multi items in pm and 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.820
 to do in pvp 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.780
 simply then already qualify them 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.880
 what more could I tell you 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.070
 else are agility elements that's 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.020
 meaning is that it's interesting but 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.130
 I do not advise you simply because 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.639
 already there are two kinds wyatt already that 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.840
 200 agility it can be very nice 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.850
 it's boring to tap two ways even 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.990
 if you can still have a cake and 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.199
 this is me I think it could 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.240
 really be already knapick band out and 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.550
 web we can always do block but 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.820
 it's one in two is in the end it's 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.410
 you 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.479
 an election to kill someone beats 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.850
 still pvp and makes you a bluff and 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.410
 that in the end ben saada leaning is a 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.360
 On two 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.430
 I come out of your peace in agility at least 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.199
 in reverse for luck lease 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.100
 that you type from the 52nd instead of typing 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:36.020
 of the 320th annoying so me I you 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.790
 do not advise agility sim cards 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.580
 but agility and r 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.770
 it can be very interesting and earthy 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.350
 fire on the ground a chance we are not 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.650
 everything and then that's what I can 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.350
 tell you else about bah cafes 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.870
 here already 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.960
 I advised you are these 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.810
 elements take what kind of style of 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.680
 we are going to say bye 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.500
 what can I tell you 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.600
 other ben when he stepped aside 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.090
 type and I handle my go somewhere 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.680
 mathilde main character them 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.440
 catholic beaks very interesting at he 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.000
 and I do not leave a class 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.740
 indispensable in cafes can 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.540
 really be very easily replace 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.550
 in tilt we see there for this question 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.470
 there the clip case is not so 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.910
 regarding tin oo me I feel that there is 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.110
 some places that are essential 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.540
 in China like bigup 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.360
 in episode 1 it's true the gap is 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.800
 essential but the graphics have 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.140
 so here I think this video there 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.120
 will learn term I hope because he will have 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.040
 helped some and that you will have liked 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.210
 if you press do not hesitate to me 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.740
 to let others know by letting go 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.940
 comment it's encouraging for the 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.350
 continuation of the series it was all at 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.800
 pleasure and to the flesh a little 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.950
 comment 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.780
 to give your opinion since they will have 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:48.750
 even invites you to leave your opinions in 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.400
 Hunger in the comments do not hesitate 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.380
 really not to leave your opinions and to 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.400
 subscribe lawsuits to follow 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.380
 every next hour 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.510
 all the rest of the series and this 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.600
 video it was cosmetics scope 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.600
 World
