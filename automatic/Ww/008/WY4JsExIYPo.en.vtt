00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.899 

we<00:00:00.900> are<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.740> discuss<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.310> different

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
we are going to discuss about different

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:11.350 
we are going to discuss about different
types<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.389> filters<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.680> short<00:00:05.670> session

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.730 

so<00:00:12.360> how<00:00:12.540> many<00:00:12.599> types<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.200> different<00:00:13.559> filters

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
so how many types of different filters

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.250 
so how many types of different filters
are<00:00:14.099> available<00:00:14.420> when<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.570> go<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.020> filter

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
are available when we go to the filter

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.010 
are available when we go to the filter
panel<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.039> right<00:00:17.910> click<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
panel and right click we see the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
panel and right click we see the
different<00:00:19.350> types<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.859> filter<00:00:20.310> range<00:00:21.150> filter

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
different types of filter range filter

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.380 
different types of filter range filter
item<00:00:22.050> filter<00:00:22.439> checkbox<00:00:23.070> radio<00:00:23.609> button<00:00:23.939> text

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
item filter checkbox radio button text

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.740 
item filter checkbox radio button text
and<00:00:24.600> list<00:00:25.470> box<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.039> let's<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:26.880> how<00:00:27.180> each<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and list box now let's see how each and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.810 
and list box now let's see how each and
every<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> them<00:00:28.680> work<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> let's<00:00:30.240> change

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
every one of them work so let's change

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
every one of them work so let's change
the<00:00:32.820> current<00:00:33.149> filter<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> check<00:00:34.500> spot

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the current filter which is a check spot

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950 
the current filter which is a check spot
check<00:00:35.250> box<00:00:35.520> filter<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.329> radio<00:00:36.719> button

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
check box filter into a radio button

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.869 
check box filter into a radio button
filter<00:00:37.520> okay

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.200 

so<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.540> filter<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.430> used<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:45.180> we

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so this kind of filter is used when we

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.900 
so this kind of filter is used when we
want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.960> choose<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.620> single<00:00:47.070> entry<00:00:47.700> which

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
want to choose a single entry which

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.810 
want to choose a single entry which
means<00:00:48.149> either<00:00:48.390> furniture<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.820> office

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
means either furniture or office

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.080 
means either furniture or office
supplies<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:52.010> while<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.550> playing<00:00:53.879> around

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
supplies and while I'm a playing around

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.970 
supplies and while I'm a playing around
with<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> filters<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.050> would<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
with the filters I would like you to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.360 
with the filters I would like you to
keep<00:00:56.699> an<00:00:56.969> eye<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.899> visualization<00:00:58.710> with

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
keep an eye on this visualization with

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
keep an eye on this visualization with
changes<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> make<00:01:00.870> changes<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
changes when I make changes to the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
changes when I make changes to the
filter<00:01:02.520> panel<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> radio

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
filter panel so this is about the radio

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.210 
filter panel so this is about the radio
button<00:01:07.470> filter<00:01:09.140> let's<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.409> how<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> checkbox

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
button filter let's see how a checkbox

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.340 
button filter let's see how a checkbox
filter<00:01:11.700> works<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:14.070> want<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.350> filter

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
filter works so if we want to filter

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.940 
filter works so if we want to filter
more<00:01:16.860> than<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:18.270> entry<00:01:18.900> which<00:01:19.680> means

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
more than a one entry which means

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.330 
more than a one entry which means
multiple<00:01:20.490> filtering<00:01:21.200> then<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:23.130> use<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
multiple filtering then we use a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.830 
multiple filtering then we use a
checkbox<00:01:29.210> ok<00:01:31.549> now<00:01:32.549> what's<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.150> third<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
checkbox ok now what's the third kind of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.999 
checkbox ok now what's the third kind of
filter<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.070> third<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.820> filter<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:37.009> an

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
filter the third kind of filter is an

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
filter the third kind of filter is an
item<00:01:38.430> filter<00:01:39.829> item<00:01:40.829> filter<00:01:41.159> means<00:01:41.630> something

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
item filter item filter means something

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.789 
item filter item filter means something
like<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> huge<00:01:46.320> range<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like this so if we have a huge range of

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880 
like this so if we have a huge range of
data<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:48.600> want<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> filter<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:49.439> based<00:01:49.619> on

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
data and we want to filter them based on

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
data and we want to filter them based on
the<00:01:50.009> number<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> items<00:01:52.880> we<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:53.909> use<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.479> kind

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the number of items we can use this kind

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
the number of items we can use this kind
of<00:01:54.899> filter<00:01:57.469> next<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> range<00:01:59.219> filter<00:01:59.640> which

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
of filter next is the range filter which

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.499 
of filter next is the range filter which
is<00:01:59.969> mainly<00:02:00.899> used<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.290> dates<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:02.509> continuous

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
is mainly used for dates or continuous

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.740 
is mainly used for dates or continuous
variables<00:02:06.500> let<00:02:07.500> me<00:02:07.619> change<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.190> back<00:02:08.629> to<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
variables let me change this back to the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.979 
variables let me change this back to the
check<00:02:09.959> box<00:02:10.200> filter<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> let's<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:14.930> how<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
check box filter and let's see how the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:23.420 
check box filter and let's see how the
range<00:02:16.349> filter<00:02:16.800> works<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.739> if<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:22.980> click<00:02:23.250> on

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
range filter works so if you click on

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.520 
range filter works so if you click on
any<00:02:23.700> other<00:02:23.790> filter<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> delivery<00:02:25.319> time

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
any other filter for the delivery time

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.530 
any other filter for the delivery time
which<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.890> actually<00:02:26.400> kind<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.849> continuous

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
which is actually kind of continuous

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.380 
which is actually kind of continuous
data<00:02:27.750> let's<00:02:28.200> say<00:02:28.379> that<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:29.520> click<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
data let's say that you click on a you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.600 
data let's say that you click on a you
make<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.810> check<00:02:31.019> box<00:02:31.200> filter<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:32.190> will<00:02:32.400> see

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
make it a check box filter you will see

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.790 
make it a check box filter you will see
that<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:33.750> will<00:02:33.959> give<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.470> numbers

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that it will give you all the numbers

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.910 
that it will give you all the numbers
from<00:02:37.910> 1<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> guess<00:02:39.480> 136<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.709> not<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
from 1 to I guess 136 so it is not a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.470 
from 1 to I guess 136 so it is not a
very<00:02:41.190> good<00:02:41.340> option<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> check<00:02:42.450> box

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
very good option to have a check box

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.670 
very good option to have a check box
filter<00:02:43.050> for<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:43.980> particular<00:02:44.989> parameter<00:02:45.989> and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
filter for this particular parameter and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.530 
filter for this particular parameter and
that's<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> reason<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:47.849> selected<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.450> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
that's the reason we selected on the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.940 
that's the reason we selected on the
range<00:02:48.780> filter<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.410> whenever<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:49.920> are

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
range filter so whenever we are

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.009 
range filter so whenever we are
filtering<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.730> can<00:02:50.879> give<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.269> range<00:02:51.480> let's<00:02:51.840> say

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
filtering we can give a range let's say

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.229 
filtering we can give a range let's say
that<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.379> want<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.620> look<00:02:52.800> at<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> data<00:02:53.340> which

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
that we want to look at the data which

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.170 
that we want to look at the data which
is<00:02:54.269> corresponding<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:56.489> delivery<00:02:56.940> time

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
is corresponding to the delivery time

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.710 
is corresponding to the delivery time
which<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.569> between<00:02:58.019> 45<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.220> 138<00:02:59.970> days<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:00.569> now

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
which is between 45 and 138 days so now

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440 
which is between 45 and 138 days so now
I<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.440> data<00:03:01.650> which<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.069> in<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.940> range<00:03:03.209> of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
I have the data which is in the range of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.240 
I have the data which is in the range of
45<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.500> 138<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:07.200> applied<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> same<00:03:07.830> kind

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
45 and 138 I have applied the same kind

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.300 
45 and 138 I have applied the same kind
of<00:03:08.400> filter<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:09.030> delivery<00:03:09.569> date<00:03:09.810> now<00:03:10.650> Spotfire

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
of filter for delivery date now Spotfire

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.559 
of filter for delivery date now Spotfire
is<00:03:11.580> intelligent<00:03:12.180> enough<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.010> assigns<00:03:14.569> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
is intelligent enough so it assigns the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.420 
is intelligent enough so it assigns the
filters<00:03:15.989> based<00:03:16.319> on<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.590> kind<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.920> data<00:03:16.980> which

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
filters based on the kind of data which

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.520 
filters based on the kind of data which
is<00:03:17.580> there<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.239> don't<00:03:18.390> have<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.780> do<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:18.959> but

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
is there so we don't have to do it but

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.920 
is there so we don't have to do it but
if<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.800> are<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:20.040> happy<00:03:20.519> with<00:03:21.060> any<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.450> kind<00:03:21.780> of

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
if we are not happy with any one kind of

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.850 
if we are not happy with any one kind of
filter<00:03:22.349> then<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.769> always<00:03:23.129> change<00:03:23.459> it

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.310 

all<00:03:27.010> about<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:28.240> different<00:03:28.570> kind<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.900> filters

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
all about the different kind of filters

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.650 
all about the different kind of filters
and<00:03:29.350> before<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:29.980> wrap<00:03:30.370> up<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.820> wanted<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.360> cover

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
and before I wrap up I wanted to cover

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.840 
and before I wrap up I wanted to cover
two<00:03:31.930> more<00:03:32.140> filters<00:03:32.560> one<00:03:32.800> is<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.160> text<00:03:33.490> text

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
two more filters one is the text text

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.880 
two more filters one is the text text
filter<00:03:34.240> and<00:03:34.510> another<00:03:35.050> one<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.590> listbox

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
filter and another one is the listbox

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.440 
filter and another one is the listbox
filter<00:03:36.490> so<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.580> listbox<00:03:39.850> filter

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
filter so this is the listbox filter

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.300 
filter so this is the listbox filter
where<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.020> all<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:42.750> values<00:03:43.750> are<00:03:44.020> listed<00:03:44.500> in

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
where and all the values are listed in

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.450 
where and all the values are listed in
form<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.240> list<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.780> has<00:03:47.200> total<00:03:47.710> 174

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
form of a list so it has total 174

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.310 
form of a list so it has total 174
values<00:03:48.880> now<00:03:49.150> let's<00:03:49.390> say<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.810> we<00:03:50.020> want<00:03:50.200> to

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
values now let's say that we want to

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.260 
values now let's say that we want to
change<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.800> filter<00:03:51.190> type<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.550> text<00:03:51.730> filter

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
change this filter type to text filter

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.800 
change this filter type to text filter
we<00:03:52.959> can<00:03:52.990> do<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.410> as<00:03:53.680> well<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.420> problem

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
we can do that as well but the problem

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.980 
we can do that as well but the problem
here<00:03:55.990> is<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.470> we<00:03:57.100> don't<00:03:57.600> let's<00:03:58.600> assume<00:03:58.930> that

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
here is that we don't let's assume that

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.720 
here is that we don't let's assume that
we<00:03:59.320> don't<00:03:59.470> know<00:03:59.709> and<00:03:59.920> we<00:04:00.190> know<00:04:00.310> nothing<00:04:00.490> about

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
we don't know and we know nothing about

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.190 
we don't know and we know nothing about
the<00:04:01.060> kind<00:04:01.240> of<00:04:01.390> products<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.080> this

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
the kind of products that this

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.680 
the kind of products that this
particular<00:04:02.440> company<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.190> using<00:04:03.610> so<00:04:04.330> in<00:04:04.480> that

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
particular company is using so in that

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.840 
particular company is using so in that
case<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.470> would<00:04:05.800> be<00:04:05.950> very<00:04:06.070> difficult<00:04:06.400> for

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
case it's it would be very difficult for

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.940 
case it's it would be very difficult for
us<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.330> actually<00:04:07.900> key<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.260> some<00:04:08.470> data<00:04:08.680> and

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
us to actually key in some data and

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.050 
us to actually key in some data and
that's<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.400> reason<00:04:09.760> instead<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.730> text

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
that's the reason instead of the text

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.300 
that's the reason instead of the text
filter<00:04:13.420> we<00:04:13.720> have<00:04:16.049> had<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.320> listbox<00:04:17.709> filter

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
filter we have had a listbox filter

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.310 
filter we have had a listbox filter
because<00:04:18.640> now<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:18.880> can<00:04:19.299> look<00:04:19.510> at<00:04:19.690> all<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.989> values

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
because now I can look at all the values

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.680 
because now I can look at all the values
and<00:04:20.470> select<00:04:20.859> as<00:04:21.040> many<00:04:21.400> values<00:04:21.609> as<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.180> want<00:04:22.480> for

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
and select as many values as I want for

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.500 
and select as many values as I want for
the<00:04:22.810> analysis<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.580> this<00:04:24.730> was<00:04:24.910> all<00:04:25.090> about<00:04:25.120> the
