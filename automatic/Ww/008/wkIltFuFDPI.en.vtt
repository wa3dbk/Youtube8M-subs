holes<00:03:39.280> at<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.520> bottom<00:03:39.820> so<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.030> plug<00:03:40.330> it

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
holes at the bottom so you can plug it

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.380 
holes at the bottom so you can plug it
into<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:41.280> base<00:03:42.280> if<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.270> wish

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
into a base if you wish

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.760 
into a base if you wish
I'm<00:03:46.390> only<00:03:46.570> gripe<00:03:46.750> with<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.959> sculpting<00:03:47.590> is

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
I'm only gripe with the sculpting is

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.070 
I'm only gripe with the sculpting is
this<00:03:48.220> area<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:49.030> butterfly<00:03:49.480> system<00:03:49.930> which

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
this area the butterfly system which

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.070 
this area the butterfly system which
I'll<00:03:50.260> get<00:03:50.410> into<00:03:50.470> with<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.980> articulation

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
I'll get into with the articulation

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.710 
I'll get into with the articulation
doesn't<00:03:53.080> look<00:03:53.170> too<00:03:53.350> great<00:03:53.500> does<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:56.040> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
doesn't look too great does it so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.210 
doesn't look too great does it so
overall<00:03:58.720> great<00:03:58.959> looking<00:03:59.170> figure<00:03:59.410> well<00:04:00.190> I

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
overall great looking figure well I

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.540 
overall great looking figure well I
can't<00:04:00.520> complain<00:04:01.209> too<00:04:01.390> much<00:04:02.100> for<00:04:03.100> articulation

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
can't complain too much for articulation

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.050 
can't complain too much for articulation
not<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.510> greatest<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.770> close<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.610> head<00:04:06.910> can

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
not the greatest it's close the head can

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
not the greatest it's close the head can
look<00:04:07.180> way<00:04:07.510> up<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.900> love<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:09.040> look<00:04:09.160> down

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
look way up I love that can look down

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.020 
look way up I love that can look down
rotate<00:04:11.080> not<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.890> lot<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.070> tilting<00:04:12.550> though<00:04:12.700> I

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
rotate not a lot of tilting though I

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.440 
rotate not a lot of tilting though I
really<00:04:13.420> wish<00:04:13.900> there<00:04:13.930> was<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.230> lot<00:04:14.530> more<00:04:14.560> tilting

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
really wish there was a lot more tilting

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.390 
really wish there was a lot more tilting
now<00:04:16.450> as<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:16.900> mentioned<00:04:17.230> before<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.680> butterfly

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
now as I mentioned before the butterfly

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.460 
now as I mentioned before the butterfly
system<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:18.910> great<00:04:19.180> good<00:04:19.390> planar<00:04:19.720> motion<00:04:19.989> I

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
system is great good planar motion I

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.100 
system is great good planar motion I
like<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.930> looks<00:04:23.110> so<00:04:23.230> ugly<00:04:23.680> it's<00:04:24.310> really

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
like it but it looks so ugly it's really

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.710 
like it but it looks so ugly it's really
yeah<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.980> don't<00:04:27.820> know<00:04:27.940> how<00:04:28.030> I'm<00:04:28.180> gonna<00:04:28.270> describe

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
yeah I don't know how I'm gonna describe

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200 
yeah I don't know how I'm gonna describe
that<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.770> body<00:04:29.979> does<00:04:30.160> not<00:04:30.280> look<00:04:30.490> like<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:30.729> I

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
that the body does not look like that I

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.000 
that the body does not look like that I
understand<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.200> an<00:04:32.290> action<00:04:32.620> figure<00:04:32.800> but

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
understand this is an action figure but

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.090 
understand this is an action figure but
it<00:04:33.100> looks<00:04:33.280> really<00:04:33.669> weird<00:04:34.830> but<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.919> can

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
it looks really weird but you can

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.250 
it looks really weird but you can
butterfly<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:37.660> like<00:04:37.840> how<00:04:37.990> there's<00:04:38.229> a

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
butterfly it and I like how there's a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.310 
butterfly it and I like how there's a
lot<00:04:38.350> of<00:04:38.500> range<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.540> yeah<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.900> bone<00:04:41.110> your

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
lot of range to it yeah the bone your

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.730 
lot of range to it yeah the bone your
arms<00:04:41.710> bring<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.550> up<00:04:42.640> that<00:04:42.850> pretty<00:04:43.450> high
