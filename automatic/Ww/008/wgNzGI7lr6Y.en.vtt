00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.109
 hello she we meet as part of the continuation of the topic and who has 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.369
 been treated 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.199
 on the environmental management system 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.210
 for 100 th we are back to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.919
 in the third step the third part 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.269
 regards the notion of control so remember so the 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.250
 first part of the policy 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.580
 when it comes to planning 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.410
 the second part the treaty of the implementation of the functioning of the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.560
 environmental management system 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.160
 the third part deals with the control of a fourth so that we 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.450
 will see after that then will concern the street direction 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.290
 during the control part 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.590
 it's all about measuring and monitoring and the bar for lying 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.840
 really taboo of the organization's environmental management system 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.590
 in e2 measure and therefore its operational performance 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.600
 help 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 doughty 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.870
 and indicators to allow 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.050
 the pilot for them the system itself 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.620
 so this is a typical example of an indicator that we will find an indication 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 orders 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.460
 of consumption it also says performance indicators 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.360
 operational 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.620
 yes we will find for example management indicators an agreement of 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.660
 loopback recovery for example the realization 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.510
 desensitization concerning the environment and the aspects 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.640
 environmental and a significant step 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.580
 order in the body 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.950
 an important notion in eurasia to take into account 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 So 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.899
 this chapter of the standard 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.899
 it is a long calibration of the measuring system 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 it often happens that they pursue 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.180
 the second blackout in europe thing to look good so this is the notion of 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.470
 regulatory size 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.410
 which is also part of the control 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.420
 and in which we see 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.050
 eva him 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.820
 mua 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.040
 the capacity of the organism 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.619
 to have a watch 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.609
 equipped with the means of regulatory controls which allow it 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.499
 feeding 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.989
 the deal is different and who 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.859
 he goes in 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.659
 identify new texts 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.439
 the regulations which may apply to the activities produced and 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.119
 services of the organization 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.119
 this new text identification usually so 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.749
 it comes from a little 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.349
 European directives that are retranscribed fleeing in domestic law 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.609
 2 to be able to be 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.569
 relevant 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.569
 not to forget about this in the lab of 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.449
 double to devalue also compared to the halls for you 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.449
 you are moving away term settlement 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.949
 the risk 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.259
 these nonconformities 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:01.379
 and then 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.779
 the other part of our control missions so consists 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.539
 to establish 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.539
 through audits and diagnose control 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.279
 nonconformities 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:17.439
 that identify the fact that the body does not respond to 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:18.979
 certain standards some angles 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.389
 as soon as if 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.539
 v 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:25.119
 so put up behind on cards so that can that tools 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.999
 provided for this purpose and no longer 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.279
 corrective and then preventive actions to avoid 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.699
 pharmaceuticals 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.699
 these phenomena and its deviations will be produced 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.549
 another part of the control is to master well and so what one 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.809
 call records management 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.289
 since every time we do we will audit 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:47.580
 to reassess 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.779
 there a requirement 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.419
 of the standard 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.509
 so it is possible that the pillar 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.659
 the associated record 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.859
 which is neither more nor less proof 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.389
 that this requirement has been met 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.939
 we will find there in particular 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.129
 the network decors on the installations we will find the top 100 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.989
 especially 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.920
 all waste tracking slips tied with waste 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.199
 prefectural decrees the receipt of declaration 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.650
 the city of Cugnaux technique asbestos 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.699
 the enemy 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.770
 of documents that brings the proof you have taken into account so the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.279
 explosive atmospheres 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.159
 and in a general way 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.230
 all records related to the exercises 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.230
 what can be done in the case of emergency situations 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.199
 following his bank and in the drama 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.340
 relies on the same subject the control mission 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.340
 e there is a requirement therefore to establish a program 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.240
 in which the opposition therefore has 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.270
 over a century for example one that 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.270
 of all the requirements of the referential in question 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.409
 it will just take time to put 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.409
 daniela advocates for party recording 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:06.309
 the training of term auditors or in the case of subcontractors or 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.620
 listeners for which 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.620
 mangani issue of securities futures 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.560
 taking into account the fact that an auditor can not be at the same time 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.090
 taking part in order to have no independence in relation to the subjects 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.580
 says it 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.650
 in fact nutrition 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.520
 impartiality 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.439
 so here are the bumps that which helps 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.979
 of the control part of the standard 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.319
 I give you an appointment 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.229
 next time we will be able to finish the presentation on 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.869
 general of this standard and in particular through the management review 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.490
 do not forget so you can join us 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.949
 It's certain 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.480
 the facebook of the purchase 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.300
 messahel see you soon 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.759
 for the next topic to treat why
