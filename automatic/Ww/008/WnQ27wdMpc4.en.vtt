00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.169
 it's wonderful the truth that I've been a 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.269
 incredible piece of year we have enjoyed 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.589
 much with each of the actions and of 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.320
 the collaborations that we have made 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.369
 I think it was the year of the takeoff 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 we started the year then leaving the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.220
 web platform where he was 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.840
 the blog 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 I started solo I started working 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.050
 with my representative and good has been a 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.730
 year as of personal growth and 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.130
 very large professional to me so 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.140
 the valuation is very good 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.860
 Well you can find many things 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.360
 as a mix of all those questions of 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 all those questions along 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.680
 These four years have gone by me 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.030
 the readers in the blog and that I have not 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.489
 could answer for lack of time 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.210
 because sometimes because you end up getting 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.320
 time with that in that world of teaching 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.850
 the looks the collaborations and 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.280
 hardly have time to no end 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.320
 and yes, I wanted to show a little 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.839
 more personal side also not inquiring 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.019
 much in my life but not if it shows a 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.780
 little bit that part more more personal mine 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.270
 show my cooking recipes show a 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.460
 little my closet not opening a little my 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.960
 home and my heart to readers and for 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.540
 for example you tips on how to make 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.970
 a good lifestyle suitcase there is a 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.799
 little bit of everything and I tell you so always 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.659
 tell me I repeat in the same not fixed that 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.369
 It's true I really like to have a 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.130
 cowboy that I feel good a cowboy 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.920
 cigarette 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.869
 a blazer to see that it does not feel good that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.610
 You see how good it is that you put it on and that you 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.289
 you saw a good essential black bag 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.240
 a pair of heels that are comfortable and that 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.439
 do not tell us more in life and I do not know 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.710
 how many I have I want that I have four 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.210
 girlfriend and a fifth can be then the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.860
 white shirt not that is 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.140
 essential in any wardrobe 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.479
 less is more I believe although it is very 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.030
 appealed by many people to me is the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.039
 phrase that defines better then when 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.659
 many times you are trying things and you see 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.830
 What do you wear? 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.990
 as your machine 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.979
 you need to remove who I am and how many 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.569
 less things 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.030
 the simpler I go the better 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.679
 I find more and more clean I go better 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.799
 better I find myself and safer 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.330
 I feel in family always family not 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.260
 For me, Christmas is the time of 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.939
 year perhaps one of the most special 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.920
 and this year as every year 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.299
 previous because the really celebrate 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.430
 house yes it is true that this year I 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.560
 a trip coincides during the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.720
 kings is the first year that I 'm not going to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.849
 spend kings in my house and with my family 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.570
 ni but good is for a good cause 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.890
 so 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.470
 they are like my personal kings not this 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.180
 trip then maybe it's the day less 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.190
 familiar to all of us 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.100
 We usually celebrate Christmas and end 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.750
 of year at my grandparents' house and maybe 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.390
 kings was a bit like more special in 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.560
 my house but but good in general the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.030
 possibility to celebrate as always in 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.180
 family that for me is the most important thing 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.040
 Well, maybe we always have the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.290
 black this this year has given me a 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.570
 back well for the shopping centers 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.060
 by stores I've also seen a bit what 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.090
 that there was online and I've seen that 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.690
 there's a lot of paillet a lot of spangle in 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.120
 golden in colors like wine as white 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.980
 there is as a variety of colors a lot 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.780
 more special than other years maybe we do not 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.520
 we are launching to other colors in the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.840
 life not only red and black and for 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.760
 I am very special, for example, dressing up 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.480
 of gold whenever I have done it in 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.520
 these holidays 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.830
 I've been feeling really good I felt very 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.060
 to taste and very sexy then I would bet 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.040
 for being a freixenet bubble this year 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.569
 I love it and it's the second time 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.069
 third that I'm here the truth that 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.440
 whenever I come I see things that good 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.060
 it seems like that outside like 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.099
 less attractive not with shopping center 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.390
 normal but really when you go in and 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.610
 you see all the material that they have that is 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.190
 very current which is good then totally 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.660
 because of trend and accounts with 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.280
 many interesting things some prices 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.019
 great in stores and it's very 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.019
 attractive i like a lot 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.670
