00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
this up in some plastic I'm just using a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.039 
this up in some plastic I'm just using a
freezer<00:02:12.940> bag<00:02:13.090> where<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.480> can<00:02:13.690> use<00:02:13.810> plastic

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
freezer bag where you can use plastic

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.720 
freezer bag where you can use plastic
wrap<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.709> we're<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.010> pop<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
wrap and we're going to pop this in the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.180 
wrap and we're going to pop this in the
freezer<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:16.269> about<00:02:16.540> forty<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.410> sixty<00:02:17.799> minutes

freezer for about forty to sixty minutes

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.640 
freezer for about forty to sixty minutes
now<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.360> very<00:02:19.660> important<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.440> make<00:02:20.620> sure

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
now it's very important to make sure

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.460 
now it's very important to make sure
that<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.370> chill<00:02:22.180> these<00:02:22.390> very<00:02:22.750> well<00:02:22.989> otherwise

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
that you chill these very well otherwise

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.830 
that you chill these very well otherwise
this<00:02:23.769> won't<00:02:24.010> work<00:02:24.310> out<00:02:24.549> as<00:02:24.790> neatly<00:02:25.299> as<00:02:25.420> you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
this won't work out as neatly as you

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.250 
this won't work out as neatly as you
want<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.230> okay<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:26.950> next<00:02:27.310> we're<00:02:27.610> going<00:02:27.790> to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
want it to okay so next we're going to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.750 
want it to okay so next we're going to
wrap<00:02:29.260> our<00:02:29.530> white<00:02:30.459> dough<00:02:30.730> around<00:02:31.000> our<00:02:31.390> red<00:02:31.660> log

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
wrap our white dough around our red log

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.550 
wrap our white dough around our red log
so<00:02:33.760> I'm<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.209> using<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.630> little<00:02:34.810> bit<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.110> baking

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
so I'm just using a little bit of baking

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.560 
so I'm just using a little bit of baking
paper<00:02:35.769> because<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.400> makes<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.880> lot<00:02:37.060> easier

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
paper because it makes it a lot easier

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.050 
paper because it makes it a lot easier
to<00:02:37.750> roll<00:02:37.959> these<00:02:38.170> out<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.860> also<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.730> doesn't

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
to roll these out and also it doesn't

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.180 
to roll these out and also it doesn't
stick<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.810> rolling<00:02:41.049> pin<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:43.890> roll<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.040> out

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
stick to the rolling pin so roll it out

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.850 
stick to the rolling pin so roll it out
to<00:02:45.220> about<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.910> centimeter<00:02:46.630> thick<00:02:46.750> no<00:02:47.530> thicker

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
to about a centimeter thick no thicker

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.400 
to about a centimeter thick no thicker
than<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:49.959> want<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.170> make<00:02:50.380> sure

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
than that and you just want to make sure

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.110 
than that and you just want to make sure
that<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:50.920> going<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.250> big<00:02:51.489> enough<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:52.000> it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
that it's going to be big enough that it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:03.080 
that it's going to be big enough that it
can<00:02:52.239> wrap<00:02:52.450> around<00:02:52.780> your<00:02:52.900> red<00:02:53.110> log

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.789 

okay<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.180> don't<00:03:04.540> worry<00:03:04.810> about<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.319> creases

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
okay so don't worry about the creases

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.530 
okay so don't worry about the creases
because<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.459> get<00:03:06.579> rid<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.819> those<00:03:07.030> after

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
because you can get rid of those after

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.569 
because you can get rid of those after
you've<00:03:07.659> got<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.989> paper<00:03:08.230> off<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.829> we're<00:03:09.549> just

going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.849> give<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.209> final<00:03:10.540> role<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.109> get

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
going to give it that final role to get

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.009 
going to give it that final role to get
rid<00:03:11.409> of<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.590> creases<00:03:15.390> now<00:03:16.390> don't<00:03:16.689> worry<00:03:16.900> about

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
rid of the creases now don't worry about

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.660 
rid of the creases now don't worry about
the<00:03:17.230> sides<00:03:17.530> either<00:03:17.890> if<00:03:18.189> they're<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:18.519> looking

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
the sides either if they're not looking

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.190 
the sides either if they're not looking
neat<00:03:19.030> we're<00:03:19.209> going<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.420> trim<00:03:19.689> those<00:03:19.810> off<00:03:20.019> at

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
neat we're going to trim those off at

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.809 
neat we're going to trim those off at
the<00:03:20.379> end

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
the end

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.119 
the end
okay<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:21.879> just<00:03:22.450> using<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:22.870> paper<00:03:23.230> I'm<00:03:23.859> going

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
okay so just using the paper I'm going

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.339 
okay so just using the paper I'm going
to<00:03:24.250> use<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.150> help<00:03:25.269> me<00:03:25.480> roll<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.079> white

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
to use that to help me roll the white

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.740 
to use that to help me roll the white
doll<00:03:26.620> around<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.040> red<00:03:27.250> log<00:03:27.549> just<00:03:28.420> firmly

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
doll around the red log just firmly

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.770 
doll around the red log just firmly
press<00:03:29.260> down<00:03:29.290> on<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.950> white<00:03:30.250> dough<00:03:31.120> onto<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
press down on the white dough onto the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.190 
press down on the white dough onto the
red<00:03:32.019> log<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.129> can<00:03:33.340> stick<00:03:33.700> nicely<00:03:34.200> it's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
red log so that it can stick nicely it's

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.780 
red log so that it can stick nicely it's
better<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.620> do<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.859> this<00:03:36.040> way<00:03:36.280> instead<00:03:36.549> of

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
better to do it this way instead of

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.030 
better to do it this way instead of
rolling<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.450> because<00:03:37.750> if<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.019> roll<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.799> white

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
rolling it because if you roll the white

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.940 
rolling it because if you roll the white
dough<00:03:39.280> onto<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.879> red<00:03:40.180> log<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:41.109> will<00:03:41.379> cause<00:03:41.620> air

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
dough onto the red log it will cause air

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.160 
dough onto the red log it will cause air
bubbles<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:43.299> don't<00:03:43.510> want<00:03:43.689> air<00:03:43.810> bubbles

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
bubbles and you don't want air bubbles

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.990 
bubbles and you don't want air bubbles
so<00:03:44.709> we're<00:03:44.829> going<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:44.980> trim<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> sides<00:03:45.639> off

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
so we're going to trim the sides off

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.210 
so we're going to trim the sides off
we're<00:03:46.810> going<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.019> wrap<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.230> up<00:03:47.409> in<00:03:47.560> plastic<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
we're going to wrap it up in plastic and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.399 
we're going to wrap it up in plastic and
pop<00:03:48.819> it<00:03:48.939> in<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> freezer<00:03:49.359> for<00:03:49.599> forty<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.260> sixty

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
pop it in the freezer for forty to sixty

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.030 
pop it in the freezer for forty to sixty
minutes<00:03:50.680> again<00:03:51.359> now<00:03:52.359> I<00:03:52.420> prefer<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.439> leave<00:03:53.739> this

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
minutes again now I prefer to leave this

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.069 
minutes again now I prefer to leave this
standing<00:03:54.760> up<00:03:54.849> in<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.239> freezer<00:03:55.480> if<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.930> have

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
standing up in the freezer if you have

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.159 
standing up in the freezer if you have
space<00:03:56.609> because<00:03:57.609> that<00:03:57.849> way<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.720> white<00:03:58.930> dough

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
space because that way the white dough

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.229 
space because that way the white dough
is<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.349> little<00:03:59.440> bit<00:03:59.769> soft<00:04:00.069> still<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.669> you<00:04:01.000> don't

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
is a little bit soft still and you don't

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.559 
is a little bit soft still and you don't
want<00:04:01.389> it<00:04:01.449> to<00:04:01.569> get<00:04:01.690> any<00:04:01.870> dense<00:04:02.879> okay<00:04:03.879> so<00:04:03.940> the

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
want it to get any dense okay so the
