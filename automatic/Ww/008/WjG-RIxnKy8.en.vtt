dust<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.440> sand<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.160> little<00:03:07.459> heads-up<00:03:07.790> there

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
dust and sand so a little heads-up there

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.940 
dust and sand so a little heads-up there
on<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.600> satellite<00:03:08.989> radar<00:03:09.170> picture<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.830> do

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
on the satellite radar picture we do

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.160 
on the satellite radar picture we do
have<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.310> area<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.700> low<00:03:10.760> pressure<00:03:10.880> well<00:03:11.510> to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
to build trying to build is what I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.890 
to build trying to build is what I
should<00:03:24.709> say<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:25.790> are<00:03:25.940> going<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.360> see<00:03:26.540> clear

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
should say so we are going to see clear

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.380 
should say so we are going to see clear
skies<00:03:27.230> tonight<00:03:27.560> through<00:03:28.280> almost<00:03:28.459> through<00:03:29.269> the

that<00:03:31.880> marine<00:03:32.360> layer<00:03:32.480> are<00:03:32.600> developing<00:03:33.110> as<00:03:33.200> we

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
that marine layer are developing as we

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.630 
that marine layer are developing as we
take<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> look<00:03:33.620> at<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.769> microcast<00:03:34.310> I'm<00:03:34.489> going

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
take a look at the microcast I'm going

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.759 
take a look at the microcast I'm going
to<00:03:34.700> put<00:03:34.820> it<00:03:34.910> into<00:03:35.060> place<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.570> you<00:03:35.690> can<00:03:35.870> see<00:03:35.930> that

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
to put it into place so you can see that

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.680 
to put it into place so you can see that
in<00:03:37.130> during<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.610> overnight<00:03:37.850> hours<00:03:38.360> at<00:03:38.480> around

two o'clock in the morning that's when
that<00:03:40.549> marine<00:03:40.910> layer<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.239> going<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.540> get<00:03:41.840> pushed

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
that marine layer is going to get pushed

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.949 
that marine layer is going to get pushed
in<00:03:42.440> as<00:03:42.590> we<00:03:42.709> get<00:03:42.860> stronger<00:03:43.280> onshore<00:03:43.670> flow<00:03:44.540> but

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
in as we get stronger onshore flow but

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.680 
in as we get stronger onshore flow but
take<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.200> look<00:03:45.440> at<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.799> by<00:03:46.400> Friday<00:03:46.820> at<00:03:47.420> around

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
take a look at this by Friday at around

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.990 
take a look at this by Friday at around
noon<00:03:48.080> look<00:03:48.709> how<00:03:48.890> light<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.190> marine<00:03:49.670> layer<00:03:49.850> is

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
noon look how light that marine layer is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.850 
noon look how light that marine layer is
we<00:03:50.660> are<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.170> see<00:03:51.350> more<00:03:51.590> sunshine

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
we are going to see more sunshine

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.710 
we are going to see more sunshine
tomorrow<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.790> temperatures<00:03:53.420> are<00:03:53.540> going<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
tomorrow and temperatures are going to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.600 
tomorrow and temperatures are going to
warm<00:03:53.780> up<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.320> little<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.860> more<00:03:55.100> than<00:03:55.310> we<00:03:55.430> had

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
warm up a little bit more than we had

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.580 
warm up a little bit more than we had
today<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.000> at<00:03:56.269> least<00:03:56.450> we<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.560> look

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
today so at least we have that to look

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.260 
today so at least we have that to look
forward<00:03:57.739> to

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
forward to

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.240 
forward to
and<00:03:59.360> by<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.630> time<00:03:59.750> Sunday<00:04:00.230> rolls<00:04:00.410> around<00:04:00.920> once

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
and by the time Sunday rolls around once

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.470 
and by the time Sunday rolls around once
again<00:04:01.490> that<00:04:01.640> marine<00:04:01.910> layer<00:04:01.940> is<00:04:02.060> gonna<00:04:02.330> get

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
again that marine layer is gonna get

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.880 
again that marine layer is gonna get
thick<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.900> we<00:04:02.960> do<00:04:03.080> have<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.320> possibility<00:04:03.860> of

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
thick and we do have the possibility of

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.700 
thick and we do have the possibility of
more<00:04:04.100> drizzle<00:04:04.460> overnight<00:04:05.000> low<00:04:05.210> 65<00:04:05.750> sunny<00:04:06.410> in

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
more drizzle overnight low 65 sunny in

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.440 
more drizzle overnight low 65 sunny in
the<00:04:06.740> afternoon<00:04:06.890> for<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.640> Easter<00:04:08.030> egg<00:04:08.120> hunt

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
the afternoon for the Easter egg hunt

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.420 
the afternoon for the Easter egg hunt
but<00:04:08.990> things<00:04:09.230> really<00:04:09.560> start<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.010> warm<00:04:10.310> up

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
but things really start to warm up

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.280 
but things really start to warm up
nicely<00:04:10.700> as<00:04:11.150> we<00:04:11.270> take<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.480> look<00:04:11.660> at<00:04:11.810> next<00:04:12.110> week

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
nicely as we take a look at next week

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.570 
nicely as we take a look at next week
and<00:04:12.500> that's<00:04:12.860> because<00:04:13.130> a<00:04:13.160> ridge<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.490> high

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
and that's because a ridge of high

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.120 
and that's because a ridge of high
pressure<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:14.030> gonna<00:04:14.120> build<00:04:14.560> 74<00:04:15.560> on<00:04:15.680> Sunday<00:04:16.070> for

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
pressure is gonna build 74 on Sunday for

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.650 
pressure is gonna build 74 on Sunday for
your<00:04:16.340> Easter<00:04:16.489> egg<00:04:16.730> hunt<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.180> then<00:04:17.270> a<00:04:17.360> huge

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
your Easter egg hunt and then a huge

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.910 
your Easter egg hunt and then a huge
bump<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.560> 79<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.340> 88<00:04:19.880> by<00:04:20.480> Tuesday<00:04:21.260> that's<00:04:21.680> look

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
bump to 79 and 88 by Tuesday that's look

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.560 
bump to 79 and 88 by Tuesday that's look
at<00:04:22.040> seven-day<00:04:22.430> forecast<00:04:22.880> we'll<00:04:23.210> be<00:04:23.330> right

that<00:06:08.960> area<00:06:09.320> of<00:06:09.380> low<00:06:09.530> pressure

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
that area of low pressure

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.999 
that area of low pressure
well<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.610> our<00:06:10.669> northeast<00:06:11.330> but<00:06:12.080> what<00:06:12.409> now<00:06:12.710> we're

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
well to our northeast but what now we're

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.040 
well to our northeast but what now we're
dealing<00:06:13.280> with<00:06:13.460> is<00:06:13.789> a<00:06:13.819> little<00:06:14.180> bit<00:06:14.270> of<00:06:14.419> sinking

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
dealing with is a little bit of sinking

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.260 
dealing with is a little bit of sinking
air<00:06:15.379> and<00:06:15.680> that<00:06:16.129> sinking<00:06:16.639> air<00:06:16.819> is<00:06:16.999> actually

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
air and that sinking air is actually

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.709 
air and that sinking air is actually
clearing<00:06:18.080> skies<00:06:18.650> up<00:06:19.129> but<00:06:19.490> overnight<00:06:19.939> that

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
clearing skies up but overnight that

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:22.869 
clearing skies up but overnight that
pressure<00:06:21.080> is<00:06:21.349> going<00:06:21.469> to<00:06:21.830> start<00:06:22.099> to<00:06:22.310> fall<00:06:22.580> and

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:22.879 
pressure is going to start to fall and

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.239 
pressure is going to start to fall and
as<00:06:23.029> it<00:06:23.360> does<00:06:23.629> we<00:06:24.199> are<00:06:24.349> going<00:06:24.650> to<00:06:24.770> see<00:06:24.949> the<00:06:25.099> low

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249 
as it does we are going to see the low

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.129 
as it does we are going to see the low
clouds<00:06:25.279> and<00:06:25.699> fog<00:06:25.909> redevelop<00:06:26.659> once<00:06:26.870> again

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
clouds and fog redevelop once again

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.189 
clouds and fog redevelop once again
tomorrow<00:06:27.469> wake<00:06:28.430> up<00:06:28.669> it<00:06:28.849> is<00:06:28.879> going<00:06:29.180> to<00:06:29.360> be<00:06:29.509> gray

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
tomorrow wake up it is going to be gray

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.170 
tomorrow wake up it is going to be gray
not<00:06:30.590> nearly<00:06:30.979> as<00:06:31.129> thick<00:06:31.460> as<00:06:31.639> it<00:06:31.789> was<00:06:31.969> this

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
not nearly as thick as it was this

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.570 
not nearly as thick as it was this
morning<00:06:32.509> which<00:06:32.930> means<00:06:32.960> it's<00:06:33.889> going<00:06:34.159> to<00:06:34.310> clear

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
morning which means it's going to clear

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.399 
morning which means it's going to clear
up<00:06:34.610> a<00:06:34.909> little<00:06:35.090> bit<00:06:35.360> earlier<00:06:35.779> take<00:06:36.050> a<00:06:36.080> look<00:06:36.319> at

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
up a little bit earlier take a look at

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.739 
up a little bit earlier take a look at
this<00:06:36.590> this<00:06:36.710> is<00:06:36.860> our<00:06:36.979> microcast<00:06:37.580> for<00:06:38.270> the

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:38.749 
this this is our microcast for the

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.959 
this this is our microcast for the
marine<00:06:39.139> layer<00:06:39.319> that's<00:06:39.590> tonight<00:06:40.069> and<00:06:40.400> as<00:06:40.729> we<00:06:40.849> go

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
marine layer that's tonight and as we go

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.279 
marine layer that's tonight and as we go
ahead<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.300> advance<00:06:41.419> it<00:06:41.779> you<00:06:41.870> can<00:06:41.990> see<00:06:42.139> that

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
ahead and advance it you can see that

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.200 
ahead and advance it you can see that
the<00:06:42.439> marine<00:06:43.129> layer<00:06:43.250> doesn't<00:06:43.639> really<00:06:43.879> take

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
the marine layer doesn't really take

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.600 
the marine layer doesn't really take
hold<00:06:44.479> until<00:06:45.289> later<00:06:45.560> on<00:06:45.650> tonight<00:06:46.039> right<00:06:46.400> around

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
hold until later on tonight right around

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.369 
hold until later on tonight right around

afternoon around the lunch hour it
starts<00:06:50.900> to<00:06:51.080> clear<00:06:51.469> up<00:06:51.680> and<00:06:51.889> it<00:06:52.279> really<00:06:52.580> starts

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
starts to clear up and it really starts

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.480 
starts to clear up and it really starts
to<00:06:53.300> like<00:06:53.960> turn<00:06:54.620> into<00:06:54.740> a<00:06:54.860> beautiful<00:06:55.310> afternoon
