00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
maybe Canelo should have been fighting

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.390 
maybe Canelo should have been fighting
Maidana

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400

business

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.830 
business
so<00:04:38.349> is<00:04:38.470> Canelo<00:04:38.860> actually<00:04:39.310> overrated<00:04:39.849> we're

yet<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.080> see

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
yet to see

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.670

but<00:04:42.400> Canelo<00:04:42.729> beat<00:04:42.969> trout<00:04:43.509> even<00:04:44.379> though<00:04:44.499> we

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
but Canelo beat trout even though we

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.269 
but Canelo beat trout even though we
felt<00:04:44.919> it<00:04:45.069> was<00:04:45.219> a<00:04:45.249> draw<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.849> trout<00:04:46.779> beat<00:04:46.990> Cotto

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:47.279 
felt it was a draw and trout beat Cotto

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.909 
felt it was a draw and trout beat Cotto
who<00:04:48.279> Floyd<00:04:48.550> didn't<00:04:48.879> look<00:04:48.999> that<00:04:49.180> great<00:04:49.330> against

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
who Floyd didn't look that great against

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.260 
who Floyd didn't look that great against
so<00:04:50.919> how<00:04:51.069> do<00:04:51.129> we<00:04:51.399> assess<00:04:51.699> who<00:04:51.879> will<00:04:51.999> win<00:04:52.149> this

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
so how do we assess who will win this

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.950 
so how do we assess who will win this
fight<00:04:52.499> we<00:04:53.499> can<00:04:53.680> only<00:04:53.830> go<00:04:54.129> by<00:04:54.309> Styles<00:04:54.960> Canelo

stoppage may be better than people think

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.079 
stoppage may be better than people think
because<00:06:14.740> Canelo<00:06:15.099> said<00:06:15.370> something<00:06:15.789> strange

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:16.089 
because Canelo said something strange

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:18.540

he starts feeling like nothing more than

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:44.809 
he starts feeling like nothing more than
a<00:06:42.879> bulkier<00:06:43.269> version<00:06:43.719> of<00:06:43.839> Ricky<00:06:44.139> Hatton

sinks the American national anthem at
the<00:07:15.009> same<00:07:15.219> time<00:07:15.689> Canelo<00:07:16.689> is<00:07:16.779> a<00:07:16.899> guy<00:07:17.050> who<00:07:17.110> can

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:17.379 
the same time Canelo is a guy who can

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:18.779 
the same time Canelo is a guy who can
end<00:07:17.560> a<00:07:17.649> fight<00:07:17.800> if<00:07:17.979> he<00:07:18.129> gets<00:07:18.310> in<00:07:18.459> that<00:07:18.579> one

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:18.789 
end a fight if he gets in that one

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.999 
end a fight if he gets in that one
lethal<00:07:18.969> cobra<00:07:19.419> bite<00:07:19.629> and<00:07:19.930> he's<00:07:20.800> certainly

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:21.009 
lethal cobra bite and he's certainly

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:22.459 
lethal cobra bite and he's certainly
faster<00:07:21.639> than<00:07:21.819> he<00:07:21.939> looks

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:22.469 
faster than he looks

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:24.600 
faster than he looks
perhaps<00:07:23.469> he<00:07:23.649> can<00:07:23.800> have<00:07:23.949> Floyd<00:07:24.189> think<00:07:24.430> all

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
perhaps he can have Floyd think all

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.269 
perhaps he can have Floyd think all
those<00:07:24.789> same<00:07:25.089> things<00:07:25.269> instead<00:07:25.829> but<00:07:26.829> Floyd's<00:07:27.099> on

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:27.279 
those same things instead but Floyd's on

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:30.089 
those same things instead but Floyd's on
his<00:07:27.430> way<00:07:27.579> to<00:07:27.639> 40<00:07:28.120> and<00:07:28.479> has<00:07:29.199> had<00:07:29.379> his<00:07:29.529> career<00:07:29.680> and

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.099 
his way to 40 and has had his career and

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:31.980 
his way to 40 and has had his career and
doesn't<00:07:30.999> give<00:07:31.300> much<00:07:31.509> of<00:07:31.539> a<00:07:31.749> shit

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:31.990 
doesn't give much of a shit

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.429 
doesn't give much of a shit
so<00:07:32.979> that's<00:07:33.189> unlikely<00:07:33.719> so<00:07:34.719> what's<00:07:34.959> our<00:07:35.079> final

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:35.439 
so that's unlikely so what's our final

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:38.939 
so that's unlikely so what's our final
prediction<00:07:35.919> it's<00:07:36.849> this<00:07:37.289> Floyd<00:07:38.289> Mayweather<00:07:38.680> is

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:38.949 
prediction it's this Floyd Mayweather is

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:40.920 
prediction it's this Floyd Mayweather is
going<00:07:39.579> to<00:07:39.699> win<00:07:39.849> this<00:07:39.939> fight<00:07:40.180> against<00:07:40.569> Canelo

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930 
going to win this fight against Canelo
