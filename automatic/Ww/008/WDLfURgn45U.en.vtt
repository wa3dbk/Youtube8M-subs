00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that you add salt and so you just have a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.920 
that you add salt and so you just have a
little<00:01:35.520> bit<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> salt<00:01:36.829> stir<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.840> makes<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
little bit of salt stir it up makes a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
little bit of salt stir it up makes a
really<00:01:40.110> big<00:01:40.170> difference<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> flavor<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
really big difference on the flavor of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.499 
really big difference on the flavor of
the<00:01:41.880> rice<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.979> set<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> lid<00:01:44.670> on

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the rice and you just set the lid on

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.429 
the rice and you just set the lid on
there<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.680> set<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.310> 40<00:01:47.610> minutes

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
there and you set this for 40 minutes

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.929 
there and you set this for 40 minutes
and<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.710> forget<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.340> until<00:01:50.759> it's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and you just forget about it until it's

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
and you just forget about it until it's
cooked<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.079> we'll<00:01:52.229> come<00:01:52.409> back<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.740> this

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
cooked and so we'll come back to this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.289 
cooked and so we'll come back to this
after<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.220> cooked<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> we'll<00:01:53.909> see<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
after it's cooked and we'll see how it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.250 
after it's cooked and we'll see how it
turned<00:01:54.570> out

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
turned out

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.320
