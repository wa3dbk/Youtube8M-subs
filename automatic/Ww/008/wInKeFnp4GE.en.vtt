then<00:01:04.540> how<00:01:04.780> do<00:01:04.839> we<00:01:05.080> apply<00:01:05.320> those<00:01:05.650> technologies

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
then how do we apply those technologies

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.160 
then how do we apply those technologies
to<00:01:06.970> make<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.180> whole<00:01:07.300> experience<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:07.960> car

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
best car we could and then at the very

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.800 
best car we could and then at the very
end<00:03:03.500> we'd<00:03:03.980> step<00:03:04.220> back<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.730> say<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.270> this

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
end we'd step back and say is this

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.750 
end we'd step back and say is this
worthy<00:03:06.110> of<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.590> Stingray<00:03:07.010> name<00:03:07.250> we've<00:03:07.730> just

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
worthy of the Stingray name we've just

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.410 
worthy of the Stingray name we've just
recently<00:03:08.209> elected<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.769> yes<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.459> fact<00:03:10.489> it's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
recently elected that yes in fact it's
