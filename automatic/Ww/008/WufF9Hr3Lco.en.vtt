00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
at a new advanced warfare and what I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.330 
at a new advanced warfare and what I
think<00:01:22.320> they're<00:01:22.470> giving<00:01:22.740> us<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
think they're giving us is just a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
think they're giving us is just a
completely<00:01:23.820> new<00:01:24.060> different<00:01:24.360> type<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> game<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
completely new different type of game I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.630 
completely new different type of game I
think<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.729> suck<00:01:27.360> sorry<00:01:27.930> um<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
think it's going to suck sorry um I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.390 
think it's going to suck sorry um I
think<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.600> fun<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> same

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
think it's gonna be fun but at the same

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
think it's gonna be fun but at the same
time<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.640> think<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.119> branching<00:01:33.390> off<00:01:33.689> away

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
time I think it's branching off away

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.859 
time I think it's branching off away
from<00:01:34.140> call<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> duty<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.750> not

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
from call of duty so much that it's not

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.060 
from call of duty so much that it's not
going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> send<00:01:37.320> call<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> duty<00:01:37.710> field<00:01:37.920> but

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
going to send call of duty field but

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.260 
going to send call of duty field but
that's<00:01:38.159> fine<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.150> lot

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that's fine because I think that a lot

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
that's fine because I think that a lot
of<00:01:39.329> people<00:01:39.420> are<00:01:39.900> sick<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> call<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.009> duty<00:01:41.340> but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
of people are sick of call of duty but

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.649 
of people are sick of call of duty but
we<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> keep<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.090> playing<00:01:42.329> call<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> duty

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
we want to keep on playing call of duty

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.620 
we want to keep on playing call of duty
if<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.470> makes<00:01:43.799> sense<00:01:44.100> oh<00:01:44.399> let<00:01:45.000> me<00:01:45.030> explain

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
person for my livestream was actually

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.259 
person for my livestream was actually
dropping<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.599> b23r<00:03:02.439> with<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.799> TAC<00:03:03.040> knife<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.639> was

picking it up getting kills with this

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.280 
picking it up getting kills with this
like<00:03:06.099> an<00:03:06.250> unlock<00:03:06.639> kills<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:07.930> can<00:03:08.170> actually

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
like an unlock kills so I can actually

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.629 
like an unlock kills so I can actually
use<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.709> for<00:03:08.859> creative<00:03:09.189> class<00:03:09.340> without

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
use it for creative class without

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.190 
use it for creative class without
actually<00:03:10.030> firing<00:03:10.209> bullets<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.989> lot<00:03:11.139> of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
actually firing bullets and a lot of

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.660 
actually firing bullets and a lot of
people<00:03:11.319> read<00:03:11.500> be<00:03:11.590> like<00:03:11.709> why<00:03:12.220> don't<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.519> just

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
people read be like why don't you just

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.330 
people read be like why don't you just
go<00:03:12.730> into<00:03:13.450> gun<00:03:14.260> game<00:03:14.500> they<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:14.919> give<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.160> that

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
go into gun game they just give you that

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.680 
go into gun game they just give you that
because<00:03:15.849> for<00:03:15.879> whatever<00:03:16.090> reason<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.540> doesn't

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
because for whatever reason it doesn't

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.720 
because for whatever reason it doesn't
count<00:03:16.930> for<00:03:17.139> gun<00:03:17.500> game<00:03:17.709> kills<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.609> it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
count for gun game kills like it it

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.640 
count for gun game kills like it it
doesn't<00:03:18.940> allow<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.780> unlock<00:03:20.109> progression

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
doesn't allow you to unlock progression

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.770 
doesn't allow you to unlock progression
and<00:03:20.859> that's<00:03:21.669> about<00:03:21.790> as<00:03:22.000> complicated<00:03:22.239> as<00:03:22.690> that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
and that's about as complicated as that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.960 
and that's about as complicated as that
I'd<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.049> make<00:03:23.349> call<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.769> duty<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.280> so

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
I'd like to make call of duty and so

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.089 
I'd like to make call of duty and so
this<00:03:25.269> new<00:03:25.480> one<00:03:25.690> looks<00:03:26.109> overly<00:03:26.530> complicated

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
this new one looks overly complicated

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.680 
this new one looks overly complicated
but<00:03:27.220> at<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.549> same<00:03:27.760> time<00:03:27.940> let's<00:03:28.239> look<00:03:28.419> back<00:03:28.629> on
