00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.330
 we have always characterized 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.900
 for having the ability to get what 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.900
 impossible 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.419
 and those are the first moments to fly 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.949
 faster than the speed of sound 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.450
 those moments in which we dare to 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.420
 aim higher 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.470
 to break down barriers 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.970
 to reach the stars forward 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.970
 I have known the unknown 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.000
 but still 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.460
 for humanity the protagonists of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.190
 our greatest heroics is raising 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.910
 the imagination of a generation but 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.910
 that is history 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.720
 for the last time 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.650
 or maybe we have forgotten 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.200
 that we are still pioneers that barely 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.509
 we have started 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.180
 and that our greatest achievements are 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.230
 arrive 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.640
 that our destiny 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.640
 and it's written in the stars
