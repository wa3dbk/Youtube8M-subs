that I'm going into the car and switch

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.340 
that I'm going into the car and switch
on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> lights<00:00:31.969> like<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.140> driver

on the lights like we can see the driver
side<00:00:34.559> light<00:00:34.739> bulb<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.329> got<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
side light bulb is out so we got to

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.180 
side light bulb is out so we got to
check<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.680> why<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.550> light<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.910> working

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
therefore we're kind of in here there's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
therefore we're kind of in here there's
a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.430> cover<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.450> case<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.079> bulb

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
a little cover in this case this bulb

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.639 
a little cover in this case this bulb
right<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.200> stick<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
right here it's just stick in and you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
right here it's just stick in and you
twist<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> pull<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and the wires can be loose because two

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.840 
and the wires can be loose because two
connectors<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.649> right<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.670> where

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
connectors are right here that's where

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
connectors are right here that's where
it<00:00:59.940> connects<00:01:02.030> make<00:01:03.030> sure<00:01:03.180> when<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> take<00:01:03.719> this

out that you always try to touch the
light<00:01:06.930> bulb<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> plastic

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
light bulb on the back of this plastic

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.800 
light bulb on the back of this plastic
here<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> replace<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.689> take<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
here and when you replace it take it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.219 
here and when you replace it take it
here<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> metal<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.710> pull<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:15.229> not

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
here on the metal and pull it out not

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
here on the metal and pull it out not
touch<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.130> front<00:01:17.400> tip<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> light<00:01:18.150> bulb

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
touch the front tip off the light bulb

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
touch the front tip off the light bulb
that<00:01:18.900> way<00:01:19.020> grease<00:01:19.290> cannot<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:19.979> then

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that way grease cannot go out and then

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.380 
that way grease cannot go out and then
burn<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.439> make<00:01:22.439> sure<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.700> also

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
burn out so make sure that and also

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.620 
burn out so make sure that and also
there's<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.930> notch<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.189> light<00:01:26.400> bulb<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
there's a notch on this light bulb and a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.179 
there's a notch on this light bulb and a
notch<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.530> when<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> put<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> back

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
notch on here so when you put it back

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
notch on here so when you put it back
together<00:01:29.340> make<00:01:29.729> sure<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.689> clips

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
together make sure that not just clips

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
together make sure that not just clips
in<00:01:32.840> as<00:01:34.009> well<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.579> put<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> back<00:01:35.909> together

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
in as well when you put it back together

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270 
in as well when you put it back together
make<00:01:36.630> sure<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.590> tricky<00:01:37.860> here

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
make sure it's kind of tricky here

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
make sure it's kind of tricky here
because<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> don't<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.540> space<00:01:39.900> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
because you don't have really space to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.170 
because you don't have really space to
look<00:01:40.380> at<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.340> kind<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.759> getting<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
look at so it's kind of like getting a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.520 
look at so it's kind of like getting a
feeling<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.730 

so<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.590> kind<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:49.810> just<00:01:50.810> try<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.080> put<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.650> a

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
so you kind of just try to put it in a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.830 
so you kind of just try to put it in a
spot<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.909> feel<00:01:53.299> kind<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.659> when<00:01:53.810> it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
spot and you you feel kind of when it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.920 
spot and you you feel kind of when it
goes<00:01:54.380> in<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:54.830> just<00:01:55.130> lock<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:55.939> in<00:01:58.930> and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
goes in and then just lock it in and

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.630 
goes in and then just lock it in and
once<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.649> lock<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.280> can<00:02:01.460> see

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
once you lock it in you can see

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.120 
once you lock it in you can see
immediately<00:02:02.080> immediately<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.710> light<00:02:03.890> comes

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
immediately immediately the light comes

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.440 
immediately immediately the light comes
back<00:02:04.369> on<00:02:06.399> while<00:02:07.399> we<00:02:07.580> change<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.970> lightbulbs

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
back on while we change the lightbulbs

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.150 
back on while we change the lightbulbs
or<00:02:08.750> one<00:02:08.959> of<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.229> reason<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.679> because<00:02:09.709> the
