about<00:05:32.819> that<00:05:33.209> this<00:05:33.899> week's<00:05:34.110> question<00:05:34.319> comes

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:34.589 
about that this week's question comes

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.759 
about that this week's question comes
from<00:05:34.979> at<00:05:35.369> kike<00:05:36.029> thumper<00:05:36.389> via<00:05:36.629> Twitter<00:05:36.959> and<00:05:37.229> she

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:37.769 
from at kike thumper via Twitter and she

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:40.670 
from at kike thumper via Twitter and she
asks<00:05:38.309> how<00:05:38.639> short<00:05:38.969> is<00:05:39.180> too<00:05:39.539> short<00:05:39.809> for<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.139> game<00:05:40.379> I

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
asks how short is too short for a game I

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.709 
asks how short is too short for a game I
don't<00:05:41.309> think<00:05:41.639> there's<00:05:41.849> too<00:05:42.029> short<00:05:42.300> for<00:05:42.449> a<00:05:42.509> game

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
don't think there's too short for a game

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.449 
don't think there's too short for a game
I<00:05:42.899> think<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.199> just<00:05:43.229> depends<00:05:43.830> on<00:05:43.949> what<00:05:44.129> the<00:05:44.309> game

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:44.459 
I think it just depends on what the game

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:46.909 
I think it just depends on what the game
is<00:05:44.779> there<00:05:45.779> i'm<00:05:46.079> trying<00:05:46.319> to<00:05:46.439> think<00:05:46.469> of<00:05:46.889> the

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
is there i'm trying to think of the

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.350 
is there i'm trying to think of the
shortest<00:05:47.579> game<00:05:48.029> i<00:05:48.479> have<00:05:49.079> or<00:05:49.409> that<00:05:49.499> i've<00:05:49.619> played

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
shortest game i have or that i've played

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.149 
shortest game i have or that i've played
it's<00:05:51.360> certainly<00:05:51.959> under<00:05:52.319> 10<00:05:52.559> minutes<00:05:52.740> i'm

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
it's certainly under 10 minutes i'm

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.790 
it's certainly under 10 minutes i'm
trying<00:05:53.399> to<00:05:53.459> think<00:05:53.490> but<00:05:53.729> yeah<00:05:54.569> i<00:05:54.599> think<00:05:54.779> a<00:05:55.199> game

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
trying to think but yeah i think a game

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.859 
trying to think but yeah i think a game
should<00:05:56.159> be<00:05:56.189> as<00:05:56.490> long<00:05:56.519> as<00:05:56.969> it<00:05:57.089> should<00:05:57.329> be<00:05:57.479> which

00:05:57.859 --> 00:05:57.869 
should be as long as it should be which

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:00.379 
should be as long as it should be which
in<00:05:58.050> some<00:05:58.199> cases<00:05:58.259> is<00:05:58.769> four<00:05:59.009> hours<00:05:59.369> in<00:05:59.639> some

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
in some cases is four hours in some

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.829 
in some cases is four hours in some
cases<00:06:00.599> it's<00:06:00.899> 15<00:06:01.289> minutes<00:06:01.999> well<00:06:02.999> you<00:06:03.689> know

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:03.839 
cases it's 15 minutes well you know

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.409 
cases it's 15 minutes well you know
sometimes<00:06:04.499> games<00:06:04.769> can<00:06:05.309> be<00:06:05.339> too<00:06:05.639> long<00:06:05.879> that's

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
sometimes games can be too long that's

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.439 
sometimes games can be too long that's
certainly<00:06:06.749> true<00:06:07.159> where<00:06:08.159> games<00:06:09.059> kind<00:06:09.389> of

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
certainly true where games kind of

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:10.730 
certainly true where games kind of
overstay<00:06:09.809> their<00:06:09.839> welcome<00:06:10.019> after<00:06:10.529> a<00:06:10.559> certain

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
overstay their welcome after a certain

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.279 
overstay their welcome after a certain
point<00:06:10.979> but<00:06:11.309> really<00:06:12.029> don't<00:06:12.209> think<00:06:12.449> I<00:06:12.959> can't

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
point but really don't think I can't

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.339 
point but really don't think I can't
think<00:06:13.529> of<00:06:13.709> any<00:06:13.919> game<00:06:14.550> that<00:06:14.879> I<00:06:15.089> played<00:06:15.419> that<00:06:16.199> was

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
think of any game that I played that was

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.760 
think of any game that I played that was
short<00:06:16.649> and<00:06:16.889> I<00:06:16.979> went<00:06:17.189> life<00:06:17.339> man

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
short and I went life man

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.529 
short and I went life man
I<00:06:18.860> wish<00:06:19.160> that<00:06:19.370> was<00:06:19.520> longer<00:06:19.759> cuz<00:06:20.180> then<00:06:20.300> I<00:06:20.330> just

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
I wish that was longer cuz then I just

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.020 
I wish that was longer cuz then I just
play<00:06:20.690> it<00:06:20.720> again<00:06:21.020> if<00:06:21.349> I<00:06:21.500> still<00:06:22.160> have<00:06:22.669> you<00:06:23.000> know

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
play it again if I still have you know

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.540 
play it again if I still have you know
want<00:06:23.509> to<00:06:23.690> dig<00:06:23.870> deeper<00:06:24.199> into<00:06:24.229> it<00:06:24.470> so<00:06:24.740> you<00:06:25.400> know<00:06:25.520> I

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
want to dig deeper into it so you know I

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.040 
want to dig deeper into it so you know I
think<00:06:25.669> as<00:06:25.910> long<00:06:26.030> as<00:06:26.240> the<00:06:26.330> mechanics<00:06:26.720> and<00:06:26.870> theme

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
think as long as the mechanics and theme

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.689 
think as long as the mechanics and theme
and<00:06:27.259> everything<00:06:27.500> fits<00:06:27.710> together<00:06:27.860> that<00:06:28.610> you

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
and everything fits together that you

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.879 
and everything fits together that you
could<00:06:28.819> have<00:06:28.940> a<00:06:28.970> game<00:06:29.180> that<00:06:29.360> takes<00:06:29.539> 30<00:06:30.440> seconds

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
could have a game that takes 30 seconds

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.589 
could have a game that takes 30 seconds
and<00:06:30.979> I<00:06:31.069> bet<00:06:31.220> there<00:06:31.370> are<00:06:31.699> games<00:06:32.060> that<00:06:32.210> take<00:06:32.419> that

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
and I bet there are games that take that

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:33.839 
and I bet there are games that take that
long<00:06:32.720> and<00:06:32.870> i'm<00:06:32.960> just<00:06:33.110> not<00:06:33.199> thinking<00:06:33.530> of<00:06:33.620> them

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
long and i'm just not thinking of them

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.180 
long and i'm just not thinking of them
