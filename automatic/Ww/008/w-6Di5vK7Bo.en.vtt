00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
i hold down shift and press three and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.140 
i hold down shift and press three and
now<00:02:27.390> they're<00:02:27.540> added<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> group<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.150> so

going to do as much damage as they can
not<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.350> worry<00:02:40.530> about<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:41.010> crowing<00:02:41.400> them<00:02:43.640> now

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
not to worry about my crowing them now

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.360 
not to worry about my crowing them now
for<00:02:44.670> groups<00:02:45.360> four<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.050> five<00:02:46.380> that's<00:02:47.190> where

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
for groups four and five that's where

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.270 
for groups four and five that's where
I'm<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.640> want<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.910> put<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> ghost<00:02:48.690> or

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
I'm going to want to put like a ghost or

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.370 
I'm going to want to put like a ghost or
some<00:02:50.280> unit<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.209> really<00:02:51.480> want<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> micro<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
some unit that I really want a micro and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.130 
some unit that I really want a micro and
pay<00:02:53.220> attention<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.420> know<00:02:54.510> each<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:55.019> their

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
pay attention to you know each of their

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.750 
pay attention to you know each of their
actions<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.720> that's<00:02:59.209> basics<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:01.760> control

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
actions so that's basics of control

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.360 
actions so that's basics of control
grouping<00:03:03.560> as<00:03:04.560> far<00:03:04.739> as<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.890> command<00:03:05.190> center

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
grouping as far as the command center

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.500 
grouping as far as the command center
goes<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:07.370> give<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.400> its<00:03:08.700> own<00:03:08.820> number<00:03:09.060> so

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
goes you can give that its own number so

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.050 
goes you can give that its own number so
you<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.660> focus<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:11.010> or<00:03:11.130> build<00:03:11.459> STV's

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
you can focus in on it or build STV's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.449 
you can focus in on it or build STV's
but<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:13.140> know<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.680> backspace<00:03:14.220> button

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
but just know that the backspace button

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.300 
but just know that the backspace button
cycles<00:03:15.120> between<00:03:15.269> your<00:03:15.570> command<00:03:16.260> centers<00:03:16.620> so

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
cycles between your command centers so

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.680 
cycles between your command centers so
you<00:03:17.400> don't<00:03:17.549> really<00:03:17.700> need<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.090> hot<00:03:18.269> kid<00:03:18.510> if

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
you don't really need to hot kid if

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.900 
you don't really need to hot kid if
you're<00:03:18.840> tearing<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:20.340> you're<00:03:20.640> playing<00:03:20.820> a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
you're tearing but if you're playing a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.699 
you're tearing but if you're playing a
race<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:21.090> surd<00:03:21.540> where<00:03:21.840> there's<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.290> lot<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
race like surd where there's a lot of

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.120 
race like surd where there's a lot of
hatcheries<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.430> may<00:03:23.579> want<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.910> sign<00:03:24.840> some

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
hatcheries you may want to sign some

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.540 
hatcheries you may want to sign some
control<00:03:26.130> groups<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.670> those

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
control groups to those

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.340 
control groups to those
and<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.350> that's<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.800> that's<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:32.510> basics<00:03:33.050> of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
and so that's it that's the basics of

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.730 
and so that's it that's the basics of
using<00:03:33.770> control<00:03:34.460> groups
