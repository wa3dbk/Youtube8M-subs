00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
probably something to do with the lens

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.130 
probably something to do with the lens
connections<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.610> how<00:01:14.330> it's<00:01:14.539> interfacing

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
connections and how it's interfacing

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.529 
connections and how it's interfacing
with<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.350> body<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.280> if<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.429> take<00:01:16.580> your<00:01:16.910> lens

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
with the body so if you take your lens

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.630 
with the body so if you take your lens
off<00:01:17.780> your<00:01:17.929> camera<00:01:18.170> you're<00:01:19.039> going<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.369> see<00:01:19.520> that

gold<00:01:23.259> contact<00:01:24.259> bars<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:24.709> the<00:01:25.429> lens<00:01:25.610> itself

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
gold contact bars on the lens itself

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.690 
gold contact bars on the lens itself
this<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:27.770> what<00:01:27.920> Canon<00:01:28.220> is<00:01:28.280> going<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.459> tell<00:01:28.610> you
