they're<00:01:47.900> very<00:01:48.170> active<00:01:48.650> so<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.130> know<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:50.090> they

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
they're very active so I know that they

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.840 
they're very active so I know that they
have<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.630> pulse<00:01:50.900> of<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.230> gaming<00:01:51.710> community

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
have the pulse of the gaming community

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.000 
have the pulse of the gaming community
so<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:52.970> all<00:01:53.090> honesty<00:01:53.120> if<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:54.140> gears<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.770> war

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
so in all honesty if a gears of war

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.040 
so in all honesty if a gears of war
collection<00:01:55.250> does<00:01:55.940> come<00:01:56.300> out<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.690> think<00:01:56.960> it

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
collection does come out I think it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.770 
collection does come out I think it
would<00:01:57.140> either<00:01:57.290> launch<00:01:57.740> alongside<00:01:58.720> Gears<00:01:59.720> of

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
would either launch alongside Gears of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.140 
would either launch alongside Gears of
War<00:01:59.900> for<00:02:00.320> i'm<00:02:00.590> pretty<00:02:01.280> sure<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:01.670> not<00:02:01.760> going

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
War for i'm pretty sure it's not going

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.469 
War for i'm pretty sure it's not going
to<00:02:02.240> include<00:02:02.390> judgment<00:02:03.229> um<00:02:03.920> i<00:02:04.640> don't<00:02:05.120> i<00:02:05.360> don't

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
to include judgment um i don't i don't

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.060 
to include judgment um i don't i don't
really<00:02:05.810> care<00:02:06.110> if<00:02:06.140> they<00:02:06.380> did<00:02:06.590> or<00:02:06.620> did<00:02:07.010> not

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
really care if they did or did not

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.910 
really care if they did or did not
include<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.909> at<00:02:08.090> all<00:02:08.269> anyways<00:02:08.810> but<00:02:09.349> I<00:02:09.409> do<00:02:09.530> think

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
include it at all anyways but I do think

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.739 
include it at all anyways but I do think
if<00:02:10.159> it's<00:02:10.369> coming<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.939> soonest<00:02:11.329> we're<00:02:11.510> going

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:11.749 
if it's coming the soonest we're going

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.050 
if it's coming the soonest we're going
to<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:12.079> it<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.409> alongside<00:02:12.920> gears<00:02:13.819> of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
to get it is alongside gears of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.750 
to get it is alongside gears of
or<00:02:14.180> four<00:02:14.450> or<00:02:14.660> afterwards<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.860> afterwards<00:02:16.069> is

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
or four or afterwards and afterwards is

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.180 
or four or afterwards and afterwards is
probably<00:02:17.360> more<00:02:17.630> likely<00:02:17.989> they<00:02:18.739> can<00:02:18.950> bundle

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
probably more likely they can bundle

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.220 
probably more likely they can bundle
Gears<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.730> War<00:02:19.849> for<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.599> collection<00:02:21.110> and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
Gears of War for with the collection and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.710 
Gears of War for with the collection and
probably<00:02:21.709> our<00:02:22.040> call<00:02:22.459> for<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.760> higher<00:02:22.970> price<00:02:23.209> you

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
probably our call for a higher price you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.360 
probably our call for a higher price you
know<00:02:23.900> people<00:02:24.470> who've<00:02:24.680> never<00:02:24.860> played<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
know people who've never played the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.420 
know people who've never played the
gears<00:02:25.640> games<00:02:26.300> which<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.780> don't<00:02:26.840> know<00:02:27.290> why<00:02:27.500> he

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
gears games which I don't know why he

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.949 
gears games which I don't know why he
would<00:02:28.459> have<00:02:28.730> never<00:02:28.940> played<00:02:29.239> gears<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.780> war<00:02:29.930> i

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
would have never played gears of war i

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.559 
would have never played gears of war i
think<00:02:30.260> most<00:02:30.739> sony<00:02:31.099> fans<00:02:31.489> have<00:02:32.030> played<00:02:32.300> gears

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
think most sony fans have played gears

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.780 
think most sony fans have played gears
of<00:02:32.810> war<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.680> that's<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.069> second<00:02:34.550> thing<00:02:34.580> you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
of war so that's the second thing you

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.400 
of war so that's the second thing you
could<00:02:35.060> come<00:02:35.239> away<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.780> think<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.140> third

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
could come away with I think the third

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.890 
could come away with I think the third
thing<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.310> most<00:02:37.489> unlikely<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.540> guess

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
thing is the most unlikely but I guess

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500 
thing is the most unlikely but I guess
it's<00:02:39.140> possible<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:39.950> possible<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.910> they're

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
it's possible it is possible and they're

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.600 
it's possible it is possible and they're
just<00:02:41.780> fucking<00:02:42.019> with<00:02:42.319> us<00:02:42.349> they<00:02:43.010> want<00:02:43.250> us<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
just fucking with us they want us to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.670 
just fucking with us they want us to
talk<00:02:44.180> about<00:02:44.239> gears<00:02:44.720> award<00:02:45.050> they<00:02:45.230> want<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.530> get

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
talk about gears award they want to get

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.160 
talk about gears award they want to get
us<00:02:45.800> talking<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.430> maybe<00:02:47.090> they<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.420> uploaded

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
us talking and maybe they just uploaded

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.110 
us talking and maybe they just uploaded
it<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.470> show<00:02:49.100> what<00:02:49.340> happened<00:02:49.760> at<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:49.940> launch

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
it to show what happened at the launch

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.390 
it to show what happened at the launch
events<00:02:50.569> on<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.810> side<00:02:51.470> note<00:02:51.500> there<00:02:51.980> was<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.100> heavy

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
events on a side note there was a heavy

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.930 
events on a side note there was a heavy
dose<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:53.030> cliffy<00:02:53.690> B<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.440> trailer<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.160> it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
dose of cliffy B in that trailer and it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.340 
dose of cliffy B in that trailer and it
really<00:02:56.150> disappoints<00:02:56.810> me<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.959> he's<00:02:57.200> not

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
really disappoints me that he's not

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.190 
really disappoints me that he's not
working<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.860> Gears<00:02:58.100> of<00:02:58.160> War<00:02:58.250> for<00:02:58.610> um<00:02:59.200> he's

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
working on Gears of War for um he's

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.080 
working on Gears of War for um he's
probably<00:03:00.560> one<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.069> my<00:03:01.160> favorite<00:03:01.549> developers

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
probably one of my favorite developers

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.320 
probably one of my favorite developers
I'm<00:03:02.269> following<00:03:02.840> his<00:03:03.019> new<00:03:03.230> project<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.980> PC<00:03:04.519> it

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
I'm following his new project on PC it

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.360 
I'm following his new project on PC it
might<00:03:05.750> at<00:03:05.989> some<00:03:06.230> point<00:03:06.530> come<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.799> consoles<00:03:07.220> I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
might at some point come to consoles I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.430 
might at some point come to consoles I
think<00:03:07.580> he<00:03:07.670> said<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.630> is<00:03:08.780> Project<00:03:09.290> Blue

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
think he said and that is Project Blue

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.410 
think he said and that is Project Blue
Streak<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.459> might<00:03:10.849> actually<00:03:11.060> make<00:03:11.360> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
Streak so I might actually make a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.150 
Streak so I might actually make a
separate<00:03:11.900> video<00:03:12.049> on<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.380> all<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.890> info

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
separate video on that all the info

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.400 
separate video on that all the info
that's<00:03:13.370> come<00:03:13.549> out<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.819> that<00:03:14.000> because<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:15.230> is

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
that's come out on that because that is

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.900 
that's come out on that because that is
something<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.769> excites<00:03:16.160> me<00:03:16.430> anything

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
something that excites me anything

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.020 
something that excites me anything
