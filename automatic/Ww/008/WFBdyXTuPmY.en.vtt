00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:15.240
 Interesting thing jr In the accident that the power transmission vehicle collided with the vehicle for work and derailed overturn in the yard of Kawasaki Station 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:20.990
 Transportation Safety Board of the country is seen as a vehicle for work before that train travel is completed has entered into the line 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:27.970
 We investigate the situation at that time, focusing on the safety management system. 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.970
 Due to the impact of this accident, jr Keihin Tohoku Line has suspended operation on some sections 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:39.040
 I head for Tokyo in the morning at jr Kawasaki Station this morning. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:47.400
 A remodeled train was running on the northbound line of the Keihin Tohoku Line 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:54.060
 Collide with the vehicle for the work to transport the material 1 both eyes and second car was overturned battle 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.990
 In this accident, the driver of the power transmission car and two people of the conductor have light injuries to their heads etc. 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.990
 It means that 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.900
 Hand-made dyeing students at Kawasaki Station on the mobile line 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.820
 It is very difficult for the customer 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.480
 Hey reported 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.530
 Also looking for 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.530
 On the other hand I think it's a success 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.930
 Recovery does not take 3 hours to imagine 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.220
 According to jr East Japan 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 I will start work from 1:13 am when the train service is over 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.020
 Derailed transmission vehicles pass through the site 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.020
 Is that was the last train 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:43.370
 Normally, the site manager is supposed to start work after confirming the passing of the train. 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:45.690
 This time the vehicle for work entered the track without waiting for the passage of the power transmission vehicle and an accident occurred 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:53.210
 is 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.210
 For this reason, the Transportation Safety Commission investigates the situation at that time, focusing on the safety management system. 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:04.890
 According to jr East Japan, the Keihin Tohoku Line is between Tokyo's Takara and Yokohama's Tsurumi under the influence of this accident. 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.890
 I have stopped driving at 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:16.220
 I will go to Shinjuku from now on that day and I will go to Shinjuku but now 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.220
 By no difference and I have surprised I think that if Re should somehow 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.440
 The Keihin Tohoku Line is expected to take considerable time to restore all lines 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:36.500
 On the other hand, the Tokaido Line with parallel tracks near the site is almost as usual 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.500
 Nambu Line is driving as usual
