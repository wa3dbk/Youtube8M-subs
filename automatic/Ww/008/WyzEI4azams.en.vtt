you just need to solve a an algebraic
problem<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:18.140> just<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.680> matter<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.070> combining

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
problem it's just a matter of combining

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.939 
problem it's just a matter of combining

you'll want to be familiar with how to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.560 
you'll want to be familiar with how to
do<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.800> not<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.849> problems<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.480> are

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
do that not just for problems that are

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.330 
do that not just for problems that are
already<00:00:27.750> set<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:28.920> problems

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
already set up for you but for problems

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.330 
already set up for you but for problems
that<00:00:29.580> you'll<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.689> set<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> result

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that you'll have to set up as a result

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.670 
that you'll have to set up as a result
of<00:00:32.489> word<00:00:32.669> problems<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.390> you'll<00:00:34.200> need<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.559> know

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
of word problems so you'll need to know

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.100 
of word problems so you'll need to know
how<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> solve<00:00:35.250> these<00:00:35.630> basic<00:00:36.630> algebraic

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
how to solve these basic algebraic

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.540 
how to solve these basic algebraic
problems<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.710> let's<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:37.980> ahead<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> start

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
problems so let's go ahead and start

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.250 
problems so let's go ahead and start
with<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.820> one

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
with this one

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.600 
with this one
solving<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.379> problem<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.950> no<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.280> than<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
solving this problem is no more than a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.170 
solving this problem is no more than a
matter<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.239> combining<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.930> terms<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
matter of just combining like terms and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.930 
matter of just combining like terms and
so<00:00:45.180> let's<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.510> ahead<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.950> Y

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
so let's go ahead and do that we have Y

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.670 
so let's go ahead and do that we have Y
minus<00:00:48.390> 2<00:00:48.660> plus<00:00:49.050> 3y<00:00:49.770> equals<00:00:49.800> 10<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:51.780> need<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.050> get

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
minus 2 plus 3y equals 10 we need to get

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.369 
minus 2 plus 3y equals 10 we need to get
these<00:00:52.980> terms<00:00:53.550> also<00:00:53.940> by<00:00:54.360> themselves<00:00:55.050> don't<00:00:55.199> we

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
these terms also by themselves don't we

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.650 
these terms also by themselves don't we
so<00:00:55.710> let's<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.340> ahead<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.469> by<00:00:59.660> adding

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so let's go ahead and do that by adding

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.229 
so let's go ahead and do that by adding
the<00:01:01.109> 2<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.859> side<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.030> eliminate

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the 2 to this side so we can eliminate

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.070 
the 2 to this side so we can eliminate
it<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.409> left<00:01:04.650> side<00:01:05.180> or<00:01:06.180> read<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.810> right

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it from the left side or read that right

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
it from the left side or read that right
this<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.640> V<00:01:08.640> y<00:01:08.850> equals<00:01:09.510> 10<00:01:10.439> okay<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> we're

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this is V y equals 10 okay and we're

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.780 
this is V y equals 10 okay and we're
going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> add<00:01:12.590> since<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.740> added<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.130> 2<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
going to add since we added the 2 to the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.789 
going to add since we added the 2 to the
left<00:01:14.909> side<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.420> course<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.200> need<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> do

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
left side of course we just need to do

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.520 
left side of course we just need to do
the<00:01:16.979> same<00:01:17.220> thing<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.630> side<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the same thing to the right side and we

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.890 
the same thing to the right side and we
are<00:01:19.830> left<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.320> y<00:01:22.320> plus<00:01:22.400> 3y<00:01:23.400> which<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.509> equal

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
are left with y plus 3y which is equal

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.700 
are left with y plus 3y which is equal
to<00:01:24.930> 12<00:01:26.270> we're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> combine<00:01:27.780> our<00:01:28.439> like

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to 12 we're going to combine our like

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
to 12 we're going to combine our like
terms<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.729> 3y<00:01:30.240> plus<00:01:31.310> y<00:01:32.310> which<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
terms so we get 3y plus y which of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.630 
terms so we get 3y plus y which of
course<00:01:33.299> gives<00:01:33.840> us<00:01:34.049> 4y<00:01:35.210> equals<00:01:36.210> 12<00:01:37.610> divided<00:01:38.610> by

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
course gives us 4y equals 12 divided by

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
course gives us 4y equals 12 divided by
4<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.509> order<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:41.670> Y<00:01:41.939> by<00:01:42.150> itself<00:01:42.229> just

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
4 in order to get the Y by itself just

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.289 
4 in order to get the Y by itself just
in<00:01:44.220> case<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.549> may<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.700> forgotten<00:01:44.850> why<00:01:45.240> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
in case you may have forgotten why this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
in case you may have forgotten why this
works<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.899> course<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:50.070> same

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
works of course when you have the same

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
works of course when you have the same
number<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> numerator<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
number in the numerator as you do the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.690 
number in the numerator as you do the
denominator<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.950> cancel<00:01:53.340> each<00:01:53.430> other<00:01:53.579> out

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
denominator they cancel each other out

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700 
denominator they cancel each other out
don't<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:54.810> become<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> 1<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
don't they because they become a 1 and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.700 
don't they because they become a 1 and
so<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.399> Y<00:01:56.909> times<00:01:57.180> 1<00:01:57.479> which<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.750> y<00:01:58.049> so

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
so now we have Y times 1 which is y so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.330 
so now we have Y times 1 which is y so
that's<00:01:58.890> why<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> works<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.530> 12<00:02:01.530> divided<00:02:02.250> by

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that's why that works and 12 divided by

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's why that works and 12 divided by
4<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.909> course<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.619> 3<00:02:04.619> which<00:02:05.280> gives<00:02:05.579> us<00:02:05.759> an

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
4 of course is 3 which gives us an

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.970 
4 of course is 3 which gives us an
answer<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.540> why

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
answer of why

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.850 
answer of why
is<00:02:08.130> equal<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> three
