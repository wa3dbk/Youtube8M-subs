make the game's replay value a little

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.300 
make the game's replay value a little
bit<00:04:33.900> higher<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.620> it's<00:04:34.860> different<00:04:35.190> money

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310

continuing<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.060> see<00:04:36.240> how<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:36.449> can<00:04:36.660> finish<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
continuing and see how I can finish the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.310 
continuing and see how I can finish the
stage<00:04:37.289> I<00:04:38.240> would<00:04:39.240> have<00:04:39.360> liked<00:04:39.539> state-o<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.050> add

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
stage I would have liked state-o to add

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.870 
stage I would have liked state-o to add
a<00:04:40.349> multiplayer<00:04:40.919> feature<00:04:41.220> where<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.580> can<00:04:41.610> play

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
a multiplayer feature where you can play

co-op I play your players online two
players<00:04:44.550> at<00:04:44.699> one<00:04:44.789> time<00:04:45.000> playing<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.479> think<00:04:45.539> that

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
players at one time playing I think that

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.290 
players at one time playing I think that
would<00:04:45.840> have<00:04:45.930> been<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> really<00:04:46.229> cool<00:04:46.409> feature

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
would have been a really cool feature

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.100 
would have been a really cool feature
unfortunately<00:04:48.300> that's<00:04:48.389> not<00:04:48.509> in<00:04:48.720> this<00:04:48.840> game

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110

unfortunately that's not in this game
one<00:04:49.949> thing<00:04:50.099> I<00:04:50.190> do<00:04:50.400> like<00:04:50.639> though<00:04:50.849> about<00:04:51.030> this

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
one thing I do like though about this

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.600 
one thing I do like though about this
game<00:04:51.419> is<00:04:51.599> that<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.960> toes<00:04:52.110> used<00:04:52.349> full<00:04:52.710> screen<00:04:53.130> and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
game is that a toes used full screen and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.820 
game is that a toes used full screen and
that<00:04:54.449> ever<00:04:54.720> there's<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:54.990> lot<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.320> action<00:04:55.500> going

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
that ever there's a lot of action going

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.159
