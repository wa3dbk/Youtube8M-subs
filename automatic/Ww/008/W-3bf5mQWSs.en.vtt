00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.070
 hello everyone I'm in the bio map 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720
 the injury to 37 warfare on ps3 I'm 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.090
 here on the map for a little spot that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 is behind a kind of small 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.930
 barrier here a kind of block is in 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.030
 do you go see I retreat like that 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.649
 slightly going to the left I 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 skip the games I'm trying to sail from 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.190
 hold onto that edge while running 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.329
 once my character is stable 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.219
 it allows me to monitor anyway 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.079
 this position see this angle of view 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.640
 in the play area so that's enough 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.579
 nice there is another one is limit 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.690
 besides out of map behind and so 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.370
 there is another spot too that I'm going 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.749
 also show you limit out of maps and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.179
 then if I shift myself a little more towards the 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.859
 grid is well there actually I you 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.600
 protects a little bit more it allows me to 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.219
 control this angle and why 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.989
 not also control the enemies to 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.940
 through the grid here which is very 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.190
 discreet so it can be not basin 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 according to which mode you play the game 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.700
 So here it is in the organic label 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.260
 see be careful not fall I'm going 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 also show you another spot that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 then exists here on the biolap map 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.860
 always i'm going to show you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.430
 the location on the of where I am 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.410
 on the map 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.690
 so just go up where I am 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.280
 on this block then I go on on 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.780
 the pillar and then I let myself 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.330
 fall down on the wall 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.840
 snowy rocky that's here I 'll be 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.760
 limitations 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.530
 out of maps and offered a good spot 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.630
 of firing so I will cut for you 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 show the realization directly from the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.040
 seal go to win a little time 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 so hop to see me here I am again double 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.760
 option on the pillar I'm shifting to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 left and then I have more than me 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.900
 drop the jma croupit I leave 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.000
 my character stabilize he moves 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.770
 the more I can take out my weapon 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.240
 and here it is so offers effectively 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 the ability to monitor this area 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.040
 and that offers a good shooting spot 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.140
 here again realized here in the map 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 biolab limit to october beats by the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.190
 rigor and so it's in the map 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.220
 biolab expects this warfare on ps3 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.580
 and so that's for these two little spots 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.580
 friendly 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.329
 to daddy hen
