00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it will actually reach your muscle

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.050 
it will actually reach your muscle
because<00:01:52.290> it'll<00:01:52.560> break<00:01:52.770> into<00:01:53.100> glucose<00:01:53.520> through

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
because it'll break into glucose through

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.410 
because it'll break into glucose through
a<00:01:54.149> process<00:01:54.570> known<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.990> glyco<00:01:55.500> Genesis<00:01:56.040> if

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
a process known as glyco Genesis if

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.609 
a process known as glyco Genesis if
glucose<00:01:57.420> levels<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> bloodstream<00:01:58.290> are

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
glucose levels in the bloodstream are

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.590 
glucose levels in the bloodstream are
too<00:01:58.860> low<00:01:59.040> something<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.820> normally<00:02:00.240> happens

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
too low something that normally happens

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
too low something that normally happens
after<00:02:00.899> training<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.920> protein<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.549> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
after training the protein that you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.520 
after training the protein that you
ingest<00:02:03.119> will<00:02:03.450> turn<00:02:03.689> into<00:02:03.899> blood<00:02:04.140> sugar

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
ingest will turn into blood sugar

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.859 
ingest will turn into blood sugar
therefore<00:02:05.399> what's<00:02:05.909> more<00:02:06.210> effective<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
therefore what's more effective is to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.080 
therefore what's more effective is to
ingest<00:02:07.439> protein<00:02:07.649> together<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> high

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
ingest protein together with a high
