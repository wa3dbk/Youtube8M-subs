anyway what we're going to do is do vary
this<00:00:28.050> different<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> sense<00:00:29.070> using<00:00:29.760> this

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
this different to the sense using this

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
this different to the sense using this
machine<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.929> hit<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> shoulders<00:00:31.590> from

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
machine to hit the shoulders from

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
machine to hit the shoulders from
different<00:00:32.160> angles<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
different angles so it's kind of like a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.950 
different angles so it's kind of like a
circuit<00:00:34.860> shoulder<00:00:35.610> press<00:00:35.790> workout<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
circuit shoulder press workout so the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
circuit shoulder press workout so the
first<00:00:37.170> exercise<00:00:37.350> I'm<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
first exercise I'm going to do is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.090 
first exercise I'm going to do is
shoulder<00:00:39.600> press<00:00:39.809> using<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.410> front<00:00:40.680> handles

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
shoulder press using the front handles

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
shoulder press using the front handles
and<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.550> no<00:00:41.700> place<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.270> emphasis

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and this is no place more the emphasis

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:56.790 
and this is no place more the emphasis
on<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> front<00:00:43.200> delt

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.319 

all<00:00:57.800> right<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:58.160> after<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:58.579> can<00:00:58.760> take<00:00:59.030> you

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
all right so after that can take you

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.360 
all right so after that can take you
know<00:00:59.420> 30<00:00:59.690> seconds<00:01:00.079> rest<00:01:00.200> or<00:01:00.380> whatever<00:01:00.650> now

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
know 30 seconds rest or whatever now

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.940 
know 30 seconds rest or whatever now
we're<00:01:01.520> going<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.700> do<00:01:01.880> the<00:01:02.720> wider<00:01:03.020> grip<00:01:03.410> using

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
we're going to do the wider grip using

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.710 
we're going to do the wider grip using
the<00:01:04.070> side<00:01:04.280> handles<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.000> this<00:01:05.360> is<00:01:05.479> going<00:01:05.630> to

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
the side handles and this is going to

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:21.660 
the side handles and this is going to
work<00:01:05.750> form<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.680> side<00:01:07.040> delt

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.770 

and<00:01:22.670> now<00:01:22.760> I'm<00:01:22.820> going<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.030> turn<00:01:23.180> around<00:01:23.270> and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
and now I'm going to turn around and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.020 
and now I'm going to turn around and
face<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.200> opposite<00:01:24.710> way<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.100> machine<00:01:25.400> and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
face the opposite way on the machine and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.940 
face the opposite way on the machine and
this<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.510> where<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:27.080> likes<00:01:27.260> they<00:01:27.410> may<00:01:27.620> or<00:01:27.830> may

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
this is where it likes they may or may

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.470 
this is where it likes they may or may
not<00:01:28.130> work<00:01:28.340> depending<00:01:28.610> on<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.030> machine<00:01:29.180> you're

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
not work depending on the machine you're

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.810 
not work depending on the machine you're
using<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:31.070> better<00:01:31.220> place<00:01:31.460> more<00:01:31.730> the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
using but this is better place more the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.490 
using but this is better place more the
stress<00:01:32.090> towards<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.630> back<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.080> shoulders

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
stress towards the back of the shoulders

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:52.700 
stress towards the back of the shoulders
just<00:01:33.800> due<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.730> position<00:01:35.180> where<00:01:35.210> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.330 

all<00:01:53.190> right<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.750> last<00:01:55.229> variation<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:56.100> kind

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
all right so that last variation is kind

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.480 
all right so that last variation is kind
of<00:01:56.400> like<00:01:57.320> behind<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.530> neck<00:01:58.680> Chris<00:01:58.950> except

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
of like behind the neck Chris except

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.300 
of like behind the neck Chris except
it's<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.729> quite<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.210> extreme<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.619> give<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it's not quite as extreme so give that a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.730 
it's not quite as extreme so give that a
try<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.940> your<00:02:03.060> next<00:02:03.210> shoulder<00:02:03.540> workout<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.590> you

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
try in your next shoulder workout if you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.990 
try in your next shoulder workout if you
have<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.070> type<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> machine<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.790> gym

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
have this type of machine at your gym

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.510 
have this type of machine at your gym
because<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.630> say<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> great<00:02:07.170> way<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.590> hit

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
because they say it's a great way to hit

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.859 
because they say it's a great way to hit
the<00:02:08.640> shoulders<00:02:09.060> from<00:02:09.179> different<00:02:09.569> angles

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the shoulders from different angles

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.199 
the shoulders from different angles
really<00:02:10.289> pump<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> delts<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.340> go<00:02:12.000> through

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
really pump up the delts and go through

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.479 
really pump up the delts and go through
that<00:02:12.330> circuit<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> few<00:02:12.930> times<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.650> trust<00:02:14.340> me

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
that circuit a few times and trust me

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.979 
that circuit a few times and trust me
your<00:02:15.060> shoulders<00:02:15.450> are<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.690> be<00:02:15.780> feeling
