hundred dollars but it's well worth it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.429

great<00:01:10.409> foundation<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:12.420> looked<00:01:12.600> great<00:01:13.409> on

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
great foundation and it looked great on

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.770 
great foundation and it looked great on
the<00:01:13.740> model<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.150> items<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the model so this is not items that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.859 
the model so this is not items that
close<00:01:22.040> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
close that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.169 
close that
and<00:01:25.109> this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:27.149> beautiful<00:01:28.100> level<00:01:29.179> courses

without folders it is quite heavy

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.130 
without folders it is quite heavy
because<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.700> way<00:01:36.060> centric<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.929> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because this is not a way centric it is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.149 
because this is not a way centric it is
an<00:01:37.409> actual<00:01:37.939> bone<00:01:38.939> steel<00:01:39.840> bone<00:01:40.140> corset<00:01:40.920> so
