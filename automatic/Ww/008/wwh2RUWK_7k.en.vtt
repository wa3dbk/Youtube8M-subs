00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
I was 12 but it's still awesome it's
gonna<00:01:38.430> fill<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> barrel<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.270> three<00:01:39.540> seconds

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.350 

and<00:01:43.600> then<00:01:43.720> I'm<00:01:43.780> gonna<00:01:43.900> cap<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.320> end

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.070 

no<00:01:49.220> screws<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:51.530> all<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:53.180> now<00:01:54.180> you're<00:01:54.990> going

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
no screws on all right now you're going

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.500 
no screws on all right now you're going
to<00:01:55.170> hold<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.380> barrel<00:01:55.820> plate<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.150> and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
to hold the barrel plate right here and

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.870 
to hold the barrel plate right here and
then<00:01:58.200> once<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> put<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.670> you're<00:01:59.790> gonna

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
then once you put it so you're gonna

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.150 
then once you put it so you're gonna
kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> try<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.420> solve<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> ball<00:02:01.070> all<00:02:02.070> I'm

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
kind of try and solve the ball all I'm

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.770 
kind of try and solve the ball all I'm
going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.550> twist<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.940> ignition<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
going to do is twist the ignition and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.930 
going to do is twist the ignition and
there<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.410> going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> go

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.430 

so<00:02:11.450> that's<00:02:11.600> about<00:02:11.720> as<00:02:11.960> far<00:02:12.110> as<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.350> usually

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
so that's about as far as it usually

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.540 
so that's about as far as it usually
goes<00:02:12.740> I've<00:02:12.920> measured<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.370> out<00:02:13.540> that's<00:02:14.540> about

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
goes I've measured that out that's about

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.190 
goes I've measured that out that's about
165<00:02:16.550> feet<00:02:16.880> but<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.570> got<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> remember<00:02:17.930> I've

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
165 feet but you got to remember I've

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.470 
165 feet but you got to remember I've
got<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.500> at<00:02:18.620> about<00:02:18.860> an<00:02:18.980> 80<00:02:19.130> degree<00:02:19.220> angle<00:02:19.880> I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
got it at about an 80 degree angle I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.880 
got it at about an 80 degree angle I
live<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.020> neighborhood<00:02:21.170> as<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.680> see

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
live in a neighborhood as you can see

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.710 
live in a neighborhood as you can see
and<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.220> I'm<00:02:22.760> not<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> be<00:02:23.150> firing<00:02:23.390> at<00:02:23.660> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and so I'm not going to be firing at the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.150 
and so I'm not going to be firing at the
street<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.080> anything<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.740> want<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.070> go

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
street at anything and I want it to go

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.410 
street at anything and I want it to go
through<00:02:25.310> anyone's<00:02:25.580> windows<00:02:25.880> or<00:02:26.120> certainly

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
through anyone's windows or certainly

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.990 
through anyone's windows or certainly
not<00:02:26.630> hit<00:02:26.810> somebody<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.680> fired<00:02:28.550> straight<00:02:28.850> up

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
not hit somebody so I fired straight up

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.520 
not hit somebody so I fired straight up
in<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.180> air<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.990> said<00:02:30.020> almost

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
in the air like that like I said almost

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.710 
in the air like that like I said almost
90<00:02:30.800> degrees<00:02:30.830> 80<00:02:31.310> degrees<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.850> still<00:02:32.510> went

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
90 degrees 80 degrees and still went

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.550 
90 degrees 80 degrees and still went
about<00:02:33.010> 165<00:02:34.010> feet<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.990> tell<00:02:36.170> get<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.380> hell

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
about 165 feet you can tell get a hell

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.610 
about 165 feet you can tell get a hell
of<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.680> report<00:02:37.070> on<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.870> really<00:02:39.260> got<00:02:39.410> louder

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
of a report on it that really got louder

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.140 
of a report on it that really got louder
once<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:39.980> put<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.190> tennis<00:02:40.430> ball<00:02:40.610> attachment<00:02:41.060> on

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
once I put the tennis ball attachment on

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.730 
once I put the tennis ball attachment on
I<00:02:41.360> assumed<00:02:41.960> because<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.380> made<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
I assumed because that made the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.890 
I assumed because that made the
compressed<00:02:43.130> barrel<00:02:43.550> from<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.540> here

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
compressed barrel from here to here

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.280 
compressed barrel from here to here
instead<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.740> just<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.130> part<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.660> think

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
instead of just this part and so I think

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.690 
instead of just this part and so I think
just<00:02:48.500> by<00:02:48.650> virtue<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:49.040> having<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.370> larger

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
just by virtue of having a larger

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.080 
just by virtue of having a larger
chamber<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.570> uh<00:02:50.840> made<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.740> louder<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.970> is

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
chamber it's uh made a louder so it is

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.180 
chamber it's uh made a louder so it is
awesome<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:54.050> saw<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.710> flick<00:02:55.070> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
awesome you saw it you know flick the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.830 
awesome you saw it you know flick the
second<00:02:55.880> time<00:02:56.030> probably<00:02:56.480> think<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.720> good

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
second time probably think it a good

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.790 
second time probably think it a good
spark<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.230> first<00:02:57.410> time

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
spark the first time

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.950 
spark the first time
works<00:02:58.280> every<00:02:58.430> time<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.970> highly<00:02:59.480> recommend<00:02:59.900> the
