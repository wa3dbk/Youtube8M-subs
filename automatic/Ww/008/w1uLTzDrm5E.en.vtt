00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.510
 the weather we are to see the feints and that they have interpreted 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.239
 or this year without losing much time 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.269
 then first of all 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.269

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.239
 which is done but obviously 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.070
 dribbling then holding this down 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.129
 ie &amp; lt and then rd repeatedly then you remember the world tour gets sheva

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.170
 as the world tour prof later on 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
