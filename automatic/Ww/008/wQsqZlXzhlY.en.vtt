00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
do this like I don't even know but I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
do this like I don't even know but I
figured<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> guys<00:00:35.969> never<00:00:36.210> get<00:00:36.420> bored<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.809> hair

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
figured you guys never get bored of hair

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.080 
figured you guys never get bored of hair
tutorials<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.010> guess<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.399> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.850> curled

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
tutorials and I guess I kind of curled

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.490 
tutorials and I guess I kind of curled
it<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.450> bit<00:00:39.629> different<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.110> put<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.379> up

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it a little bit different I put it up

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.229 
it a little bit different I put it up
different<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.340> never<00:00:41.610> part<00:00:41.879> my<00:00:41.969> hair<00:00:42.120> in

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
different and I never part my hair in

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
different and I never part my hair in
the<00:00:42.300> middle<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.079> guess<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.770> kind<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the middle so I guess this is kind of a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
the middle so I guess this is kind of a
changeup<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.329> doing<00:00:45.539> my<00:00:45.629> hair

to<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.360> hair<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:49.140> parting<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> down<00:00:49.649> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
going to take a Conair one-inch curling

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.660 
going to take a Conair one-inch curling
iron<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.900> begin<00:01:40.380> curling<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.860> hair<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.520> this

iron and begin curling my hair now this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.710 
iron and begin curling my hair now this
is<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> part<00:01:42.150> where<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.360> gets<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> little

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
is the part where it gets a little

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
is the part where it gets a little
confusing<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.860> totally<00:01:44.250> random

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
confusing because I'm totally random

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.490 
confusing because I'm totally random
when<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.180> curling<00:01:45.540> my<00:01:45.600> hair<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.049> sometimes

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
when I'm curling my hair so sometimes

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.499 
when I'm curling my hair so sometimes
I'll<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.159> clamp<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.180> away<00:01:48.360> from

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
I'll use the clamp and use it away from

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
I'll use the clamp and use it away from
my<00:01:48.630> face<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.200> sometimes<00:01:49.619> I'll<00:01:49.770> wrap<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
my face and then sometimes I'll wrap it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
my face and then sometimes I'll wrap it
around<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.520> barrel<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.149> reason<00:01:51.479> why<00:01:51.630> I'm

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
around the barrel the reason why I'm

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.389 
around the barrel the reason why I'm
doing<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.439> none<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> curls

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
doing this is because none of the curls

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.499 
doing this is because none of the curls
are<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> match<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
are going to match and it's going to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
are going to match and it's going to
look<00:01:54.600> very<00:01:54.659> messy<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.979> very<00:01:56.130> put

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
look very messy and not very put

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
first one I use the clamp and did it

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.490 
first one I use the clamp and did it
away<00:02:02.579> from<00:02:02.790> my<00:02:02.909> face<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:03.479> I'm<00:02:03.630> keeping

would<00:02:34.470> obviously<00:02:34.800> vary<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.910> your<00:02:36.060> hair<00:02:36.240> type

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
would obviously vary with your hair type

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.250 
would obviously vary with your hair type
also<00:02:38.070> as<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.580> see<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.910> am<00:02:39.330> taking<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
also as you can see I am taking the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.140 
also as you can see I am taking the
clamp<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.010> smoothing<00:02:41.430> down<00:02:41.580> my<00:02:41.730> hair<00:02:41.910> first

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
clamp and smoothing down my hair first

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
clamp and smoothing down my hair first
before<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.810> curl<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.770> totally

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
before I curl now this is totally

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.920 
before I curl now this is totally
optional<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.940> all<00:02:45.120> depends<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.600> your<00:02:45.720> hair

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
optional it all depends on your hair

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.140 
optional it all depends on your hair
type<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.740> my<00:02:46.950> hair<00:02:47.160> type<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.550> very<00:02:47.730> easy<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
type so my hair type is very easy to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.729 
type so my hair type is very easy to
curl<00:02:48.420> hair<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.900> that's<00:02:48.989> why<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.410> smooth

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
curl hair so that's why I like to smooth

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.650 
curl hair so that's why I like to smooth
it<00:02:49.800> down<00:02:49.980> first<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.489> gives<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.000> kind<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.570> a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
it down first it just gives it kind of a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.570 
it down first it just gives it kind of a
nice<00:02:51.840> softer<00:02:52.380> look<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.070> keeps<00:02:53.220> my<00:02:53.400> hair

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
nice softer look to it and keeps my hair

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.220 
nice softer look to it and keeps my hair
a<00:02:53.610> little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.000> tamed<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.140> are

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
a little bit more tamed but if you are

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.140 
a little bit more tamed but if you are
someone<00:02:55.590> who<00:02:55.620> has<00:02:55.950> kind<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.489> straight<00:02:57.120> hair

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
someone who has kind of straight hair

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.570 
someone who has kind of straight hair
naturally<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:57.989> naturally<00:02:58.440> softer<00:02:59.070> hair<00:02:59.340> I

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
naturally or naturally softer hair I

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.240 
naturally or naturally softer hair I
would<00:02:59.970> recommend<00:03:00.750> not<00:03:01.380> doing<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.130> just

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
would recommend not doing this and just

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.680 
would recommend not doing this and just
curling<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:02.850> away<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.120> if<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.450> have

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
curling it right away but if you have

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.020 
curling it right away but if you have
easy<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.680> curl<00:03:04.860> hair<00:03:05.070> or<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.400> kind<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.820> very

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
easy to curl hair or just kind of very

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.760 
easy to curl hair or just kind of very
curly<00:03:06.270> hair<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.600> want<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.930> smooth<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.230> smooth

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
curly hair and want to smooth it smooth

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.680 
curly hair and want to smooth it smooth
it<00:03:07.890> down<00:03:07.920> first<00:03:08.370> I'd<00:03:08.850> recommend<00:03:09.330> doing<00:03:09.390> what

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
it down first I'd recommend doing what

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.960 
it down first I'd recommend doing what
I'm<00:03:09.810> doing<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.590> again<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.310> thinner

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
I'm doing but again if you have thinner

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.760 
I'm doing but again if you have thinner
hair<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.600> would<00:03:12.690> recommend<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.230> curling<00:03:13.680> it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
hair I would recommend just curling it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.140 
hair I would recommend just curling it
first<00:03:13.980> because<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> curls<00:03:14.670> will<00:03:14.820> hold<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
first because the curls will hold a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.940 
first because the curls will hold a
little<00:03:15.330> bit<00:03:15.420> better

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.770 

now<00:03:19.520> when<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.790> get<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.150> front<00:03:20.390> sections

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
now when you get to the front sections

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.300 
now when you get to the front sections
of<00:03:20.900> your<00:03:20.930> hair<00:03:21.200> make<00:03:21.440> sure<00:03:21.470> these<00:03:21.830> are<00:03:22.069> going

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
of your hair make sure these are going

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.280 
of your hair make sure these are going
away<00:03:22.430> from<00:03:22.580> your<00:03:22.819> face<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.080> frames

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
away from your face just so it frames

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.630 
away from your face just so it frames
your<00:03:24.410> face<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.709> little<00:03:24.950> bit<00:03:25.069> better<00:03:25.370> if<00:03:25.520> the

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
your face a little bit better if the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.070 
your face a little bit better if the
curls<00:03:25.880> are<00:03:26.000> going<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.330> towards<00:03:26.569> your<00:03:26.720> face<00:03:26.900> it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
curls are going in towards your face it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.140 
curls are going in towards your face it
might<00:03:27.230> not<00:03:27.380> look<00:03:27.530> as<00:03:27.709> nice<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.550> just<00:03:29.000> keep<00:03:29.120> that

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
might not look as nice so just keep that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.910 
might not look as nice so just keep that
in<00:03:29.390> mind<00:03:29.540> when<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.810> get<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.709> front

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
in mind when you get to the front

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.770 
in mind when you get to the front
sections<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.550> your<00:03:31.580> hair<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.209> by<00:03:32.360> your<00:03:32.540> face

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
sections of your hair like by your face

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.590 
sections of your hair like by your face
I<00:03:33.080> would<00:03:33.140> recommend<00:03:33.530> curling<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:33.950> away<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:35.450> now

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
I would recommend curling it away so now

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.240 
I would recommend curling it away so now
once<00:03:35.810> you're<00:03:35.959> done<00:03:36.170> curling<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.650> section<00:03:37.130> of

once you're done curling that section of

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.130 
once you're done curling that section of
your<00:03:37.400> hair<00:03:37.580> just<00:03:37.850> lightly<00:03:38.510> spray<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.020> with
