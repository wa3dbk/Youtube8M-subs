00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and it also comes in the white now from

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
and it also comes in the white now from
a<00:00:38.820> fitment<00:00:39.360> standpoint<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:39.930> quickly

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
a fitment standpoint really quickly

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
a fitment standpoint really quickly
before<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.739> dive<00:00:40.920> into<00:00:41.129> some<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> nuance

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
before we dive into some of the nuance

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.790 
before we dive into some of the nuance
here<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.390> found<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> fit<00:00:43.290> pretty

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
here we found that it fit pretty

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.470 
here we found that it fit pretty
reasonably<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> American<00:00:44.940> market<00:00:45.059> even

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
reasonably for the American market even

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.110 
reasonably for the American market even
though<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.230> speed<00:00:46.530> ease<00:00:46.680> our<00:00:46.879> European<00:00:47.879> boots

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
though the speed ease our European boots

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
though the speed ease our European boots
so<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> 45<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.500> run<00:00:49.680> about<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.920> ten<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
so the 45 is gonna run about a ten and a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
so the 45 is gonna run about a ten and a
half<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.940> me<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.270> about<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> half-size

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
half to me that's about a half-size

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709 
half to me that's about a half-size
ahead<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> European<00:00:53.430> size<00:00:53.640> curve<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.449> keep

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
ahead of the European size curve so keep

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.880 
ahead of the European size curve so keep
that<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.960> mind<00:00:55.050> when<00:00:55.320> you're<00:00:55.440> buying<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that in mind when you're buying that you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350 
that in mind when you're buying that you
shouldn't<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.370> any<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.000> should<00:00:57.030> unless

you're a Triple E with you really

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.869 
you're a Triple E with you really
shouldn't<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.340> tough<00:00:59.520> time<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.820> the
