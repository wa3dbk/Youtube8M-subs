malarkey<00:06:25.740> one<00:06:26.310> of<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.490> things<00:06:26.700> I<00:06:26.880> truly<00:06:27.330> hated

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
malarkey one of the things I truly hated

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.290 
malarkey one of the things I truly hated
about<00:06:27.990> its<00:06:28.320> predecessors<00:06:28.950> the<00:06:29.760> screen<00:06:30.030> itself

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
about its predecessors the screen itself

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.300 
about its predecessors the screen itself
is<00:06:30.570> also<00:06:30.780> easier<00:06:31.530> to<00:06:31.710> see<00:06:31.890> in<00:06:32.100> bright

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
is also easier to see in bright

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.070 
is also easier to see in bright
conditions<00:06:32.490> it's<00:06:33.090> less<00:06:33.360> susceptible<00:06:33.930> to

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
conditions it's less susceptible to

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.659 
conditions it's less susceptible to
glare<00:06:34.380> and<00:06:34.650> being<00:06:34.890> washed<00:06:35.130> out<00:06:35.310> in<00:06:35.460> bright

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
glare and being washed out in bright

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.960 
glare and being washed out in bright
conditions<00:06:36.260> so<00:06:37.260> it's<00:06:37.830> a<00:06:38.010> better<00:06:38.190> tool<00:06:38.400> to<00:06:38.640> use

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
conditions so it's a better tool to use

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.629 
conditions so it's a better tool to use
and<00:06:39.240> it<00:06:39.479> delivers<00:06:39.690> results<00:06:39.990> which

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
and it delivers results which

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.459 
and it delivers results which
range<00:06:40.789> from<00:06:41.030> slightly<00:06:41.449> to<00:06:41.810> noticeably<00:06:42.349> better

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
range from slightly to noticeably better

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.070 
range from slightly to noticeably better
