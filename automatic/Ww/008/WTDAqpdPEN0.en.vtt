national<00:04:51.479> samurai<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.389> was<00:04:54.539> a<00:04:54.570> pretty

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
national samurai so this was a pretty

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.379 
national samurai so this was a pretty
fast<00:04:55.139> battle<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.770> all<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.699> way<00:04:56.789> I<00:04:56.820> try<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.090> get

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
fast battle and all the way I try to get

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.629 
fast battle and all the way I try to get
his<00:04:57.509> general<00:04:57.840> about<00:04:58.039> this<00:04:59.039> general<00:04:59.310> didn't

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
his general about this general didn't

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.480 
his general about this general didn't
die<00:05:00.919> so<00:05:01.970> there<00:05:02.970> was<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> waste<00:05:04.370> defense<00:05:05.370> is

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
die so there was a waste defense is

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.740 
die so there was a waste defense is
Irish<00:05:05.820> value

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.650 

so<00:05:10.280> it's<00:05:11.280> like<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.700> channel<00:05:11.970> samurai<00:05:12.330> you<00:05:12.480> can

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
so it's like a channel samurai you can

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.800 
so it's like a channel samurai you can
