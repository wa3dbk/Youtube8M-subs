for priming large molds you basically

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.000 
for priming large molds you basically
want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> give<00:00:35.340> five<00:00:35.790> even<00:00:36.390> coatings<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.170> the

primer changing direction each time you
add<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:42.059> application<00:00:42.500> now<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.890> don't<00:00:44.190> need<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
add an application now you don't need to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.420 
add an application now you don't need to
dry<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.030> between<00:00:45.840> applications<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
dry this between applications because it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.549 
dry this between applications because it
only<00:00:47.610> needs<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.030> thin<00:00:48.210> coat<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.140> any<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> these

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559

only needs a thin coat and any of these
bumps<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.329> wipe

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bumps that you get you can actually wipe

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.229 
bumps that you get you can actually wipe
out<00:00:51.960> afterwards<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.949> putting<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.250> piece

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
out afterwards by just putting a piece

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
out afterwards by just putting a piece
of<00:00:54.390> paper<00:00:54.570> between<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.559> shelf<00:00:55.770> primer<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
of paper between the shelf primer in

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
of paper between the shelf primer in
your<00:00:56.309> hand<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:57.239> rubbing<00:00:57.510> gently<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
your hand and just rubbing gently and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.959 
your hand and just rubbing gently and
it'll<00:00:58.620> give<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.219> smooth<00:00:59.460> finish<00:00:59.489> on

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
it'll give you a really smooth finish on

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.779 
it'll give you a really smooth finish on
there<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.750> last<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.079> ages<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:02.430> Primo

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
there that will last for ages the Primo

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.500 
there that will last for ages the Primo
primer<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.449> good<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.610> small<00:01:05.610> detailed<00:01:06.119> molds

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
primer is good for small detailed molds

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.190 
primer is good for small detailed molds
and<00:01:07.130> premium<00:01:08.130> primer<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.729> settles<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.630> lot

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and premium primer really settles a lot

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.660 
and premium primer really settles a lot
in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> bottom<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> container<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.520> be

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in the bottom of the container so be

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
in the bottom of the container so be
careful<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.570> make<00:01:12.720> sure<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.080> stir<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.380> up

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
careful to make sure that you stir it up

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
careful to make sure that you stir it up
really<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.010> well<00:01:14.280> before<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.850> actually

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
really really well before you actually

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.929 
really really well before you actually
use<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.619> use<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> brush<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
use it and then you can use a brush to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.030 
use it and then you can use a brush to
apply<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.299> primer<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.619> work<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
apply the primer and you just work it

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.399 
apply the primer and you just work it
into<00:01:20.220> those<00:01:20.490> small<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:21.150> details<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
into those small little details in the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.219 
into those small little details in the
in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> mold<00:01:23.009> applying<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.119> single<00:01:24.780> coat<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
in the mold applying a single coat at a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
in the mold applying a single coat at a
time<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.400> best<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> dry<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
time and it's best to dry this in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.410 
time and it's best to dry this in
between<00:01:28.140> each<00:01:28.500> coat<00:01:28.920> using<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.790> hair<00:01:29.970> dryer<00:01:30.000> or

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
between each coat using a hair dryer or

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
between each coat using a hair dryer or
something<00:01:30.479> lights<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:32.520> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
something lights like that because that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.840 
something lights like that because that
allows<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> pick<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:33.810> detail

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
allows you to pick up more detail

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
allows you to pick up more detail
finally<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.180> stainless<00:01:36.390> steel<00:01:36.720> molds<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.409> use

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
finally for stainless steel molds we use

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.580 
finally for stainless steel molds we use
boron<00:01:38.310> nitride<00:01:38.790> spray<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.780> boron<00:01:40.170> nitride

spray is limited to the lower
temperature<00:01:43.409> ranges<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.490> need<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> put<00:01:44.939> about

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
temperature ranges you need to put about

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.690 
temperature ranges you need to put about
a<00:01:45.530> three-second<00:01:46.530> blast<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.340> spray<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
a three-second blast you just spray that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.819 
a three-second blast you just spray that
onto<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.240> mold<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.990> best<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.470> stainless

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
onto the mold it's best for stainless

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.289 
onto the mold it's best for stainless
steel<00:01:50.009> molds<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:51.119> expensive

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
steel molds because it's very expensive

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.569 
steel molds because it's very expensive
and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.470> not<00:01:52.649> great<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.369> high

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and it's not great at really high
