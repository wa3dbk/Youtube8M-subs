 pronounced annoying and pouring 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.280
 in the case of communities 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.920
 the central region of Mexico and especially if the states of Puebla 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.879
 tlaxcala hidalgo 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.729
 and of course the one in Mexico 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.710
 They specialize in how to satisfy 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.979
 your cystic culex with the most varied foods 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.069
 special in Puebla right here because you like justified fame others 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.599
 of the most sophisticated way to remove 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.149
 make sweets and pastries and eat all that 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.390
 the Mexican southeast is different 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.760
 and embracing to like ee 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 eye to the patch the state and especially the port of veracruz 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.569
 the specialty of the Mexican of that southeast area 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.230
 nogués or by far dominated by us 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.150
 nobody like the veracruzanos lucas tecos campechanos tabasqueños also 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.080
 to hoist fish and seafood 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.660
 the approved okada 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.980
 to us instead we get a milagrito concreted in said popular in 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.020
 adage 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.610
 four things like the poblano say pork pig pork and pig and it's 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.900
 true or not 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.220
 but we also recognize creative expertise for example 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.620
 someone burns the mole 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.300
 the chiles in nogada 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.010
 and a huge variety of pipián same liters and pencil and other portents 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.840
 from the local cuisine 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.870
 classic our region otherwise and among the street cravings is the 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.970
 hermitages 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.180
 for my taste it is written by the way and it is said with messi 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.100
 contradicting those who write ibicenco 11 with that I think because 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.780
 originally the bread that we call is made is made with semolina that wheat 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.810
 crushed mind pasta 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 good the issue that are also consumed in mexico in Hidalgo and Tlaxcala and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.840
 limited to the hermitages around those states 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 it's one of the street foods 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.780
 classic of puebla 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.899
 but how about everything else flip flops and mules press 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 not to mention the classic hashish boats 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.479
 but since another edible marvel and 10 the sweet bread 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.230
 eye to the patch given today welcome back to the favorite bakeries 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:24.549
 of the poblano the almond of 25 poniente 307 the queen of san martín texmelucan 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.620
 14 and the viewpoint of 31 east and 20 south those three places of true 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.019
 privilege for the best palate poblano 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.159
 that palate of people that demands the highest quality 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:44.449
 and also the most absolute purity in the regio the superb the unequaled bread 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.239
 sweet poblano 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.609
 I will overcome my with those out there 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.949
 and one or the other wing is better a fence and bones 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:53.509
 I go and say
