00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

slightly<00:01:00.030> darker<00:01:00.359> brown<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
slightly darker brown and I'm going to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.969 
slightly darker brown and I'm going to
again<00:01:02.520> use<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.910> same<00:01:03.180> brush<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> just

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
again use that same brush and just

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.920 
again use that same brush and just
increase<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.280> intensity<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.299> eye<00:01:06.479> crease

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
increase the intensity in the eye crease

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750 
increase the intensity in the eye crease
because<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
because this is going to look like a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760 
because this is going to look like a
little<00:01:08.970> bit<00:01:09.150> more<00:01:09.180> defined<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.590> add<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
little bit more defined and just add a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
little bit more defined and just add a
bit<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.189> shape<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.850> eye<00:01:11.909> rather<00:01:12.390> than

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
bit more shape to your eye rather than

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
bit more shape to your eye rather than
just<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.110> sort<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.350> matte<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> flat<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
just really sort of matte and flat so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.399 
just really sort of matte and flat so
this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> add<00:01:15.570> some<00:01:15.810> shadows<00:01:16.170> into

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this is going to add some shadows into

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.230 
this is going to add some shadows into
your<00:01:16.590> crease<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> go

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
your crease and I'm actually going to go

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570 
your crease and I'm actually going to go
in<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.960> shadow<00:01:19.259> by<00:01:19.530> makeup<00:01:19.560> geek<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
in with this shadow by makeup geek and I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.399 
in with this shadow by makeup geek and I
believe<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:20.939> called<00:01:21.150> grandstand<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> it's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
believe it's called grandstand and it's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.609 
believe it's called grandstand and it's
really<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.890> shimmery<00:01:23.640> foiled<00:01:24.420> shadow<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.259> I'm

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
really a shimmery foiled shadow and I'm

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
really a shimmery foiled shadow and I'm
going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> use<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> smaller<00:01:26.909> brush<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.540> apply

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
going to use a smaller brush and apply

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.859 
going to use a smaller brush and apply
that<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.439> outer<00:01:28.619> two-thirds<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.729> my

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
that to the outer two-thirds of my

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.390 
that to the outer two-thirds of my
eyelid<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.229> packing<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> brush

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
eyelid just packing it on with a brush

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.210 
eyelid just packing it on with a brush
so<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.869> opaque<00:01:34.470> color

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so that you get a really opaque color

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.080 
so that you get a really opaque color
