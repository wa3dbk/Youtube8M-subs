into the wall behind it we've got a
backer<00:02:52.680> here<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.550> we've<00:02:54.000> got<00:02:54.030> solid<00:02:54.630> backing

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840

backer here so we've got solid backing
to<00:02:55.170> screw<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.040> heavy<00:02:56.250> TV<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.000> TV<00:02:57.030> is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
to screw in for that heavy TV the TV is

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.120 
to screw in for that heavy TV the TV is
going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.570> about<00:02:57.690> 42<00:02:58.200> inches<00:02:58.230> wide<00:02:58.830> and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
going to be about 42 inches wide and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.550 
going to be about 42 inches wide and
probably<00:02:59.640> 70<00:03:00.090> pounds<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:01.260> want<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> make

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
probably 70 pounds so we want to make

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.900 
probably 70 pounds so we want to make
sure<00:03:01.590> we've<00:03:01.770> got<00:03:01.920> something<00:03:02.130> solid<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.610> screw

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
sure we've got something solid to screw

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.140 
sure we've got something solid to screw
into<00:03:03.210> in<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> future<00:03:04.790> okay<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> other<00:03:05.970> thing

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
into in the future okay the other thing

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.790 
into in the future okay the other thing
we<00:03:06.390> want<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.630> check<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.470> want<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.710> make

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
we want to check for so want to make

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.380 
we want to check for so want to make
sure<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.070> all<00:03:08.250> mechanicals<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
sure that all mechanicals in the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.330 
sure that all mechanicals in the
basement<00:03:09.990> are<00:03:10.140> covered<00:03:10.770> up<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:11.130> there's

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
basement are covered up if there's

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.890 
basement are covered up if there's
something<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.940> way<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.480> radon

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
something in the way like this radon

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.440 
something in the way like this radon
vent<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.860> actually<00:03:14.100> vents<00:03:14.640> radon<00:03:14.970> gases

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
vent here it actually vents radon gases

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.210 
vent here it actually vents radon gases
up<00:03:15.630> from<00:03:15.870> under<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.260> floor<00:03:16.410> out<00:03:16.770> through<00:03:17.100> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
up from under the floor out through the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.550 
up from under the floor out through the
roof<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:18.090> case<00:03:18.330> we've<00:03:18.570> boxed<00:03:19.020> around<00:03:19.320> it

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
roof in this case we've boxed around it

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.530 
roof in this case we've boxed around it
so<00:03:19.920> we<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.160> drywall<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> column

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
so we can drywall and out like a column

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.390 
so we can drywall and out like a column
and<00:03:21.720> you'll<00:03:22.020> never<00:03:22.200> know<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:22.650> there<00:03:22.739> we

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
and you'll never know it's there we

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
and you'll never know it's there we
don't<00:03:23.550> have<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.760> spend<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.060> money<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
don't have to spend the money to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.060 
don't have to spend the money to
actually<00:03:24.750> cut<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.170> out<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.500> remove<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.040> and

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
actually cut it out and remove it and

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.300 
actually cut it out and remove it and
put<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.489> another<00:03:26.580> place<00:03:27.709> okay<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:29.010> might<00:03:29.190> be

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
put it in another place okay it might be

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.740 
put it in another place okay it might be
a<00:03:29.340> little<00:03:29.459> bit<00:03:29.670> difficult<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.150> see<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:30.600> we've

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
a little bit difficult to see but we've

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.840 
a little bit difficult to see but we've
actually<00:03:30.959> left<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.500> ceiling<00:03:31.920> open<00:03:32.340> what

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
actually left the ceiling open what

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.250 
actually left the ceiling open what
we're<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.150> do<00:03:33.330> on<00:03:33.480> our<00:03:33.630> plan<00:03:33.959> for<00:03:34.170> our

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
we're going to do on our plan for our

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.390 
we're going to do on our plan for our
finished<00:03:34.590> basement<00:03:34.980> we're<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.250> leave

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
finished basement we're going to leave

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.710 
finished basement we're going to leave
this<00:03:35.550> open<00:03:35.790> we're<00:03:36.060> going<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.239> paint<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.600> all

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
this open we're going to paint it all

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.110 
this open we're going to paint it all
black<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.470> actually<00:03:38.040> create<00:03:38.489> what<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:39.000> to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
black and actually create what I like to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.330 
black and actually create what I like to
call<00:03:39.180> an<00:03:39.450> urban<00:03:39.690> loft<00:03:40.050> feel<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:41.070> actually

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
call an urban loft feel it actually

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.340 
call an urban loft feel it actually
gives<00:03:41.550> us<00:03:41.670> more<00:03:41.910> Headroom<00:03:42.420> than<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:43.050> drop

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
gives us more Headroom than if we drop

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.110 
gives us more Headroom than if we drop
the<00:03:43.560> ceiling<00:03:43.770> and<00:03:44.070> drywall<00:03:44.489> bit<00:03:44.730> or<00:03:44.880> did<00:03:45.090> a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
the ceiling and drywall bit or did a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.449 
the ceiling and drywall bit or did a
drop<00:03:45.420> ceiling<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.650> case<00:03:46.920> we're

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
drop ceiling so in this case we're

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.380 
drop ceiling so in this case we're
actually<00:03:47.550> just<00:03:47.880> going<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.030> leave<00:03:48.270> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
actually just going to leave the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.600 
actually just going to leave the
mechanicals<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.050> is<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:50.190> way<00:03:50.370> we're

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
mechanicals as is in this way we're

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.860 
mechanicals as is in this way we're

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
going to have more Headroom and it's

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.240 
going to have more Headroom and it's
going<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.050> give<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.440> kind<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.950> cool

make<00:03:57.870> sure<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.290> Carpenter<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.770> use

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
make sure that the Carpenter is use

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.540 
make sure that the Carpenter is use
treated<00:03:59.580> material<00:03:59.700> anywhere<00:04:00.570> we<00:04:00.720> contact

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
treated material anywhere we contact

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.979 
treated material anywhere we contact
concrete<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:03.060> there's<00:04:03.360> going<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.540> be<00:04:03.600> moisture

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
concrete so there's going to be moisture

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.570 
concrete so there's going to be moisture
in<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.170> concrete<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> concrete<00:04:04.709> touches<00:04:05.459> the

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
in the concrete the concrete touches the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.920 
in the concrete the concrete touches the
ground<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.120> going<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.330> wick<00:04:06.540> moisture

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
ground and it's going to wick moisture

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.990 
ground and it's going to wick moisture
up<00:04:07.320> into<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.370> don't<00:04:08.550> want<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
up into it so we don't want the the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.540 
up into it so we don't want the the
lumber<00:04:09.690> deteriorating<00:04:10.530> over<00:04:10.620> time<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.459> we

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
lumber deteriorating over time so we

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.740 
lumber deteriorating over time so we
want<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.760> make<00:04:11.910> sure<00:04:11.940> check<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.600> make<00:04:12.720> sure
