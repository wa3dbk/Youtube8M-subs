feel<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.479> it<00:04:59.600> kind<00:04:59.900> of<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.199> tends<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.710> match

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
feel that it kind of it tends to match

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.700

this one but I don't know this is

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.110 
this one but I don't know this is
definitely<00:05:05.990> more<00:05:06.229> flashy<00:05:06.620> where<00:05:07.610> this<00:05:07.789> one<00:05:07.970> is
