00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.920
 with the update to version 1.00 60 have 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.730
 we are using the spotlights in 3d satellite 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.070
 recorded 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.589
 here will be here below in the future 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.140
 another rider namely speed 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.430
 There you will find the existing one 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.830
 technology and you can use it as usual 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.690
 just drag and drop into here 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.420
 pull in studio and as usual 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.830
 serve 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.320
 you also have the possibility of yours 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.250
 own speedlite with in the software 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.710
 take 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.649
 Just click one in the studio 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.039
 located players and could now 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.199
 over here over the plus sign yours 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.019
 include your own technology 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:51.730
 First , you give a name here 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:55.030
 example canon 580 ii x2 next 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.600
 you are looking for the performance area here 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.479
 Your speed lights off in the event 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.920
 to light your head between the power 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:08.710
 1 and up to 128 rules so we choose 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.620
 This next would have to be here 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.860
 choose over in which area 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.000
 let your speedlite zoom 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.080
 just look at this 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.930
 table and the canon speedlite lets 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.930
 settle here in this area and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.060
 has these single steps available 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.890
 If necessary, you have to be in yours here 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.320
 check the operating instructions 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.960
 to find out which one is right 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.020
 control range is I'm going to this now 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.060
 here and next you have to go here 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.220
 then adjust the guide number over there 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.020
 who needs additional information 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.730
 here is the possibility our website 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.250
 to visit there is a certain 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.620
 Overview that will help you with that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.990
 to find the right value 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.090
 Just click here and choose 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.530
 the corresponding performance range in 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.990
 In the event that a number of 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.990
 850 measured at 105 mm 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.620
 This will range in front of us 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.749
 depending on what you are doing up front 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.340
 so you have more times 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.140
 less choice available 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.700
 we just do that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.780
 to make something easier 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.580
 then click on add and here 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.300
 one sees the lightning head stands to 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.910
 disposal 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.590
 here is our standard lightning head and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.690
 here the self added 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.549
 we only have one location 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.890
 pitstop inserted because it just like that 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.750
 many different variants exist 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.920
 we did not want to include them 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.480
 but everyone just his 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.230
 individual assemble yourself 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.170
 can 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.269
 who does not need the lightning head anymore 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.530
 or just tried it 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.200
 about this little one wants too 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.360
 delete again and then exists only 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.890
 still the existing or 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.760
 the others you already added 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.220
 has been able to operate the spotlights 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.780
 like the normal lightning heads too 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.170
 but there are two more 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.269
 rule range and once this of the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.620
 The angle of the lightning cops is adjusted like 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.900
 you can see beautiful here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 and otherwise it's easy here 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.569
 adjust the speedlite as usual 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.849
 and you have the opportunity to give it 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.989
 to set the area of ​​the lightning head 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.069
 I'll show you one again 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.130
 Another picture where you can do that a bit 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.410
 The performance looks better 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.319
 Speed ​​unfortunately a little different how 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.500
 at normal lightning heads and that is 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.599
 also shown here accordingly 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.819
 not all of these variants exist 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.139
 in the light form when we look 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.170
 look at this lightning head now 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:44.049
 you can see that you only move this way 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.690
 Can and only the performance is available 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.180
 that's because the combination 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.980
 not suitable for this kind here 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.630
 the little lightning head is here now 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.419
 to move additionally at the top 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.950
 That's why we left that out 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.609
 also it makes no sense to this 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.150
 zoom 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.669
 since we are usually here with 24 to 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.069
 maybe 35 mm works as possible 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.650
 to get a flat light that 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.209
 We also find the same here and at the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.500
 other light forms here below 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.690
 to have available 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.590
 Again, we will be more 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.349
 Add 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.810
 you just use the light form of the 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.250
 man comes next and can handle it 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.500
 So certainly a great light 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.460
 build up 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.950
 Now I'll show you those too 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.689
 exciting light characteristic of a 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.699
 sorry i'm doing this here 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.439
 little bit darker if you do that 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.689
 you can see speedlite now 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:37.539
 just nice if you like this and how 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.969
 Then the light output changes 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.860
 so the brightness changes but also 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.169
 the same to the area 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.179
 gets smaller and you can so here 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.309
 learn nice later and also 

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:50.799
 try out how to use a speedlite 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:52.449
 works best and why in these 

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:54.969
 area just way less 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.349
 Performance is available if he is too 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.969
 and very clearly 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.860
 then the light output is simply higher 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.989
 and that's why I have more light here 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.209
 available then a little 

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:06.069
 Tip and we have a new track 

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:09.219
 added function that already exists 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.969
 since version 59 and although I can here 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:15.339
 over there simply over the text form and 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.379
 with the left mouse button which then 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:20.110
 keep driving here and there 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:23.589
 and then you see, the advertising 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.569
 fine in the small here too 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.449
 that is especially helpful if 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.399
 this view is currently active here 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.329
 has and now wants all the values ​​here 

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.999
 still change 

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:35.610
 That's a nice thing to do again 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.929
 be able to work faster 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.079
 Finally , a little tip 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:43.300
 if you have set exports in the set plan 

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:44.019
 you have great opportunity here too 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.959
 rated 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:50.949
 Just pull a line in and you 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:53.499
 see the distances here then directly 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.819
 measured and displayed if you 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:56.259
 it just wants to delete it again 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:59.050
 Click and with the remove button 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:01.329
 remove and so you have the 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.149
 possibility these dimensions still on the 

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:06.069
 schedule to take over here when I so 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.079
 which have entered I see it 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.209
 In the studio I can go out again and 

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:13.389
 fade in and intimate tool change 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:15.369
 here too these lines draw one 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.519
 I can mark a free point in the room 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:20.319
 by just taking off here and the 

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:24.189
 Old button press and to the mouse 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:26.439
 let loose then arises here in the room 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.300
 measure point if I again everything 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.569
 I can change tools as well 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.569
 move and the other points too 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:36.279
 Last but not least we have the 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.539
 reset test time that is all 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.110
 who have already tested the software 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.820
 have before the version 60 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.830
 Now the possibility again 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.720
 to make an update to the version 60 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.270
 or reinstall the software 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.320
 and then 15 days in peace again 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.320
 Try everything
