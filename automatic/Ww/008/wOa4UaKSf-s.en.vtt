00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.290 
considering penetration of these weak
spots<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.590> how<00:00:40.770> big<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.250> gun<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.969> angle

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
armor is take for consideration if you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.650 
armor is take for consideration if you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and they have thick armor you're gonna

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.950 
and they have thick armor you're gonna
have<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> tougher<00:00:50.940> time<00:00:51.030> penetrating<00:00:51.840> these

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
have a tougher time penetrating these

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.959 
have a tougher time penetrating these
weak<00:00:52.199> spots<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.770> some<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> these<00:00:53.460> weak<00:00:53.670> spots

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
weak spots and some of these weak spots

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
weak spots and some of these weak spots
are<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.239> actually<00:00:54.660> weak<00:00:54.809> spots<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.379> where

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
are not actually weak spots just where

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.880 
are not actually weak spots just where
some<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> crew<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> located<00:00:57.890> another

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
some of the crew is located another

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.500 
some of the crew is located another
thing<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.460> these<00:00:59.670> skins<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.239> illegal

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
thing is these skins are not illegal

thing is these skins are not illegal
wargaming<00:01:01.260> has<00:01:01.350> already<00:01:01.590> been<00:01:01.770> over<00:01:01.920> them<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
wargaming has already been over them you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
wargaming has already been over them you
can<00:01:02.460> use<00:01:02.609> them<00:01:02.640> in-game<00:01:02.969> although<00:01:03.930> they're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
can use them in-game although they're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.719 
can use them in-game although they're
not<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.470> useful<00:01:04.739> they're<00:01:05.220> mainly<00:01:05.400> just

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
not really useful they're mainly just

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
not really useful they're mainly just
used<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.450> find<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.780> where<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> weak<00:01:07.170> spots

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
used to find out where the weak spots

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260 
used to find out where the weak spots
are<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> can't<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.580> them<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:08.970> afar

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
are because you can't see them from afar

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.640 
are because you can't see them from afar
you<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.689> zoomed<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> can't

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you have to be zoomed in and you can't

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350 
you have to be zoomed in and you can't
see<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:10.920> through<00:01:11.100> bushes<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.729> they're

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
see them through bushes and they're

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.630 
see them through bushes and they're
mainly<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.990> tool<00:01:13.530> used<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.010> learning<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
mainly just a tool used for learning and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.740 
mainly just a tool used for learning and
that's<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.030> trying<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that's what I'm trying to do for you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
that's what I'm trying to do for you
guys<00:01:15.930> teach<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.799> where<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> weak<00:01:17.159> spots<00:01:17.460> are

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
guys teach you where the weak spots are

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.080 
guys teach you where the weak spots are
so<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:19.250> now<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> guys<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:20.700> coming

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so you know now if you guys are coming

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
so you know now if you guys are coming
up<00:01:21.210> against<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> kv-3<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.590> best

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
up against the kv-3 my best

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
up against the kv-3 my best
recommendation<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.390> tier<00:01:24.780> 6

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
recommendation to you is if your tier 6

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.800 
recommendation to you is if your tier 6
or<00:01:25.350> lower<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.909> try<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> engage

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
or lower would be to try not to engage

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
or lower would be to try not to engage
its<00:01:28.259> front<00:01:28.590> try<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> engage<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> size<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.360> its

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
its front try to engage the size or its

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.569 
its front try to engage the size or its

it should be moved up or should it stay
a<00:02:19.740> tier<00:02:20.130> considering<00:02:21.090> how<00:02:21.330> much<00:02:21.510> power<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.080> has

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
a tier considering how much power it has

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.200 
a tier considering how much power it has
compared<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.800> other<00:02:23.040> tier<00:02:23.430> 6<00:02:23.700> heavy<00:02:23.850> x'
