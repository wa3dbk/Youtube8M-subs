because cars to Nikolai I collaborated

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.729 
because cars to Nikolai I collaborated
apparently<00:03:43.760> passed<00:03:44.000> he<00:03:44.840> created<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.260> book<00:03:45.560> of

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
apparently passed he created a book of

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.309 
apparently passed he created a book of
formulas<00:03:46.430> for<00:03:47.060> marais<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.110> was<00:03:48.200> very

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
formulas for marais and it was very

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.009 
formulas for marais and it was very
puzzled<00:03:48.800> by<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:50.000> idea<00:03:50.090> here<00:03:50.390> was<00:03:50.599> to

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
puzzled by that so the idea here was to

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.559 
puzzled by that so the idea here was to
how<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.590> create<00:03:52.069> more<00:03:52.430> appearances<00:03:53.060> up<00:03:53.360> being

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
how to create more appearances up being

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.620 
how to create more appearances up being
more<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.650> know<00:03:54.830> so<00:03:55.130> by<00:03:55.489> layering<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.269> and<00:03:56.510> by

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
more a you know so by layering it and by

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.270 
more a you know so by layering it and by
creating<00:03:57.019> fabrics<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.440> were<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> little<00:03:58.069> more

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
creating fabrics that were a little more

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.699 
creating fabrics that were a little more
open<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:58.880> little<00:03:59.239> more<00:03:59.420> closed<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.410> know<00:04:00.560> it

open and little more closed you know it

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.979 
open and little more closed you know it
became<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.010> dynamic<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.150> development<00:04:02.870> of

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
became a dynamic so development of

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.729 
became a dynamic so development of
putting<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.590> together<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:05.120> see<00:04:05.330> that<00:04:05.569> on<00:04:05.870> a
