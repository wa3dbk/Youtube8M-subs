00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
texture pack tutorials today we're

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.650 
texture pack tutorials today we're
making<00:00:09.960> AWS<00:00:10.460> look<00:00:11.460> about<00:00:11.610> redstone<00:00:12.120> texture

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
making AWS look about redstone texture

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.759 
making AWS look about redstone texture
because<00:00:12.929> that's<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.200> we're<00:00:13.349> making<00:00:13.500> today

into the redstone rasterize it and here

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.810 
into the redstone rasterize it and here
we<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:35.070> need<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.430> our<00:00:35.610> redstone

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
we are we need to make our redstone

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.990 
we are we need to make our redstone
small<00:00:36.420> we're<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.899> image<00:00:37.200> size<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:38.309> 9

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
small we're going to image size about 9

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.740 
small we're going to image size about 9
250<00:00:40.430> bicubic<00:00:41.430> sharper<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.329> there<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.570> go

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
250 bicubic sharper and there we go

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.410 
250 bicubic sharper and there we go
paste<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.829> well<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.250> here's<00:00:45.239> our

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
paste this in as well so here's our

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.139 
paste this in as well so here's our
redstone<00:00:45.809> texture<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.610> need<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.940> now

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
redstone texture what we need to do now

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
redstone texture what we need to do now
is<00:00:48.329> make<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.750> layer<00:00:49.140> mask<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.010> we'll<00:00:50.129> click<00:00:50.309> on

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
is make a layer mask so we'll click on

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.510 
is make a layer mask so we'll click on
layer<00:00:51.030> mask<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> Redstone<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:53.190> Ruby

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
layer mask all the Redstone not Ruby

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 
layer mask all the Redstone not Ruby
it's<00:00:54.059> only<00:00:54.270> selected<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.469> we'll<00:00:55.710> make<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.860> all

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's only selected and we'll make it all

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's only selected and we'll make it all
bike<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.910> we'll<00:00:57.090> change<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.660> invert<00:00:58.649> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
bike so we'll change this invert this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
bike so we'll change this invert this
had<00:00:59.010> bikes<00:00:59.219> behind<00:00:59.550> press<00:01:00.539> ctrl<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
had bikes behind press ctrl a and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
had bikes behind press ctrl a and
backspace<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.370> it'll<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:02.789> everything<00:01:03.120> bike

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
backspace and it'll make everything bike

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
backspace and it'll make everything bike
so<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.690> can't<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.049> anything<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:05.519> we

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so you can't see anything now what we

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.330 
so you can't see anything now what we
need<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.150> click<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.110> brush<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> get

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
need to do is click on the brush and get

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
need to do is click on the brush and get
a<00:01:08.549> brush<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.180> choosing<00:01:09.510> perfectly

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
a brush of your choosing perfectly

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.240 
a brush of your choosing perfectly
something<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.860> unique

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
something that's a bit unique

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
something that's a bit unique
so<00:01:11.580> I've<00:01:11.670> downloaded<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.150> brushes<00:01:12.390> here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
so I've downloaded these brushes here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
so I've downloaded these brushes here
they're<00:01:12.930> supposed<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> replicate<00:01:13.799> proper

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
they're supposed to replicate proper

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120 
they're supposed to replicate proper
paint<00:01:14.880> brushes<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> we've<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:16.830> as

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
paint brushes so we've got this here as

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
paint brushes so we've got this here as
you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.790> doing<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.180> there's<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> bit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
you can see doing that there's a bit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.320 
you can see doing that there's a bit
bland<00:01:19.619> no<00:01:19.830> fours<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> do

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
bland no fours for what we need to do

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.370 
bland no fours for what we need to do
let's<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.350> window<00:01:23.030> brush<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.420> yeah

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
let's go to your window brush and yeah

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
let's go to your window brush and yeah
brushes<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> macro

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
brushes are what we can do as a macro

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.640 
brushes are what we can do as a macro
with<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.600> these<00:01:27.840> settings<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.560> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
with all these settings and what this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.499 
with all these settings and what this
won't<00:01:28.890> eventually<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.270> play<00:01:30.450> around

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
won't eventually do we just play around

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.620 
won't eventually do we just play around
all<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.140> look<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
all of these look what this will do is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140 
all of these look what this will do is
make<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> brush<00:01:34.290> more<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.340> random<00:01:35.880> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
make the brush more you know random so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.700 
make the brush more you know random so
things<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> bottom<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> what

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
things it on the bottom this is what

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.219 
things it on the bottom this is what
it'll<00:01:37.979> look<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.840> play<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it'll look like so I can play up the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.240 
it'll look like so I can play up the
whole<00:01:40.350> bunch<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> stuff<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.189> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
whole bunch of stuff that's what you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.469 
whole bunch of stuff that's what you
want<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.549> cuz<00:01:41.759> he<00:01:41.850> always<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.240> supposed<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
want to do cuz he always was supposed to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.899 
want to do cuz he always was supposed to
be<00:01:42.600> random<00:01:43.229> looking<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.610> over<00:01:44.640> here

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
be random looking so if I go over here

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
be random looking so if I go over here
now<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.630> makes<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.350> whole<00:01:46.470> bunch<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
now I can see it makes a whole bunch of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.780 
now I can see it makes a whole bunch of
random<00:01:47.159> stuff

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
random stuff

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
random stuff
don't<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.780> big<00:01:48.990> though<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.200> we'll

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
don't just be that big though so we'll

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.429 
don't just be that big though so we'll
make<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:49.890> small<00:01:51.020> randal<00:01:52.020> these<00:01:52.170> down

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
make a bit small randal these down

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.359 
make a bit small randal these down
because<00:01:52.680> too<00:01:52.920> much

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
because too much

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.899 
because too much
I'll<00:01:53.700> make<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> brush<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.540> lot<00:01:54.810> smaller<00:01:55.909> bit

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
I'll make the brush a lot smaller bit

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.780 
I'll make the brush a lot smaller bit
bigger<00:01:57.090> than<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.829> 99s<00:01:58.829> alright<00:01:59.040> so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
bigger than that actually 99s alright so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
bigger than that actually 99s alright so
just<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.770> no<00:02:01.770> Pete<00:02:02.280> much<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:03.740> think<00:02:04.740> that's

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
just go over no Pete much I think that's

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.119 
just go over no Pete much I think that's
all<00:02:05.850> right<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.540> mean<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.439> should<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.680> drag<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
all right I mean I should just drag it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.619 
all right I mean I should just drag it
down<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.649> mask<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.950> off<00:02:11.099> again<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.629> ctrl

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
down and mask that off again with ctrl

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.460 
down and mask that off again with ctrl
backspace

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
backspace

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
backspace
so<00:02:14.250> there<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.460> go<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.580> looks<00:02:14.730> all<00:02:15.060> right<00:02:15.330> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
so there we go that looks all right to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
so there we go that looks all right to
begin<00:02:15.570> with<00:02:16.340> that's<00:02:17.340> not<00:02:17.490> anything<00:02:17.730> yet

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
begin with that's not anything yet

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.310 
begin with that's not anything yet
though<00:02:18.210> what<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.480> need<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.660> do<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.140> go<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
though what we need to do now is go to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.260 
though what we need to do now is go to
effects<00:02:20.360> well<00:02:21.360> first<00:02:21.660> start<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.020> do<00:02:23.270> everyone

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
effects well first start to do everyone

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.720 
effects well first start to do everyone
embossed<00:02:24.570> now<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.990> is<00:02:25.170> how<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.190> made<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
embossed now this is how I made the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.150 
embossed now this is how I made the
author<00:02:26.850> sort<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.570> know<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.980> secret<00:02:28.980> one

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
author sort of you know a secret one

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.920 
author sort of you know a secret one
that<00:02:29.190> I've<00:02:29.430> kept<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.790> while<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.750> my

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
that I've kept for a while because my

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
that I've kept for a while because my
always<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.010> my<00:02:32.160> life<00:02:32.430> techSpec<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.060> quite

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
always in my life techSpec a quite

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.380 
always in my life techSpec a quite
unique<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.440> find<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:35.160> actually<00:02:35.910> quite<00:02:36.150> made<00:02:36.300> in

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
unique I find I actually quite made in

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.150 
unique I find I actually quite made in
by<00:02:36.480> mistake<00:02:36.600> really<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> bevel<00:02:38.130> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
by mistake really in the bevel and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.980 
by mistake really in the bevel and
emboss<00:02:38.250> or<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.850> mucking<00:02:39.030> around<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.540> came

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
emboss or just mucking around I came

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.050 
emboss or just mucking around I came
over<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.280> really<00:02:41.310> quite<00:02:41.610> good<00:02:41.670> I

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
over this so it's really quite good I

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.210 
over this so it's really quite good I
think<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.020> what<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.350> need<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> do<00:02:43.650> drag<00:02:44.100> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
think so what we need to do drag a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.610 
think so what we need to do drag a
shading<00:02:44.670> about<00:02:44.910> 290<00:02:45.570> or<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.260> keep<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> sort

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
shading about 290 or so to keep it sort

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.840 
shading about 290 or so to keep it sort
of<00:02:46.740> central<00:02:47.150> now<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.210> need<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.960> add<00:02:49.230> an<00:02:49.860> inner

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
of central now we need to add an inner

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.320 
of central now we need to add an inner
bevel<00:02:51.060> yep<00:02:51.990> which<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.190> soft<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.880> here's

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
bevel yep which is all soft and here's

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.830 
bevel yep which is all soft and here's
the<00:02:54.510> magic<00:02:54.660> sort<00:02:54.960> of<00:02:55.020> comes<00:02:55.200> along<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:56.730> bit<00:02:57.660> more

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the magic sort of comes along a bit more

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.600 
the magic sort of comes along a bit more
depth

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
depth

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.730 
depth
how<00:02:59.610> much<00:03:01.400> 76<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.580> size<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.180> as<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.480> see

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
how much 76 in size and as you can see

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.030 
how much 76 in size and as you can see
yeah<00:03:05.630> looking<00:03:06.630> good<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.960> it's<00:03:07.320> getting<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.620> 3d

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
yeah looking good is it's getting a 3d

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.140 
yeah looking good is it's getting a 3d
look<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.430> you'll<00:03:08.550> see<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.790> little<00:03:09.060> my

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
look that you'll see in little my

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.340 
look that you'll see in little my
texture<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:11.870> yeah<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.020> doesn't<00:03:13.140> really

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
texture so yeah that doesn't really

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.350 
texture so yeah that doesn't really
change<00:03:13.410> up<00:03:13.830> until<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.670> point<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.180> want<00:03:15.270> to

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
change up until that point you want to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.330 
change up until that point you want to
change<00:03:15.600> out<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> depth<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.260> everything<00:03:16.620> I'm

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
change out the depth in everything I'm

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.050 
change out the depth in everything I'm
not<00:03:17.640> just<00:03:17.880> as<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:18.959> see<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.590> changes

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
not just as you can see it just changes

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.330 
not just as you can see it just changes
that<00:03:21.060> said<00:03:21.239> what<00:03:21.360> we<00:03:21.420> do<00:03:21.660> now<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.350> highlight

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that said what we do now is highlight

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.220 
that said what we do now is highlight
make<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.450> less<00:03:24.870> opaque<00:03:27.080> anyone<00:03:28.080> like

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
make it a bit less opaque anyone like

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.080 
make it a bit less opaque anyone like
this<00:03:28.320> reddish<00:03:28.920> or<00:03:29.370> depending<00:03:29.730> on<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.060> know

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
this reddish or depending on you know

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.490 
this reddish or depending on you know
what<00:03:30.959> texture<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.680> that's<00:03:31.830> red<00:03:32.100> make<00:03:33.030> it

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
what texture it is so that's red make it

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.870 
what texture it is so that's red make it
lighter<00:03:34.500> red<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.190> still<00:03:35.400> sort<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.670> blends

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
lighter red so it still sort of blends

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.300 
lighter red so it still sort of blends
in<00:03:36.060> all<00:03:36.209> right<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.880> make<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.540> overlay<00:03:40.530> yep

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
in all right and the make it overlay yep

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.190 
in all right and the make it overlay yep
we<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.910> actually<00:03:42.150> play<00:03:42.360> on<00:03:42.390> all<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.810> these<00:03:42.989> and

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
we can actually play on all of these and

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.850 
we can actually play on all of these and
so<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.320> looks<00:03:43.500> best

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
so it looks best

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.890 
so it looks best
I<00:03:43.950> think<00:03:44.840> else<00:03:45.840> all<00:03:46.620> right<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:47.489> suppose<00:03:47.910> and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
I think else all right I suppose and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.570 
I think else all right I suppose and
also<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.650> want<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.800> make<00:03:49.920> sure<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.160> colors

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
also you want to make sure the colors

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.050 
also you want to make sure the colors
match<00:03:51.650> real<00:03:52.650> redstone<00:03:53.160> or<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> actual<00:03:53.670> color

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
match real redstone or the actual color

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.020 
match real redstone or the actual color
of<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.350> default<00:03:55.769> texture<00:03:56.670> pack<00:03:56.700> so

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
of it in the default texture pack so

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.970 
of it in the default texture pack so
that<00:03:57.180> looks<00:03:57.360> actually<00:03:58.320> all<00:03:58.560> right<00:03:58.739> for<00:03:58.920> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
that looks actually all right for the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.050 
that looks actually all right for the
moment<00:04:00.260> yeah<00:04:01.260> basically<00:04:01.830> what<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.370> did<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.850> I

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
moment yeah basically what I did is I

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.340 
moment yeah basically what I did is I
just<00:04:03.090> mucked<00:04:03.450> around<00:04:03.600> with<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.170> ages

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
just mucked around with this for ages

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.890 
just mucked around with this for ages
until<00:04:04.830> it's<00:04:05.220> something<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.519> yeah

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
until it's something that yeah

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.199 
until it's something that yeah
felt<00:04:07.320> looks<00:04:07.590> quite<00:04:07.920> good<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.700> also<00:04:08.850> do<00:04:09.000> chisel

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
felt looks quite good and also do chisel

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.750 
felt looks quite good and also do chisel
hard<00:04:09.480> as<00:04:09.750> work<00:04:10.050> now<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.350> can't<00:04:12.470> maybe<00:04:13.470> not<00:04:13.830> no

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
hard as work now you can't maybe not no

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.199 
hard as work now you can't maybe not no
no<00:04:15.000> chisel<00:04:15.720> soft<00:04:15.870> thing<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.290> think<00:04:17.209> sometimes

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
no chisel soft thing I think sometimes

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.970 
no chisel soft thing I think sometimes
chisel<00:04:18.959> hard<00:04:19.109> works<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.650> make<00:04:19.769> something

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
chisel hard works and make something

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.039 
chisel hard works and make something
that's<00:04:20.220> similar<00:04:20.640> but<00:04:20.820> not<00:04:21.390> exactly<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> same

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
that's similar but not exactly the same

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.870 
that's similar but not exactly the same
so<00:04:22.740> that's<00:04:22.830> good<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.100> start<00:04:23.280> off<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.610> now<00:04:23.820> I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
so that's good to start off with now I

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.450 
so that's good to start off with now I
go<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.150> outer<00:04:24.479> glow<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.169> that's<00:04:26.130> not<00:04:26.220> going<00:04:26.370> to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
go to outer glow and that's not going to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.880 
go to outer glow and that's not going to
work<00:04:26.550> because<00:04:26.910> we've<00:04:27.210> got

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
work because we've got

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.240 
work because we've got
laying<00:04:28.890> last<00:04:29.160> gun<00:04:30.650> okay<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:31.800> when<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:31.920> do<00:04:32.190> is

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
laying last gun okay but when you do is

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.000 
laying last gun okay but when you do is
make<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.670> outer<00:04:32.910> glow<00:04:33.240> here<00:04:33.890> don't<00:04:34.890> worry

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
make this outer glow here don't worry

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.290 
make this outer glow here don't worry
about<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.310> for<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.670> moment<00:04:35.730> just<00:04:36.060> worry

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
about that for the moment just worry

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.090 
about that for the moment just worry
about<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.600> inside<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.110> texture<00:04:37.470> now

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
about this inside of the texture now

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.910 
about this inside of the texture now
it's<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.370> glow<00:04:38.930> make<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:39.960> bit<00:04:40.170> yeah<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.560> spreads

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
it's a glow make a bit yeah it spreads

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.320 
it's a glow make a bit yeah it spreads
all<00:04:41.100> right<00:04:43.670> yeah<00:04:44.670> that's<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:44.970> life<00:04:45.150> at<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
all right yeah that's the life at the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.500 
all right yeah that's the life at the
moment<00:04:45.600> um<00:04:46.410> need<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.310> make<00:04:47.430> that<00:04:47.580> softer<00:04:48.300> light

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
moment um need to make that softer light

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.890 
moment um need to make that softer light
and<00:04:49.250> make<00:04:50.250> sure<00:04:50.550> it's<00:04:50.730> reddish<00:04:51.360> again<00:04:53.870> yeah<00:04:54.870> I

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
and make sure it's reddish again yeah I

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.900 
and make sure it's reddish again yeah I
think<00:04:55.020> we'll<00:04:55.200> just<00:04:55.290> pretend<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:55.680> no<00:04:56.670> help

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
think we'll just pretend this no help

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.880 
think we'll just pretend this no help
spread<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.300> size<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.570> little<00:04:57.900> bit

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
spread this size a little bit

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.450 
spread this size a little bit
don't<00:04:59.790> let<00:04:59.910> me<00:05:00.060> go<00:05:00.290> smaller<00:05:01.290> than<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.770> now

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
don't let me go smaller than that now

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.740 
don't let me go smaller than that now
we'll<00:05:02.610> just<00:05:02.700> leave<00:05:02.850> at<00:05:03.030> at<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.180> moment<00:05:03.300> what

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
we'll just leave at at the moment what

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.190 
we'll just leave at at the moment what
we<00:05:03.840> can<00:05:04.020> do<00:05:04.170> is<00:05:04.350> just<00:05:04.560> drag<00:05:04.770> this<00:05:04.950> out<00:05:05.100> here<00:05:06.200> go

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
we can do is just drag this out here go

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.200 
we can do is just drag this out here go
over<00:05:07.230> all<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.770> edges<00:05:08.360> we've<00:05:09.360> ctrl<00:05:10.140> backspace

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
over all the edges we've ctrl backspace

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.510 
over all the edges we've ctrl backspace
oops

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
oops

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720 
oops
take<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.640> back<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.000> middle<00:05:16.730> ctrl

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
take it back to the middle ctrl

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:26.900 
take it back to the middle ctrl
backspace<00:05:20.330> out<00:05:21.330> again<00:05:23.750> ctrl<00:05:24.750> backspace<00:05:25.910> the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
backspace out again ctrl backspace the

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.250 
backspace out again ctrl backspace the
same<00:05:27.120> thing<00:05:27.300> for<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.510> bottom<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:30.270> this

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
same thing for the bottom and this

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.830 
same thing for the bottom and this
should<00:05:31.440> be<00:05:31.470> nothing<00:05:32.070> around<00:05:32.790> the<00:05:33.030> edges<00:05:33.660> this

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
should be nothing around the edges this

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.860 
should be nothing around the edges this
time<00:05:34.050> that's<00:05:34.530> right<00:05:34.800> now<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.040> can<00:05:35.280> also<00:05:35.870> go

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
time that's right now you can also go

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.560 
time that's right now you can also go
over<00:05:37.310> these<00:05:38.310> little<00:05:38.580> weed<00:05:38.880> bits<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:39.360> black<00:05:39.540> a

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
over these little weed bits and black a

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.570 
over these little weed bits and black a
bit<00:05:39.780> more<00:05:39.980> if<00:05:40.980> I<00:05:41.070> get<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.250> proper<00:05:41.520> brush<00:05:43.580> over

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
bit more if I get a proper brush over

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.130 
bit more if I get a proper brush over
these<00:05:44.760> weird<00:05:45.150> bits<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:45.780> don't<00:05:45.930> know<00:05:45.990> why

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
these weird bits I don't know why

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.050 
these weird bits I don't know why
they're<00:05:46.350> there<00:05:48.530> we'll<00:05:49.530> just<00:05:49.650> see<00:05:49.860> over<00:05:50.160> as<00:05:50.790> you

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
they're there we'll just see over as you

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.220 
they're there we'll just see over as you
can<00:05:51.150> see<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.360> can<00:05:51.480> drag<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:51.690> brush<00:05:51.990> out<00:05:52.170> and

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
can see you can drag the brush out and

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.040 
can see you can drag the brush out and
make<00:05:52.440> some<00:05:52.970> more<00:05:53.970> wacky<00:05:54.300> effects<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:54.960> things

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
make some more wacky effects and things

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.020 
make some more wacky effects and things
actually<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.980> know<00:05:56.100> quite<00:05:56.400> cool<00:05:56.670> just<00:05:56.850> make

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
actually you know quite cool just make

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.020 
actually you know quite cool just make
and<00:05:57.930> if<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.140> put<00:05:58.770> black<00:05:58.950> on<00:05:59.070> I<00:05:59.520> can<00:05:59.850> get<00:05:59.940> the

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
and if I put black on I can get the

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.400 
and if I put black on I can get the
texture<00:06:00.360> why<00:06:00.480> is<00:06:00.540> it<00:06:00.780> you<00:06:01.050> know<00:06:01.110> it's<00:06:01.290> really

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
texture why is it you know it's really

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.960 
texture why is it you know it's really
up<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.770> what<00:06:01.890> you<00:06:01.920> want<00:06:01.980> to<00:06:02.130> do<00:06:02.280> that's<00:06:02.850> a

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
up to you what you want to do that's a

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.370 
up to you what you want to do that's a
good<00:06:03.090> texture<00:06:03.450> start<00:06:03.690> off<00:06:03.780> with<00:06:03.960> us<00:06:04.080> suppose

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
good texture start off with us suppose

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
so coolly I put a bit bit lower now

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.020 
so coolly I put a bit bit lower now
actually<00:06:44.940> looks<00:06:45.889> pretty<00:06:46.889> good<00:06:47.280> I'll<00:06:47.490> sing<00:06:47.789> and

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
actually looks pretty good I'll sing and

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.510 
actually looks pretty good I'll sing and
so<00:06:48.930> the<00:06:49.050> same<00:06:49.229> thing<00:06:49.409> applies<00:06:49.710> for<00:06:49.740> diamonds

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
so the same thing applies for diamonds

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.399 
so the same thing applies for diamonds
and<00:06:50.789> you<00:06:51.000> know<00:06:51.120> golden<00:06:51.960> or<00:06:52.050> a<00:06:52.139> thing<00:06:52.289> you<00:06:52.379> just

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:52.409 
and you know golden or a thing you just

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.350 
and you know golden or a thing you just
change<00:06:52.740> the<00:06:52.800> colors<00:06:53.129> accordingly<00:06:53.580> so<00:06:54.270> I<00:06:54.300> think

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
change the colors accordingly so I think

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.649 
change the colors accordingly so I think
