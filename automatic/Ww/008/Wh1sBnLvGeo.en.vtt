see it in this scene but we will see it
in<00:00:34.410> later<00:00:34.649> ones<00:00:34.950> coming<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
in later ones coming up and what the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.360 
in later ones coming up and what the
patch<00:00:36.719> aims<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.649> make<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> foreground

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
patch aims to do is make the foreground

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
patch aims to do is make the foreground
sharper<00:00:39.090> while<00:00:39.480> still<00:00:39.809> retaining<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.350> nice

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
sharper while still retaining the nice

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
sharper while still retaining the nice
blurred<00:00:41.040> background<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> original

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
blurred background of the original

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.720 
blurred background of the original
Dynavision<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.040> two<00:00:44.190> versions<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
Dynavision so there are two versions of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.400 
Dynavision so there are two versions of
this<00:00:45.030> mod<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.629> first<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.140> make<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
this mod the first will make the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.680 
this mod the first will make the
foreground<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.160> blurred<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> background

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
foreground as blurred as the background

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
foreground as blurred as the background
in<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.110> scene<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> swipes

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
in this scene so as you see as it swipes

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
in this scene so as you see as it swipes
across<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> foreground<00:00:51.899> becoming<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.469> very

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
across the foreground becoming a very

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
across the foreground becoming a very
blurred<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.670> matches<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
blurred and actually matches with the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
blurred and actually matches with the
blurriness<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> background<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:56.370> later

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
blurriness of the background in later

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
blurriness of the background in later
scenes<00:00:56.910> we'll<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.239> how<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.629> version<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
scenes we'll see how this version of the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
scenes we'll see how this version of the
mod<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:59.070> quite<00:00:59.280> sharp<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.789> very

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
mod is actually quite sharp on very

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
mod is actually quite sharp on very
close<00:01:00.359> objects<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.989> blurs<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> background

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
close objects and blurs the background

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
close objects and blurs the background
quite<00:01:02.340> nicely<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.300> swipe<00:01:03.510> across<00:01:03.660> with

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
quite nicely so if I swipe across with

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.630 
quite nicely so if I swipe across with
my<00:01:03.989> preferred<00:01:04.439> version<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> mod<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
my preferred version of the mod which is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
my preferred version of the mod which is
the<00:01:05.729> second<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.330> download<00:01:06.840> section

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the second one in the download section

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
the second one in the download section
the<00:01:08.159> other<00:01:08.189> DS<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.670> been<00:01:08.820> pushed<00:01:09.090> back

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the other DS have been pushed back

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820 
the other DS have been pushed back
slightly<00:01:09.600> again<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> nice

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
slightly again so we have the nice

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
slightly again so we have the nice
blurred<00:01:11.100> background<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.180> sharp

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
blurred background and the sharp

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.630 
blurred background and the sharp
foreground<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.040> scene<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> will

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
foreground now in this scene this will

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
foreground now in this scene this will
look<00:01:14.760> exactly<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.360> same<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> original

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
look exactly the same as the original

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.800 
look exactly the same as the original
Dynavision<00:01:16.770> static<00:01:17.400> mode<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.270> move<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> some

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
Dynavision static mode if I move to some

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.390 
Dynavision static mode if I move to some
of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> scenes<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:19.439> we'll<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.770> how<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> two

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
of the scenes now we'll see how the two

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.399 
of the scenes now we'll see how the two
versions<00:01:20.880> compare<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:22.049> close-up

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
versions compare on very close-up

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.149 
versions compare on very close-up
objects<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.500> looking<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.009> my

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
objects so here we are looking at my

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
objects so here we are looking at my
character<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> original<00:01:27.270> static

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
character with the original static

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.910 
character with the original static
version<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.110> Dynavision<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
version of Dynavision that's the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.670 
version of Dynavision that's the
original<00:01:29.040> mod<00:01:29.460> by<00:01:29.880> gopher<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.350> apply

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
original mod by gopher so if I now apply

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.980 
original mod by gopher so if I now apply
the<00:01:31.799> first<00:01:32.310> version<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.270> patch<00:01:33.570> remember

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
quite a nice blend now if I swipe again

we<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> towers<00:01:56.490> become<00:01:56.880> nice<00:01:57.149> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
we see that the towers become nice and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.539 
we see that the towers become nice and
clear<00:01:57.689> again<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.320> our<00:01:58.649> character<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.280> still

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
really quite a nice change now walking

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.910 
really quite a nice change now walking
around<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.060> version<00:02:12.450> one<00:02:12.629> of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
pache you may find the foreground it's a

pache you may find the foreground it's a
little<00:02:15.470> bit<00:02:15.590> too<00:02:15.709> blurred<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:17.120> become<00:02:17.270> a

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
little bit too blurred and can become a

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.380 
little bit too blurred and can become a
little<00:02:17.810> bit<00:02:18.250> disorientating<00:02:19.250> objects<00:02:20.180> only

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
little bit disorientating objects only

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.930 
little bit disorientating objects only
become<00:02:20.720> sharp<00:02:21.080> if<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.380> get<00:02:21.560> quite<00:02:21.860> close<00:02:22.130> but

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
become sharp if you get quite close but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.570 
become sharp if you get quite close but
it<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.180> quite<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> nice<00:02:23.750> effect<00:02:24.410> however<00:02:25.250> with

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
it is quite a nice effect however with

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.130 
it is quite a nice effect however with
version<00:02:25.819> 2<00:02:26.390> you'll<00:02:26.690> find<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
version 2 you'll find that the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.110 
version 2 you'll find that the
foreground<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.709> really<00:02:28.099> sharp<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.730> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
foreground is really sharp and the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.510 
foreground is really sharp and the
background<00:02:29.600> retains<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.440> static<00:02:31.160> effect

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
background retains that static effect

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.820 
background retains that static effect
from<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.880> original<00:02:32.270> Dynavision<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.110> that's

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
from the original Dynavision and that's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.680 
from the original Dynavision and that's
why<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.220> my<00:02:34.340> preferred<00:02:34.730> version<00:02:35.150> because<00:02:35.600> it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
why it's my preferred version because it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.540 
why it's my preferred version because it
takes<00:02:35.870> away<00:02:36.110> some<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.470> blurriness<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
takes away some of the blurriness of the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.520 
takes away some of the blurriness of the
original<00:02:37.940> mod<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.360> that's<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.930> nice<00:02:39.110> sharp

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
original mod and that's the nice sharp

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.780 
original mod and that's the nice sharp
effect<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.069> would<00:02:40.220> find<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
effect that you would find in the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.110 
effect that you would find in the
dynamic<00:02:41.540> version<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.370> as<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.700> watch<00:02:43.819> another

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
