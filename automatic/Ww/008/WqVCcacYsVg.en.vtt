00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:21.779
 the Brazilian state is a lay state 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:26.350
 but quoting the psalm of David 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:37.420
 I wanted to say that happy is the nation whose 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:42.790
 God, you have helped to return the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:46.570
 hope to the poor the most 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.300
 needy and excluded 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.879
 Brazil beyond 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.769
 have strengthened the role of family and 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.070
 within the family 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.650
 the female role within the group 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.280
 familiar with the role that 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.540
 we have in common the dedication those 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.220
 What else do you need? 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.280
 and this is an excellent opportunity to 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.100
 talk a little about what we have 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.610
 We have done our part 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.020
 in government I am sure that in the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.270
 brazil never supported and strengthened 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 we invest both in the family and in my 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 government and we know that women and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.890
 especially mothers have a role today 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.469
 decisive in Brazilian families in their 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:51.210
 strengthening in the valuation and 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:55.450
 adoption of those fundamental values 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:00.570
 for a nation and for the state to be 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.979
 fact a nation and a committed state 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.450
 for the good of all 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:10.420
 but I want to tell you that 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.930
 this partnership, which is the recognition 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.920
 political humility that without us 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:22.269
 realize the wealth that is your action 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.730
 in all the communities in which you 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:30.220
 come in which you exercise the 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:37.120
 evangelization and in which you exercise 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:41.250
 also all the assistance actions we 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.069
 we arrived a lot faster 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.430
 I believe in those who believe 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:55.750
 I believe in the power of prayer in 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:59.200
 The Bible in the bible states that 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 prayer of a righteous man can greatly in his 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.680
 effects 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.710
 I will ask you for this very 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.880
 while you return to your states 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:20.330
 and municipalities 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:26.560
 do not forget oracle means me 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:32.030
 also to you that all the leaders 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.680
 depend on the vote of the people and the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.680
 Thank you, me too. 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.810
 therefore 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:47.030
 Thank you very much for everything and happy the nation. 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.030
 A god, thank you. 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.610
 Hmm
