a Meccano two-speed automatic gearbox

this was made by Michael Edwards in the

this was made by Michael Edwards in the

automatic<00:00:10.170> gearboxes<00:00:10.740> there's<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> centrifuge

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
automatic gearboxes there's a centrifuge

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.870 
automatic gearboxes there's a centrifuge
here<00:00:12.030> which<00:00:12.900> provides<00:00:13.380> sideways<00:00:14.040> movement<00:00:14.700> as

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
here which provides sideways movement as

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.560 
here which provides sideways movement as
it<00:00:15.030> speeds<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:16.170> engage<00:00:16.560> different<00:00:17.070> gears

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
it speeds up to engage different gears

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.269 
it speeds up to engage different gears
what's<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.660> bit<00:00:18.779> unusual<00:00:18.930> about<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.039> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
what's a bit unusual about it is that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.519 
what's a bit unusual about it is that
the<00:00:21.000> movement<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.750> actually<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> lathe

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the movement is actually on a lathe

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.810 
the movement is actually on a lathe
shaft<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.990> rod<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.680> moved<00:00:25.980> over<00:00:26.220> by

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
shaft so that that rod is moved over by

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.720 
shaft so that that rod is moved over by
the<00:00:27.480> centrifuge<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:28.619> these<00:00:28.830> three<00:00:29.400> rods

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the centrifuge and then these three rods

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
the centrifuge and then these three rods
here<00:00:30.590> get<00:00:31.590> moved<00:00:31.859> over<00:00:32.130> also<00:00:33.230> at<00:00:34.230> very<00:00:34.530> low

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
here get moved over also at very low

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.310 
here get moved over also at very low
speeds<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.969> doesn't<00:00:36.360> drive<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> output<00:00:36.780> at

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
speeds it doesn't drive the output at

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.119 
speeds it doesn't drive the output at
all<00:00:37.579> because<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.469> sort<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.559> dog<00:00:40.829> clutch

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
all because this sort like dog clutch

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.940 
all because this sort like dog clutch
arrangement<00:00:41.850> doesn't<00:00:42.270> engage<00:00:42.500> as<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> speeds

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
arrangement doesn't engage as it speeds

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.990 
arrangement doesn't engage as it speeds
up<00:00:44.480> dog<00:00:45.480> clutch<00:00:45.809> engages<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.980> low<00:00:47.579> gear

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
up dog clutch engages for low gear

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020 
up dog clutch engages for low gear
that's<00:00:48.450> on/off<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.230> gear<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.940> when<00:00:50.940> it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that's on/off this gear will when it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.819 
that's on/off this gear will when it
speeds<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.480> even<00:00:51.840> more<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> goes<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.620> high

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
speeds up even more it goes into high

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
speeds up even more it goes into high
gear<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.969> things<00:00:54.239> happen<00:00:54.719> there

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
gear and two things happen there

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.040 
gear and two things happen there
one<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> low<00:00:56.340> gear<00:00:56.750> disengages<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
one is that low gear disengages and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
one is that low gear disengages and
that's<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.440> done<00:00:58.710> underneath<00:00:59.010> from

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that's actually done underneath from

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.460 
that's actually done underneath from
this<00:00:59.870> socket<00:01:00.870> coupling<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.680> actually

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
this socket coupling it actually

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.940 
this socket coupling it actually
disengages<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.460> end<00:01:06.000> gear<00:01:06.479> wheel<00:01:06.950> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
disengages from this end gear wheel the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.640 
disengages from this end gear wheel the
gear<00:01:08.130> wheel<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> long<00:01:09.150> grub<00:01:09.960> screw<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
gear wheel has a long grub screw on it

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
gear wheel has a long grub screw on it
which<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.189> disengages<00:01:11.580> from<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> coupling

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
which it disengages from the coupling

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
which it disengages from the coupling
and<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.799> top<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:15.290> engages<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.740> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and the top one here engages with this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.380 
and the top one here engages with this
bolt<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:19.220> there's<00:01:20.220> also<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.490> spring<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.210> make

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
bolt here there's also a spring to make

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.070 
bolt here there's also a spring to make
sure<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.520> centrifuge<00:01:23.520> moves<00:01:24.240> slowly

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
sure that the centrifuge moves slowly

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.660 
sure that the centrifuge moves slowly
over<00:01:25.880> that's<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.090> working

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.599 

but<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:33.969> is<00:01:34.319> idling<00:01:35.319> it<00:01:35.770> does<00:01:35.950> move<00:01:36.189> slightly

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
but this is idling it does move slightly

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.109 
but this is idling it does move slightly
the<00:01:37.030> output<00:01:37.509> but<00:01:37.990> some<00:01:38.259> it's<00:01:38.499> basically<00:01:39.119> by

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
the output but some it's basically by

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.590 
the output but some it's basically by
doing<00:01:40.509> not<00:01:40.780> not<00:01:41.079> turning<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.679> neutral<00:01:42.600> that's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
doing not not turning in neutral that's

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.139 
doing not not turning in neutral that's
where<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.899> speed<00:01:44.350> up<00:01:47.399> goes<00:01:48.399> into<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.850> first

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
where you speed up goes into the first

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.660 
where you speed up goes into the first
gear<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.340> job<00:01:51.759> plus<00:01:52.030> is<00:01:52.329> engaged<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
gear so that job plus is engaged and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.350 
gear so that job plus is engaged and
then<00:01:54.819> we're<00:01:54.969> going<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.270> high<00:01:55.780> gear

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.050 

now<00:02:01.360> Jerry

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.350 

doesn't<00:02:06.630> work<00:02:06.750> quite<00:02:07.229> well
