00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
think because they're so close on the
actual<00:01:23.159> world<00:01:23.340> map<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.270> take<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> bus<00:01:24.720> from

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
actual world map you can take a bus from

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.899 
actual world map you can take a bus from
transit<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.680> Newtown<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.549> Newtown

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
transit to Newtown if you have Newtown

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.760 
transit to Newtown if you have Newtown
that's<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.720> theory<00:01:27.990> that's<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.680> I'm

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that's my theory that's what I'm

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
that's my theory that's what I'm
sticking<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.700> got<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> find<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.210> other

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
sticking with we got to find this other

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.840 
sticking with we got to find this other
bus<00:01:30.600> there<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:30.930> two<00:01:31.320> buses<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.280> daytime

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
bus there are two buses this is daytime

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
bus there are two buses this is daytime
right<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.240> they're<00:01:33.390> playing<00:01:33.540> transit<00:01:34.079> there

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
right now they're playing transit there

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
right now they're playing transit there
is<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> night<00:01:34.740> bus<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.909> can't

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is a night bus out there and we can't

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.940 
is a night bus out there and we can't
find<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:37.049> clocks<00:01:37.380> may<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.799> something

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
find it these clocks may have something

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.020 
find it these clocks may have something
to<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.400> there's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
to do with it there's a lot of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.640 
to do with it there's a lot of
speculation<00:01:39.630> around<00:01:40.020> these<00:01:40.170> clocks<00:01:40.350> because

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
speculation around these clocks because

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.260 
speculation around these clocks because
look<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.920> magic<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.000> clock

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
look at magic see right there that clock

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
look at magic see right there that clock
right<00:01:42.570> there<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.350> location<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.189> the

right there in the same location in the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
starting room is different than the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.569

other<00:01:46.020> two<00:01:46.110> clocks<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> showed<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.100> two

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
other two clocks that I showed you two

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
other two clocks that I showed you two
of<00:01:47.670> them<00:01:47.790> say<00:01:47.939> 7:15<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:48.990> says

of them say 7:15 out of the one says

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.080 
of them say 7:15 out of the one says
like<00:01:49.259> five<00:01:49.439> o'clock<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:49.920> something

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
like five o'clock or something

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.980 
like five o'clock or something
something's<00:01:51.090> messed<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> there's

something's messed up with that there's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780 
something's messed up with that there's

the<00:02:07.079> bridge<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the bridge this is right in the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.979 
the bridge this is right in the
beginning<00:02:08.759> where<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.569> backwards

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
beginning where you can go backwards

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.780 
beginning where you can go backwards
from<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> starting<00:02:10.590> point<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.489> get<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
from the starting point you get to the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.090 
from the starting point you get to the
bridge<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.239> when<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.450> step<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
bridge and when you step on that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.040 
bridge and when you step on that
it's<00:02:13.430> weird<00:02:13.730> even<00:02:14.600> when<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.780> step<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:14.990> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
it's weird even when you step on the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.910 
it's weird even when you step on the
bridge<00:02:15.170> by<00:02:15.260> yourself<00:02:15.530> you'll<00:02:15.620> see<00:02:15.740> right<00:02:15.860> here

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
bridge by yourself you'll see right here

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.170 
bridge by yourself you'll see right here
in<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.100> second<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.370> bridge<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.670> perfectly<00:02:16.970> fine

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
in a second the bridge is perfectly fine

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.670 
in a second the bridge is perfectly fine
as<00:02:17.450> soon<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.870> lay<00:02:18.050> foot<00:02:18.290> in<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.410> bridge

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
as soon as you lay foot in that bridge

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.490 
as soon as you lay foot in that bridge
it<00:02:19.250> rumbles<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:19.970> breaks<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:21.080> doesn't<00:02:21.440> make

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
it rumbles and breaks that doesn't make

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.110 
it rumbles and breaks that doesn't make
any<00:02:21.650> sense<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.950> me<00:02:22.070> is<00:02:22.280> Treyarch<00:02:22.730> calling<00:02:23.030> me

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
any sense to me is Treyarch calling me

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.580 
any sense to me is Treyarch calling me
fat<00:02:23.360> am<00:02:23.540> i<00:02:23.630> that<00:02:23.780> fat<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.260> walk<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
fat am i that fat that I walk in the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.680 
fat am i that fat that I walk in the
bridge<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:24.980> breaks<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.340> don't<00:02:25.520> think<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:25.910> it

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
bridge and it breaks I don't think so it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.480 
bridge and it breaks I don't think so it
also<00:02:27.170> happens<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.680> bus<00:02:27.830> goes<00:02:28.070> on<00:02:28.220> it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
also happens with the bus goes on it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.310 
also happens with the bus goes on it
but<00:02:28.730> why<00:02:29.000> does<00:02:29.270> this<00:02:29.360> happen<00:02:29.600> there's<00:02:29.960> this<00:02:30.110> I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
but why does this happen there's this I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.140 
but why does this happen there's this I
feel<00:02:30.650> like<00:02:30.680> there's<00:02:31.010> some<00:02:31.220> reason<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.970> that

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
feel like there's some reason that that

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.790 
feel like there's some reason that that
thing<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.840> bridge<00:02:33.110> breaks<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.770> that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
thing that the bridge breaks like that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.110 
thing that the bridge breaks like that
it<00:02:34.100> wouldn't<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.370> break<00:02:34.670> normally<00:02:35.030> unless

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
it wouldn't just break normally unless

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.340 
it wouldn't just break normally unless
they're<00:02:35.300> trying<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.540> indicate<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:36.050> this

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
they're trying to indicate that this

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.080 
they're trying to indicate that this
bridge<00:02:36.560> has<00:02:36.590> some<00:02:36.800> relevance<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.430> us<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.700> think

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
bridge has some relevance to us I think

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.760 
bridge has some relevance to us I think
I<00:02:38.270> don't<00:02:38.510> know<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.750> don't<00:02:38.960> know<00:02:39.080> otherwise<00:02:39.440> why

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
I don't know I don't know otherwise why

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
I don't know I don't know otherwise why
the<00:02:39.830> bridge<00:02:40.040> would<00:02:40.160> break<00:02:40.370> other<00:02:40.520> than<00:02:40.670> that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
the bridge would break other than that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.340 
the bridge would break other than that
you<00:02:40.910> know<00:02:41.000> maybe<00:02:41.180> there's<00:02:41.450> lava<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.930> it's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
you know maybe there's lava and it's

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.810 
you know maybe there's lava and it's
been<00:02:42.500> almost<00:02:42.830> ready<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.250> break<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.550> as<00:02:43.640> soon<00:02:43.760> as

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
been almost ready to break in as soon as

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.860 
been almost ready to break in as soon as
you<00:02:43.910> put<00:02:44.060> any<00:02:44.210> weight<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.660> breaks

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
you put any weight on it it breaks

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.080 
you put any weight on it it breaks
because<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.920> lot<00:02:46.340> below<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.850> that's<00:02:47.030> a

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
because of the lot below it that's a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.790 
because of the lot below it that's a
possibility<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.170> think<00:02:48.440> there's<00:02:48.560> more

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
possibility but I do think there's more

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.530 
possibility but I do think there's more
meaning<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.340> bridge<00:02:49.610> breaking<00:02:50.150> than

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
meaning to this bridge breaking than

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.210 
meaning to this bridge breaking than
that<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.050> figured<00:02:51.470> I'd<00:02:51.560> listen<00:02:51.770> this<00:02:51.860> guy<00:02:52.040> he

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
that so I figured I'd listen this guy he

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.830 
that so I figured I'd listen this guy he
said<00:02:52.370> there's<00:02:52.490> an<00:02:52.580> app<00:02:52.760> card<00:02:53.060> his<00:02:53.450> friend

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
said there's an app card his friend

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.500 
said there's an app card his friend
found<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.500> nab<00:02:54.710> card<00:02:55.070> under<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.610> bridge<00:02:55.880> okay

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
found a nab card under the bridge okay

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.300 
found a nab card under the bridge okay
so<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.170> went<00:02:57.290> over<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.560> bridge<00:02:57.770> I'm<00:02:58.040> here

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
so I went over to the bridge I'm here

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.850 
so I went over to the bridge I'm here
the<00:02:58.430> bridge<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.820> looked<00:02:59.120> for<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.810> 20<00:03:00.440> minutes

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
the bridge I looked for like 20 minutes

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.920 
the bridge I looked for like 20 minutes
there's<00:03:01.310> no<00:03:01.610> nav<00:03:01.820> card<00:03:02.120> here<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.600> even<00:03:02.870> if

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
there's no nav card here and even if

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.120 
there's no nav card here and even if
there<00:03:03.050> wasn't<00:03:03.170> have<00:03:03.380> no<00:03:03.500> an<00:03:03.620> AB<00:03:03.740> card<00:03:04.010> you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
there wasn't have no an AB card you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.230 
there wasn't have no an AB card you
can't<00:03:04.400> get<00:03:04.520> under<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.730> bridge<00:03:04.850> there's<00:03:05.060> no

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
can't get under the bridge there's no

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.880 
can't get under the bridge there's no
way<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.420> get<00:03:05.540> into<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.750> bridge<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.170> tried

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
way to get into the bridge I tried

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.170 
way to get into the bridge I tried
everything<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.280> went<00:03:07.430> around<00:03:07.490> all<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.850> corners

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
everything I went around all the corners

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.760 
everything I went around all the corners
I<00:03:08.330> look<00:03:08.480> up<00:03:08.630> top<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.050> thought<00:03:09.380> maybe<00:03:09.530> if<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.710> go

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
I look up top I thought maybe if you go

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.930 
I look up top I thought maybe if you go
on<00:03:09.860> top<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.100> bus<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.430> can<00:03:10.550> get<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.790> there's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
on top the bus you can get it there's

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.790 
on top the bus you can get it there's
nothing<00:03:11.150> there's<00:03:11.750> absolutely<00:03:12.200> no<00:03:12.350> NAB<00:03:12.530> card

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
nothing there's absolutely no NAB card

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.500 
nothing there's absolutely no NAB card
at<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.950> bridge<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.340> can<00:03:13.520> find<00:03:13.670> any<00:03:13.850> way<00:03:14.030> and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
at the bridge that can find any way and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.370 
at the bridge that can find any way and
as<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:14.900> right<00:03:14.990> there<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.170> already

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
as you can see right there I already

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.200 
as you can see right there I already
have<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> nav<00:03:15.800> card<00:03:16.070> now<00:03:16.550> what<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:16.700> do<00:03:16.790> think

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
have a nav card now what I do think

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.610 
have a nav card now what I do think
based<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.600> theory<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.900> said<00:03:18.080> about<00:03:18.230> earlier

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
based on the theory I said about earlier

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.040 
based on the theory I said about earlier
is<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.190> if<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.820> get<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.270> other<00:03:20.450> NAB<00:03:20.720> card

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
is that if you get this other NAB card

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.840 
is that if you get this other NAB card
the<00:03:21.260> supposed<00:03:21.650> nav<00:03:21.890> card<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.280> would<00:03:22.400> work<00:03:22.610> in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
the supposed nav card that would work in

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.430 
the supposed nav card that would work in
the<00:03:23.180> nav<00:03:23.330> table<00:03:23.810> because<00:03:23.990> this<00:03:24.080> one<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.350> we

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
the nav table because this one that we

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.600 
the nav table because this one that we
have<00:03:24.560> right<00:03:24.710> now<00:03:24.740> doesn't<00:03:25.250> work<00:03:25.370> for<00:03:25.550> some

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
have right now doesn't work for some

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.020 
have right now doesn't work for some
reason

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
reason

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.760 
reason
and<00:03:26.750> nobody<00:03:27.080> can<00:03:27.170> seem<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.350> find<00:03:27.560> one<00:03:27.590> that

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
and nobody can seem to find one that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.790 
and nobody can seem to find one that
works<00:03:27.950> they've<00:03:28.250> only<00:03:28.400> found<00:03:28.550> one<00:03:28.700> behind<00:03:29.800> the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
works they've only found one behind the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.960 
works they've only found one behind the
starting<00:03:31.130> room<00:03:31.250> where<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.430> showed<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:31.790> guys<00:03:31.820> a

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
starting room where I showed you guys a

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.880 
starting room where I showed you guys a
while<00:03:32.210> back<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.960> one<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.290> card<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.740> now

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
while back the one that card I have now

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.990 
while back the one that card I have now
that's<00:03:34.130> where<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.340> got<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:34.700> that's<00:03:34.880> where

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
that's where I got it that's where

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.730 
that's where I got it that's where
everybody<00:03:35.240> gets<00:03:35.390> their<00:03:35.540> nap<00:03:35.690> cards<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.620> do

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
everybody gets their nap cards so I do

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.050 
everybody gets their nap cards so I do
think<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:36.980> snap<00:03:37.220> card<00:03:37.490> is<00:03:37.610> going<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.760> be<00:03:37.820> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
think the snap card is going to be the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.510 
think the snap card is going to be the
waited<00:03:38.480> program<00:03:39.080> or<00:03:39.350> maybe<00:03:39.650> find<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.370> other

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
waited program or maybe find the other

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.270 
waited program or maybe find the other
bus<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:41.600> get<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:42.170> possibly<00:03:42.800> Newtown<00:03:43.250> or

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
bus to get to possibly Newtown or

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.430 
bus to get to possibly Newtown or
possibly<00:03:43.790> another<00:03:43.970> area<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.510> think<00:03:45.140> that's

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
possibly another area I think that's

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.540 
possibly another area I think that's
gonna<00:03:45.590> be<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.740> next<00:03:45.980> step<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.250> think<00:03:46.280> that's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
gonna be the next step I think that's

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.460 
gonna be the next step I think that's
the<00:03:46.730> part<00:03:46.910> after<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.480> Easter<00:03:47.630> Egg<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.350> we

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the part after the Easter Egg that we

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.050 
the part after the Easter Egg that we
can't<00:03:48.740> find<00:03:48.890> out<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.160> Tower<00:03:49.400> of<00:03:49.430> Babel<00:03:49.580> anyway

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
can't find out the Tower of Babel anyway

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.570

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
video with this guy basically Deschutes

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.070 
video with this guy basically Deschutes
this<00:04:00.890> door<00:04:01.160> right<00:04:01.190> here<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.820> basically<00:04:02.540> says

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
this door right here and basically says

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.470 
this door right here and basically says
that<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.890> orb<00:04:04.190> are<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.970> light<00:04:05.150> coming<00:04:05.390> from

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
that the orb are the light coming from

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.880 
that the orb are the light coming from
the<00:04:05.660> tower<00:04:05.840> over<00:04:05.960> there

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
the tower over there

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.400 
the tower over there
you<00:04:07.460> use<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.940> user's<00:04:08.480> gun<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.810> power<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.200> door

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
you use the user's gun to power the door

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.380 
you use the user's gun to power the door
and<00:04:09.710> it<00:04:09.800> actually<00:04:10.220> shoots<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.180> beam

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
and it actually shoots this the beam

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.790 
and it actually shoots this the beam
over<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.900> lightening<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.230> crazy<00:04:12.440> low<00:04:12.590> orb

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
over to the lightening and crazy low orb

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.370 
over to the lightening and crazy low orb
on<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.010> stop<00:04:13.220> light<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:13.840> don't<00:04:14.840> know<00:04:15.020> how

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
on the stop light I don't know how

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.720 
on the stop light I don't know how
legitimate<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.310> really<00:04:16.489> don't<00:04:16.609> think

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
legitimate that is I really don't think

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.039 
legitimate that is I really don't think
there's<00:04:16.970> any<00:04:17.180> relevance<00:04:17.630> right<00:04:17.840> there

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
there's any relevance right there

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.660 
there's any relevance right there
because<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.950> don't<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.280> shoot<00:04:19.400> in<00:04:19.520> any

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
because you don't have to shoot in any

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.150 
because you don't have to shoot in any
way<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.910> already<00:04:20.030> happens<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.410> props

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
way and it already happens so I props

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.710 
way and it already happens so I props
that<00:04:22.460> guy<00:04:22.610> for<00:04:22.880> trying<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.120> find<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.479> and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
that guy for trying to find that and

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.270 
that guy for trying to find that and
looking<00:04:24.110> for<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.470> but<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.890> really<00:04:25.100> don't<00:04:25.250> think

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
looking for it but I really don't think

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.710 
looking for it but I really don't think
that<00:04:25.460> has<00:04:25.550> any<00:04:25.669> significance<00:04:26.210> on<00:04:26.360> the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
that has any significance on the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.630 
that has any significance on the
part<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.140> easter<00:04:27.380> egg<00:04:27.470> or<00:04:27.650> maybe<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.430> maybe

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
part of the easter egg or maybe it maybe

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.280 
part of the easter egg or maybe it maybe
does<00:04:28.880> down<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> road<00:04:29.360> but<00:04:29.630> really<00:04:29.930> right<00:04:30.080> now

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
does down the road but really right now

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.570 
does down the road but really right now
that<00:04:30.530> doesn't<00:04:30.650> seem<00:04:30.890> like<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.220> makes<00:04:31.340> any

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
that doesn't seem like it makes any

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.370 
that doesn't seem like it makes any
sense<00:04:31.820> or<00:04:32.060> fits<00:04:32.330> or<00:04:32.570> there's<00:04:33.080> nothing<00:04:33.320> to

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
sense or fits or there's nothing to

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.930 
sense or fits or there's nothing to
indicate<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:33.860> it's<00:04:34.190> actually<00:04:34.640> doing<00:04:34.880> the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
indicate that it's actually doing the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.340 
indicate that it's actually doing the
easter<00:04:35.180> egg<00:04:35.240> right<00:04:35.510> it's<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.020> just<00:04:36.140> a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
easter egg right it's kind of just a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.680 
easter egg right it's kind of just a
coincidence<00:04:36.950> that<00:04:37.010> it's<00:04:37.220> happening<00:04:37.690> thanks
