00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.799 

once<00:00:05.859> we<00:00:06.100> have<00:00:06.250> our<00:00:06.279> environment<00:00:06.880> set<00:00:07.060> we<00:00:07.660> can

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:07.809 
once we have our environment set we can

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.169 
once we have our environment set we can
change<00:00:07.990> some<00:00:08.230> of<00:00:08.260> the<00:00:08.380> camera<00:00:08.800> settings<00:00:09.179> to

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:10.179 
change some of the camera settings to

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.670 
change some of the camera settings to
better<00:00:10.420> manipulate<00:00:10.990> our<00:00:11.019> scene<00:00:11.440> and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
better manipulate our scene and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.130 
better manipulate our scene and
fine-tune<00:00:12.670> it<00:00:12.820> so<00:00:13.300> to<00:00:13.390> do<00:00:13.600> that<00:00:13.630> we'll<00:00:13.930> click

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.140 
fine-tune it so to do that we'll click

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.950 
fine-tune it so to do that we'll click
on<00:00:14.320> the<00:00:14.470> preview<00:00:14.680> camera<00:00:15.250> and<00:00:15.779> some<00:00:16.779> of<00:00:16.900> the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
on the preview camera and some of the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.330 
on the preview camera and some of the
things<00:00:17.170> that<00:00:17.320> we<00:00:17.410> can<00:00:17.560> change<00:00:17.740> here<00:00:18.039> so<00:00:18.160> we<00:00:18.220> can

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
things that we can change here so we can

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.159 
things that we can change here so we can
change<00:00:18.519> our<00:00:18.699> field<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.150> view<00:00:19.300> so<00:00:19.689> if<00:00:19.869> we<00:00:19.960> wanted

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:20.169 
change our field of view so if we wanted

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.339 
change our field of view so if we wanted
to<00:00:20.640> even<00:00:21.640> increase<00:00:22.119> in<00:00:22.359> or<00:00:22.539> get<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:22.929> fire<00:00:23.169> back

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
to even increase in or get a fire back

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.259 
to even increase in or get a fire back
field<00:00:23.589> of<00:00:23.739> view<00:00:23.829> we<00:00:24.009> can<00:00:24.159> change<00:00:24.550> that<00:00:24.820> scale

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
field of view we can change that scale

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.989 
field of view we can change that scale
that<00:00:25.499> we<00:00:26.499> can<00:00:26.650> also<00:00:26.769> change<00:00:27.069> our<00:00:27.279> aperture<00:00:27.579> to

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
that we can also change our aperture to

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.649 
that we can also change our aperture to
get<00:00:28.839> that<00:00:28.989> beautiful<00:00:29.319> depth<00:00:29.679> of<00:00:29.800> field<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:31.480> we

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:31.659 
get that beautiful depth of field so we

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:32.940 
get that beautiful depth of field so we
can<00:00:31.810> crank<00:00:31.960> it<00:00:32.079> up<00:00:32.169> really<00:00:32.320> large<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.800> get<00:00:32.920> a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
can crank it up really large to get a

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.610 
can crank it up really large to get a
very<00:00:33.130> shallow<00:00:33.430> depth<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:33.880> field<00:00:33.940> I<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:35.500> also

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
very shallow depth of field I can also

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.529 
very shallow depth of field I can also
change<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.039> position<00:00:36.670> target<00:00:37.149> and<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.390> up

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
change the position target and the up

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.410 
change the position target and the up
angle<00:00:38.079> of<00:00:38.320> our<00:00:38.500> camera<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.219> one<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.269> new

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420

where whatever's in the middle of the
scene<00:01:18.610> is<00:01:18.880> perfectly<00:01:19.450> in<00:01:19.540> focus<00:01:19.810> we<00:01:20.770> can<00:01:20.800> turn

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
scene is perfectly in focus we can turn

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.710 
scene is perfectly in focus we can turn
that<00:01:21.280> off<00:01:21.490> though<00:01:21.760> we<00:01:21.970> could<00:01:22.150> turn<00:01:22.300> our<00:01:22.480> auto

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
that off though we could turn our auto

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.420 
that off though we could turn our auto
focus<00:01:23.230> picker<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:23.920> if<00:01:24.010> we<00:01:24.100> wanted<00:01:24.370> to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
focus picker so that if we wanted to

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.000 
focus picker so that if we wanted to
focus<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.570> on<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.690> specific<00:01:25.900> element<00:01:26.710> in<00:01:26.860> our

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
focus in on a specific element in our

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.190 
focus in on a specific element in our
scene<00:01:27.340> we<00:01:28.090> could<00:01:28.270> click<00:01:28.510> on<00:01:28.690> that<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:28.930> the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
scene we could click on that and the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.290 
scene we could click on that and the
depth<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.560> field<00:01:29.770> will<00:01:29.980> focus<00:01:30.220> directly<00:01:30.910> to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
depth of field will focus directly to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.170 
depth of field will focus directly to
that<00:01:31.330> element

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.249

exposure<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.430> independent<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.450> our<00:01:50.659> power<00:01:50.869> of

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
exposure so independent of our power of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.359 
exposure so independent of our power of
our<00:01:51.110> lights<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.680> play<00:01:51.890> around<00:01:52.009> with<00:01:52.250> an

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
our lights we can play around with an

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.070 
our lights we can play around with an
adjuster<00:01:52.759> exposure<00:01:53.179> and<00:01:53.360> that's<00:01:53.539> all<00:01:53.659> done<00:01:53.840> on

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
adjuster exposure and that's all done on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.669 
adjuster exposure and that's all done on
the<00:01:54.590> GPU<00:01:54.920> as<00:01:55.159> well<00:01:55.369> we<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.299> adjust<00:01:56.539> our<00:01:56.750> f-stop

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
the GPU as well we can adjust our f-stop

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.249 
the GPU as well we can adjust our f-stop
and<00:01:57.979> our<00:01:58.070> ISO<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.729> also<00:01:59.659> adjust<00:01:59.899> our<00:02:00.020> gamma

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
and our ISO and also adjust our gamma

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.440 
and our ISO and also adjust our gamma
settings<00:02:00.679> we<00:02:01.520> also<00:02:01.670> can<00:02:01.909> adjust<00:02:02.270> how<00:02:02.390> much

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
settings we also can adjust how much

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.080 
settings we also can adjust how much
vignette<00:02:03.409> away<00:02:03.649> get<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.850> can<00:02:05.000> go

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
vignette away get and so you can go

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.910 
vignette away get and so you can go
really<00:02:05.270> extreme<00:02:05.750> or<00:02:06.020> adjust<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:06.860> to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
really extreme or adjust that to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.800 
really extreme or adjust that to
anywhere<00:02:07.340> you'd<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.520> or<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.300> set<00:02:08.720> your

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
anywhere you'd like or to set your

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.140 
anywhere you'd like or to set your
artistic<00:02:09.519> preference<00:02:10.519> for<00:02:10.700> your<00:02:10.880> image

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
artistic preference for your image

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
artistic preference for your image
they're<00:02:11.989> all<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.709> bunch<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.100> camera

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
they're all so a bunch of camera

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.220 
they're all so a bunch of camera
response<00:02:14.000> curves<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.750> if<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.900> wanted<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
response curves so that if we wanted to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.320 
response curves so that if we wanted to
actually<00:02:15.410> use<00:02:15.769> real<00:02:16.190> camera<00:02:16.610> response<00:02:17.000> curves

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
actually use real camera response curves

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.509 
actually use real camera response curves
we<00:02:17.540> could<00:02:17.690> choose<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.650> any<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.920> these<00:02:18.980> presets

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
we could choose on any of these presets

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.020 
we could choose on any of these presets
and<00:02:19.640> actually<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.959> response<00:02:21.290> curve<00:02:21.620> for

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and actually get the response curve for

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.640 
and actually get the response curve for
that<00:02:23.030> actual<00:02:23.480> camera<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.200> can<00:02:24.319> get<00:02:24.530> some

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
that actual camera so you can get some

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.430 
that actual camera so you can get some
really<00:02:24.890> nice<00:02:25.099> effects<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.200> colorations<00:02:27.200> of

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
really nice effects and colorations of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.400 
really nice effects and colorations of
your<00:02:27.739> render<00:02:28.099> using<00:02:28.730> these<00:02:29.030> settings

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.600 

okay<00:02:36.410> there's<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.890> few<00:02:37.070> more<00:02:37.160> things<00:02:37.460> I'd

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
okay there's just a few more things I'd

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.160 
okay there's just a few more things I'd
like<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> show<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.120> before<00:02:38.270> we<00:02:38.480> finalize<00:02:38.930> up

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
like to show you before we finalize up

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140 
like to show you before we finalize up
so<00:02:39.410> we<00:02:39.950> have<00:02:40.070> our<00:02:40.100> scene<00:02:40.460> continuing<00:02:41.060> to

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
so we have our scene continuing to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.990 
so we have our scene continuing to
render<00:02:41.480> here<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:42.230> if<00:02:42.320> we'd<00:02:42.470> like<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.940> take<00:02:43.940> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
render here now if we'd like to take a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.730 
render here now if we'd like to take a
look<00:02:44.180> at<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.990> a<00:02:45.080> couple<00:02:45.260> different<00:02:45.470> ways

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
look at this in a couple different ways

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.710 
look at this in a couple different ways
we<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.580> couple<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.180> buttons<00:02:47.330> here<00:02:47.570> that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
we have a couple of buttons here that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.390 
we have a couple of buttons here that
are<00:02:47.810> new<00:02:47.930> one<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.560> we<00:02:48.740> have<00:02:48.890> our<00:02:49.100> ambient

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
are new one is that we have our ambient

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.770 
are new one is that we have our ambient
occlusion<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.210> that<00:02:50.330> we<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.480> click<00:02:50.630> that

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
occlusion so that we can click that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.060 
occlusion so that we can click that
button<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.410> can<00:02:51.560> take<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.740> look<00:02:51.800> at<00:02:51.980> our

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
button and we can take a look at our

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.830 
button and we can take a look at our
scene<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.580> just<00:02:52.760> look<00:02:52.910> at<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.270> just<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
scene and just look at the just the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.570 
scene and just look at the just the
geometry<00:02:54.470> that's<00:02:54.680> there<00:02:54.890> we<00:02:55.070> call<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.250> clay

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
geometry that's there we call that clay

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.650 
geometry that's there we call that clay
rendering<00:02:56.030> mode<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.480> then<00:02:57.200> we<00:02:57.320> also<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.800> a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
rendering mode and then we also have a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.199 
rendering mode and then we also have a
colored<00:02:59.660> clay<00:02:59.990> mode<00:03:00.290> where<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:01.209> renders

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
colored clay mode where it renders

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.550 
colored clay mode where it renders
everything<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.140> diffuse<00:03:03.470> color

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
everything just with the diffuse color

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.310 
everything just with the diffuse color
that<00:03:04.010> it's<00:03:04.160> it's<00:03:04.670> set<00:03:04.880> on<00:03:04.910> currently<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.140> those

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
that it's it's set on currently so those

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.449 
that it's it's set on currently so those
are<00:03:06.440> some<00:03:06.500> pretty<00:03:06.620> interesting<00:03:06.980> modes<00:03:07.370> that

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
are some pretty interesting modes that

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.800 
are some pretty interesting modes that
allow<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.880> visualize<00:03:08.330> your<00:03:08.540> scene<00:03:08.780> a

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
allow you to visualize your scene a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.460 
allow you to visualize your scene a
little<00:03:08.959> bit<00:03:09.170> more<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:10.640> also<00:03:10.820> have<00:03:11.470> two

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
little bit more we also have two

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.229 
little bit more we also have two
different<00:03:12.650> rendering<00:03:13.100> kernels<00:03:13.459> so<00:03:13.970> if<00:03:14.120> we

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
different rendering kernels so if we

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.090 
different rendering kernels so if we
want<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.480> adjust<00:03:14.780> those<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.470> click<00:03:15.739> on<00:03:15.890> the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
want to adjust those we click on the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.949 
want to adjust those we click on the
preview<00:03:16.310> Colonel<00:03:16.760> button<00:03:17.000> right<00:03:17.660> now<00:03:17.780> it's

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
preview Colonel button right now it's

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.630 
preview Colonel button right now it's
set<00:03:18.050> at<00:03:18.110> direct<00:03:18.500> lighting<00:03:18.770> which<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.280> more<00:03:19.520> of

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
set at direct lighting which is more of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.640 
set at direct lighting which is more of
a<00:03:19.760> traditional<00:03:20.270> ray<00:03:20.810> tracing<00:03:21.110> mode<00:03:21.470> where

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
a traditional ray tracing mode where

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.620 
a traditional ray tracing mode where
it's<00:03:21.800> got<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.730> believe<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.030> single<00:03:23.300> bounce

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
it's got just I believe a single bounce

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.690 
it's got just I believe a single bounce
an<00:03:23.900> ambient<00:03:24.709> occlusion<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.310> give<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.670> a

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
an ambient occlusion to give you a

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.850 
an ambient occlusion to give you a
decent<00:03:26.120> render<00:03:26.630> but<00:03:27.200> one<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.620> things<00:03:27.800> that

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
decent render but one of the things that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.260 
decent render but one of the things that
we'd<00:03:28.010> like<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.280> do<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.550> change<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.060> path

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
we'd like to do is change that to path

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.470 
we'd like to do is change that to path
tracing<00:03:29.690> which<00:03:29.959> will<00:03:30.140> give<00:03:30.260> us<00:03:30.440> our<00:03:30.650> true

we don't need that many you could stop

the render whenever you're happy and

the render whenever you're happy and
already<00:04:03.650> we're<00:04:03.860> just<00:04:04.040> at<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.340> know<00:04:04.400> 120<00:04:05.090> and

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
already we're just at you know 120 and

already we're just at you know 120 and
it's<00:04:05.329> starting<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.570> clean<00:04:05.780> up<00:04:05.900> nicely<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.530> you

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
it's starting to clean up nicely so you

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.050 
it's starting to clean up nicely so you

could stop the render whenever you'd

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.180 
could stop the render whenever you'd
like<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.989> typically<00:04:09.350> between<00:04:09.590> two<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.040> five

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190

thousand<00:04:10.790> samples<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.750> can<00:04:11.840> get<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:11.989> very

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
thousand samples you can get a very

thousand samples you can get a very

settings<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.750> we'd<00:04:14.870> like<00:04:15.049> to<00:04:15.200> change<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.920> the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
settings that we'd like to change is the

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.880 
settings that we'd like to change is the
filter<00:04:16.609> setting<00:04:17.030> here<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.450> right<00:04:18.260> now<00:04:18.290> it's

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
filter setting here and right now it's

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.069 
filter setting here and right now it's
disabled<00:04:19.729> now<00:04:19.880> what<00:04:20.180> filtering<00:04:20.630> is<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.930> that

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
disabled now what filtering is is that

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.730 
disabled now what filtering is is that
sometimes<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:22.479> diagonals<00:04:23.479> or<00:04:23.810> on<00:04:24.440> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
sometimes on the diagonals or on the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.710 
sometimes on the diagonals or on the
edges<00:04:25.160> inside<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.790> render<00:04:26.120> you'll<00:04:26.270> see<00:04:26.510> some

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
edges inside the render you'll see some

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.960 
edges inside the render you'll see some
aliasing<00:04:27.140> or<00:04:27.440> stair-stepping<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.760> by

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
aliasing or stair-stepping so by

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.330 
aliasing or stair-stepping so by
clicking<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.419> it<00:04:30.229> will<00:04:30.440> cause<00:04:30.860> our<00:04:31.070> render

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
clicking that it will cause our render

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.830 
clicking that it will cause our render
to<00:04:31.460> take<00:04:31.610> just<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.880> little<00:04:32.120> bit<00:04:32.210> longer<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.630> time

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
to take just a little bit longer in time

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.480 
to take just a little bit longer in time
but<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.200> will<00:04:33.290> also<00:04:33.410> clean<00:04:33.890> those<00:04:34.130> up<00:04:34.160> by

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
but it will also clean those up by

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.510 
but it will also clean those up by
helping<00:04:34.880> us<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.800> anti-alias<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.950> those<00:04:37.070> edges

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
helping us to anti-alias of those edges

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.760 
helping us to anti-alias of those edges
as<00:04:37.669> well<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.750> when<00:04:38.930> we're<00:04:39.080> happy<00:04:39.380> with<00:04:39.470> all<00:04:39.680> of

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
as well so when we're happy with all of

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.620 
as well so when we're happy with all of
our<00:04:39.860> settings<00:04:40.250> we<00:04:40.430> could<00:04:40.610> go<00:04:40.790> back<00:04:40.970> over<00:04:41.390> to

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
our settings we could go back over to

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.960 
our settings we could go back over to
the<00:04:41.810> screen<00:04:42.140> resolution<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.280> we<00:04:43.400> could<00:04:43.610> crank

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
the screen resolution and we could crank

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.969 
the screen resolution and we could crank
that<00:04:44.240> up<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.660> much<00:04:44.870> higher<00:04:45.080> setting<00:04:45.830> and

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
that up to a much higher setting and

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.890 
that up to a much higher setting and
then<00:04:46.580> we'll<00:04:46.789> just<00:04:46.940> let<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.240> render<00:04:47.539> cook

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
then we'll just let the render cook

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.530 
then we'll just let the render cook
and<00:04:48.139> when<00:04:48.740> it's<00:04:48.860> completed<00:04:49.280> we<00:04:49.910> could<00:04:50.060> use<00:04:50.240> the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
and when it's completed we could use the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.840 
and when it's completed we could use the
little<00:04:50.990> button<00:04:51.290> right<00:04:51.440> here<00:04:51.470> when<00:04:52.220> save<00:04:52.580> our

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
little button right here when save our

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.900 
little button right here when save our
render<00:04:53.479> to<00:04:53.750> an<00:04:53.870> image<00:04:54.259> file<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.889> then<00:04:55.699> have

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
render to an image file and then have

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:04.710 
render to an image file and then have
our<00:04:55.940> nice<00:04:56.240> finished<00:04:56.660> render

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720
