I started with a strip of fabric you can
vary<00:00:46.479> the<00:00:46.600> width<00:00:46.929> and<00:00:47.140> length<00:00:47.229> of<00:00:47.679> the<00:00:47.739> fabric

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.860 
vary the width and length of the fabric
for<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.489> size<00:00:48.729> of<00:00:48.909> flower<00:00:49.120> that<00:00:49.359> you<00:00:49.420> want<00:00:49.719> to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
have and then I just cut it like fringe

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.930 
have and then I just cut it like fringe
and<00:00:52.559> angled<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.649> ends<00:00:54.010> this<00:00:54.129> is<00:00:54.309> about<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.579> six

and angled the ends this is about a six

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.849 
and angled the ends this is about a six
inch<00:00:55.149> by<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.449> one-inch<00:00:55.870> piece<00:00:56.109> of<00:00:56.289> fabric<00:00:56.499> and
