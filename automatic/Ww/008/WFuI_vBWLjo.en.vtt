I'm<00:00:11.550> making<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.000> video<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.630> because<00:00:12.660> I

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
I'm making this video is because I

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.950 
I'm making this video is because I
realized<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.280> there<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.179> no<00:00:17.660> videos<00:00:18.660> on

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
realized that there is no videos on

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.570 
realized that there is no videos on
YouTube<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.619> how<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.890> stall<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> either<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
YouTube on how to stall the either the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.790 
YouTube on how to stall the either the
routes<00:00:20.850> message<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.420> figured<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:22.109> guess<00:00:22.619> I

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
routes message so I figured I guess I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.339 
routes message so I figured I guess I
would<00:00:23.660> so<00:00:24.660> anyway<00:00:25.849> first<00:00:26.930> you're<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.260> to

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
would so anyway first you're going to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.089 
would so anyway first you're going to
get<00:00:28.560> 1<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.429> 2<00:00:29.490> by<00:00:29.789> 3<00:00:30.000> bar<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.949> then<00:00:31.949> you're

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
get 1 by 2 by 3 bar here then you're

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.350 
get 1 by 2 by 3 bar here then you're
gonna<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> same<00:00:32.730> thing<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> opposite

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
gonna get the same thing on the opposite

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.110 
gonna get the same thing on the opposite
side<00:00:33.950> you're<00:00:34.950> gonna<00:00:35.070> orient<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.700> permeate

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
side you're gonna orient and permeate

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.319 
side you're gonna orient and permeate
the<00:00:36.239> corners<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.399> then<00:00:38.399> orient<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> edges

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the corners and then orient the edges

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
the corners and then orient the edges
and<00:00:40.520> then<00:00:41.520> finish<00:00:42.270> off<00:00:42.450> each<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> left<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and then finish off each of the left and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
and then finish off each of the left and
right<00:00:44.700> sides<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.870> finish<00:00:46.800> off

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
right sides and then you just finish off

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.190 
right sides and then you just finish off
the<00:00:47.039> rest

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
the rest

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.369 
the rest
now<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.559> should<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.070> some<00:00:51.170> extent<00:00:52.170> amount

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
now you should have some extent amount

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.779 
now you should have some extent amount
of<00:00:52.440> experience<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.879> depends<00:00:55.670> just<00:00:56.670> have

of experience to what depends just have
some<00:00:57.059> experience<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> solve<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
some experience on how to solve a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
some experience on how to solve a
Rubik's<00:00:58.920> Cube<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.489> else<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.420> might<00:01:00.629> get

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
Rubik's Cube or else you might get

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.070 
Rubik's Cube or else you might get
confused<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.250> tell<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.080> so

confused with what I'm gonna tell you so

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260 
confused with what I'm gonna tell you so
anyway<00:01:04.559> first<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.220> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> find<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.060> piece

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
anyway first you want to find the piece

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.960 
anyway first you want to find the piece
that<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> middle<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.729> 1

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that will go in the middle of your 1

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780 
that will go in the middle of your 1
mode<00:01:09.150> 2<00:01:09.180> by<00:01:09.420> 3<00:01:09.600> block<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:11.070> my<00:01:11.460> case

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
mode 2 by 3 block which would be my case

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
mode 2 by 3 block which would be my case
the<00:01:12.180> red<00:01:12.510> white<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> find<00:01:16.439> our<00:01:16.590> red

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the red white so we have to find our red

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.060 
the red white so we have to find our red
white<00:01:16.920> piece<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.810> just

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
white piece and it's right here so just

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.660 
white piece and it's right here so just
be<00:01:20.070> where<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.759> needs<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.090> push<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> down<00:01:22.670> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
be where it needs to go push it down and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.969 
be where it needs to go push it down and
there<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.780> pieces<00:01:25.790> next<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.970> need<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.390> get

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
there that pieces next we need to get

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.069 
there that pieces next we need to get
these<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:32.430> need<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.299> find<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
these right here so we need to find the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.130 
these right here so we need to find the
pieces<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.590> will<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.610> which<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.140> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pieces that will go there which is this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.940 
pieces that will go there which is this
red<00:01:38.040> green<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.390> red<00:01:40.020> white<00:01:40.350> green<00:01:40.380> these

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
red green and this red white green these

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.140 
red green and this red white green these
are<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.189> first<00:01:41.430> two<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.880> you're<00:01:42.030> gonna

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
are the first two that you're gonna

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.800 
are the first two that you're gonna
match<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.040> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> try<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> get

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
match up and you just want to try to get

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.249 
match up and you just want to try to get
them<00:01:46.439> out<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.799> way<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.750> each<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.049> can

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
them out the way so that each one can

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.039 
them out the way so that each one can
move<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.729> well<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.270> piece<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.780> here

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
move up so like well this piece is here

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.969 
move up so like well this piece is here
this<00:01:55.350> one's<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.560> well<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this one's here so we know well then you

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.370 
this one's here so we know well then you
can<00:01:59.130> move<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> middle<00:01:59.700> around<00:02:00.110> much<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
can move the middle around much as you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.550 
can move the middle around much as you
know<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> doesn't<00:02:01.829> matter

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
know it doesn't matter

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.039 
know it doesn't matter
so<00:02:03.310> we're<00:02:03.580> basically<00:02:03.700> just<00:02:04.030> gonna<00:02:04.390> move<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.020> to

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
so we're basically just gonna move it to

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.260 
so we're basically just gonna move it to
one<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.799> sides<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.369> don't<00:02:06.580> want<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.119> be

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
one of the sides you don't want it to be

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.300 
one of the sides you don't want it to be
facing<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.840> front<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.289> or<00:02:08.470> back<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.190> be

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
facing in front of you or back to be

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.910 
facing in front of you or back to be
meant<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.880> be<00:02:09.940> facing<00:02:10.209> on<00:02:10.420> your<00:02:10.569> left<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.740> your

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
meant to be facing on your left and your

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.140 
meant to be facing on your left and your
right<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.069> case<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.430> want<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:15.940> our

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
right so in this case we want it on our

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.070 
right so in this case we want it on our
left

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
left

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.820 
left
because<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.950> our<00:02:18.790> green<00:02:19.660> red<00:02:19.989> piece<00:02:20.230> and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
because is our green red piece and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.790 
because is our green red piece and
here's<00:02:21.069> our<00:02:21.250> red<00:02:21.700> green<00:02:22.390> white<00:02:22.420> piece<00:02:22.959> we<00:02:23.620> can

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
here's our red green white piece we can

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.160 
here's our red green white piece we can
just<00:02:24.040> turn<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> middle<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.090> bring<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.330> up<00:02:25.420> you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
just turn the middle and bring it up you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.080 
just turn the middle and bring it up you
can<00:02:26.319> move<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> middle<00:02:27.010> however<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.580> want<00:02:27.850> to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
can move the middle however you want to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.890 
can move the middle however you want to
bring<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:30.160> piece<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.670> there<00:02:31.330> moving<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
bring the piece in there moving the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.199 
bring the piece in there moving the
middle<00:02:32.110> doesn't<00:02:32.290> cut<00:02:32.530> right<00:02:32.650> now<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.940> if

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
middle doesn't cut right now and so if

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.300 
middle doesn't cut right now and so if
you're<00:02:34.660> gonna<00:02:34.840> move<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.350> piece<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.800> two

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
you're gonna move the piece in two

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.060 
you're gonna move the piece in two
pieces<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:37.090> go<00:02:37.239> on<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.530> side

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
pieces to go on this side

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.290 
pieces to go on this side
you<00:02:39.280> basically<00:02:39.459> just<00:02:40.030> move<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.110> up<00:02:42.090> push<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
you basically just move it up push the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.860 
you basically just move it up push the
piece<00:02:43.480> oh<00:02:43.690> wait<00:02:43.840> no<00:02:44.019> that's<00:02:44.050> really<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:46.540> okay

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
piece oh wait no that's really just okay

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.130 
piece oh wait no that's really just okay
this<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.440> different<00:02:47.739> case<00:02:47.860> actually<00:02:49.140> these

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
this is a different case actually these

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.300 
this is a different case actually these
green<00:02:50.620> red<00:02:51.340> white<00:02:51.610> bar<00:02:52.510> needs<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:53.950> here

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
green red white bar needs to go in here

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.949 
green red white bar needs to go in here
and<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.640> what<00:02:54.880> you're<00:02:55.030> gonna<00:02:55.150> do<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.480> turn<00:02:55.780> them

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
and so what you're gonna do is turn them

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.850 
and so what you're gonna do is turn them
both<00:02:56.170> these<00:02:56.500> faces<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.190> way<00:02:57.870> move<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.050> in<00:02:59.230> so

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
both these faces this way move it in so

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.100 
both these faces this way move it in so
now<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.100> have<00:03:00.340> your<00:03:00.459> bar<00:03:00.670> here<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:01.959> just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
now you have your bar here and then just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.670 
now you have your bar here and then just
put<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.440> back<00:03:03.690> do<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.840> same<00:03:05.080> thing<00:03:05.380> with<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
put it back do the same thing with the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.580 
put it back do the same thing with the
other<00:03:05.830> one<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:06.930> here's<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.049> pieces<00:03:08.260> they're

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
other one so here's the pieces they're

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.680 
other one so here's the pieces they're
match<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.190> we<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.489> need<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.790> bring<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.150> away

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
match so we just need to bring that away

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.030 
match so we just need to bring that away
and<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:12.430> want<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.120> case<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:14.500> one

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
and this want in this case this one

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.340 
and this want in this case this one
needs<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.549> be<00:03:15.670> here<00:03:16.120> because<00:03:16.390> we<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.110> red

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
needs to be here because we see the red

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.270 
needs to be here because we see the red
facing<00:03:17.890> us

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
facing us

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.000 
facing us
and<00:03:18.549> once<00:03:19.420> we<00:03:19.630> bring<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.989> up<00:03:20.019> we<00:03:20.590> bring<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:20.980> up

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
and once we bring it up we bring it up

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.890 
and once we bring it up we bring it up
again<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:22.209> we<00:03:22.390> have<00:03:22.540> them<00:03:22.720> matched<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:25.180> for

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
again and we have them matched just for

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.750 
again and we have them matched just for
this<00:03:26.079> case<00:03:26.380> it's<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.829> lot<00:03:27.010> easier<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.489> put<00:03:27.640> it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
this case it's a lot easier to put it

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.090 
this case it's a lot easier to put it
and<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.060> bring<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.299> up<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.750> set<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.470> and

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
and just bring it up and set it and

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.000 
and just bring it up and set it and
bring<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.340> back<00:03:30.459> down<00:03:31.560> now<00:03:32.560> we're<00:03:32.680> gonna<00:03:32.799> do

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
bring it back down now we're gonna do

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.150 
bring it back down now we're gonna do
the<00:03:33.130> same<00:03:33.459> exact<00:03:34.000> thing<00:03:34.299> for<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.660> other<00:03:34.780> one

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
the same exact thing for the other one

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.770 
the same exact thing for the other one
so<00:03:36.160> I'm<00:03:36.250> gonna<00:03:36.430> move<00:03:36.609> a<00:03:36.730> little<00:03:36.850> fast<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.540> this

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
so I'm gonna move a little fast on this

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.190 
so I'm gonna move a little fast on this
and<00:03:37.989> then<00:03:38.109> just<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.530> time<00:03:39.900> there<00:03:40.900> goes<00:03:41.049> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
and then just a time there goes the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.349 
and then just a time there goes the
first<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:46.680> there<00:03:47.680> goes<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.430> corner<00:03:49.060> for

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
first one and there goes the corner for

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:55.010 
first one and there goes the corner for
the<00:03:49.480> other<00:03:49.690> one<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:51.299> red<00:03:52.299> white<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.630> orange

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.170 

and<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.650> goes<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.890> yeah<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.310> then<00:04:02.180> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
and it goes so just yeah and then the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.330 
and it goes so just yeah and then the
next<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.840> orienting<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:04.800> permuting<00:04:05.700> these

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
next is orienting and permuting these

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.460 
next is orienting and permuting these
corners<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:09.740> use<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:11.160> oval<00:04:12.060> algorithms<00:04:12.960> to<00:04:13.290> get

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
corners I use the oval algorithms to get

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.670 
corners I use the oval algorithms to get
these<00:04:13.650> but<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.010> believe<00:04:14.340> there's<00:04:14.610> like<00:04:14.960> 42<00:04:15.960> cm

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
these but I believe there's like 42 cm

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.240 
these but I believe there's like 42 cm
ml<00:04:16.980> cases<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:17.820> can<00:04:18.000> use<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:19.100> orient<00:04:20.100> and

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
ml cases that you can use to orient and

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.160 
ml cases that you can use to orient and
permeate<00:04:20.700> these<00:04:20.989> corners<00:04:21.989> in<00:04:22.290> one<00:04:22.770> move<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:25.140> I

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
permeate these corners in one move but I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.650 
permeate these corners in one move but I
just<00:04:25.560> used<00:04:25.800> if<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.670> oil<00:04:26.880> those<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.330> would<00:04:27.450> use

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
just used if the oil those you would use

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.170 
just used if the oil those you would use
in<00:04:27.780> fridges<00:04:28.170> with<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.860> lift<00:04:29.430> across<00:04:29.700> already

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
in fridges with the lift across already

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.420 
in fridges with the lift across already
salt<00:04:30.450> so<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:31.440> one<00:04:31.620> would<00:04:31.800> be<00:04:31.830> like<00:04:32.130> having

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
salt so this one would be like having

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.060 
salt so this one would be like having
these<00:04:33.150> two<00:04:33.330> on<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.570> back<00:04:33.750> like<00:04:34.710> Ross<00:04:34.890> already

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
these two on the back like Ross already

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.410 
these two on the back like Ross already
solved<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.640> having<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.030> on<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.390> front<00:04:36.800> so

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
solved and having this on the front so

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.260 
solved and having this on the front so
if<00:04:39.420> you<00:04:39.690> don't<00:04:39.930> know<00:04:40.110> those<00:04:40.290> algorithms<00:04:41.270> which

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
if you don't know those algorithms which

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.910 
if you don't know those algorithms which
you<00:04:42.390> probably<00:04:42.720> should<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.470> check<00:04:43.770> them

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
you probably should you can check them

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.950 
you probably should you can check them
out<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.100> cublas<00:04:44.820> i'll<00:04:45.090> leave<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.300> link<00:04:45.420> in<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
out on cublas i'll leave a link in the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.770 
out on cublas i'll leave a link in the
description<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.710> video<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.780> anyway<00:04:48.780> just

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.050 

now<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.920> permeate<00:04:55.920> them<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:59.160> just<00:04:59.490> have<00:04:59.820> to

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
now to permeate them you just have to

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.460 
now to permeate them you just have to
find<00:05:00.330> two<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.930> match<00:05:01.170> up<00:05:01.200> so<00:05:01.880> like<00:05:02.880> these<00:05:03.120> two

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
find two that match up so like these two

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.180 
find two that match up so like these two
they<00:05:04.470> match<00:05:04.740> up<00:05:05.900> move<00:05:06.900> them<00:05:07.170> to<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.590> left<00:05:07.620> or

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
they match up move them to the left or

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.060 
they match up move them to the left or
right<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:09.780> can<00:05:09.930> do<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.200> T<00:05:10.350> permutation

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
right and you can do the T permutation

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.000 
right and you can do the T permutation
or<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:12.330> Y<00:05:12.480> permutation<00:05:13.200> I<00:05:13.290> like<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.590> do<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.830> Y

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
or the Y permutation I like to do the Y

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.480 
or the Y permutation I like to do the Y
prime<00:05:14.220> mutation<00:05:14.790> so<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.240> one<00:05:15.420> is<00:05:15.450> I<00:05:16.490> right

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
prime mutation so that one is I right

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.350 
prime mutation so that one is I right
