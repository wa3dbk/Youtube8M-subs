more everything go more the right side

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
more everything go more the right side
because<00:00:55.350> lifeblood<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.130> more<00:00:56.309> lighter<00:00:56.520> yeah

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
because lifeblood is more lighter yeah

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
because lifeblood is more lighter yeah
way<00:00:57.420> more<00:00:57.450> lighter<00:00:57.809> than<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.350> cannot<00:00:58.590> high

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

just so everything more go are the body
side<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:21.450> test<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.350> test<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> first

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
side we test actually we test the first

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
it's already feel like a much different

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's already feel like a much different
complete<00:01:32.610> complete<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> cars<00:01:33.750> feel<00:01:34.229> like

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
totally different parts but actually

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
totally different parts but actually
they<00:01:36.750> look<00:01:36.780> designs<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.760> that's<00:01:38.760> not<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
they look designs like that's not so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.090 
they look designs like that's not so
much<00:01:39.750> big<00:01:39.930> difference<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:41.010> bit

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.070 
much big difference just a little bit
small<00:01:41.400> difficult<00:01:41.760> detail<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.659> bow<00:01:42.810> gets

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
small difficult detail like the bow gets

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.789 
small difficult detail like the bow gets
is<00:01:43.290> Manalo

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
is Manalo

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.210 
is Manalo
in<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.210> effects<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.770> same<00:01:46.950> still

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in much as effects but it's same still

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
in much as effects but it's same still
same<00:01:47.400> arms<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.970> jim<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.330> is<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.080> same

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
same arms and jim it is kind of all same

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.050 
same arms and jim it is kind of all same
right<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.130> they're<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> steering

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
right so they're like a steering

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
right so they're like a steering
clanking<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:52.680> different<00:01:52.950> position<00:01:53.040> for

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
clanking little different position for

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.420 
clanking little different position for
staring<00:01:53.700> plant<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.600> transifex<00:01:55.500> make<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.189> lot<00:01:56.400> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
staring plant in transifex make a lot of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.370 
staring plant in transifex make a lot of
difference<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> dollar's<00:01:57.659> feel<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
difference of the dollar's feel like a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.370 
difference of the dollar's feel like a
more<00:01:59.070> stable<00:01:59.360> living<00:02:00.360> wall<00:02:00.540> steering's<00:02:00.930> more

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
more stable living wall steering's more

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.360 
more stable living wall steering's more
grip

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
grip

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.140 
grip
in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.790> lap<00:02:03.030> times<00:02:04.430> maybe<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.550> little<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:05.880> just

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
in the lap times maybe a little bit just

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.400 
in the lap times maybe a little bit just
a<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.390> bit<00:02:06.480> more<00:02:06.540> faster<00:02:06.840> lap<00:02:06.960> times<00:02:07.200> but

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
a little bit more faster lap times but

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.530 
a little bit more faster lap times but
more<00:02:07.620> better<00:02:07.860> Avedissian<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.970> five<00:02:09.240> minutes

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
more better Avedissian so five minutes

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:20.830 
more better Avedissian so five minutes
for<00:02:09.690> boys<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.530> couple<00:02:11.010> seconds<00:02:11.280> faster

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.730 

it's<00:02:21.840> really<00:02:22.050> good

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
it's really good

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's really good
obviously<00:02:23.550> when<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.730> came<00:02:23.880> back<00:02:24.030> from

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
obviously when we came back from

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.670 
obviously when we came back from
Thailand<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.720> first<00:02:24.930> time<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.200> came<00:02:25.350> here<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
Thailand the first time we came here and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.650 
Thailand the first time we came here and
put<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.890> car<00:02:26.070> down<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.550> was<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.090> kid<00:02:27.330> you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
put the car down it was you kid you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.060 
put the car down it was you kid you
could<00:02:27.810> notice<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:28.470> big<00:02:28.620> difference<00:02:28.770> so

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
could notice a really big difference so

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.700 
could notice a really big difference so
like<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.940> said<00:02:30.300> before<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.230> actually<00:02:31.380> feels

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
like I said before it it actually feels

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.370 
like I said before it it actually feels
like<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> completely<00:02:32.370> different<00:02:32.730> car<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.060> drive

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
like a completely different car to drive

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.020 
like a completely different car to drive
even<00:02:34.380> though<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> suspension<00:02:35.040> obviously<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
even though the suspension obviously the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.690 
even though the suspension obviously the
four<00:02:36.180> corners<00:02:36.630> are<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> same<00:02:37.130> but<00:02:38.130> basically

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
four corners are the same but basically

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.310 
four corners are the same but basically
the<00:02:38.850> rest<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.540> completely<00:02:40.170> different

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
the rest of it is completely different

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.830 
the rest of it is completely different
so<00:02:40.710> no<00:02:41.490> it's<00:02:41.640> good<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.240> definitely

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
so no it's good so definitely

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.580 
so no it's good so definitely
improvement<00:02:44.360> we<00:02:45.360> still<00:02:45.810> testing<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
improvement we still testing for the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.730 
improvement we still testing for the
small<00:02:46.890> steering<00:02:47.070> system<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:49.440> steering

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
small steering system the steering

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.340 
small steering system the steering
system<00:02:49.890> for<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.760> single<00:02:51.180> wire<00:02:51.330> single<00:02:51.870> single

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
system for the single wire single single

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.710 
system for the single wire single single
post<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:53.040> seems<00:02:53.490> like<00:02:53.670> saikhan<00:02:54.150> TC<00:02:54.420> before

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
post like seems like saikhan TC before

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.070 
post like seems like saikhan TC before
or<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.980> post<00:02:56.250> we<00:02:57.120> saw<00:02:57.300> skip<00:02:57.570> testing<00:02:57.900> but

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
or like to post we saw skip testing but

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.580 
or like to post we saw skip testing but
for<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> kit<00:02:58.590> for<00:02:59.370> sure<00:02:59.520> we<00:03:00.270> put<00:03:00.480> double<00:03:01.440> boss

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
for the kit for sure we put double boss

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.010 
for the kit for sure we put double boss
fight<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.850> whole<00:03:02.970> post<00:03:03.150> type<00:03:03.450> also<00:03:03.690> you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
fight but the whole post type also you

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.250 
fight but the whole post type also you
can<00:03:04.230> make<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:05.130> Szabo<00:03:05.390> positions<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.600> other

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
can make the Szabo positions like other

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.910 
can make the Szabo positions like other
way<00:03:07.440> some<00:03:08.160> more<00:03:08.489> make<00:03:08.760> space<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.650> radio

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
way some more make space for the radio

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.310 
way some more make space for the radio
thing<00:03:11.100> right<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.140> brushless

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
thing right so now it's a brushless

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.280 
thing right so now it's a brushless
speed<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.890> getting<00:03:14.310> bigger<00:03:14.489> than<00:03:14.760> both<00:03:15.660> like

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
speed of getting bigger than both like

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.490 
speed of getting bigger than both like
brushed<00:03:16.890> speedos<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.450> also<00:03:18.959> we<00:03:19.170> need<00:03:19.320> more

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
brushed speedos so also we need more

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.140 
brushed speedos so also we need more
space<00:03:19.739> for<00:03:19.770> here<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.400> also<00:03:20.550> made<00:03:20.760> better<00:03:20.940> photo

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
space for here it also made better photo

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.990 
space for here it also made better photo
cooling<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.830> think<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.640> more<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:23.880> more

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
cooling so I think it's more just more

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.500 
cooling so I think it's more just more
option<00:03:24.420> for

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.569 

you
