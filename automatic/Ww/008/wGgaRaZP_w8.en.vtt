this<00:00:25.340> is<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.610> beginning<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.030> flight<00:00:26.270> I<00:00:26.390> get

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
this is the beginning of a flight I get

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.260 
this is the beginning of a flight I get
to<00:00:26.690> be<00:00:26.810> center<00:00:27.080> stage<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:28.550> reality<00:00:29.000> is<00:00:29.119> there

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
to be center stage the reality is there

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.640 
to be center stage the reality is there
ought<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:29.390> be<00:00:29.510> several<00:00:30.080> thousand<00:00:30.529> people

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
ought to be several thousand people

ought to be several thousand people
center<00:00:31.070> stage<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.610> can<00:00:31.790> think<00:00:32.000> of<00:00:32.090> a

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
center stage and I can think of a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.460 
center stage and I can think of a
hundred<00:00:32.239> right<00:00:32.599> now<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:32.989> deserve<00:00:33.260> more

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
accolades than I do now we start this

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.920 
accolades than I do now we start this
whole<00:00:38.000> saga<00:00:38.270> that's<00:00:38.540> going<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.780> be<00:00:38.840> the
