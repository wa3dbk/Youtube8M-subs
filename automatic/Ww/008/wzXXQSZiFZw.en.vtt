00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.130
 both 2015 we are at the boot of lenovo e 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.469
 this is the new series and third flex 3 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.160
 generation of multimodal notebooks by 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.600
 mainstream band of the Chinese house 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.710
 includes three models from 11 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.660
 inch 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.760
 then more in the center is the one from 14 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.220
 inch and at the bottom of the format model 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.540
 greater from 15 to 6 inches with this 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.190
 third generation of notebooks 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.200
 multimedia in category but in 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.840
 streaming of the Chinese manufacturer comes 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.110
 introduced a significant novelty and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.210
 that is the hinge that previously on 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.860
 flex could go up to a maximum of 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.230
 300 degrees 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.930
 now instead it allows you to fold it 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.980
 screen completely on the base 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.980
 thus enabling the tablet mode 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.230
 you may be wondering then what is the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.269
 difference now between the three and the flexes 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.510
 yoga trains the differences will be all 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.729
 in the technical equipment in the materials e 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.510
 in the dimensions that for the flex are 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.510
 slightly higher 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.630
 in this case we see that the frame is 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.330
 in aluminum and not in magnesium alloy 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.650
 however, an excellent material 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.930
 while regarding the equipment 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.040
 hardware we are going to open the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.920
 system information 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.560
 there are intel celeron or intel processors 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.860
 pentium with bitrel architecture in place 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.470
 of the heart of yoga 3 11 with 8 gigabytes 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.240
 and we give the maximum and a yemen storage 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.240
 It is up to a maximum of 64 gb 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.520
 then a hardware platform 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.000
 slightly cheaper we find a 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.890
 keyboard cue type the palm rest with 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.680
 this metal effect finish 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.010
 brushed in terms of interface e 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.240
 then we have the hole on the left side 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.220
 for attachment to the security padlock 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.990
 kensington the connector of 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.380
 feeding a door i gets the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.300
 sd memory card reader a jack 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.150
 audio button for locking the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.130
 rotation and volume scales and on 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.880
 right side we have the rj45 connector 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.100
 there is a digital video output for the LAN 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.130
 no two USB ports, and the button 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.130
 power on 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.549
 let's move on to the 14-inch flex 3 model 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.319
 14 apart from the greater diagonal of the 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.359
 screen at the same resolution in the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.859
 11 model and the same features 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.989
 we also find the same hinge that 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.299
 allows in addition to the usual three 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.930
 flex mode also to have the 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.930
 tablet mode 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.600
 and identical and also the budget of 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.600
 interfaces 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.810
 on 14 inches, however, we see this 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.849
 white population which is one of the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.190
 news that have been introduced by 9 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.040
 with the flex the three over and has 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.319
 required the manufacturer to adopt a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.920
 new process for coloring the 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.920
 metal 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.939
 to me completely respect instead 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.930
 to eleven inches and the equipment 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:17.359
 hardware that in this case is based on 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.269
 intel core processors with dulko retrieves 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.730
 fifth generation acors seven 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.099
 broadway accompanied by 8 gigabytes of 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.859
 ram and hard disk or hybrid storage 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:31.159
 up to a maximum of one terabyte and this 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.049
 is the flex 3 15 with a 15 6 screen 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.970
 inches but the same 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.939
 features of the 14 model 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.189
 inch 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:42.560
 I take this opportunity to signal you that in 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:45.049
 this time the model at 14 from 15 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.760
 inches have integrated graphics but 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.500
 that in the future it will be possible to have 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.919
 configurations with dedicated graphics 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.919
 nvidia
