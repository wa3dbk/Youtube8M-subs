and now I can show you what's really
nice<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:55.980> running<00:00:56.580> new<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
nice about running new because it's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.000 
nice about running new because it's
really<00:00:57.660> easy<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.080> implement<00:00:58.500> additional

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
really easy to implement additional

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.600 
really easy to implement additional
things<00:00:59.900> for<00:01:00.900> example<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.980> us

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350 

one<00:01:06.610> use<00:01:06.820> case<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.280> sector<00:01:09.700> firms<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.270> are

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
one use case is the sector firms you are

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.350 
one use case is the sector firms you are
sitting<00:01:10.659> on<00:01:10.780> your<00:01:10.900> couch<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.790> wonder<00:01:13.090> what<00:01:13.240> is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
sitting on your couch you wonder what is

new on internet to is simply start
internet<00:01:17.200> thousand

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.290 

wait<00:01:21.470> until<00:01:22.370> it<00:01:22.580> loads<00:01:23.980> ok<00:01:24.980> and<00:01:25.250> now<00:01:25.400> now<00:01:25.730> you

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
wait until it loads ok and now now you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.820 
wait until it loads ok and now now you
can<00:01:26.450> do<00:01:26.600> simple<00:01:26.810> things<00:01:26.960> with<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.470> remote<00:01:27.680> you

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
can do simple things with the remote you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.380 
can do simple things with the remote you
can<00:01:27.860> scroll<00:01:28.190> up<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.520> down<00:01:28.610> but<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:29.240> not

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
can scroll up and down but it's not

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.350 
can scroll up and down but it's not
really<00:01:29.570> useful<00:01:30.020> for<00:01:30.790> for<00:01:31.790> entering<00:01:32.120> takes

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
really useful for for entering takes

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.560 
really useful for for entering takes
over<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.930> on<00:01:33.260> links<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.100> on<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.120> what

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
over I on links and then so on so what

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.940 
over I on links and then so on so what
is<00:01:35.750> we<00:01:36.110> implemented<00:01:37.030> simple<00:01:38.030> application<00:01:38.950> 51

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
is we implemented simple application 51

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.230 
is we implemented simple application 51
on<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.310> beat<00:01:40.460> em<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:42.230> just<00:01:42.410> started<00:01:45.070> ok<00:01:46.240> my

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
on the beat em so we just started ok my

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.270 
on the beat em so we just started ok my
notice<00:01:47.600> took<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.290> picture<00:01:48.620> of<00:01:48.980> this<00:01:49.430> remote<00:01:51.280> we

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
notice took a picture of this remote we

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.040 
notice took a picture of this remote we
actually<00:01:52.580> enables<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.240> picture<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:53.810> it

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
actually enables this picture so that it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.390 
actually enables this picture so that it
recognizes<00:01:55.780> touch<00:01:56.780> events<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.010> can<00:01:58.220> also

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
recognizes touch events so you can also

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.720 
recognizes touch events so you can also
use<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.820> same<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.540> mode<00:01:59.750> by<00:02:00.110> simply<00:02:00.500> touching

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
use the same the mode by simply touching

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.730 
use the same the mode by simply touching
instead<00:02:01.730> of<00:02:01.760> this<00:02:02.000> one<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.960> have<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.200> mouse<00:02:03.320> area

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
instead of this one we have a mouse area

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.600 
instead of this one we have a mouse area
here<00:02:04.150> where<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.420> simply<00:02:05.690> can<00:02:06.020> move

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.730 

to<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> mouse<00:02:09.360> cursor<00:02:09.630> that's<00:02:10.200> very<00:02:10.470> cool

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
to the mouse cursor that's very cool

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.140 
to the mouse cursor that's very cool
always<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.180> click<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.950> course<00:02:14.190> if

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
always one we can click and of course if

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150

you<00:02:15.330> want<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> search<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.650> want<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> type

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you want to search if you want to type

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.130 
you want to search if you want to type
something<00:02:17.430> simply<00:02:18.390> pull<00:02:18.570> up<00:02:18.720> division

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140

and<00:02:25.719> so<00:02:26.140> are<00:02:26.230> easier<00:02:26.650> than<00:02:26.709> entering<00:02:27.159> it<00:02:27.400> with

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
and so are easier than entering it with

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.089 
and so are easier than entering it with
remote<00:02:27.939> oh<00:02:28.299> yeah<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.650> actually<00:02:29.829> a
