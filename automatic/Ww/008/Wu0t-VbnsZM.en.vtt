00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.730
 at the airfield in Eisenach Kindel 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.250
 begins the crucial day of the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.660
 race as close as possible to his 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:28.080
 Norman has to be boliden 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:30.090
 zugfahrzeug stayed I have a 12 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.710
 1 driven was my best so far 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 Exercise also the speed of 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 plan km / h 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.010
 shock to me so I'm more than 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.480
 Satisfied a great result 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.899
 but Norman will keep this time 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.149
 can 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.829
 he must compete against harry who again 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.329
 yesterday had no problems and very 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.329
 consistently good times driven 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.850
 only then am I actually still too 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.520
 Bank driven tried two more times 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.059
 little reaction time practiced 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.560
 where really ok 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.720
 and that's why Harry turned away for 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.040
 at least committed to that today 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.040
 to come to victory podium 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.429
 toyota against bmw 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.429
 He will make it 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.200
 Both drivers give everything but Harry 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.200
 Norman is out 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.530
 So not so good unfortunately I 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.850
 in another, a clutch 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.200
 bit broke then 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.900
 noticed the second gear when driving off 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.430
 that she does not have 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:09.270
 so only 13 came out i got 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.920
 rear court and if ferrari against 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.120
 has done it and his next 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.120
 opponent is waiting 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:33.610
 chevrolet camaro 79 the engine is 383 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.530
 Kubicki motor is unfairly 6.3 liters with 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.880
 Harry has about 580 ps against this 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.300
 beefed up one at a time 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.300
 chance 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.420
 welcome to the finale so it is now 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.580
 four more cars left so with the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.600
 illumination runs so far all have 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.280
 opponents only cracked when it's wet 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.680
 plays along the screw stop me 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.300
 That should work 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.380
 Mike Tecklenburg and his camera have 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.380
 So it is in itself 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.900
 Harry gives everything but he has none 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.900
 chance against his controls 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.170
 better so far 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.560
 yesterday in the 12 but unfortunately not 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.400
 served camera or better 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.400
 reaction time had 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.120
 what does not stop 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.800
 mike is in the qualifying runs 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.200
 always a great time drove 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.650
 also the reaction time was the best of the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.650
 day 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.630
 and may may be against all opponents 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.630
 push through 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.230
 So no one is surprised that he is in the end 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.800
 of the day with the coveted winner's cup 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.800
 takes home 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.820
 being there is not everything 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.210
 better next time 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.210
 you have to be athletic 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.280
 the two points collected 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.120
 even if this time the success 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.069
 was denied 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.289
 in thought they are already at the next 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.729
 quarter mile race after hunting 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.729
 the fastest time
