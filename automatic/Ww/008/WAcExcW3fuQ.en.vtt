 Come on, calm bay please, I'm running 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 a sword fight packed me in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.340
 rest so to go to the house never so 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:47.329
 Clever but faithful, no one is ice cold 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:52.829
 then hears plus stones sword horny 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.329
 we get there I feel pure directly 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.399
 go and see what we have and everything 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.800
 People today it's like this again 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.800
 round which is really early in the morning 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.689
 dead 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.890
 really early tomorrow but also easy 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.240
 only I wanted you something last night 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.640
 record then I was somehow 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 quietly and then bykow you have to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.600
 Yes, it's too loud to be poor and me 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.430
 Yesterday I thought so only 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.100
 record was the evening I have to go 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.030
 speak quietly but I wanted to record 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.830
 but the recording with the verkackt 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.420
 make a mistake because the window is on 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.610
 Incorrect resolution has been included 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.220
 is a bit packed but that does not matter 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.380
 each time but first happen 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.930
 I 've noticed at the moment 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.020
 no normal project more so on 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.890
 So run with normal brad marchand 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 singleplayer project or something that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.840
 So it's fixed on a channel like that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.610
 that's why I wanted it from me 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.280
 Take a look at this recording today 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.720
 I'm asking for two v8 right now 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.450
 record and follow him 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.810
 what should you come online this afternoon? 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.090
 because so promised as a standard project 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 which twice a week three times a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.980
 so I want to have to come for weeks 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 definitely would have 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.640
 In any case, I was stubborn on many things 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.770
 also open for everything 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 Maybe you can get your ideas there 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.100
 maybe we just write what we like 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.650
 far his ladies and there and afterwards 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.130
 so it gets to the name suggestion or 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.560
 as far as I 'm so uncreative and that's why 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.930
 I just ask you what do you want 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.770
 then see though writes nice and so 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.330
 So I would be interested 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.910
 maybe you have some cool ones 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.110
 ideas with cool names or with 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.550
 Anyone whether we are there 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.490
 somehow buck or something so 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.380
 just write a nice contrast 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.630
 me as if he has cool ideas 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.510
 because I like that nothing at a 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.700
 and I just think to shiver 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.460
 is important what comes and you are important 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.850
 All the questions you like like 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.310
 therefore also the comment of one 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.200
 if that pleases if yes arises me 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.460
 I want to see it differently and you the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.420
 same opinion then there is this 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.760
 Just comment on the thumbs up 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.440
 instead of writing that now 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.920
 because I see it ok that you 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.960
 I want that and I like that much better 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:17.640

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:21.090
