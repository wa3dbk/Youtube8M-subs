probably a little bit louder but I do

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
probably a little bit louder but I do
see<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> audio<00:01:58.110> marks<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> quieter<00:01:59.460> so

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
see on the audio marks it is quieter so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
see on the audio marks it is quieter so
I<00:02:00.570> think<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> clear<00:02:01.200> winner<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.500> I'm

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
I think we have a clear winner here I'm

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
I think we have a clear winner here I'm
not<00:02:02.219> sure<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.000> guys<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.479> better

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
not sure which one you guys like better

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.380 
not sure which one you guys like better
but<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.649> know<00:02:05.040> from<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> Samsung<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.090> has<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
but I do know from the Samsung it has a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.229 
but I do know from the Samsung it has a
low<00:02:07.020> hum<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.520> don't<00:02:08.700> reduce<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
low hum to it if you don't reduce the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.950 
low hum to it if you don't reduce the
audio<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:10.259> around<00:02:10.649> 60<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.580> its<00:02:11.790> 100<00:02:12.360> output

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960

you<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> lot<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.640> background<00:02:14.880> noise<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
you do get a lot of background noise so

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.330
