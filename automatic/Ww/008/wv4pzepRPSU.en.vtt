00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
I think it's very well done I think

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.730 
I think it's very well done I think
you're<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:14.740> to<00:03:14.890> enjoy<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.790> price<00:03:16.060> is

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
you're going to enjoy it the price is

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.270 
you're going to enjoy it the price is
1550<00:03:18.060> for<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> decent<00:03:19.870> sized<00:03:20.200> meal<00:03:20.710> you<00:03:20.920> get<00:03:21.040> a

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
1550 for a decent sized meal you get a

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.220 
1550 for a decent sized meal you get a
bowl<00:03:21.520> of<00:03:21.640> rice

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.380 
bowl of rice
I<00:03:23.290> think<00:03:24.129> that<00:03:24.310> again<00:03:24.819> if<00:03:24.940> you're<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.239> area

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
I think that again if you're in the area

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.399 
I think that again if you're in the area
you<00:03:25.840> have<00:03:26.050> anywhere<00:03:26.500> access<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.159> PF<00:03:27.489> Changs

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
you have anywhere access to a PF Changs

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.009
