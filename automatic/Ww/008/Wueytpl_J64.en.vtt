00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 good to see spend a lot of things that 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.670
 have we can not always catch the ones with 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.490
 the cameras as if we open shadows to the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.740
 petition of a girl with powers 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.320
 psychics more developed the average of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.180
 we ask him how old he is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 you will hear clarito five designs with 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.410
 posters little girls we try that we are 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.750
 we who are sitting like 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.029
 the tables as presentation there 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.330
 from that chapel that in front of this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.099
 person sitting obviously in banks 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 all in silence and you hear the name 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.040
 it opened doors they saw more lights 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 but I tell you it was full and loaded 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 the place where you looked was that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.500
 wait a little bit and something happened 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.020
 outside you like to see when you understand that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.120
 there is a presence of children these 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.920
 entities has a little more than 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 tolerance when reacting 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.680
 problem that what they told us is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 that not only are there children apparently 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.300
 there were a couple of adults whipping 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.800
 to the little ones no no no but I tell you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.809
 also independently that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.140
 He heard a voice that someone who said 5 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.760
 and the presence of living children 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 in front of him there is a greater tolerance to 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.470
 moment to react 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.560
 like when you tell them if you are 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.300
 taken out please give us apparently 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.430
 do not we art an answer with figures 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.030
 implement I would say more than when there 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.100
 children and they are children the souls that are 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.020
 disembodied feel an attraction like 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 of game seems to have occurred many 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.759
 videos where girls at school when 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.740
 in the playground at recess are added 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.500
 another game who records on video 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.960
 then I would say that it is rather appetizing 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.820
 the presence of other small ones that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.590
 rather you do not tolerate clear that no 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.289
 Criteria of ubiquity work 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.540
 rather I'm interested I do not care that 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.480
 one attracts him gold 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.970
 anyway, it must be said that this 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.770
 experience so that they are not simply 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.420
 banal as to say the morbid ones in the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.760
 sense that the contact of a tree 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.650
 maya is done in networks or obviously 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.929
 subsequent problems in some way 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.090
 begging say for these presences that 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.370
 are there wandering maybe for how long 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.860
 alicante exactly or is it about 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.780
 also obviously to make a prayer 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.370
 collective to see if that is what the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.080
 can help in one way or another the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.690
 time to spend a number of things 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.640
 awesome you anyone 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.430
 this tour is open for me to do it 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.900
 and something is always going to happen between 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.240
 more people are leaving as who else 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.100
 that energy is counted in addition and with 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.800
 some of them their own tests in their 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.200
 phones with their psychophonies and nothing the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.730
 real phenomenon now a constancy me 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.410
 I imagine are phases that is to say of all the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.930
 people who participated in this tour 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.569
 with you and with freddy they felt and saw 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.239
 pretty much the same 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.219
 well, look at the videos that 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.560
 we live answered your question felipe 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:56.260
 there is a guy that collapses that falls to 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.909
 good knee before him to you there is a 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.439
 hallway in the room space death 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.540
 that because the windows that open 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.969
 alone and because apparently one of the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.250
 punishments there is a very small ladder of 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.810
 about five or six rungs that I think 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.210
 it's not the punishments that pushed us 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.870
 out there the kids and obviously for what 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.130
 will be hit in the fall as there is a 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.480
 experiment that I want to make you with 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.400
 blindfolded you go through the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.440
 hallway and you when you pass by there 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.180
 we let it cover to the side 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.860
 sometimes it's funny in the case to 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.960
 women because they want to imitate 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.310
 those who punish the most push them towards 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.530
 in front is like the saleh here because you 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.020
 you can fall but men seem like 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.060
 that adults see us more as 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.070
 Punishers like they push you over 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.740
 that you fall and in fact I passed and I 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.360
 I crouched better because I felt dizzy 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.890
 but one of the boys could not stand 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.810
 he said ameal was lost let's say at least one 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.850
 third the tour that was one of the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.560
 moments until the road and went to 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.660
 Black had to be woken up 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.470
 collapsed he fell to his knees as he entered 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.360
 that he threw it really hard down 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.060
 in fact what I was saying that shortly before 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.620
 trying the steps I already felt right to 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:06.600
 see what I confess what it is will feel like 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:08.710
 of the comfortable clothes uncle uncle but the for 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.750
 move it to people who are not 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:19.170
 familiar with this kind of panoramas and 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:21.970
 the paranormal reels this is done 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.710
 often in different places and 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.930
 other kind of places apart this house 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.880
 of the you only religious so 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.230
 loaded both in Santiago and outside 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.850
 all known several of them by 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.090
 supposed cemeteries are the main 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.860
 look, but I would say the biggest 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.350
 experience he has had in places that 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.660
 at some point they housed people 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.620
 generally people before us 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.240
 confined to but as colleges of 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.270
 interned or in this case that was 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.870
 orphanage cloister and currently the 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.990
 gluten but they were people that was their 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.340
 house they lived in a group and they obviously have 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.050
 an exchange of experiences several 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.340
 some a little painful in the case of 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.940
 the children of this place 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.570
 now that place is 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.640
 loaded look that for 185 one fell 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.130
 column and the wall is placed like this 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.810
 is framed they found a very note 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.560
 mysterious that said for whom 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.040
 find this paper 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.040
 I am absolutely your safest 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.919
 server to do with me what you 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.380
 please and please I invoked we are not 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.000
 all of the same order well a series of 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.310
 mystery that is stored between 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.080
 stones of one of the pillars still in 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.639
 those places with wearing a priest 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.160
 because we have already talked about it here 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.340
 the Catholic entities are exorcists 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.350
 they have a thing like without public there is a 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.240
 study not not all but some 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.580
 Catholic priests function as 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.470
 exorcist minister when there are presences 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.150
 negative in some places would not be enough 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.680
 with bringing a priest these places 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.290
 as to cleanse so that those souls 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.419
 rest do not seem like it but look 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.860
 that it did not turn out that much because 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.690
 of children people presence more 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.479
 strong and some religious as a 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.250
 nun that the guardian himself has said that 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.680
 saw once floating behind the hall 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.860
 is that there is talk of a malign presence 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.080
 of two people apparently I'm in 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.660
 possible street check it but it seems 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.340
 that there are people is punishing like 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.050
 very strict as teachers by 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.820
 say it so bad wave they continue 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.410
 scampering the little ones and there are others that 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.610
 they seem to have a power with a 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.229
 manifestation 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.509
 with a negative inflection even more 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.689
 powerful now you have to understand what 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.520
 until the year 73 and add two decades 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.069
 backwards this was a cloister of 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.620
 nuns of the true quality that they had 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.659
 a series of problems in fact never 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.340
 he tried but several psychics who were 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.039
 said it seems that even 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.419
 they hid fetuses and things like this happened 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.340
 in the history of our country good in 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.139
 all the one that I know you until 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.030
 ends in someone in the team to Peru 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.129
 well you know him 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.509
 there also some tremendous stories of 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.439
 like the one that has what was left 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.210
 pregnant 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:57.020
 In this cloister, the buses 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:59.939
 they were washed off with a load 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.680
 abortion clear but good anyone who 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.750
 let's say let's go through this 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.060
 experience is open for all 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.490
 people and I recommend it at least 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.090
 in life to have no doubt about 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.090
 that exists
