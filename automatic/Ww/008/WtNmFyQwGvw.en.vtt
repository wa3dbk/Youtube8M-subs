00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 for all my name is bad reputation and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.890
 I wanted to tell you that in the background there 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.299
 a game that has been playing for a long time 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.069
 I had and saved and the truth is that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.660
 I know if I got on the channel I'm watching 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.540
 the videos but I think I did not upload them 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.740
 but if I brought them up I'm very sorry 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.750
 but this is going to help me get organized 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.400
 a little bit more since I always 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.810
 I upload the videos he ended up deleting them from 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 my pc and this is not going to be erased 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.010
 better I made a mistake or something and I did not erase it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.350
 without wanting if that was that excuse me but 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.060
 I'm going to talk about the subject of the title of the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.470
 video that I know a lot of people that what 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 I did not know better 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 is saying wanna fuck and does not know what 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.010
 is what is happening but to me a lot 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 people sent me messages on facebook that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.309
 is where I look at them the most although 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.770
 I can not answer everything because it's very 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.770
 difficult many people told me that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.600
 microsoft bought equal hours of work 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.180
 when I started looking for a bit and I gave myself 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 I realized that it was true and I have to continue 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.070
 when he tells me that it was true 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.920
 turned the soul to the body the truth that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.809
 I felt a lot of happiness itself because it was 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.809
 true what I was doing 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.930
 spikins with gears of war was not me 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.350
 liking nothing 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.030
 for me very bad since the game 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.390
 practically has revived with this of 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.520
 microsoft let's see I'm not saying 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.050
 that microsoft is going to be the best 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.530
 guard history I do not know that I do not know how much 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.540
 but it's going to keep it alive and it's going to be 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.570
 nothing else will obviously not take 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.910
 the game already but if we already know that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.280
 they bought the right we guaranteed a 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.110
 new word virus is practically 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.600
 assured one did works because not that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.729
 I do not believe that microsoft buys 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 rights of the gears of wars not to create 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.170
 a new good software obviously like 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.970
 have new and the software and the truth 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.160
 I have to be very happy 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.780
 I want to know your opinion also for that 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.550
 I put in the title of the video good or bad 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.100
 because maybe some of you who 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.840
 believe that this is bad I think it is 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.560
 terrific since the only thing we're going to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.240
 to have 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 we know that epic games did it 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.979
 horribly wrong with the chat meant to me 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.240
 opinion and that of many because there is no 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.100
 more than entering games of 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.470
 multiplayer of one game and the other and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.899
 see that for example here in Spain 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.180
 when I get into jazz meant and I 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.420
 I look for a game where more 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.050
 people there is usually in all 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.560
 against everyone 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.930
 and there are 15 people to the best and here in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.930
 the gears of war 3 there are always 300 200 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.240
 300 200 people since it came out 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.100
 game obviously when the game came out 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.040
 there was more had not come to a thousand and one 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.410
 of people but now that the game already 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.330
 itself is dead it can be said that 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.400
 and he came out the next generation of games 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.040
 when it came out the just meant follow 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.010
 having 300 200 300 200 people 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.160
 constantly counting the best not to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.230
 the 34 hours in the morning there are 100 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.510
 people and in mint jazz there are two 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.990
 people playing what's happening 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.610
 difference I think it's great for me 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.920
 that Microsoft bought a game 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.190
 worse than what was doing it 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.750
 fitz james I do not think they do it for me 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.700
 I think that piquet was 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.060
 basing a lot on trying to sell the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.160
 game and that's why he ended up destroying and 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.160
 let's hope that microsoft hears a 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.660
 little to those of us who play the game and do not 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.870
 do as epic games that do what 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.819
 it came out of their noses you can say 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.250
 and you said they were going they would not put 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.870
 cropped and put it and did not meet the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.239
 word and did what they wanted with 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.739
 us that if we are the consumers and 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.680
 we are what we are the ones that we are going to 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.450
 define what game will serve and what 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.209
 game not what I play to sell and what 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.549
 game will not sell if jazz med 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.400
 will have sold many copies but the mouth 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.620
 I think it killed him since I 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.360
 I bought it and I was playing for a while 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.370
 and with anyone who comes to me 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.799
 ask right now I tell you look better 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.379
 do not buy it if you have the gears of 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.329
 war 3 play 10 or 23 if you do not have it and 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.840
 you want to buy a visogol buy yourself the 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.120
 gears of war 3 which is the best 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.110
 because we know that obviously a lot 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.610
 People say that 1 was the best 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.310
 and then there are other people that I know that 2 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.130
 but I think the 3 has is at 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.220
 limit of what was the chat men's 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.800
 jazz men has already crossed the line to me 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.239
 look and like I said to many people 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.880
 I also do not think I'm not that I do not think 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.970
 that is crazy me but that maybe 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.870
 we are all crazy and epic games I do not think 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.030
 that is not the case 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.740
 I want to know your opinions, give me the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.210
 comments if you think michael the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.120
 microsoft purchase of the rights of 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.550
 use word is better there for you to what 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.440
 better is not worse for me to be for this 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.770
 on the other they give me their explanations there 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.780
 so we can discuss and decide who 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.310
 we are the world gamer we are going to 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.970
 decide if microsoft is going to succeed or 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.970
 do not 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.800
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.120
 leave your comments remember it and we 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.120
 we have dared until then
