00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.690
 October 97 it becomes so that the second Quebec to reach the point 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.730
 the country's highest low-priced forest in 91 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.710
 but especially vernard see become 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.980
 one of the only this rumor to have walked 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.150
 the north pole the pole yield the center pole 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.529
 as he called himself the rest 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.869
 sharing the mersey 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.460
 every time I go down by m 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.800
 the latter remain modest 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.040
 but every time I showed 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.270
 The succession is assured 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.319
 so it was screaming in the sky 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.669
 he would go back I stay and more importantly 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.100
 he would not come back 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.700
 less publicized than the first escalation this expedition has allowed 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.980
 see to focus on the essentials the preparation and the fimat-to sion there 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.830
 shone today back with his companion nathalie tremblay and surprise 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.040
 the dear no orgy 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.940
 yet the narrative is therefore the most sober of many years as this 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.490
 device it took three years for the climb called the assembly to 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.230
 noon and sisters it's a great friend 10 6 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.670
 we stayed on the ground 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.600
 in summary 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 and percent 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.590
 she's talking to nobody and at this hour 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 we have a holy horror of that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.939
 what he does not say if the mass margin separates life and death 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.070
 in the cold the rarefied air europe the ice and the snow a medium so 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.040
 hostile that even during his sleep the climber loses weight and strength 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.980
 so when we go so far and also for you we have the right to report a 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.900
 little memory but I have not forgotten apam in bottle rank 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.460
 this brings to a European passport in the region

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.420
 arises when too many people but what are the few drops 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 which cost the most effort 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.830
 the hardest percent 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.290
 the Serbian president the plot the pana 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.889
