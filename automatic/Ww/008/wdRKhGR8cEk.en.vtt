left side of our charcoal rock there and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.410 
left side of our charcoal rock there and
then<00:02:09.180> what<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.510> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:12.270> ahead

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
then what I'm going to do is go ahead

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.460 
then what I'm going to do is go ahead
and<00:02:13.190> drop<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.460> all<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.060> way<00:02:15.210> down<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and drop this all the way down to the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.520 
and drop this all the way down to the
lowest<00:02:16.710> setting<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:19.290> we're<00:02:19.380> going<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
lowest setting and then we're going to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.770 
lowest setting and then we're going to
get<00:02:19.710> our<00:02:21.350> grilled<00:02:22.350> grill<00:02:22.860> grates<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
get our grilled grill grates on on the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.810 
get our grilled grill grates on on the
top<00:02:24.990> here<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:26.570> basically<00:02:28.490> get<00:02:29.490> this<00:02:29.640> thing

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
top here and basically get this thing

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.570 
top here and basically get this thing
preheated<00:02:30.480> okay<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.350> idea<00:02:31.710> now<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:31.980> that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
preheated okay so the idea now is that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.020 
preheated okay so the idea now is that
after<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.210> get<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.080> grill<00:02:34.290> preheated<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:35.280> I'm

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
after I get the grill preheated here I'm

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.180 
after I get the grill preheated here I'm
going<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.330> be<00:02:36.450> cooking<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.050> fillets<00:02:37.530> low<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
going to be cooking the fillets low and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.010 
going to be cooking the fillets low and
