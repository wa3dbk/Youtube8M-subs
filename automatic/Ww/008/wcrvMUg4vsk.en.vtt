00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.420
 how are you I am dragon and welcome to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.540
 a new video this time we are in the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.300
 unboxing of call of duty black ops 2 la 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.490
 normal edition I know badly because I wanted 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.360
 get the armored edition since a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.360
 a moment 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.480
 there we are as you have seen in others 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.320
 videos because I have the route and radiation 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.850
 offered the black ops the 1 but 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.430
 well this time he plays saying the man 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.460
 nothing happens the game is the same way 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.400
 campaign multiplayer mode and how not 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 classic zombies from the hand of trailers 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.470
 for call of duty 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.150
 excellent map included 2025 knock down 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.700
 I do not know if you can appreciate it I do not think 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.230
 because the camera as always is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.450
 giving in the ass and it looks like a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.300
 shit so nothing let's proceed to 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.430
 open it as always here the games of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.750
 playstation 3 I do not know if with xbox passed 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.360
 to the same program I suppose that also 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.250
 has a small eyelash that has not 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.470
 served much because look how it has 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.770
 stayed this but good 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.560
 the little girl was once I speak it 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.180
 ok here is the game the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.480
 instructions and I guess around here 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.520
 I will have a code, I will not look at it 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.859
 if it seems to have 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.560
 the paper ready paper to this one of a 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:26.689
 town then the reservation code in the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 card to download this card 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.620
 to download it worth the code is that 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.940
 endorse the code is behind 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.220
 this was good for it to look and nothing 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.680
 More instructions 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.230
 how the game goes like this and how few 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.930
 instructions because lately I do not know 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.170
 they bother a lot to do instructions and 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.830
 the impeccable new game just came out 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.490
 from the factory so nothing will I save 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.490
 this over here 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.490
 I have doubts we have serious doubts in that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.290
 it's the first thing that I will play the most 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.140
 sure is that the first thing you play is 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.829
 the zombies because while you climb a 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.259
 YouTube video 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.840
 the connection goes very slow and you can not 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.489
 use the multiplayer so I'm going to upload 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.260
 this video while going up I'm going to try 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.750
 the zombie mode and once the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.040
 video and play the multiplayer to see 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.970
 of some games so that tomorrow 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.610
 you can see how some games of the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.459
 that I have done nothing else we see ourselves in the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.050
 next video soon soon not tomorrow 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.390
 same already 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.880
 new gameplays on the channel this time 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.850
 it was decalogue of targets 2 and nothing else 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.850
