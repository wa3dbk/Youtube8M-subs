definitely has taken the spot right now
I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> best<00:01:04.019> PVC<00:01:04.500> player<00:01:04.799> right<00:01:05.250> now

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
I think as the best PVC player right now

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.810 
I think as the best PVC player right now
I'm<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.970> used<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.510> soo<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.820> dead

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.370 
I'm it used to be be soo but that's dead
and<00:01:09.000> gone<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:09.840> was<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.200> not

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and gone now I think these was just not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.960 
and gone now I think these was just not
performing<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> level<00:01:11.430> he<00:01:11.520> should<00:01:11.850> be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
performing up to the level he should be

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.660 
performing up to the level he should be
able<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.420> move<00:01:13.409> meanwhile<00:01:13.890> has<00:01:14.159> become<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
able to move meanwhile has become one of

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
able to move meanwhile has become one of
the<00:01:14.790> best<00:01:15.000> Protoss<00:01:15.390> players<00:01:15.630> around<00:01:15.990> he<00:01:16.290> still

he<00:01:58.649> has<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.070> takes<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.630> consistently

think<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.180> take<00:02:06.570> them<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> best<00:02:07.200> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
think you can take them in a best of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.410 
think you can take them in a best of
five<00:02:07.380> series<00:02:07.590> unfortunately<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
five series unfortunately this is a

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.059 
five series unfortunately this is a
best-of-three<00:02:09.780> those<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:10.920> is

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
best-of-three those so this I think is

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.500 
best-of-three those so this I think is
best<00:02:11.280> chance<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> advance<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.120> round<00:02:12.450> of

best chance to advance the round of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.380 
best chance to advance the round of
eight

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
eight

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.730

he<00:03:27.549> has<00:03:27.670> overall<00:03:28.030> very<00:03:28.450> good<00:03:29.010> unit<00:03:30.010> control

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
he has overall very good unit control

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.650 
he has overall very good unit control
nice<00:03:31.870> micro<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.640> when<00:03:33.640> he<00:03:33.730> gets<00:03:34.060> into<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
nice micro and when he gets into the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.630 
nice micro and when he gets into the
late<00:03:34.840> mid<00:03:35.290> game<00:03:35.500> i<00:03:35.560> would<00:03:35.829> say<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.220> when<00:03:36.489> his

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
late mid game i would say it's when his

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.430 
late mid game i would say it's when his
macro<00:03:37.239> really<00:03:37.510> kicks<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.959> he's<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.140> tough<00:03:38.410> guy

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
macro really kicks and he's a tough guy

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.009 
macro really kicks and he's a tough guy
did<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.250> was<00:03:39.459> not<00:03:39.640> something<00:03:39.940> i<00:03:40.150> really<00:03:40.660> saw

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
did this was not something i really saw

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.780 
did this was not something i really saw
in<00:03:41.170> him<00:03:41.350> earlier<00:03:41.739> on<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:42.160> half<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.519> year<00:03:42.670> ago

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
in him earlier on like half a year ago

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.150 
in him earlier on like half a year ago
or<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:44.110> maybe<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.410> little<00:03:44.530> bit<00:03:44.680> more<00:03:44.829> than<00:03:45.010> that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
or so maybe a little bit more than that

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.720 
or so maybe a little bit more than that
I<00:03:45.430> suppose<00:03:46.329> before<00:03:46.690> he<00:03:46.900> became<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.860> player

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
I suppose before he became a player

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.670 
I suppose before he became a player
who's<00:03:48.910> capable<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.450> winning<00:03:49.630> ace<00:03:50.110> matches<00:03:50.560> a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
who's capable of winning ace matches a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.840 
who's capable of winning ace matches a
player<00:03:50.920> who's<00:03:51.100> capable<00:03:51.310> winning<00:03:51.730> in<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
player who's capable winning in the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.400 
player who's capable winning in the
clutch<00:03:52.030> before<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.630> don't<00:03:52.959> think<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.170> saw

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
clutch before that I don't think I saw

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.110 
clutch before that I don't think I saw
in<00:03:53.590> him<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:54.070> saw<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.340> unit<00:03:54.700> control<00:03:55.000> but

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
in him this I saw the unit control but

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.120 
in him this I saw the unit control but
did<00:03:55.209> not<00:03:55.450> see<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.870> macro<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:56.470> now<00:03:56.590> he's<00:03:56.739> macro

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
did not see the macro but now he's macro

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.500 
did not see the macro but now he's macro
is<00:03:57.250> really<00:03:57.489> kicked<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:57.850> he's<00:03:58.090> become<00:03:58.299> a<00:03:58.329> much

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
is really kicked and he's become a much

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.539 
is really kicked and he's become a much
better<00:03:58.750> macro<00:03:59.049> player<00:03:59.380> but<00:03:59.620> one<00:03:59.769> of<00:03:59.860> the<00:03:59.950> one

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
better macro player but one of the one

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.039 
better macro player but one of the one
of<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.670> better<00:04:00.910> Protoss<00:04:01.420> macro<00:04:01.810> players

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
of the better Protoss macro players

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.949 
of the better Protoss macro players

or two probing walk so coming of the
line<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.660> think<00:04:38.810> it's<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.080> scouting<00:04:39.440> pro<00:04:39.770> back

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.320 
line I think it's a scouting pro back
she<00:04:40.070> never<00:04:40.250> got<00:04:40.370> killed<00:04:40.669> this<00:04:40.760> entire<00:04:41.060> time<00:04:41.270> so

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
she never got killed this entire time so

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.460 
she never got killed this entire time so
nice<00:04:41.630> play<00:04:41.900> there<00:04:42.080> were<00:04:42.139> only<00:04:42.199> nice

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
nice play there were only nice

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.629 
nice play there were only nice
micromanagement<00:04:42.949> overall<00:04:43.310> they<00:04:43.460> weren't

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
micromanagement overall they weren't

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.820 
micromanagement overall they weren't
really<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:44.000> many<00:04:44.120> drug<00:04:44.780> inside<00:04:45.080> his<00:04:45.229> base<00:04:45.440> is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
really that many drug inside his base is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.340 
really that many drug inside his base is
more<00:04:46.040> focused<00:04:46.160> on<00:04:46.630> doing<00:04:47.630> other<00:04:47.870> things<00:04:47.960> too

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
more focused on doing other things too

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.409 
more focused on doing other things too
so<00:04:48.500> it's<00:04:48.650> not<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:49.100> they're<00:04:49.220> gonna<00:04:49.340> might<00:04:50.150> try

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
so it's not that they're gonna might try

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.700 
so it's not that they're gonna might try
to<00:04:50.449> engage<00:04:50.750> these<00:04:50.930> drawings<00:04:51.139> want<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.590> be<00:04:51.650> able

to engage these drawings want to be able

to be careful about it to zealots can

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.210 
to be careful about it to zealots can
engage<00:04:53.720> 63<00:04:54.560> brings<00:04:54.740> but<00:04:54.919> they<00:04:54.979> have<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.100> be
