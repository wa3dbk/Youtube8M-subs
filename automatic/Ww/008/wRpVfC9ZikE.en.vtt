00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.990
 you still have to lay down in this pedal 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.020
 just take 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.020
 and unleash everything 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.019

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:51.660
 so everything is in a circle, in principle, that's all 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.830
 there is nothing more 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.700
 tasks for 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.700
 nothing else 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 you can just rub it with alcohol 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:09.049

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.870
 so already did 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.840

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:34.460

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:39.370
