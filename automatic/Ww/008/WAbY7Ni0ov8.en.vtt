flat<00:00:24.039> here<00:00:24.369> on<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.550> nice<00:00:24.789> drawing<00:00:25.390> board<00:00:26.050> what's

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
flat here on a nice drawing board what's

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.380 
flat here on a nice drawing board what's
your<00:00:26.770> intention<00:00:27.250> at<00:00:27.369> who<00:00:27.520> is<00:00:27.669> this<00:00:27.849> villain

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
your intention at who is this villain

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.380 
your intention at who is this villain
yeah<00:00:29.169> this<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.590> regular<00:00:29.919> and<00:00:30.369> he<00:00:30.700> opens<00:00:31.180> like

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
yeah this is a regular and he opens like

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.390 
yeah this is a regular and he opens like
really<00:00:31.840> wife<00:00:32.020> also<00:00:32.439> at<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.829> second<00:00:33.220> buying

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
really wife also at the second buying

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.020 
really wife also at the second buying
level<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.090> if<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:35.110> have<00:00:35.230> two<00:00:35.410> aces<00:00:35.920> there's<00:00:36.760> the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
level so if I have two aces there's the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.390 
level so if I have two aces there's the
tooth<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.930> chance<00:00:38.379> that<00:00:38.620> he<00:00:38.739> has<00:00:38.860> an<00:00:38.980> ace<00:00:39.160> is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
tooth the chance that he has an ace is

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.100 
tooth the chance that he has an ace is
two<00:00:39.610> times<00:00:39.879> as<00:00:40.120> small<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:42.780> there's<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.870> very

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
two times as small so there's a very

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.079 
two times as small so there's a very
small<00:00:44.290> chance<00:00:44.530> he's<00:00:45.040> going<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.370> call<00:00:45.640> if<00:00:45.879> I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
small chance he's going to call if I

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.660 
small chance he's going to call if I
Reeve<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.870> slim<00:00:47.230> usually<00:00:47.949> it's<00:00:48.070> like<00:00:48.250> fifteen

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
Reeve a slim usually it's like fifteen

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.700 
Reeve a slim usually it's like fifteen
percent<00:00:48.940> he<00:00:49.150> has<00:00:49.269> neighs<00:00:49.570> now<00:00:50.320> it's<00:00:50.559> like

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
percent he has neighs now it's like

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.799 
percent he has neighs now it's like
seven<00:00:51.129> percent<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:51.699> if<00:00:51.879> I<00:00:52.030> think<00:00:52.299> that<00:00:52.510> he<00:00:52.659> will

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
seven percent so if I think that he will

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.460 
seven percent so if I think that he will
call<00:00:53.049> with<00:00:53.890> every<00:00:54.280> ace<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.780> rear<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.110> slim

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
call with every ace if I rear a slim

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.770 
call with every ace if I rear a slim
then<00:00:57.100> that's<00:00:57.339> like<00:00:57.460> only<00:00:57.760> seven<00:00:58.210> percent<00:00:58.360> of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
then that's like only seven percent of

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.570 
then that's like only seven percent of
his<00:00:58.960> hands<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.680> six<00:00:59.949> percent<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.430> the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
his hands and six percent of the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.119 
his hands and six percent of the
Pharisee<00:01:01.000> will<00:01:01.150> call<00:01:01.390> and<00:01:01.799> so<00:01:02.799> that's<00:01:02.949> like

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
Pharisee will call and so that's like

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.160 
Pharisee will call and so that's like
thirteen<00:01:03.640> percent<00:01:03.970> he<00:01:04.330> will<00:01:04.479> call<00:01:04.659> some<00:01:04.930> king

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
thirteen percent he will call some king

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.460 
thirteen percent he will call some king
jack<00:01:05.500> king<00:01:06.040> queen<00:01:06.310> maybe<00:01:07.270> King<00:01:07.659> 10<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.229> maybe

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
jack king queen maybe King 10 so maybe

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.640 
jack king queen maybe King 10 so maybe
like<00:01:08.740> sixteen<00:01:09.189> or<00:01:09.310> seventeen<00:01:09.369> percent<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.390> his

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
like sixteen or seventeen percent of his

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.590 
like sixteen or seventeen percent of his
total<00:01:11.650> range<00:01:11.860> he<00:01:12.250> will<00:01:12.430> call<00:01:12.640> but<00:01:13.000> he<00:01:13.090> opens

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
total range he will call but he opens

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.770 
total range he will call but he opens
like<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:15.280> than<00:01:15.430> seventy<00:01:15.909> percent<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.479> think

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
like more than seventy percent I think

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.380 
like more than seventy percent I think
so<00:01:17.590> only<00:01:18.520> one<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:19.770> four<00:01:20.770> times<00:01:21.130> or<00:01:21.460> even<00:01:21.520> a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
so only one in four times or even a

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.359 
so only one in four times or even a
little<00:01:22.600> bit<00:01:22.719> less<00:01:22.960> he<00:01:23.170> will<00:01:23.200> call<00:01:23.530> if<00:01:23.679> i<00:01:23.829> push<00:01:24.070> I

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
little bit less he will call if i push I

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.169 
little bit less he will call if i push I
think<00:01:24.640> if<00:01:24.789> I<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.920> call<00:01:27.159> i<00:01:27.429> can<00:01:27.789> get<00:01:27.969> more

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
think if I just call i can get more

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.450 
think if I just call i can get more
value<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:28.869> if<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.289> Kings<00:01:29.649> I<00:01:29.829> which<00:01:30.009> is<00:01:30.159> pushed

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
value but if I Kings I which is pushed

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.690 
value but if I Kings I which is pushed
from<00:01:31.119> their<00:01:31.530> agency<00:01:32.530> calls<00:01:32.770> my<00:01:32.979> winry<00:01:33.490> race

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
from their agency calls my winry race

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.749 
from their agency calls my winry race
sure<00:01:34.179> sure<00:01:34.869> then<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.890> flop<00:01:36.130> comes<00:01:36.399> down

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
sure sure then the flop comes down

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.050 
sure sure then the flop comes down
fairly<00:01:37.329> wide<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:38.049> he<00:01:38.350> checks<00:01:38.649> behind<00:01:39.219> I<00:01:39.579> know

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
fairly wide and he checks behind I know

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.580 
fairly wide and he checks behind I know
that's<00:01:40.240> probably<00:01:40.450> not<00:01:40.719> what<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.960> wanted<00:01:41.409> to

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
that's probably not what you wanted to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.690 
that's probably not what you wanted to
see<00:01:42.179> I<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:44.380> care<00:01:44.530> like<00:01:44.799> too<00:01:45.039> much<00:01:45.340> because

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
see I don't care like too much because

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.149 
see I don't care like too much because
if<00:01:46.329> he<00:01:46.719> checks<00:01:46.990> there<00:01:47.319> i'm<00:01:47.469> on<00:01:47.679> this<00:01:47.920> drawing

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
if he checks there i'm on this drawing

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.489 
if he checks there i'm on this drawing
board<00:01:48.549> we<00:01:48.880> already<00:01:49.030> know<00:01:49.509> right<00:01:49.780> he<00:01:50.170> doesn't

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
board we already know right he doesn't

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:54.050 
board we already know right he doesn't
have<00:01:50.590> anything<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:52.149> let's<00:01:52.659> see<00:01:52.840> what<00:01:52.990> happens

because the intent that you're saying
that<00:01:57.789> is<00:01:58.149> on<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.509> lot<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.289> wet<00:01:59.469> drawing

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
that is on a lot of the wet drawing

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.559 
that is on a lot of the wet drawing
boards<00:02:00.340> they're<00:02:00.520> almost<00:02:00.670> always<00:02:01.090> going<00:02:01.479> to

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
boards they're almost always going to

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.370 
boards they're almost always going to
make<00:02:02.289> see<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.130> there<00:02:03.340> yeah<00:02:03.969> they<00:02:04.960> don't<00:02:05.109> want

many hands that I could have and they

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.559 
many hands that I could have and they

don't want to see that a turn card
objection<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.439> is<00:02:32.590> what<00:02:32.739> exactly<00:02:33.310> what

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
objection and this is what exactly what

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.910 
objection and this is what exactly what
would<00:02:33.700> have<00:02:33.849> happened<00:02:34.299> if<00:02:34.480> he<00:02:35.409> was<00:02:35.620> checking

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
would have happened if he was checking

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.039 
would have happened if he was checking
and<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.430> was<00:02:36.579> sitting<00:02:36.909> here<00:02:36.939> with<00:02:37.239> King<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.629> that

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
and I was sitting here with King a that

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.989 
and I was sitting here with King a that
I<00:02:38.079> probably<00:02:38.439> would<00:02:38.709> have<00:02:38.829> raised<00:02:39.519> his<00:02:39.790> sea

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:39.999 
I probably would have raised his sea

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.509 
I probably would have raised his sea
bass<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.510> we<00:02:40.749> probably<00:02:41.019> went<00:02:41.349> all<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:42.370> now

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
bass and we probably went all in but now

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.309 
bass and we probably went all in but now
all<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.760> summer<00:02:43.120> when<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.389> ACE<00:02:43.629> columns<00:02:44.109> I

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
all the summer when the ACE columns I

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.349 
all the summer when the ACE columns I
might<00:02:45.040> even<00:02:45.069> fold<00:02:45.579> here<00:02:45.879> when<00:02:46.060> he<00:02:46.209> bet<00:02:46.389> no<00:02:48.359> let

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
might even fold here when he bet no let

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.780 
might even fold here when he bet no let
me<00:02:49.480> check<00:02:49.510> out<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.170> let<00:02:50.650> him<00:02:50.680> bet<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.219> switch

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
me check out and let him bet be a switch

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.170 
me check out and let him bet be a switch
he<00:02:51.939> does<00:02:52.349> yeah<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.680> now<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:53.829> think<00:02:54.219> like<00:02:54.430> yeah

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
he does yeah and now I think like yeah

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.449 
he does yeah and now I think like yeah
how<00:02:55.420> many<00:02:55.480> outs<00:02:55.959> do<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.260> get<00:02:56.590> him<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.069> this

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
how many outs do I get him in this

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.330 
how many outs do I get him in this
situation<00:02:57.669> I<00:02:58.450> know<00:02:59.139> he's<00:02:59.469> always<00:02:59.739> going<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.310> be

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
situation I know he's always going to be

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.949 
situation I know he's always going to be
off<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.519> ACE<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.749> perfect

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
off the ACE this is like the perfect

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.000 
off the ACE this is like the perfect
card<00:03:02.439> I<00:03:02.739> know<00:03:03.669> he<00:03:04.000> doesn't<00:03:04.209> have<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.569> seven

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
card I know he doesn't have a seven

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.800 
card I know he doesn't have a seven
basically<00:03:06.010> because<00:03:06.189> if<00:03:06.760> he<00:03:06.939> gets<00:03:07.150> an<00:03:07.299> open<00:03:07.629> end

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
basically because if he gets an open end

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.780 
basically because if he gets an open end
there<00:03:07.989> with<00:03:08.560> these<00:03:08.769> lines<00:03:09.099> when<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.579> fourth

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
there with these lines when the fourth

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.240 
there with these lines when the fourth
is<00:03:09.909> already<00:03:10.299> so<00:03:10.540> big<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.079> floor<00:03:11.290> he's<00:03:11.980> just

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
is already so big on the floor he's just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.179 
is already so big on the floor he's just
going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.639> bed<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:13.000> open<00:03:13.359> and<00:03:13.510> there<00:03:13.719> and<00:03:14.189> the

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
going to bed is open and there and the

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.490 
going to bed is open and there and the
thing<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.459> he<00:03:16.000> probably<00:03:16.180> dozens<00:03:16.930> raised<00:03:17.199> like

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
thing is he probably dozens raised like

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.330 
thing is he probably dozens raised like
72<00:03:18.040> 73<00:03:18.489> seven<00:03:19.090> yeah<00:03:19.840> those<00:03:20.199> hands<00:03:20.650> on<00:03:21.159> the

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
72 73 seven yeah those hands on the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.399 
72 73 seven yeah those hands on the
floor<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:21.909> or<00:03:22.449> 74<00:03:23.579> so<00:03:24.579> if<00:03:24.939> he<00:03:25.150> raises<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.930> seven

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
floor so or 74 so if he raises the seven

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.849 
floor so or 74 so if he raises the seven
it's<00:03:26.799> either<00:03:27.069> like<00:03:27.219> ten<00:03:28.150> seven<00:03:28.659> then<00:03:29.620> he<00:03:29.650> has<00:03:29.829> a

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
it's either like ten seven then he has a

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.679 
it's either like ten seven then he has a
straight<00:03:30.250> he<00:03:30.400> would<00:03:30.549> have<00:03:30.669> bedded<00:03:31.000> Jack<00:03:31.269> seven

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
straight he would have bedded Jack seven

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.289 
straight he would have bedded Jack seven
years<00:03:31.900> also<00:03:32.109> an<00:03:32.349> over<00:03:32.650> card<00:03:32.919> or<00:03:33.519> like<00:03:34.000> Queen

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
years also an over card or like Queen

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.240 
years also an over card or like Queen
seven<00:03:34.719> all<00:03:34.840> those<00:03:35.049> hands<00:03:35.379> he<00:03:35.469> which<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.829> bad<00:03:36.040> so

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
seven all those hands he which is bad so

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.280 
seven all those hands he which is bad so
he<00:03:36.280> doesn't<00:03:36.609> have<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.849> seven<00:03:37.329> he<00:03:37.840> doesn't<00:03:38.199> have

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
he doesn't have a seven he doesn't have

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.580 
he doesn't have a seven he doesn't have
a<00:03:38.319> nine<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.340> he<00:03:40.180> could<00:03:40.359> have<00:03:40.509> a<00:03:40.540> flush<00:03:40.870> draw<00:03:40.900> if

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
a nine so he could have a flush draw if

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.129 
a nine so he could have a flush draw if
he<00:03:41.799> has<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:41.919> fossil<00:03:42.519> then<00:03:43.269> he<00:03:43.419> has<00:03:43.540> now<00:03:43.720> twenty

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
he has a fossil then he has now twenty

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.229 
he has a fossil then he has now twenty
percent<00:03:44.439> chance<00:03:44.680> waited<00:03:45.159> on<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> river<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:45.970> I

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
percent chance waited on the river and I

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.619 
percent chance waited on the river and I
would<00:03:46.299> be<00:03:46.599> happy<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.959> give<00:03:47.139> him<00:03:47.439> the<00:03:47.470> chance

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
would be happy to give him the chance

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:56.039 
would be happy to give him the chance
sure<00:03:49.629> sure<00:03:51.180> then<00:03:52.180> comes<00:03:52.540> here<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.400> now<00:03:55.049> why

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
sure sure then comes here and now why

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.740 
sure sure then comes here and now why
you<00:03:56.109> what<00:03:56.859> would<00:03:57.189> explain<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.970> river<00:03:58.509> play

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
you what would explain the river play

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.649 
you what would explain the river play
here<00:03:58.989> when<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.769> five<00:03:59.949> hits<00:04:00.340> yeah<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.060> know<00:04:01.209> he

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
here when the five hits yeah I know he

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.460 
here when the five hits yeah I know he
doesn't<00:04:02.199> have<00:04:02.409> a<00:04:02.530> seven<00:04:02.949> and<00:04:04.049> he<00:04:05.049> could<00:04:05.290> have<00:04:05.439> a

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
doesn't have a seven and he could have a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.710 
doesn't have a seven and he could have a
nice<00:04:05.769> but<00:04:06.099> I<00:04:06.129> mean<00:04:06.310> probably<00:04:06.759> doesn't<00:04:07.479> have<00:04:07.569> an

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
nice but I mean probably doesn't have an

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.330 
nice but I mean probably doesn't have an
H<00:04:07.810> either<00:04:08.079> because<00:04:08.500> there's<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:08.949> only<00:04:09.159> one

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
H either because there's like only one

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.839 
H either because there's like only one
ace<00:04:09.669> in<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:10.000> deck<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.500> looks<00:04:11.889> me<00:04:12.159> like<00:04:12.609> I

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
ace in the deck and it looks me like I

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.330 
ace in the deck and it looks me like I
have<00:04:13.180> like<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.479> nine<00:04:13.780> ornate<00:04:14.229> then<00:04:15.009> I'm<00:04:15.159> just

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
have like a nine ornate then I'm just

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.879 
have like a nine ornate then I'm just
going<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.759> call<00:04:15.969> and<00:04:16.269> of<00:04:16.870> course<00:04:17.199> I<00:04:17.440> could<00:04:17.680> also

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
going to call and of course I could also

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.939 
going to call and of course I could also
have<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> seven<00:04:19.019> that's<00:04:20.019> like<00:04:20.259> a<00:04:20.289> very<00:04:20.650> small

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
have a seven that's like a very small

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.890 
have a seven that's like a very small
chance<00:04:21.009> i<00:04:21.459> might<00:04:21.669> have<00:04:21.880> raised<00:04:22.150> with<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.449> seven

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
chance i might have raised with a seven

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.580 
chance i might have raised with a seven
so<00:04:24.030> he<00:04:25.030> probably<00:04:25.330> thinks<00:04:25.690> that<00:04:26.020> i<00:04:26.050> have<00:04:26.380> like

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
so he probably thinks that i have like

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.730 
so he probably thinks that i have like
nine<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:27.370> eight<00:04:27.520> or<00:04:27.940> or<00:04:28.180> or<00:04:28.620> something<00:04:29.620> like

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
nine and eight or or or something like

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.339 
nine and eight or or or something like
that<00:04:29.800> or<00:04:30.009> six<00:04:30.580> or<00:04:30.909> Jack<00:04:31.360> ten<00:04:31.599> or<00:04:31.840> queen<00:04:32.080> Jack

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
that or six or Jack ten or queen Jack

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.010 
that or six or Jack ten or queen Jack
whatever<00:04:32.849> so<00:04:33.849> I'm<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.210> going<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.509> check<00:04:34.780> and

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
whatever so I'm just going to check and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.379 
whatever so I'm just going to check and
let<00:04:35.139> him<00:04:35.349> love<00:04:35.530> he<00:04:35.800> can<00:04:35.949> represent<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.550> ace<00:04:36.669> he

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
let him love he can represent the ace he

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.089 
let him love he can represent the ace he
thinks<00:04:37.719> that<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.900> would<00:04:38.169> reversal<00:04:38.770> in<00:04:38.889> with

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
thinks that I would reversal in with

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.209 
thinks that I would reversal in with
every<00:04:39.370> ace<00:04:39.659> so<00:04:40.659> the<00:04:41.139> only<00:04:41.289> thing<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.800> that

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
every ace so the only thing is that

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.550 
every ace so the only thing is that
that's<00:04:43.000> like<00:04:43.090> totally<00:04:43.389> true<00:04:43.779> but<00:04:43.960> not<00:04:44.229> if<00:04:44.409> I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
that's like totally true but not if I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.510 
that's like totally true but not if I
two<00:04:44.620> aces

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
two aces

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.499

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
know that this guy is thinking like this

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.080 
know that this guy is thinking like this
because<00:04:51.729> it's<00:04:52.030> pretty<00:04:52.330> good<00:04:52.509> player<00:04:53.849> so<00:04:54.849> in

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
and that that I think is you know real

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.140 
and that that I think is you know real
said<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.979> whole<00:05:09.159> time<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.639> putting<00:05:09.970> him<00:05:10.060> on

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
said the whole time you putting him on

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.080 
said the whole time you putting him on
here<00:05:10.449> when<00:05:10.900> you<00:05:11.500> I'm<00:05:12.039> sorry<00:05:12.370> when<00:05:12.610> he<00:05:12.849> is

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
here when you I'm sorry when he is

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.110 
here when you I'm sorry when he is
putting<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.629> on<00:05:13.659> a<00:05:13.810> hand<00:05:14.169> on<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.849> could

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
putting you on a hand on the you could

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.180 
putting you on a hand on the you could
have<00:05:16.389> a<00:05:16.419> nine<00:05:16.780> because<00:05:17.319> maybe<00:05:17.770> he<00:05:17.889> would<00:05:18.099> have

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
have a nine because maybe he would have

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.620 
have a nine because maybe he would have
gone<00:05:18.280> for<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.580> check<00:05:18.849> raised<00:05:19.090> on<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.419> flop

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
gone for a check raised on the flop

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.600 
gone for a check raised on the flop
that's<00:05:20.050> why<00:05:20.289> I<00:05:20.319> nine<00:05:20.680> is<00:05:20.889> in<00:05:21.039> your<00:05:21.220> range<00:05:21.370> of

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
that's why I nine is in your range of

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.249 
that's why I nine is in your range of
what<00:05:21.759> he<00:05:21.849> perceives<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.449> to<00:05:22.539> have<00:05:22.720> yeah

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
what he perceives you to have yeah

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.480 
what he perceives you to have yeah
exactly<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:25.360> then<00:05:25.569> the<00:05:25.720> seven<00:05:26.289> so<00:05:26.680> then<00:05:27.370> when

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
exactly and then the seven so then when

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.159 
exactly and then the seven so then when
the<00:05:27.610> five<00:05:27.819> cons<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:28.539> check<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:28.840> he

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
the five cons and you check that he

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.809 
the five cons and you check that he
obviously<00:05:29.440> takes<00:05:29.770> a<00:05:29.919> 7<00:05:30.310> out<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.490> your<00:05:30.699> range

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
obviously takes a 7 out of your range

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.909 
obviously takes a 7 out of your range
he's<00:05:31.539> going<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.840> try<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.080> get<00:05:32.289> you<00:05:32.470> up<00:05:32.620> an<00:05:32.770> eight

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
he's going to try to get you up an eight

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:39.300 
he's going to try to get you up an eight
or<00:05:33.099> even<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.849> six<00:05:34.949> yeah<00:05:35.949> sure<00:05:37.110> perfect<00:05:38.310> very
