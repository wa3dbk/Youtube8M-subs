so<00:00:02.250> working<00:00:02.460> on<00:00:02.639> Oh<00:00:02.790> six<00:00:03.120> Toyota<00:00:03.629> Sienna<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.350> I

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
so working on Oh six Toyota Sienna and I

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.070 
so working on Oh six Toyota Sienna and I
just<00:00:05.520> did<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.670> timing<00:00:05.970> belt<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.750> rack<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
just did a timing belt and a rack and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.799 
just did a timing belt and a rack and
pinion<00:00:07.849> switched<00:00:08.849> out<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> rack<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.480> pinion

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
pinion switched out the rack and pinion

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.480 
pinion switched out the rack and pinion
the<00:00:11.030> passenger<00:00:12.030> side<00:00:12.240> outer<00:00:12.750> seal<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.410> leaking

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
the passenger side outer seal is leaking

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.599 
the passenger side outer seal is leaking
and<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.619> lot<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.770> trouble<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> rebuild<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
and it's a lot of trouble to rebuild the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.400 
and it's a lot of trouble to rebuild the
rack<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.359> don't<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> tools<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.260> we

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
rack and I don't have the tools so we

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.470 
rack and I don't have the tools so we
just<00:00:19.590> switched<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> rack<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.480> obviously

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
just switched the rack out obviously

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.179 
just switched the rack out obviously
that's<00:00:22.730> what<00:00:23.730> most<00:00:23.939> people<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.420> now<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.410> just

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that's what most people do now so just

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.470 
that's what most people do now so just
going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> show<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.699> quick<00:00:26.880> trick<00:00:27.060> for

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
going to show you a quick trick for

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.049 
going to show you a quick trick for
doing<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.080> quick<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.010> dirty<00:00:29.099> alignment<00:00:30.710> and

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
doing a quick and dirty alignment and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.030 
doing a quick and dirty alignment and
it's<00:00:33.059> fairly<00:00:33.899> old<00:00:34.050> trick<00:00:34.500> from<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> know

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's fairly old trick from what I know

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.880 
it's fairly old trick from what I know
just<00:00:35.880> using<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.300> string

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.510 

so<00:00:43.460> I've<00:00:43.850> got<00:00:44.060> the<00:00:44.180> steering<00:00:44.450> wheel<00:00:44.660> locked

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
so I've got the steering wheel locked

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.000 
so I've got the steering wheel locked
where<00:00:46.520> it's<00:00:46.670> flat<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.150> even<00:00:47.450> and<00:00:48.440> got<00:00:48.860> the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
where it's flat and even and got the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.000 
where it's flat and even and got the
brake<00:00:49.190> pedal<00:00:49.520> depressed<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:54.620> what<00:00:54.830> we're

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
brake pedal depressed so what we're

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.180 
brake pedal depressed so what we're
doing<00:00:55.040> here<00:00:59.020> putting<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.080> string<00:01:00.500> all<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.860> way

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
doing here putting a string all the way

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.719 
doing here putting a string all the way
down<00:01:02.080> the<00:01:03.080> line<00:01:03.260> here<00:01:03.800> without<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.400> length<00:01:04.610> of

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
down the line here without the length of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.960 
down the line here without the length of
the<00:01:04.820> vehicle

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
the vehicle

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.390 
the vehicle
I'm<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.210> using<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.600> chalk<00:01:08.810> line<00:01:09.400> because

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
I'm just using a chalk line because

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.920 
I'm just using a chalk line because
that's<00:01:10.580> all<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:10.760> have<00:01:11.060> right<00:01:11.090> now<00:01:11.330> but<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:11.750> want

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
that's all I have right now but you want

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.480 
that's all I have right now but you want
to<00:01:11.960> use<00:01:12.020> kind<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.530> thin<00:01:12.770> line<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:13.370> can

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
to use kind of a thin line that you can

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.969 
to use kind of a thin line that you can
stretch<00:01:13.760> pretty<00:01:14.120> tight<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.530> also<00:01:15.710> need

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
stretch pretty tight and you also need

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.520 
stretch pretty tight and you also need
to<00:01:16.009> be<00:01:16.130> able<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.400> see<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.840> what<00:01:17.990> we<00:01:18.050> do<00:01:18.259> is<00:01:18.440> we

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
to be able to see it so what we do is we

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.670 
to be able to see it so what we do is we
get<00:01:18.680> this<00:01:18.800> string<00:01:19.990> exactly<00:01:20.990> even<00:01:21.380> with<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
get this string exactly even with the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.950 
get this string exactly even with the
plane<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.190> rear<00:01:22.670> wheel<00:01:23.030> because<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.780> rear

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
plane of the rear wheel because the rear

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.840 
plane of the rear wheel because the rear
wheel<00:01:24.110> is<00:01:24.410> fixed<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.040> not<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.280> four<00:01:25.670> wheel

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
wheel is fixed it's not a four wheel

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.600 
wheel is fixed it's not a four wheel
alignment<00:01:26.390> so<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.470> just<00:01:27.710> setting<00:01:27.890> toe<00:01:28.280> on

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
alignment so this is just setting toe on

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.859 
alignment so this is just setting toe on
the<00:01:28.640> front<00:01:28.940> wheel<00:01:29.119> drive<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.399> what<00:01:31.399> we<00:01:31.520> do<00:01:31.670> is

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.060 

get<00:01:35.869> these<00:01:36.050> measurements<00:01:36.440> exactly<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.190> same

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
get these measurements exactly the same

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.680 
get these measurements exactly the same
so<00:01:40.070> we're<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:40.430> four<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:40.880> half<00:01:40.910> or<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.570> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
so we're at four and a half or on the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.620 
so we're at four and a half or on the
generous<00:01:42.050> side<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.500> four<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.830> half<00:01:43.509> come<00:01:44.509> to

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
generous side of four and a half come to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.830 
generous side of four and a half come to
other<00:01:44.810> side<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.350> rear<00:01:45.530> wheel<00:01:49.840> measure

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
other side of the rear wheel measure

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.380 
other side of the rear wheel measure
again<00:01:51.700> exactly<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.970> same<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:55.909> now<00:01:55.940> we<00:01:56.150> know

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
again exactly the same so now we know

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.990 
again exactly the same so now we know
this<00:01:56.570> string<00:01:56.870> is<00:01:57.500> parallel<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.729> plane<00:01:58.970> to

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
this string is parallel to the plane to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.940 
this string is parallel to the plane to
the<00:01:59.240> rear<00:01:59.420> wheel<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.229> now<00:02:00.350> we<00:02:00.409> go<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.710> front

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
the rear wheel so now we go to the front

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.289 
the rear wheel so now we go to the front
wheel<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:06.020> measure<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.530> same<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.299> see

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
wheel and we measure the same and see

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:14.280 
wheel and we measure the same and see
where<00:02:08.540> we<00:02:08.690> are<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.709> right<00:02:12.980> exactly

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
where we are so right exactly

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.060 
where we are so right exactly
at<00:02:15.290> 120<00:02:16.190> millimeters<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.830> front

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
at 120 millimeters then on the front

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.970 
at 120 millimeters then on the front
side<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.519> wheel<00:02:22.840> exactly<00:02:23.980> 120

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
side of the wheel exactly 120

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.610 
side of the wheel exactly 120
millimeters<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.810> I've<00:02:26.900> already<00:02:27.080> adjusted

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
millimeters so I've already adjusted

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.190 
millimeters so I've already adjusted
this<00:02:27.769> one<00:02:27.980> as<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.120> saw<00:02:29.299> it's<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.959> alignment

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
this one as you saw it's in alignment

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.750 
this one as you saw it's in alignment
and<00:02:30.530> I've<00:02:30.590> already<00:02:30.709> done<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.040> other<00:02:31.160> side<00:02:31.250> so

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
and I've already done the other side so

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.490 
and I've already done the other side so
it's<00:02:31.940> ready<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.269> tighten<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.840> jam<00:02:33.019> nuts<00:02:33.320> on

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
it's ready to tighten the jam nuts on

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.610 
it's ready to tighten the jam nuts on
the<00:02:33.590> tie<00:02:33.769> rods<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.870> take<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:35.959> for<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> drive<00:02:36.290> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
the tie rods and take it for a drive to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.250 
the tie rods and take it for a drive to
see<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.070> even<00:02:37.310> close<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.970> should<00:02:38.180> be<00:02:38.360> this

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
see if it's even close it should be this

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.420 
see if it's even close it should be this
band<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.650> going<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.799> get<00:02:39.950> tires<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
band is going to get tires in the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.979 
band is going to get tires in the
limelight<00:02:40.700> soon<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:41.299> I<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.540> wanted<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.840> try

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
limelight soon but I just wanted to try

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.970 
limelight soon but I just wanted to try
to<00:02:42.170> see<00:02:42.790> how<00:02:43.790> well<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.060> could<00:02:44.239> do<00:02:44.510> at<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
to see how well I could do at it so to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.530 
to see how well I could do at it so to
make<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> adjustments<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.060> case<00:02:47.269> you're<00:02:47.450> not

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
make the adjustments in case you're not

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.860 
make the adjustments in case you're not
familiar<00:02:48.670> just<00:02:49.670> climb<00:02:49.880> under<00:02:50.180> your<00:02:50.329> string<00:02:50.660> be

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
familiar just climb under your string be

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.690 
familiar just climb under your string be
careful<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.560> move<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.890> don't<00:02:52.160> move<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
careful not to move it don't move the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.800 
careful not to move it don't move the
string<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.270> then<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:53.720> start<00:02:53.959> over

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.660 

just<00:02:58.810> turn<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.019> inner<00:02:59.319> tie<00:02:59.590> rod<00:02:59.640> which<00:03:00.640> is

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
just turn the inner tie rod which is

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.319 
just turn the inner tie rod which is
this<00:03:01.060> part<00:03:01.359> here<00:03:02.579> hey<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:03.640> got<00:03:03.909> to<00:03:04.000> loosen<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
this part here hey you got to loosen the

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.770 
this part here hey you got to loosen the
jam<00:03:04.359> nut<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:06.030> then<00:03:07.030> turn<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.359> inner<00:03:07.480> tie<00:03:07.750> rod

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
jam nut and then turn the inner tie rod

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.030 
jam nut and then turn the inner tie rod
and<00:03:09.239> that's<00:03:10.239> what<00:03:10.480> adjust<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.140> toe<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
and that's what adjust the toe of the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.509 
and that's what adjust the toe of the
wheel<00:03:13.140> another<00:03:14.140> thing<00:03:14.409> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.620> do<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:15.129> get<00:03:15.400> it

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
wheel another thing you can do to get it

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.059 
wheel another thing you can do to get it
reasonably<00:03:15.939> close<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.569> this<00:03:17.409> was<00:03:17.590> on<00:03:17.680> Brian's

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
reasonably close and this was on Brian's

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.910 
reasonably close and this was on Brian's
mobile<00:03:18.459> channel<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.689> it<00:03:20.290> works<00:03:20.500> pretty<00:03:20.769> well

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
mobile channel and it works pretty well

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.500 
mobile channel and it works pretty well
is<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:22.260> eyeball<00:03:23.260> these<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:25.090> can<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.389> it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
is to eyeball these and you can get it

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.039 
is to eyeball these and you can get it
pretty<00:03:25.750> close<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.319> way<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.900> eyeball

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
pretty close that way you just eyeball

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.750 
pretty close that way you just eyeball
the<00:03:29.409> planes<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:29.950> wheels<00:03:30.189> until<00:03:30.519> they

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
the planes of the wheels until they

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.990 
the planes of the wheels until they
eclipsed<00:03:31.120> each<00:03:31.269> other<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.519> string<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.970> a

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
eclipsed each other but the string is a

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.280 
eclipsed each other but the string is a
little<00:03:34.090> more<00:03:34.329> exact<00:03:34.689> but<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:34.959> definitely

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
little more exact but it definitely

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.530 
little more exact but it definitely
takes<00:03:35.470> some<00:03:35.590> more<00:03:35.769> time<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.849> with<00:03:37.150> some<00:03:37.359> body

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
takes some more time and with some body

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.770 
takes some more time and with some body
shapes<00:03:37.959> is<00:03:38.790> pretty<00:03:39.790> hard<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.419> the<00:03:40.540> plane

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
shapes is pretty hard to see the plane

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.259 
shapes is pretty hard to see the plane
of<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.019> wheel<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.799> doesn't<00:03:42.639> always<00:03:42.819> work

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
of the wheel so that doesn't always work

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.069 
of the wheel so that doesn't always work
but<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.989> string<00:03:44.260> usually<00:03:44.709> will<00:03:44.859> work
