real thing would have applied with every

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.179 
real thing would have applied with every
stride<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.080> I'd<00:01:10.200> grab<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> back<00:01:10.650> end<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
stride but I'd grab the back end this is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.070 
stride but I'd grab the back end this is
a<00:01:11.490> heavy<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.270> say<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> least

that's<00:01:31.640> attached<00:01:32.140> now<00:01:33.140> let's<00:01:33.439> see<00:01:33.649> what<00:01:33.830> kind

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
that's attached now let's see what kind

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.609 
that's attached now let's see what kind
of<00:01:34.100> impact<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.909> dinosaur<00:01:35.659> like<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.200> would

of impact a dinosaur like this would

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.100 
of impact a dinosaur like this would
have<00:01:36.740> had<00:01:36.920> on<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:39.310> need<00:01:40.600> something<00:01:41.600> else<00:01:41.720> made

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
have had on I need something else made

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.010 
have had on I need something else made
of<00:01:42.289> steel<00:01:42.619> my<00:01:43.570> carcharodontosaurus<00:01:44.570> foot<00:01:44.810> to

tread on a scrap car obviously they

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.760 
tread on a scrap car obviously they
didn't<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.119> those<00:01:50.270> 95<00:01:50.929> million<00:01:51.259> years<00:01:51.619> ago

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
didn't have those 95 million years ago

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.690 
didn't have those 95 million years ago

in the path of the mighty
carcharodontosaurus<00:02:00.770> right<00:02:01.490> rich<00:02:01.940> can<00:02:02.240> you

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
carcharodontosaurus right rich can you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:13.920 
carcharodontosaurus right rich can you
give<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.659> big<00:02:02.899> seven<00:02:03.319> ton<00:02:03.560> stump

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.309 

and<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:15.120> didn't<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:16.269> stand<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.750> chance<00:02:16.959> and

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
and I didn't really stand the chance and

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.440 
and I didn't really stand the chance and
I<00:02:17.920> think<00:02:18.099> that's<00:02:18.250> probably<00:02:18.549> what<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.239> lot<00:02:19.299> of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
I think that's probably what a lot of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.360 
I think that's probably what a lot of
dinosaurs<00:02:20.079> that<00:02:20.260> hung<00:02:20.409> around<00:02:20.620> North<00:02:20.920> Africa

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
dinosaurs that hung around North Africa

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.300 
dinosaurs that hung around North Africa
95<00:02:21.909> million<00:02:22.150> years<00:02:22.450> ago<00:02:22.569> felt<00:02:22.959> because<00:02:23.560> weight

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
95 million years ago felt because weight

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.089 
95 million years ago felt because weight
is<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.700> massive<00:02:25.659> advantage<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.650> battle<00:02:27.010> for

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
is a massive advantage in the battle for

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.190 
is a massive advantage in the battle for
dominance<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.200> Carcharodontosaurus

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
carried a lot of weight and this one's

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.559 
carried a lot of weight and this one's
angry<00:02:35.069> I'm<00:02:36.069> not<00:02:36.129> sure<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.849> that's<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.239> kind
