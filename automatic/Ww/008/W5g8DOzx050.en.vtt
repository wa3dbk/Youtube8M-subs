00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
this is my oh one Grand Cherokee with a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.180 
this is my oh one Grand Cherokee with a
rough<00:00:05.520> country<00:00:05.930> four<00:00:06.930> inch<00:00:07.109> suspension<00:00:07.830> lip<00:00:08.040> I

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
rough country four inch suspension lip I

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:19.820 
rough country four inch suspension lip I
put<00:00:11.190> everything<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.849> myself<00:00:14.240> I<00:00:18.619> had<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> little

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
put everything on myself I had a little

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.300 
put everything on myself I had a little
bit<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.250> problem<00:00:20.510> taking<00:00:21.510> off<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.310> mostly

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
bit of a problem taking off that mostly

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.359 
bit of a problem taking off that mostly
because<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.519> rust<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> stuff<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.650> that

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
because of rust and stuff and that

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.820 
because of rust and stuff and that
actually<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.910> came<00:00:27.060> off<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.630> its<00:00:28.080> own<00:00:28.199> after

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
actually just came off on its own after

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.030 
actually just came off on its own after
I<00:00:29.099> took<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.369> off<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.500> was<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> lot<00:00:34.680> easier

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I took that off so I was a lot easier

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
I took that off so I was a lot easier
than<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.309> thought<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.640> gonna<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:38.300> got<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
than I thought I was gonna be got the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.229 
than I thought I was gonna be got the
three<00:00:40.469> net<00:00:40.680> Finch<00:00:42.770> suspension<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> back

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
three net Finch suspension in the back

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:53.350 
three net Finch suspension in the back
um<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.430> spacer<00:00:48.350> right<00:00:50.629> there

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
um and a spacer right there

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.060 
um and a spacer right there
that<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> lot<00:00:55.079> harder<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.890> than

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that one was a lot harder to get to than

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.790 
that one was a lot harder to get to than
you'd<00:00:56.250> expect<00:00:56.399> uh<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> whole<00:00:58.440> lot<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you'd expect uh it's not a whole lot of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.049 
you'd expect uh it's not a whole lot of
room<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.280> fit<00:00:59.550> anything<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.270> under<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:02.059> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
room to fit anything up under there to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.690 
room to fit anything up under there to
get<00:01:03.210> those<00:01:03.359> bolts<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:04.489> um<00:01:06.140> just<00:01:07.140> gonna<00:01:07.700> give

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
get those bolts off um just gonna give

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.679 
get those bolts off um just gonna give
you<00:01:08.820> time<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:10.229> use<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> lot<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:14.150> multi-purpose

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.020 

lubrication<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.320> off<00:01:19.619> they<00:01:20.430> seem

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
lubrication to get those off they seem

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.289 
lubrication to get those off they seem
to<00:01:21.210> lock<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> weird<00:01:22.860> angle<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to lock up at a weird angle so I put a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.410 
to lock up at a weird angle so I put a
jack<00:01:24.680> up<00:01:25.680> under<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> differential<00:01:30.210> right

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
jack up under the differential right

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.920 
jack up under the differential right
there

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
there

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.520 
there
and<00:01:31.369> um<00:01:32.369> lifted<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> slight<00:01:34.500> angle

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and um lifted it up at a slight angle

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.300 
and um lifted it up at a slight angle
and<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:36.540> seemed<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> help<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.200> lot<00:01:37.439> um<00:01:38.420> get<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
and that seemed to help a lot um get the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.109 
and that seemed to help a lot um get the
fullness<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.880> point<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.890> shocks<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
fullness to point to shocks and the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.430 
fullness to point to shocks and the
coils<00:01:45.680> let<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.070> spacers<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:47.970> there

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.660 

um<00:01:53.440> one<00:01:53.830> thing<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.280> noticed<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:55.000> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
um one thing that I noticed is that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.410 
um one thing that I noticed is that
exhaust<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:58.210> mine<00:01:58.540> at<00:01:58.720> least<00:02:00.090> seems<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.300> be

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
exhaust on mine at least seems to be

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.580 
exhaust on mine at least seems to be
hitting<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:03.130> right<00:02:03.490> here<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.140> when<00:02:05.440> you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
hitting this right here and when you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.010 
hitting this right here and when you
drive<00:02:06.450> makes<00:02:07.450> an<00:02:07.660> awful<00:02:07.990> noise<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.940> I'm<00:02:10.780> gonna

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
drive makes an awful noise but I'm gonna

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.760 
drive makes an awful noise but I'm gonna
be<00:02:11.140> doing<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.680> exhaust<00:02:12.070> soon<00:02:13.020> um<00:02:16.200> here's<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
be doing the exhaust soon um here's the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.160 
be doing the exhaust soon um here's the
other<00:02:17.980> side<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.270> front<00:02:21.780> shocks

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
other side of the front shocks

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.699 
other side of the front shocks
um<00:02:24.010> lower<00:02:24.459> control<00:02:24.820> arms<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:26.290> was<00:02:26.440> another

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
um lower control arms that was another

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.140 
um lower control arms that was another
problem<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.340> seem<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.700> have<00:02:27.880> isn't<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
problem that I seem to have isn't it the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.730 
problem that I seem to have isn't it the
front<00:02:31.260> axle<00:02:32.260> needed<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.770> come<00:02:33.010> forward<00:02:34.740> um

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
front axle needed to come forward um

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.260 
front axle needed to come forward um
about<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.520> quarter<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.000> an<00:02:37.180> inch<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:38.350> what<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.800> did

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
about a quarter of an inch so what I did

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.390 
about a quarter of an inch so what I did
was<00:02:40.270> put<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:41.820> jack<00:02:42.820> in<00:02:43.150> between<00:02:43.660> here<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
was put a jack in between here and the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.660 
was put a jack in between here and the
front<00:02:45.880> axle<00:02:46.270> up<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:48.160> pushed<00:02:48.489> it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
front axle up here and it pushed it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.860 
front axle up here and it pushed it
forward<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.430> way<00:02:51.550> these<00:02:51.870> bolts

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
forward and so that way these bolts

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.530 
forward and so that way these bolts
could<00:02:53.080> line<00:02:53.320> up<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.640> then<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.209> slide

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
could line up and then you just slide

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.540 
could line up and then you just slide
them<00:02:55.750> right<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.140> um<00:02:59.250> other<00:03:00.250> than<00:03:00.370> that

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
them right in um other than that

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.490 
them right in um other than that
everything<00:03:01.390> was<00:03:01.959> really<00:03:02.410> easy<00:03:02.650> um<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:04.500> bump

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
everything was really easy um a bump

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.890 
everything was really easy um a bump
stop<00:03:06.360> extensions<00:03:07.860> um<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.980> front<00:03:12.480> shocks<00:03:13.480> are

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
stop extensions um the front shocks are

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.240 
stop extensions um the front shocks are
the<00:03:14.049> coil<00:03:14.610> springs<00:03:15.610> we're<00:03:16.540> actually<00:03:17.040> able<00:03:18.040> to

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
the coil springs we're actually able to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.720 
the coil springs we're actually able to
go<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.019> jack<00:03:20.410> up<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.799> car<00:03:20.830> or<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.459> body

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
go in if you jack up the car or the body

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.390 
go in if you jack up the car or the body
of<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.970> car<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.630> lower<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.500> front<00:03:23.739> axle<00:03:24.040> up

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
of the car and lower the front axle up

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.720 
of the car and lower the front axle up
enough<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.090> don't<00:03:25.269> have<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:26.730> spring

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
enough you don't have to have spring

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.070 
enough you don't have to have spring
compressors<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:30.299> but<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.510> definitely<00:03:31.690> gonna

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
compressors and but you definitely gonna

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.150 
compressors and but you definitely gonna
have<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.920> use<00:03:33.910> those<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.600> back<00:03:35.160> but

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
have to use those in the back but

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.040 
have to use those in the back but
overall<00:03:37.560> it's<00:03:38.560> a

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
overall it's a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.150 
overall it's a
the<00:03:41.050> lowest<00:03:41.890> model<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.879> suspension<00:03:43.780> lift<00:03:44.160> it

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
the lowest model of a suspension lift it

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.780 
the lowest model of a suspension lift it
seemed<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.550> do<00:03:45.790> all<00:03:46.650> really<00:03:47.650> well<00:03:47.890> just<00:03:48.640> on

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
seemed to do all really well just on

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:56.430 
seemed to do all really well just on
overall<00:03:49.360> driving<00:03:49.959> quality<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:54.810> I'm<00:03:55.810> pretty

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
overall driving quality and I'm pretty

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.680 
overall driving quality and I'm pretty
happy<00:03:56.560> with<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.099> I<00:03:57.489> got<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:57.880> few<00:03:58.090> things<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.450> want

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
happy with it I got a few things I want

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.699 
happy with it I got a few things I want
to<00:03:58.750> do<00:03:59.370> it<00:04:00.370> doesn't<00:04:00.610> really<00:04:00.700> seem<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.180> sit

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.210 

level<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.840> rear<00:04:08.019> end<00:04:08.260> is<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.470> little<00:04:08.709> higher<00:04:08.890> I

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
level the rear end is a little higher I

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.710 
level the rear end is a little higher I
think<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.840> I'm<00:04:11.080> going<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.290> put<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> 2<00:04:11.769> inch<00:04:12.720> coil

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
think so I'm going to put a 2 inch coil

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.060 
think so I'm going to put a 2 inch coil
spacers<00:04:16.049> kind<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.139> lift<00:04:17.350> up<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.769> front<00:04:17.919> a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
spacers kind of lift up the front a

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.440 
spacers kind of lift up the front a
little<00:04:18.280> more<00:04:18.459> so<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:18.790> can<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.150> little<00:04:19.329> more

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
little more so I can have a little more

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.780 
little more so I can have a little more
clearance<00:04:19.930> between<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:20.530> front<00:04:21.430> bumper<00:04:21.760> and

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
clearance between the front bumper and

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.450 
clearance between the front bumper and
the<00:04:23.190> new<00:04:24.190> tires<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:25.000> rooms<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.930> stuff

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
the new tires and rooms and stuff
