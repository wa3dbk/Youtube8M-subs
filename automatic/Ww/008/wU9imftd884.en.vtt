00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359

think<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.420> heard<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.660> rumor<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.070> he<00:00:32.070> was<00:00:32.189> going

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
think I heard a rumor that he was going

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
think I heard a rumor that he was going
to<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.000> positional<00:00:33.450> hero<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
to be the positional hero for like I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.180 
to be the positional hero for like I
guess<00:00:34.950> right<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.399> white<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.820> 1<00:00:36.030> or<00:00:36.120> 2<00:00:36.270> but

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
guess right as white as here 1 or 2 but

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.360 
guess right as white as here 1 or 2 but
uh

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
uh

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.549 
uh
EA<00:00:38.610> decided<00:00:39.300> not<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
EA decided not to do that because I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.369 
EA decided not to do that because I
guess<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.460> rumor<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:41.940> leaked<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.870> month

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
guess the rumor got leaked like a month

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
guess the rumor got leaked like a month
before<00:00:43.739> his<00:00:43.860> release<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.550> dez<00:00:45.300> bryant's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
before his release or dez bryant's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.060 
before his release or dez bryant's
release<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.079> something<00:00:46.110> maybe<00:00:46.530> even<00:00:46.620> Julio's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
release or something maybe even Julio's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
release or something maybe even Julio's
so<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.789> decided<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.329> go<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.600> Dez

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so they decided to just go with Dez

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.529 
so they decided to just go with Dez
Bryant<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:51.590> yeah<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:52.980> believe<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
Bryant and yeah but I do believe if it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
Bryant and yeah but I do believe if it
wasn't<00:00:54.899> between<00:00:55.170> Julio<00:00:55.620> Dez<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.250> Demaryius

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
wasn't between Julio Dez that Demaryius

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
wasn't between Julio Dez that Demaryius
Thomas<00:00:56.940> definitely<00:00:57.510> deserved<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.050> that's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
Thomas definitely deserved it so that's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
Thomas definitely deserved it so that's
why<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> had<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.710> added<00:00:58.980> him<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> team<00:00:59.489> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
why I had it I added him to the team and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.729

couldn't there's obviously no other
positional<00:01:53.490> heroes<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.909> them<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.560> I'm

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
positional heroes for them and I'm

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.530 
positional heroes for them and I'm
pretty<00:01:55.829> much<00:01:55.950> made<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.280> Seahawks<00:01:56.670> team<00:01:56.909> like

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
pretty much made it a Seahawks team like

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.069 
pretty much made it a Seahawks team like
in<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> secondary<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:59.130> Thomas<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.640> Cam

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
in the secondary with Thomas and Cam

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.300 
in the secondary with Thomas and Cam
because<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.469> give<00:02:01.710> boosts<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.250> do

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
because they do give boosts and I do

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
because they do give boosts and I do
like<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.210> I'm<00:02:03.600> actually<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
like that so they I'm actually not a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.170 
like that so they I'm actually not a
one-on-one<00:02:04.560> overall<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.610> team<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.909> take<00:02:06.149> a

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240

pretty<00:03:05.830> salt<00:03:06.070> stat<00:03:06.370> 67<00:03:06.910> tackle<00:03:07.120> isn't<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
pretty salt stat 67 tackle isn't the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.210 
pretty salt stat 67 tackle isn't the
worst<00:03:07.600> but<00:03:07.840> Vontae<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.440> dominates<00:03:08.890> him<00:03:09.040> I

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
worst but Vontae just dominates him I

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.340 
worst but Vontae just dominates him I
think<00:03:09.370> he's<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.610> best<00:03:10.110> cornerback<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.290> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350
