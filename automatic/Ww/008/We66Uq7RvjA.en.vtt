00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
lot of people that ask what are these

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
lot of people that ask what are these

machines are shuffling the cards and and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
machines are shuffling the cards and and
it<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:29.820> depends<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.689> machine<00:00:31.230> it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it really depends what machine it

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.940 
it really depends what machine it
there's<00:00:32.130> different<00:00:32.550> kinds<00:00:33.059> some<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:33.570> are

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
there's different kinds some of them are

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
there's different kinds some of them are
completely<00:00:34.950> they<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.180> can't<00:00:36.450> count<00:00:36.899> cards<00:00:37.140> at

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
completely they you can't count cards at

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.049 
completely they you can't count cards at
that<00:00:37.739> game<00:00:37.980> other<00:00:38.250> ones<00:00:38.550> they're<00:00:38.790> totally

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
that game other ones they're totally

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.119 
that game other ones they're totally
fine<00:00:39.180> they<00:00:39.300> actually<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> game<00:00:40.770> faster

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
fine they actually make the game faster

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.650 
fine they actually make the game faster
which<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> better<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:42.450> two

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
which is better for you so there's two

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
which is better for you so there's two
kinds<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.989> machines<00:00:43.110> we're<00:00:43.350> gonna<00:00:43.469> talk<00:00:43.590> about

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
kinds of machines we're gonna talk about

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
kinds of machines we're gonna talk about
one<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.309> regular<00:00:44.520> shuffle<00:00:45.090> machine

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
one is just a regular shuffle machine

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.240 
one is just a regular shuffle machine
and<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:46.050> don't<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:46.590> machines<00:00:46.950> here

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and we don't have these machines here

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.860 
and we don't have these machines here
because<00:00:47.520> we're<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> hotel<00:00:48.210> room<00:00:48.360> but

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
because we're just in a hotel room but

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600 
because we're just in a hotel room but
one<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.440> these<00:00:49.620> machines<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.309> does<00:00:50.460> like

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
one of these machines it just does like

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
one of these machines it just does like
this<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.809> shuffles<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> cards

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this and just shuffles the cards

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.260 
this and just shuffles the cards
together<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:53.039> time<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> human

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
together one time just like a human

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
together one time just like a human
would<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> cards<00:00:56.129> over

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
would do and then you put the cards over

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.200 
would do and then you put the cards over
here<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.020> cards<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.980> dealt<00:00:59.309> over

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
here and then the cards get dealt over

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.500 
here and then the cards get dealt over
here<00:01:00.570> into<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.829> discard<00:01:02.160> tray<00:01:02.460> okay<00:01:02.910> one<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
here into the discard tray okay one at a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.350 
here into the discard tray okay one at a
time<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.799> pretty<00:01:05.129> soon<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.240> would

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
time and then pretty soon what you would

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.469 
time and then pretty soon what you would
see<00:01:06.600> over<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> discard<00:01:07.710> tray<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.479> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
see over here in the discard tray is you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
see over here in the discard tray is you
would<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> bunch<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.229> cards<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.740> have

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
would see a bunch of cards that have

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.410 
would see a bunch of cards that have
been<00:01:10.860> dealt<00:01:10.950> okay<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.580> they'll<00:01:11.700> occurred

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
been dealt okay and they'll occurred

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
been dealt okay and they'll occurred
like<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.689> guy<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.350> way<00:01:13.500> card<00:01:13.799> counting

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
like this guy and the way card counting

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.490 
like this guy and the way card counting
works<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.270> keep<00:01:15.509> track<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.020> these<00:01:16.110> cards

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
works is you keep track of these cards

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
works is you keep track of these cards
here<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.880> predict<00:01:18.270> what's<00:01:18.600> next

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
here so that you can predict what's next

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
here so that you can predict what's next
okay<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.500> important<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> keep<00:01:20.820> track

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
okay that's important so you keep track

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
okay that's important so you keep track
of<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.450> past<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.560> break<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
of the past so that you can break the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
of the past so that you can break the
future<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.030> learn<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.360> count

how<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.380> tell<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:48.360> very

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
how you can tell this is very very

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.179 
how you can tell this is very very
simply<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.229> cabe<00:01:49.470> sometimes<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.070> can

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
simply like this cabe sometimes you can

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.370 
simply like this cabe sometimes you can
look<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> machine<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> ask<00:01:51.630> what

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
look at the machine or you can ask what

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.719 
look at the machine or you can ask what
you're<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.189> something<00:01:53.460> like

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you're going to see is something like

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
you're going to see is something like
this<00:01:53.909> okay<00:01:54.299> there's<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.259> some<00:01:55.470> cards

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this okay there's going to be some cards

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
this okay there's going to be some cards
over<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.880> usually<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> cards<00:01:57.659> never

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
over here but usually the cards never

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.010 
over here but usually the cards never
get<00:01:58.409> more<00:01:58.680> than<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.280> many<00:01:59.520> never<00:02:00.020> usually

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
get more than this many never usually

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.560 
get more than this many never usually
it'll<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.409> closer<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.340> they'll<00:02:03.210> take

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it'll be closer to this and they'll take

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
it'll be closer to this and they'll take
these<00:02:03.869> back<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.560> they'll<00:02:05.310> stick<00:02:05.520> him<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
these back and they'll stick him in the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.490 
these back and they'll stick him in the
machine<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.390> these<00:02:06.719> cards<00:02:07.200> will<00:02:07.380> get

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
machine and these cards will get

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.830 
machine and these cards will get
shuffled<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:08.069> into<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.720> usually

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
shuffled back into I think it's usually

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.990 
shuffled back into I think it's usually
three<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:10.259> four<00:02:10.560> decks<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.250> usually<00:02:11.550> six

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
three or four decks it's not usually six

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.550 
three or four decks it's not usually six
or<00:02:12.209> five<00:02:12.540> whatever<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.140> doesn't<00:02:13.290> matter

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
or five whatever it doesn't matter

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.449 
or five whatever it doesn't matter
because<00:02:13.739> you're<00:02:13.860> never<00:02:14.010> going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.370> them

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
because you're never going to see them

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.880 
because you're never going to see them
so<00:02:15.000> these<00:02:15.180> cards<00:02:15.450> will<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.569> back<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:16.530> what

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
so these cards will go back in now what

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.920 
so these cards will go back in now what
that<00:02:17.160> does<00:02:17.550> for<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.150> card<00:02:18.450> counter<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:18.870> you

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that does for a card counter if you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.300 
that does for a card counter if you
think<00:02:19.170> about<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:20.540> normally<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.099> only
