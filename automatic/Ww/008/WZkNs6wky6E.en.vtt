00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
already I've got the blue one down down

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.680 
already I've got the blue one down down
there<00:00:14.429> I'm<00:00:14.519> trying<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.910> very<00:00:15.150> careful

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
there I'm trying to be very careful

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.810 
there I'm trying to be very careful
because<00:00:15.719> I've<00:00:16.109> never<00:00:16.139> opened<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.640> laptop

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
because I've never opened the laptop

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.570 
because I've never opened the laptop

screen<00:00:23.330> all<00:00:24.330> right<00:00:24.800> now<00:00:25.800> inside<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.640> basil

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
screen all right now inside this basil

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.439 
screen all right now inside this basil
there's<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.510> wire<00:00:27.960> running<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.939> this<00:00:29.939> side<00:00:30.240> over

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
there's a wire running on this side over

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.240 
there's a wire running on this side over
here<00:00:31.219> to<00:00:32.219> all<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.700> LEDs<00:00:32.940> oh<00:00:33.770> no<00:00:34.770> no<00:00:34.950> no<00:00:35.040> it's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
here to all the LEDs oh no no no it's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
here to all the LEDs oh no no no it's
running<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> microphone<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.840> far

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
running to the microphone on the far

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990 
running to the microphone on the far
side<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:38.370> don't<00:00:38.520> want<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> mess<00:00:38.969> with

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
side I really don't want to mess with

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.090 
side I really don't want to mess with
that<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:40.140> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:42.500> I'm<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.950> going

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that so I'm just going to I'm just going

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
that so I'm just going to I'm just going
to<00:00:44.129> let<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.550> down<00:00:44.850> nice<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.329> easy<00:00:47.930> really

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
to let this down nice and easy really

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.360 
to let this down nice and easy really
doesn't<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.289> why<00:00:49.469> down<00:00:49.710> without<00:00:49.860> stretching

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
doesn't know why down without stretching

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
doesn't know why down without stretching
anything<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:53.239> but<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> wire<00:00:54.629> does<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
anything so but the wire does have a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770 
anything so but the wire does have a
little<00:00:55.590> give<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.090> used<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
little give on it because it's used to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.579 
little give on it because it's used to
being<00:00:59.570> pulled<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.109> rotate<00:01:02.989> I'd<00:01:03.989> really

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
being pulled on as you rotate I'd really

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.120 
being pulled on as you rotate I'd really
rather<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:04.920> pull<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.470> don't<00:01:07.799> see

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
rather not pull it out but I don't see

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.990 
rather not pull it out but I don't see
much<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.479> option<00:01:10.369> well<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> meantime

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
much of an option well for the meantime

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280 
much of an option well for the meantime
we'll<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.360> kind<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.600> hold<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> hope<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
we'll just kind of hold it and hope that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.130 
we'll just kind of hold it and hope that
my<00:01:13.530> hands<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.960> way<00:01:16.080> two

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
my hands not that it's not in a way two

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.440 
my hands not that it's not in a way two
much<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:20.369> what<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.210> screen<00:01:21.570> looks<00:01:21.600> like

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
much here is what the screen looks like

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.420 
much here is what the screen looks like
as<00:01:24.450> you'll<00:01:24.720> notice<00:01:24.990> single<00:01:25.770> hinge<00:01:25.920> down<00:01:26.159> there

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
as you'll notice single hinge down there

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
as you'll notice single hinge down there
and<00:01:27.080> this<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.470> backlight

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and this this here is the backlight

bad because the because the symptoms
would<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:30.000> lot<00:02:30.300> more<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.900> lot<00:02:30.959> less<00:02:31.650> when<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
would be a lot more a lot less when I

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.640 
would be a lot more a lot less when I
rotate<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.300> computer<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> lot<00:02:34.110> more<00:02:34.319> all

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
rotate the computer and a lot more all

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.670 
rotate the computer and a lot more all
the<00:02:34.950> time<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.580> if<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.569> turns<00:02:39.840> out<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.319> be<00:02:40.349> this

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the time so if it turns out to be this

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.890 
the time so if it turns out to be this
and<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.430> its<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:41.970> out<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.540> my

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and it's just on its way out and my

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.650 
and it's just on its way out and my
turning<00:02:43.379> it's<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:43.739> aggravating<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:45.300> I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
turning it's just aggravating it then I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.949 
turning it's just aggravating it then I
can<00:02:45.930> buy<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> new<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.970> 30<00:02:47.970> 40<00:02:48.300> bucks<00:02:48.599> and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
going to get a bit more in depth with

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.270 
going to get a bit more in depth with
this<00:03:01.050> thing<00:03:01.379> or<00:03:02.870> whatever<00:03:04.220> um<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:07.159> really<00:03:08.159> don't

want to take the whole thing off as you

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.449 
want to take the whole thing off as you
can<00:03:09.989> see<00:03:10.110> there's<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:10.440> black<00:03:10.739> stuff<00:03:11.129> right

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
can see there's this black stuff right

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.430 
can see there's this black stuff right
here<00:03:12.650> maybe<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.830> can't<00:03:14.480> let<00:03:15.480> me<00:03:15.599> zoom<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.200> on

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
here maybe you can't let me zoom in on

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.030 
here maybe you can't let me zoom in on
that<00:03:16.500> oh<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:21.150> course<00:03:21.209> I'm<00:03:21.750> recording<00:03:22.290> how<00:03:22.800> can

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
that oh of course I'm recording how can

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.089 
that oh of course I'm recording how can
i<00:03:23.129> zoom<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:25.049> here<00:03:25.319> along<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.739> edges<00:03:25.920> of

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
i zoom it like here along the edges of

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.789 
i zoom it like here along the edges of
the<00:03:26.220> screen<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.819> is<00:03:26.879> this<00:03:27.540> black<00:03:27.930> stuff<00:03:28.409> it's

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
the screen this is this black stuff it's

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.869 
the screen this is this black stuff it's
it's<00:03:29.459> still<00:03:29.760> tacky<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:32.280> goes<00:03:32.459> all<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.670> way

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
it's still tacky and it goes all the way

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.690 
it's still tacky and it goes all the way
around<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.360> imagine<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.260> its<00:03:34.409> purpose<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.890> to

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
around I imagine that its purpose is to

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.210 
around I imagine that its purpose is to
provide<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.120> good<00:03:36.360> seal<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:38.190> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
provide a good seal with the with the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.309 
provide a good seal with the with the
basil<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.480> I've<00:03:39.629> already<00:03:39.840> taken<00:03:40.170> off<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.790> to

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
basil that I've already taken off and to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.170 
basil that I've already taken off and to
help<00:03:43.319> for<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.620> dirt<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.220> dust<00:03:44.489> getting<00:03:44.940> back

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
help for that dirt and dust getting back

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.960 
help for that dirt and dust getting back
in<00:03:45.480> here<00:03:45.870> into<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.230> components<00:03:46.830> now<00:03:47.580> if<00:03:47.790> we

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
in here into the components now if we

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.330 
in here into the components now if we
wanted<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.390> see<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.690> LED<00:03:48.989> screen<00:03:49.530> itself<00:03:50.040> I'd

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
wanted to see the LED screen itself I'd

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.420 
wanted to see the LED screen itself I'd
have<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.150> pry<00:03:51.510> off<00:03:51.780> fly<00:03:52.500> off<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:52.799> screen<00:03:53.129> but

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
have to pry off fly off this screen but

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.850 
have to pry off fly off this screen but
I<00:03:54.830> really<00:03:55.830> don't<00:03:56.010> want<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:57.439> I'm<00:03:58.439> not<00:03:58.650> going

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
I really don't want to and I'm not going

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.320 
I really don't want to and I'm not going
to<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.939> my<00:04:00.360> suspicion<00:04:00.659> is<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:02.069> these<00:04:02.790> cords

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
to so my suspicion is that these cords

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.660 
to so my suspicion is that these cords
here<00:04:03.780> here<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.650> here<00:04:04.970> they<00:04:05.970> run<00:04:06.209> down<00:04:06.560> through

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
here here and here they run down through

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.479 
here here and here they run down through
this<00:04:08.670> through<00:04:09.629> this<00:04:09.720> hinge<00:04:10.080> all<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:11.099> these<00:04:11.280> do

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
this through this hinge all of these do

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.399 
this through this hinge all of these do
but<00:04:12.299> I've<00:04:12.360> got<00:04:12.510> no<00:04:12.689> problem<00:04:12.720> with<00:04:13.200> these

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
but I've got no problem with these

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.879 
but I've got no problem with these
buttons<00:04:14.310> or<00:04:14.640> LEDs<00:04:15.209> they<00:04:15.540> were<00:04:15.599> just<00:04:15.900> fine<00:04:16.199> so

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
buttons or LEDs they were just fine so

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.099 
buttons or LEDs they were just fine so
it's<00:04:17.160> definitely<00:04:17.609> not

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
it's definitely not

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.039 
it's definitely not
with<00:04:18.349> this<00:04:18.939> these<00:04:19.939> two<00:04:20.329> are<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.539> ones<00:04:20.629> that<00:04:20.840> go

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
with this these two are the ones that go

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.409 
with this these two are the ones that go
to<00:04:21.109> inverter<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:22.159> is<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.729> video<00:04:24.400> if<00:04:25.419> you

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
to inverter and this is the video if you

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.240 
to inverter and this is the video if you
look<00:04:26.629> closely<00:04:27.139> which<00:04:27.620> I'll<00:04:27.830> bring<00:04:28.069> you<00:04:28.219> a

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
look closely which I'll bring you a

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.619 
look closely which I'll bring you a
little<00:04:28.430> closer<00:04:30.009> if<00:04:31.009> you<00:04:31.069> look<00:04:31.430> closely<00:04:31.759> at

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
little closer if you look closely at

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.899 
little closer if you look closely at
this<00:04:32.870> right<00:04:33.409> let's<00:04:33.710> give<00:04:33.979> it<00:04:34.009> time<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.729> focus

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
this right let's give it time to focus

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:39.040 
this right let's give it time to focus
come<00:04:35.419> on<00:04:35.569> come<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:37.419> okay<00:04:38.419> it<00:04:38.599> really<00:04:38.780> just

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
come on come on okay it really just

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.860 
come on come on okay it really just
doesn't<00:04:39.349> want<00:04:39.469> to<00:04:39.560> focus<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:40.039> close<00:04:43.870> okay

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
doesn't want to focus that close okay

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.100 
doesn't want to focus that close okay
this<00:04:45.770> piece<00:04:46.039> right<00:04:46.159> here<00:04:46.750> it's<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.870> little

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
this piece right here it's a little

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.490 
this piece right here it's a little
crooked<00:04:48.379> unit<00:04:49.340> sitting<00:04:49.819> in<00:04:50.330> its<00:04:50.509> setting<00:04:50.930> now

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
crooked unit sitting in its setting now

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.909 
crooked unit sitting in its setting now
I'm<00:04:51.620> going<00:04:51.889> to<00:04:52.159> uh<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:53.300> reset<00:04:53.779> it<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.529> know<00:04:54.650> and

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
I'm going to uh to reset it you know and

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.010 
I'm going to uh to reset it you know and
then<00:04:55.699> I'm<00:04:55.939> going<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.180> do<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.449> same<00:04:56.599> with<00:04:56.779> these

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
then I'm going to do the same with these

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.939 
then I'm going to do the same with these
I<00:04:57.319> suspect<00:04:58.189> that<00:04:58.279> these<00:04:58.639> here<00:04:59.569> and<00:05:01.509> here<00:05:02.949> also

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
I suspect that these here and here also

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.719 
I suspect that these here and here also
set<00:05:04.669> a<00:05:04.849> little<00:05:05.590> little<00:05:06.590> off<00:05:06.889> so<00:05:07.310> i'll<00:05:07.460> try

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
set a little little off so i'll try

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.570 
set a little little off so i'll try
resetting<00:05:08.210> them<00:05:08.509> and<00:05:08.719> then<00:05:09.379> we'll<00:05:10.219> see<00:05:10.430> how

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
resetting them and then we'll see how

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.819 
resetting them and then we'll see how
that<00:05:10.639> goes
