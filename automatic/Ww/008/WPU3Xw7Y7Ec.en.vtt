00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
worth it I'll say so I'm here we are

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.420 
worth it I'll say so I'm here we are
loading<00:05:49.199> up<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.469> windows<00:05:49.770> side<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.159> take<00:05:50.400> a

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
loading up the windows side to take a

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.370 
loading up the windows side to take a
little<00:05:50.759> bit<00:05:50.969> because<00:05:51.569> I'm<00:05:51.840> this<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.169> first

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
little bit because I'm this the first

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.939 
little bit because I'm this the first
time<00:05:52.529> I'm<00:05:52.650> actually<00:05:52.770> turning<00:05:53.370> that<00:05:53.610> side<00:05:53.849> on

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
time I'm actually turning that side on

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.559 
time I'm actually turning that side on
so<00:05:55.949> it's<00:05:56.129> gonna<00:05:56.250> catch<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.699> little<00:05:57.000> bit<00:05:57.120> for<00:05:57.449> it

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:57.569 
so it's gonna catch a little bit for it

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.320 
so it's gonna catch a little bit for it
so<00:05:57.979> this<00:05:58.979> is<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.159> longest<00:05:59.490> it'll<00:05:59.759> take<00:05:59.940> ever

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
so this is the longest it'll take ever

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.659 
so this is the longest it'll take ever
because<00:06:00.960> as<00:06:01.289> you<00:06:01.620> know<00:06:01.830> so<00:06:02.129> here<00:06:02.340> it<00:06:02.460> goes

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
because as you know so here it goes

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.059 
because as you know so here it goes
