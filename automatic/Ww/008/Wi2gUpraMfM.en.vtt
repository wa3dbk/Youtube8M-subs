turned 13 years old the next one is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.679 
turned 13 years old the next one is
actually<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.280> debatable<00:02:05.909> question<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
actually a really debatable question and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.419 
actually a really debatable question and
it<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.020> why<00:02:07.380> didn't<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.979> buy

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it is why didn't you just buy

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.789 
it is why didn't you just buy
all<00:02:08.579> with<00:02:08.789> no<00:02:09.030> hair<00:02:09.329> from<00:02:09.539> American<00:02:10.079> girl<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
all with no hair from American girl the

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.619 
all with no hair from American girl the
reason<00:02:11.159> that<00:02:11.189> my<00:02:11.400> parents<00:02:11.609> didn't<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.390> is

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
reason that my parents didn't do that is

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.780 
reason that my parents didn't do that is
because<00:02:12.840> getting<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.439> off<00:02:13.620> ebay<00:02:14.159> was<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> lot

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
because getting it off ebay was a lot

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
because getting it off ebay was a lot
less<00:02:15.090> expensive<00:02:15.120> than<00:02:15.750> getting<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.349> off<00:02:16.469> of

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
less expensive than getting it off of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.099 
less expensive than getting it off of
American<00:02:17.159> girl<00:02:17.400> because<00:02:17.909> most<00:02:18.540> dolls<00:02:18.840> from

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
American girl because most dolls from

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.899 
American girl because most dolls from
American<00:02:19.680> girl<00:02:19.890> without<00:02:20.040> any<00:02:20.489> accessories

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
American girl without any accessories

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.800 
American girl without any accessories
are<00:02:21.530> 115<00:02:22.530> dollars<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.219> let's<00:02:24.209> say<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.719> we

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
are 115 dollars and let's say that we

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.629 
are 115 dollars and let's say that we
got<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.109> doll<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.349> seventy<00:02:25.950> dollars<00:02:26.340> we

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:26.639 
got the doll for seventy dollars we

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.369 
got the doll for seventy dollars we
would<00:02:26.819> be<00:02:26.969> saving<00:02:27.420> almost<00:02:27.629> forty<00:02:28.230> five

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
would be saving almost forty five

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.530 
would be saving almost forty five
dollars<00:02:28.889> by<00:02:29.129> getting<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.609> from<00:02:29.760> ebay<00:02:30.000> instead

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
dollars by getting it from ebay instead

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.229 
dollars by getting it from ebay instead
so<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.620> think<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.549> lot<00:02:32.730> better<00:02:32.909> to

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
so I think that it's a lot better to

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.910 
so I think that it's a lot better to
just<00:02:33.420> get<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.719> from<00:02:33.840> ebay<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.469> I<00:02:34.620> also

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just get it from ebay because I also

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.410 
just get it from ebay because I also
think<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.579> kind<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:35.879> fun<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.120> try<00:02:36.359> to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
think that it's kind of fun to try to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.690 
think that it's kind of fun to try to
fix<00:02:36.689> it<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.530> next<00:02:37.799> question<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.250> why

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
fix it up the next question is why

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.339 
fix it up the next question is why
didn't<00:02:38.969> you<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.239> cut<00:02:39.480> their<00:02:39.659> hair<00:02:39.900> instead

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
didn't you just cut their hair instead

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.409 
didn't you just cut their hair instead
of<00:02:40.530> using<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:41.010> wig<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.579> reason<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.150> bought

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:42.419 
of using a wig the reason that I bought

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.360 
of using a wig the reason that I bought
a<00:02:42.480> wig<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:43.049> because<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.859> guys<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.280> ever

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
a wig is because if you guys have ever

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.339 
a wig is because if you guys have ever
looked<00:02:44.639> it<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:44.939> your<00:02:45.180> doll's<00:02:45.389> hair<00:02:45.689> you'll<00:02:46.079> see

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
looked it up your doll's hair you'll see

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.470 
looked it up your doll's hair you'll see
that<00:02:46.500> their<00:02:46.709> hair<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.159> actually<00:02:47.310> sewn<00:02:47.849> in<00:02:48.150> in

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that their hair is actually sewn in in

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.289 
that their hair is actually sewn in in
layers<00:02:48.810> onto<00:02:49.169> the<00:02:49.439> wig<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.489> tried<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:51.060> cut

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
layers onto the wig so I tried to cut

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.420 
layers onto the wig so I tried to cut
that<00:02:51.450> up<00:02:51.689> that<00:02:51.989> would<00:02:52.139> look<00:02:52.260> really<00:02:52.319> messy<00:02:52.829> and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that up that would look really messy and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.339 
that up that would look really messy and
then<00:02:53.639> even<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:54.269> you'd<00:02:54.419> be<00:02:54.569> able<00:02:54.719> to<00:02:54.900> see<00:02:55.169> the

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
then even and you'd be able to see the

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.770 
then even and you'd be able to see the
layer<00:02:55.560> lines<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.310> each<00:02:56.519> layer<00:02:56.909> that<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.480> cut

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
layer lines with each layer that you cut

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.920 
layer lines with each layer that you cut
up<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.349> so<00:02:59.159> I<00:02:59.519> think<00:02:59.639> it's<00:02:59.969> just<00:03:00.239> easier<00:03:00.659> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
up to so I think it's just easier and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.500 
up to so I think it's just easier and
nicer<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.620> buy<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.799> wig<00:03:02.099> because<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.819> don't<00:03:03.209> think

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
nicer to buy a wig because I don't think

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.539 
nicer to buy a wig because I don't think
cutting<00:03:03.930> would<00:03:04.200> do<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.379> very<00:03:04.680> nice<00:03:04.950> job<00:03:05.010> at<00:03:05.430> all

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
cutting would do a very nice job at all

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.059 
cutting would do a very nice job at all
so<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.359> next<00:03:06.389> question<00:03:06.719> is<00:03:07.260> why<00:03:07.530> did<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.859> call

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
so the next question is why did you call

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.459 
so the next question is why did you call
your<00:03:08.219> doll<00:03:08.430> number<00:03:08.790> 49<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.629> lot<00:03:10.079> of<00:03:10.230> people

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
your doll number 49 a lot of people

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.199 
your doll number 49 a lot of people
believe<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:11.250> doll<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.849> originally

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
believe that the doll that I originally

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.050 
believe that the doll that I originally
got<00:03:12.540> from<00:03:12.930> ebay<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.799> number<00:03:14.129> 49<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.879> I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
got from ebay is not number 49 like I

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
going to deny that I talk a lot but the

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.330 
going to deny that I talk a lot but the
video<00:03:54.750> would<00:03:55.109> have<00:03:55.199> been<00:03:55.409> a<00:03:55.439> lot<00:03:55.919> shorter

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
video would have been a lot shorter

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.300 
video would have been a lot shorter
itself<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.389> I<00:03:57.569> didn't<00:03:57.930> put<00:03:58.199> that<00:03:58.229> big<00:03:58.799> part<00:03:59.159> in

itself if I didn't put that big part in
the<00:03:59.549> beginning<00:03:59.729> of<00:04:00.209> me<00:04:00.449> talking<00:04:00.780> about<00:04:01.139> the

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
the beginning of me talking about the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.280 
the beginning of me talking about the
flaws<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.189> doll<00:04:02.400> but<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.209> decided<00:04:03.659> to<00:04:03.900> put

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
flaws of the doll but I decided to put

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.099 
flaws of the doll but I decided to put
that<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.650> any<00:04:04.919> way<00:04:05.099> because<00:04:05.909> I<00:04:06.120> wasn't<00:04:06.509> sure<00:04:06.659> if

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
that in any way because I wasn't sure if

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.710 
that in any way because I wasn't sure if
you<00:04:07.229> guys<00:04:07.259> wanted<00:04:08.159> to<00:04:08.790> see<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.209> or<00:04:09.299> not<00:04:09.479> because

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
you guys wanted to see it or not because

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.259 
you guys wanted to see it or not because
i<00:04:09.870> actually<00:04:10.109> did<00:04:10.560> consider<00:04:11.009> not<00:04:11.759> putting<00:04:12.239> that

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
i actually did consider not putting that

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.899 
i actually did consider not putting that
part<00:04:12.659> in<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.930> video<00:04:13.259> but<00:04:14.159> i<00:04:14.220> did<00:04:14.579> decide<00:04:14.849> to

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
part in the video but i did decide to

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.490

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
put the part in the video because i

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.629
