00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 the fucking mother years I do not do videos 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.359
 fuck but it has to be a 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.099
 very special occasion or that I have to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.570
 be with the balls filled to more no 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.240
 power to feel the need 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.580
 to criticize something and is that there are people so 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.710
 ignorant and dogmatic fool that the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.449
 truth my instinct criticized what whole 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.359
 had to resurface from the ashes 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.670
 at least this time it happens that on the internet 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.529
 lately I've been discovering that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 from the anime world and every time 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.939
 pendeja meeting people could not be more 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.340
 who believes that geek and otaku are things already 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 practically antagonistic or that comic or 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 manga are parallel things that do not have 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.610
 no relation to each other and that already 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.890
 salons a little more come out to say that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 are the next evolutionary leap in fact 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 I think I already discovered why 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 otaku relates mentally enfermito of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.719
 done, I think they already hurt him so much 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.760
 at its end that the truth is better than 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.949
 take refuge saying they are geeks 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 next I will expose the arguments 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.550
 who use the otakus to raise their 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.510
 self-esteem and refute these 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.510
 ortho hairs 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.360
 it's serious if I remember geek has 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.640
 two definitions can be someone 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.770
 strange or it can also be someone with 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.560
 one or several hobbies or passions for 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.110
 example the comics are American 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.020
 or Japanese computer games 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.360
 etcetera in fact in any case the otaku 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.759
 would be a subclass of the geek besides 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.100
 at a certain point it 's funny because they 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.410
 they insult themselves if they say they are not 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.869
 geeks and then what geek is synonymous with 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.930
 someone intelligent means that they 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.930
 they say themselves idiots xd xd xddddd 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.760
 here if it is to grab them with kicks there is 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.130
 otaku groups that tell me that geek 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.200
 it is many times someone who is sickly 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.060
 mentally in the eyes of the people but at 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.010
 look like they do not even realize that 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.500
 they are also shown as sick 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.390
 mental an example are those who see gore 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.760
 and after five minutes of watching 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.920
 indicate a series that I think gore already 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.560
 they believe serial killers and all the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.210
 ugly fat ones are believed 1 or also all 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.100
 those who believe that society 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.990
 for violating psychologically and that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.500
 they are miserable among others 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 boludeces 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.600
 otakus demonstrating his intelligence 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.910
 extreme if the girl and the brand comes 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.280
 they have a good style of drawing which 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 that lies in the simplicity of it 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.810
 it does not put it above other types of 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.330
 drawing met before this well to the head ni 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.310
 the drawing of the anime and the manga is 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.440
 Gringo drawing up comic or 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.150
 of a Renaissance painting though 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.070
 Of course there are some mangakas that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.720
 they reach a drawing that can be 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.120
 some cases better than the ones 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.190
 gringos clear examples are capture 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.840
 Hoshino of grima not go here today 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.840
 from josh half adventure 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.230
 yes clear is like saying it's the same 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.870
 eat shit to eat chicken there's a big 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.550
 list of bad animes just that there are people 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 that does not want the rest to use the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.110
 brain and slides its truths like that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.240
 high school of the dead is a complete 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.340
 shit whose story does not make sense and 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.350
 is more full of plot holes 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.600
 that the ass of saeco in the number 80 and 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.490
 his same series or that bridge at the beginning 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.130
 was rejected by the action in yang by 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.410
 be a blatant plagiarism I accuse or that 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.420
 One piece is too overextended or 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.160
 that the series of blackrock shooter is 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.500
 inferior quality to the previous one 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.810
 or what to save online even though it's a good 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.510
 anime he fucked with birds in the house 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.010
 in the meadow people tell you this if 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.290
 they want to criticize an anime 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.739
 do it is not bad it's called using the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.739
 brain 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.950
 that's like saying that a Chinese can not 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.150
 apply surrealism in a box by 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.340
 not be French 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.350
 in other words avatar the legend of 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.220
 Aang is unanimous in the quality of the 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.220
 holy fuck 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.240
 that's silly to start manga is the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.460
 term the Japanese use for 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.710
 refer to the comics besides that in 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.110
 a certain point manga is the same as the 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.390
 comic book in the end the only thing that 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.000
 varies is the artistic style at the end 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.100
 they are always a sheet of paper where 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.170
 tells us a story which is 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.209
 distributed in boxes which 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.520
 contain drawings and which are 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.150
 they communicate by balloons and if we talk about 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.670
 stories 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.620
 both have their powers in the 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.660
 Japanese comic we have for example to 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.670
 hokuto not that in dragon ball and yoyos 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.620
 meat and adventure and in the world of 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.690
 comic book dream we do not have things like 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.690
 revenge the spiderman and girls 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.610
 that's funny because to begin with 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.219
 the Japanese hate the otaku in addition 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.319
 that these guys are racist 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:50.779
 see that almost all of his characters are 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.939
 whites a naruto example that is gringo 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.279
 more than can not and also many times 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.860
 end the servants' blacks a 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:59.779
 example mister popo in fact I think that 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.039
 if an otaku from my country goes to japan 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.039
 they will say listen to nothing 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.699
 that's silly because goku recontracts 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.289
 have the same rhythm and not for that 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.560
 dragon ball is better than full metal 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.560
 alchemist 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.560
 efe is an error of proportions 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.659
 colossal Japanese food if well 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.310
 tastes good does not compare to the 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.310
 Peruvian or Italian food 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.840
 to finish because I got bored of 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.270
 make this video 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.580
 this is a mistake to begin with there is no 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.710
 strongest anime character due to 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.660
 that each character has his abilities 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.540
 that allow you to be above 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.490
 and below others for example and kimi 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.380
 that is capable of winning something but at 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.210
 walker chinga a piquÃ­n and by the 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.060
 simple fact of being a carrier of the 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.100
 innocence good people see you maybe 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.650
 again want to make a video 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.650
 from here to the next three years xd xd
