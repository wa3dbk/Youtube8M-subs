00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.460 
stations out at e3 here and for three
days<00:02:09.240> straight<00:02:09.390> people<00:02:09.960> have<00:02:10.050> been<00:02:10.170> playing

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
days straight people have been playing

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.180 
days straight people have been playing
the<00:02:10.649> game<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:12.300> think<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:13.380> it's<00:02:13.710> kind<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.070> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the game and I think it's it's kind of a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.950 
the game and I think it's it's kind of a
game<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.360> really<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:15.810> your

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
game that you really have to get your

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.170 
game that you really have to get your
hands<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:17.160> see<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:17.820> it's<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.120> about

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
hands on and see what it's all about

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.450 
hands on and see what it's all about
before<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.290> make<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.470> judgement<00:02:20.040> it's

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
before you can make a judgement it's

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.950 
before you can make a judgement it's
certainly<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.940> different<00:02:21.360> kind<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.630> Resident

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
certainly a different kind of Resident

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.030 
certainly a different kind of Resident
Evil<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.560> lot<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.710> people<00:02:22.800> have

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
Evil and I think a lot of people have

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040 
Evil and I think a lot of people have
reservations<00:02:23.670> about<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> seems

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
reservations about that but it seems

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.540 
reservations about that but it seems
that<00:02:25.260> once<00:02:25.500> people<00:02:25.650> get<00:02:25.860> their<00:02:26.010> hands<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.400> it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
that once people get their hands on it

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.920 
that once people get their hands on it
they're<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.270> liking<00:02:27.690> what<00:02:27.810> we

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
they're really really liking what we

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.220 
they're really really liking what we
have<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.230> offer<00:02:28.459> as<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.610> move<00:02:29.790> forward<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:30.780> hope

city<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> shooter<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.410> was<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> was<00:02:43.770> kind<00:02:43.980> of

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
city as a shooter it was it was kind of

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.970 
city as a shooter it was it was kind of
hard<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.610> switch<00:02:44.970> over<00:02:45.270> from<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.690> mindset<00:02:46.590> of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
hard to switch over from that mindset of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.640 
hard to switch over from that mindset of
creating<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.400> survival<00:02:47.910> horror<00:02:48.050> game<00:02:49.050> into

of respect for those old resident evil

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
of respect for those old resident evil
games<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.750> was<00:02:54.840> really<00:02:54.990> difficult<00:02:55.260> to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
games and it was really difficult to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.820 
games and it was really difficult to
buck<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> trend<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.310> first<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:56.820> once<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:58.050> let

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
buck the trend at first but once I let

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.460 
buck the trend at first but once I let
myself<00:02:59.360> just<00:03:00.360> kind<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.600> sink<00:03:00.989> into<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.260> fact

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
myself just kind of sink into the fact

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.020 
myself just kind of sink into the fact
that<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.860> not<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> numbered<00:03:02.459> Resident

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
