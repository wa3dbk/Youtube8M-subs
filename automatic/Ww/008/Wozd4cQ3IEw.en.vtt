there<00:00:06.270> continues<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.170> growing<00:00:07.799> concern

natural levels of aluminum are found in
shellfish<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> highest<00:01:20.549> levels<00:01:20.939> overall

is<00:01:21.920> in<00:01:23.689> cheese<00:01:25.880> why

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
is in cheese why

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
is in cheese why
just<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> poultry<00:01:29.579> industry<00:01:29.729> adds

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
just like the poultry industry adds

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
just like the poultry industry adds
arsenic<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> chicken<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.490> dairy<00:01:32.880> industry

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
arsenic to chicken the dairy industry

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.060 
arsenic to chicken the dairy industry
adds<00:01:34.130> aluminum<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.850> cheese<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.560> number<00:01:37.920> one

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
adds aluminum to cheese the number one

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
adds aluminum to cheese the number one
source<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.579> aluminum<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> diet<00:01:41.299> why<00:01:42.299> would

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
source of aluminum in the diet why would

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.450 
source of aluminum in the diet why would
they<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:45.570> aluminum<00:01:46.290> salts<00:01:46.590> produce

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
they do that the aluminum salts produce

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.069 
they do that the aluminum salts produce
a<00:01:47.700> smooth<00:01:48.689> uniform<00:01:49.409> film<00:01:50.399> around<00:01:51.060> each<00:01:51.479> fat

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
a smooth uniform film around each fat

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.039 
a smooth uniform film around each fat
droplet<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.460> prevent<00:01:53.850> something<00:01:54.119> called<00:01:54.600> fat

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
droplet to prevent something called fat

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.280 
droplet to prevent something called fat
bleeding<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.430> give<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> cheese<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.329> softer

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
bleeding and to give the cheese a softer

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.130 
bleeding and to give the cheese a softer
texture<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.570> desirable<00:02:00.570> slicing<00:02:01.290> properties

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
texture and desirable slicing properties

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
texture and desirable slicing properties
so<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.320> you're<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> parent<00:02:04.920> worrying<00:02:05.790> about<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
so if you're a parent worrying about the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.869 
so if you're a parent worrying about the
aluminum<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.140> vaccines

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
aluminum and vaccines

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.469 
aluminum and vaccines
every<00:02:08.879> grilled<00:02:09.239> cheese<00:02:09.569> sandwich

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
every grilled cheese sandwich

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.470 
every grilled cheese sandwich
you<00:02:10.840> give<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.260> your<00:02:11.379> kids<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:12.069> like<00:02:13.000> injecting

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
you give to your kids is like injecting

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.559 
you give to your kids is like injecting
them<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.140> dozen<00:02:14.849> aluminum<00:02:15.849> containing

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569
