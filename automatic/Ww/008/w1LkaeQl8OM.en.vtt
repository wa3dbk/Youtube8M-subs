00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.620
 usually what we do the best 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.500
 definition of its lens is not the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.360
 the aperture it has usually 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.140
 above three points and then a lens 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.420
 2.8 2.834 is 5.5 point 6 would be the part 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 more defined your lens higher resolution 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.549
 of your lens as my lens is 2.8 I 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.070
 I'll use 5.678 you get a good 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.460
 definition of your beauty lens i 'll do 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.869
 this photo at low speed or try 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.330
 3.2 seconds 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.009
 Let's see how it goes. I'm 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.930
 using this without the legal good but I still 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.420
 I will try to seek the focus that seeks the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.770
 auto focus and I'll try to search 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.659
 a manual focus 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.659
 Let's see how the door is. 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.759
 and to increase to become cooler 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.789
 definition 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.369
 I'll put the camera to shoot 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.170
 two seconds because the camera is not 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.170
 They wagged that pressing her button. 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:08.910
 It was really cool, so I used two 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.799
 points five seconds seven iso 100 as 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.840
 I increased the speed is to decrease the 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.060
 image capture speed 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.870
 I ended up getting more rus coming 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.700
 from the bottom 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.349
 when you want to raise more funds and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.420

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.500
