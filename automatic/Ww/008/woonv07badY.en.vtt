name but so far we like what we see and
we're<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.700> looking<00:00:41.940> forward<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> driving

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it behind me you see the frame and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.410 
it behind me you see the frame and
internal<00:00:45.809> structure<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.010> c7<00:00:47.670> Corvette

might<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:58.920> notice<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.550> because<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
might not notice it because the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
might not notice it because the
dimensions<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.570> pretty<00:01:00.750> close<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.440> one

the last one that's not a lot and to be

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
the last one that's not a lot and to be
honest<00:01:17.850> Chevy<00:01:18.060> probably<00:01:18.540> could<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.750> gotten

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
more out of it but to keep the price

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.219 
more out of it but to keep the price

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.910

right<00:01:22.880> we<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> good<00:01:24.509> move<00:01:24.920> some

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
right we think this was a good move some

right we think this was a good move some
of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> technological<00:01:26.880> upgrades<00:01:27.299> may<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.659> may

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
of the technological upgrades may or may

of the technological upgrades may or may
not<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:28.229> seem<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.070> upgrades<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.820> one

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
not actually seem like upgrades for one

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
wheel to evaluate the new interior it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.889 
wheel to evaluate the new interior it
looks<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.579> improved<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.329> feels<00:01:45.720> much

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
looks much improved it feels much

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.870 
looks much improved it feels much
improved<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.799> does<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.280> new<00:01:47.490> interior

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
improved but does this new interior

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.660 
improved but does this new interior
really<00:01:48.720> stand<00:01:48.960> up<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> day-to-day<00:01:49.439> use<00:01:49.860> we'll

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
really stand up to day-to-day use we'll
