00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello today there is a handicraft lesson 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.550
 I keep asking 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.950
 michaela how does the colors work? 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.259
 to be replaced from the pallets 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.020
 I have a 5 palette here 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.650
 rausgeholt there was the color ball almost 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.350
 empty 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.050
 I can show you the rest 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.910
 placed in such a clinic 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.170
 Okay, that's a great charm now 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.150
 I would not normally have that right now 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.740
 disposed of but I wanted this question so 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.520
 solve as fast as possible namely how 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.380
 I get these flags exchanged 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 It really only really matters 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 be a rest in there because if you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 the exchange is the color 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 broken or the rest of the still 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.149
 you can not do that anymore 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 So use to the bitter end 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 please exhaust the color because of the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 Rest will break I have it now 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.280
 even before this in here right now 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.350
 Breaking is deliberately made easy 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.750
 with a pair of scissors a bit on 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.370
 poked in the evening and then I have 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.809
 no piggyback in the range 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 as you can see I have with 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.290
 my teaching with a scissors sheet 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.250
 This was between the edge of the window 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.770
 and the palette purely pricked and completely 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.350
 gently bent inward so that 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.659
 I have a little bit about with the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 I can confess to tipping 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.380
 have never done that before because 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 with me the color ball is still 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.740
 nowhere empty because I have 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.570
 just two palettes if I have one 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 I'm on the road when I'm at home 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 and it is not really 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.350
 happened that my color ball in one 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.090
 it was empty of both palettes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.729
 a training palette I'm in the ins 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 office and she was almost there 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.840
 empty and said so now that brought out 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 the cellar and then you try I 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.909
 I hope that I can handle this now 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.670
 to show so we can all see 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.380
 So I take a tassel here 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.079
 that's what you usually have at home too 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.759
 a little i do not even know 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.649
 the pliers probably not so 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.530
 you usually have something in the tool box 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.170
 at home then I put this right here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.959
 on the small flop and must 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.950
 just pull here hard 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.840
 I could imagine 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 glue them firmly on each other 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.349
 So now it is easy to get out 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.569
 pick up 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.629
 should that puts a little tighter 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.360
 you take a blow dryer and fill it exactly 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.459
 on the spot and a little bit of what 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.530
 I know maybe half a minute like that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.989
 that this sticky mass is a bit 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.030
 warm and thereby soften and 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.519
 then pull out so you look at that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.410
 the palette is damaged now nothing 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.019
 if you do it the way I said it 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.160
 So a rest only once from scratch 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.840
 with a solid nobility or with one 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.030
 thin scissors please not the good now 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.069
 nail scissors used for between 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.349
 edge of the window and the palette 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.120
 but a bit inside offer and 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.400
 pull out with the pliers 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.560
 that was pretty simple and then take 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.480
 I refill my 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.819
 they are here in this practical 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.019
 So wrap up the fruit and put that to me 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.150
 just in there again 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.010
 I feel like this is still here 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.900
 still enough adhesive mass down there 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.290
 but no new kathrein too 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.389
 put there are places the new flag 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.989
 here purely presses a bit 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:25.540
 and Schwuppdiwupp keeps it that way 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.430
 can not fail and is back 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.690
 fresh because I'm annoying myself but me 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.950
 I used to palette with this one 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.810
 annoyed then you buy a nice one 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.100
 color combination and the the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.290
 favorite color empty 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.819
 yes and what do you do then you can do it 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.829
 mostly not buy 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.720
 this is now here at my palette 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.880
 completely different you can any color 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.859
 individually exchange without the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.440
 palette is suffering and now it is back 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.720
 freshly stocked at the three pallets 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.470
 this one works a bit 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.269
 different 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.329
 that's just the way it is right now 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.359
 Here again how does this company 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.459
 palette on if you keep it so normal 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.660
 and tries on the thumb from the front 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.060
 That is very difficult 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.489
 I do it the other way around 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.650
 so keep away from me holding so that the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.959
 closure is up and then go with 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.209
 clean the fingernail and then leave it 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.859
 Open yourself so easy closure 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.079
 do not take to the front but to 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.120
 above and then with the hand here 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.979
 just guess in and then go 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.870
 it is totally simplistic otherwise 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.150
 actually a bit hard on though 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.870
 that's easy 12 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.120
 times as a tip on the edge and the 3 Series 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.889
 Pallets that have it even more practical 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.699
 they're down here on the bottom 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:40.360
 three small holes in these holes 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:42.639
 sit exactly under the color like that 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.270
 that's exactly the color you get 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.610
 exchange wants to fix from the bottom out 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.770
 can also sit here again 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.050
 color very firm feel a bit 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.850
 please a bit at the big birth 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.539
 do not fill that carefully 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.190
 the flags all melt up or 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.930
 content but dissolves I guess 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.330
 Let's just 30 seconds at about 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.729
 should lead there nothing only happen at 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.490
 Eyeshadow always remember that 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.630
 you rausholt that is broken it means 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.520
 a color just like that 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.539
 Replacing because here says would 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.240
 But I prefer another one 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.979
 color in there is the color here 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.449
 expresses break in the must 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.910
 you know otherwise you get angry then 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.080
 So that is super simple with the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.880
 hole in here in the back 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.970
 easy with a needle with the solid 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.729
 Needle from fix at the 5 palette with 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.380
 the pliers take out very very simple 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.800
 and then just dispose of money 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.229
 rubbish 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.330
 maybe you could even get out of that 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.470
 crumble to do something from there are 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.940
 some very, very creative but very 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.650
 very easy to refill 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.300
 I just wanted to answer that 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.090
 For those who say how do I get that 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.340
 color pots because it's out there at all 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.099
 imitate but only if it 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.960
 empty is oh and by the way so this one 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.680
 little flags you know the cost 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.949
 four euro 50 in the after mistake and the 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.110
 Incidentally, they also fit in the mac palettes 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.060
 So who says the mac range 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.970
 but I own the individual mac 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.979
 Potties with almost 20 euros are mine too 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.599
 expensive 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.840
 Try this one out of the suit 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:22.810
 indymac range or just in my five 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.520
 range four euro 50 for a super 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.169
 I'm a bit proud of quality 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.270
 Know this on what I'm talking about 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.830
 and the mac fans that maybe can 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.570
 to be convinced 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.920
 that does not necessarily mac on it 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.920
 have to go bye
