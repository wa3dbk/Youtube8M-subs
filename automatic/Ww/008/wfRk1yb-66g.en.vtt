00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.979
 this is the video presentation of the 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.100
 new cars of the signature double vÃ©lez 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:11.240
 toys in scale 1 in 24 economic lines 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:15.279
 and now let's see why they are the 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.760
 rally outfits this one simulates doing the 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.760
 whose blog party 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.369
 a lot of detail in the body the truth 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 that are very, very nice, very well 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.929
 achieved these cars are two channels 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.929
 electric rear-wheel drive 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.120
 they include everything necessary to be 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.180
 used of two- channel radio equipment 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.510
 battery charger and here we have the other 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.440
 model that is a simile peugeot 308 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.120
 also rally 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.120
 very, very successful 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.480
 let's see how it can be done 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.159
 work this first turn on from 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.460
 this red tab that is in the part 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:08.430
 bottom of the car and then the team 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.759
 radio is turned on from here we wait for 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.960
 I finished the flashing that led and there 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.750
 should be linked 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.299
 we have an address but the address is 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.220
 digital all or nothing this makes this 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.220
 car is a little more economical is not 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.290
 proportional to the alignment of that 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.479
 direction that is if us when accelerating 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.890
 the car alone without touching the steering wheel 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.869
 they have a tendency with this knob 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.580
 we can go giving left or right 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.680
 to correct and that the author 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.140
 it truly happens online 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.150
 then we said here with the steering wheel and not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.580
 we have the address and we have a 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.780
 trigger for acceleration if we press 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.970
 running forward brake if I give it to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.990
 go ahead and if I give one more time to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.990
 forward trigger 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.909
 another of the team's functions 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.490
 radio is that we have a limiter 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.080
 maximum power notice that usually 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.080
 press this button that says more 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.800
 appear more read what I have more 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.800
 final speed 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 Y 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.409
 remembering that the use you have for 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.269
 training to learn how to use it and 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.129
 that does not go so strong with the one side 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.499
 of the other in the little one so they can 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:44.719
 go at a controlled speed and 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.719
 learning to direct the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.750
 to load it let's turn off the author of 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 radio 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.020
 let's see the issue of loading this 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.560
 car 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.750
 we put out in a little red fichita 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.430
 we got a usb adapter because the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.600
 charger is usb or to pc 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.950
 we connect it by making a red light 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.620
 the car is not connected yet 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.340
 the load switch we have here in the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.970
 left side connected and notice that the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.209
 little light from the charger went off when 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.670
 re-ignition finished the charge is 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.950
 It is important that when the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.080
 burden beyond that have not been given 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.190
 account at the time spent an hour two 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.280
 hours but disconnect it 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.700
 the charger and then also disconnect 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.480
 the port keeper usb I've never 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.030
 connected the charger to the car and not to 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.790
 the network that is not feeding another 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.920
 important detail is that the battery of 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.520
 lithium polymer that is in here not 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.040
 never be discharged completely 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.710
 so if you finish using the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.200
 deceased and off is perfect but if 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.780
 they forget it on this is going to continue 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.970
 consuming in a couple of hours the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.190
 battery runs out and the car will not go 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.130
 more to see than buy another battery 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.810
 that are sold as a replacement and replace it 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.810
 inside which is installed
