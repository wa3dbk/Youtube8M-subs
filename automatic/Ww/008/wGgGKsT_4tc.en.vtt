00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
monofilament line with this kind of line

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.670 
monofilament line with this kind of line
in<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.510> particular<00:00:24.810> diameter<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:25.560> going

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
in this particular diameter we're going

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
in this particular diameter we're going
to<00:00:25.740> use<00:00:25.890> about<00:00:26.039> 20<00:00:26.670> wraps<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> Bimini<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
to use about 20 wraps on the Bimini and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.160 
to use about 20 wraps on the Bimini and
if<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> were<00:00:28.740> using<00:00:28.980> let's<00:00:29.429> say<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.170> thinner

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
if you were using let's say a thinner

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.830 
if you were using let's say a thinner
diameter<00:00:31.910> braided<00:00:32.910> line<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.540> might<00:00:33.719> use

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
diameter braided line you might use

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.049 
diameter braided line you might use
upwards<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> 40<00:00:34.710> wraps<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.730> highly

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
upwards of 40 wraps so it's it's highly

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
upwards of 40 wraps so it's it's highly
dependent<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.719> anywhere<00:00:37.620> any<00:00:37.860> monofilament

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
dependent but anywhere any monofilament

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.840 
dependent but anywhere any monofilament
22<00:00:39.329> let's<00:00:39.570> say<00:00:39.809> 80<00:00:40.620> pound<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.730> away

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
22 let's say 80 pound you can get away

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.660 
22 let's say 80 pound you can get away
with<00:00:42.180> 20<00:00:42.629> wraps<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:44.219> we're<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> start

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
with 20 wraps so we're going to start

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.209 
with 20 wraps so we're going to start
wrapping<00:00:44.879> our<00:00:45.180> line<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:46.070> we're<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
wrapping our line here we're going to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.470 
wrapping our line here we're going to
want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> keep<00:00:47.550> tension<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> whole

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
enough tagline to work with and then I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
enough tagline to work with and then I
like<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> moisten<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.699> line<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.059> bit

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
like to moisten the line a little bit

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
like to moisten the line a little bit
just<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.600> don't<00:00:57.750> get<00:00:57.840> any<00:00:57.930> memory<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
just so I don't get any memory and as I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.250 
just so I don't get any memory and as I
apply<00:00:59.370> tension<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.210> separate<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.899> legs

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
apply tension and separate these legs

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
apply tension and separate these legs
I'm<00:01:01.559> gonna<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> decrease<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I'm gonna I'm going to decrease the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
I'm gonna I'm going to decrease the
tension<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> tagline<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.439> hand<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
tension on the tagline in my hand and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
tension on the tagline in my hand and
it's<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> allow<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> line<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.299> just

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's going to allow the line to just

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.200 
it's going to allow the line to just
loop<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:07.439> down<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.830> top<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> itself<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.060> here

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
loop right down on top of itself so here

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
loop right down on top of itself so here
we<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.659> start<00:01:10.070> letting<00:01:11.070> tension

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
we go I'm going to start letting tension

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.210 
we go I'm going to start letting tension
off<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.000> my<00:01:12.510> hand<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> I'm

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
off of my my hand on my right and I'm

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.359 
off of my my hand on my right and I'm
going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:16.280> now<00:01:17.280> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
going to be going down like that now you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.499 
going to be going down like that now you
got<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> hold<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> tight<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.420> because

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
got a hold it tight right there because

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
got a hold it tight right there because
if<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.750> let<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.140> my<00:01:19.290> left<00:01:19.409> hand<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.979> line

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
if I let go with my left hand that line

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
if I let go with my left hand that line
is<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> unravel<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.720> I'm<00:01:21.810> doing<00:01:21.840> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
is going to unravel so what I'm doing is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.429 
is going to unravel so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:22.290> making<00:01:23.000> one<00:01:24.000> half<00:01:24.330> hitch<00:01:24.600> knot<00:01:24.630> over<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
I'm making one half hitch knot over a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.160 
I'm making one half hitch knot over a
single<00:01:25.830> leg<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> line<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> go

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
single leg of the line so there you go

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
single leg of the line so there you go
now<00:01:28.710> we're<00:01:28.860> pretty<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.100> tightened<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:29.970> what

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
now we're pretty much tightened up what

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.969 
now we're pretty much tightened up what
I'm<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> further<00:01:31.350> tighten<00:01:31.829> this

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I'm going to do to further tighten this

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.350 
I'm going to do to further tighten this
lock<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> double<00:01:35.060> one<00:01:36.060> half

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
lock it down I do a double one half

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.140 
lock it down I do a double one half
hitch<00:01:36.600> over<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> double<00:01:37.470> line<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.030> we're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
hitch over the double line and now we're

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
hitch over the double line and now we're
going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.600> twice<00:01:39.869> more<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.770> more

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
going to do that twice more so one more

it you've got a double line nice clean

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.059 
it you've got a double line nice clean
Bimini<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.599> what's<00:02:16.780> nice<00:02:16.930> about<00:02:16.989> this<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.530> not

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
Bimini and what's nice about this is not

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.800 
Bimini and what's nice about this is not
only<00:02:18.340> does<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.489> give<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.880> solid<00:02:19.180> loop<00:02:19.600> where

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
only does it give you a solid loop where

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.990 
only does it give you a solid loop where

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
you can attach a wind on leader or

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.380 
you can attach a wind on leader or
swivel<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.680> knot<00:02:23.980> retains<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.090> hundred

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
swivel this knot retains a hundred

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.670 
swivel this knot retains a hundred
percent<00:02:25.510> breaking<00:02:26.080> strength<00:02:26.350> when<00:02:26.500> tied

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
percent breaking strength when tied

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.870 
percent breaking strength when tied
properly<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.310> you're<00:02:27.400> not<00:02:27.459> worried<00:02:27.819> about

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
connection so now you know how to tie a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.030 
connection so now you know how to tie a
Bimini<00:02:31.569> and<00:02:32.110> go<00:02:32.230> out<00:02:32.350> there<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.560> pull<00:02:32.830> in<00:02:32.920> some

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
Bimini and go out there and pull in some

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.430 
Bimini and go out there and pull in some
big<00:02:33.190> fish
