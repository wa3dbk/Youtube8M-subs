trying to destroy a main wall so we see

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.559 
trying to destroy a main wall so we see
him<00:03:26.709> sending<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> rest<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:27.730> his<00:03:27.910> army<00:03:28.180> in

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.830 
he's just gaming for my defenses he sets
it<00:03:50.829> another<00:03:51.099> pixie<00:03:51.579> which<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.180> find<00:03:52.510> kind<00:03:52.629> of

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
it another pixie which I find kind of

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.430 
it another pixie which I find kind of
pointless<00:03:53.169> because<00:03:54.660> on<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.959> right<00:03:56.139> side<00:03:56.349> of

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
pointless because on the right side of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.439 
pointless because on the right side of
my<00:03:56.560> base<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:57.129> realized<00:03:57.489> this<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.150> another

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
my base you realized this is another

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.379 
my base you realized this is another
elephants<00:03:58.989> right<00:03:59.169> there<00:03:59.379> so<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.549> sooner<00:04:01.269> or

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
elephants right there so it's sooner or

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.150 
elephants right there so it's sooner or
later<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.870> his<00:04:01.959> Pixies<00:04:02.410> we<00:04:02.560> can<00:04:02.709> take<00:04:02.889> it<00:04:03.040> out

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
later that his Pixies we can take it out

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.830 
later that his Pixies we can take it out
once<00:04:03.519> he<00:04:03.609> move<00:04:03.849> onto<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.269> right<00:04:04.419> side<00:04:04.629> of<00:04:04.720> my

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
once he move onto the right side of my

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.849 
once he move onto the right side of my
base<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:06.609> see<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:07.500> monster<00:04:08.500> this<00:04:08.590> bombing

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
base so we see this monster this bombing

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.970 
base so we see this monster this bombing
the<00:04:09.519> middle<00:04:09.760> toss<00:04:09.910> while<00:04:10.239> they<00:04:10.359> get<00:04:10.480> healed<00:04:10.810> up

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.540 

they<00:04:23.640> continue<00:04:24.120> moving<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.530> see<00:04:25.830> he

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
reaches near my air-defense where the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.990 
reaches near my air-defense where the
Pixies<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:30.030> take<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.390> out<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:32.010> guys<00:04:32.940> can

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.580 
Pixies can take it out so you guys can
see<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.480> base<00:04:33.660> defense<00:04:34.020> actually<00:04:34.380> really

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
see this base defense actually really

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.280 
see this base defense actually really
good<00:04:34.770> again<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.520> kind<00:04:35.670> of<00:04:35.790> attacks

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
good again this is kind of attacks

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.890 
good again this is kind of attacks
people<00:04:37.290> trying<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.800> set<00:04:38.040> in<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:39.360> minute<00:04:39.690> sauce

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
people trying to set in the minute sauce

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.410 
people trying to set in the minute sauce
and<00:04:40.260> pixie<00:04:40.620> susheel<00:04:41.130> it's<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.030> really<00:04:42.240> good

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
and pixie susheel it's a really good

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.060 
and pixie susheel it's a really good
strategy<00:04:42.660> against<00:04:43.260> those<00:04:43.380> kind<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.770> rates

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
strategy against those kind of rates

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.970 
strategy against those kind of rates
because<00:04:45.020> minute<00:04:46.020> stones<00:04:46.170> are<00:04:46.260> really<00:04:46.440> slow<00:04:46.740> so

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
because minute stones are really slow so

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.580 
because minute stones are really slow so
they<00:04:47.100> get<00:04:47.220> taken<00:04:47.400> up<00:04:47.700> by<00:04:47.880> room<00:04:48.150> they<00:04:48.510> get<00:04:48.660> hit

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
they get taken up by room they get hit

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.260 
they get taken up by room they get hit
by<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.800> lot<00:04:50.010> of<00:04:50.130> damage<00:04:50.340> really<00:04:50.640> fast

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
by a lot of damage really fast

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.650 
by a lot of damage really fast
I'd<00:04:51.510> like<00:04:52.730> okay<00:04:53.730> you<00:04:53.790> see<00:04:54.000> his<00:04:54.120> big<00:04:54.270> sneeze<00:04:54.510> get

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
taken out now by my air defense so it's

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.030 
taken out now by my air defense so it's
too<00:04:57.570> late<00:04:57.750> for<00:04:57.810> him<00:04:58.140> he's<00:04:58.320> not<00:04:58.470> gonna<00:04:58.650> win<00:04:58.860> this

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
send in some sniffles which was kind of

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.200 
send in some sniffles which was kind of
desperate<00:05:08.700> Murph

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
desperate Murph

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.210 
desperate Murph
he<00:05:09.810> sent<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.140> twenty<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.560> them<00:05:10.740> but<00:05:11.010> my

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
that was a pretty stupid move because

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.250 
that was a pretty stupid move because
the<00:06:19.560> more<00:06:20.190> top<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.730> the<00:06:21.570> wizard<00:06:21.810> tower<00:06:21.990> she

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260

takes<00:06:22.470> out<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:23.130> range<00:06:24.090> is<00:06:24.210> pretty<00:06:24.360> fast<00:06:24.690> you

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
takes out the range is pretty fast you

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.330 
takes out the range is pretty fast you
can<00:06:24.930> see<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.260> moss<00:06:25.410> actually<00:06:25.740> takes<00:06:25.919> out<00:06:26.070> the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.360 
can see the moss actually takes out the
Rangers<00:06:26.610> in<00:06:26.729> one<00:06:26.940> shot<00:06:27.330> so<00:06:28.229> it<00:06:29.010> was<00:06:29.160> pretty

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
Rangers in one shot so it was pretty

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.390 
Rangers in one shot so it was pretty
stupid<00:06:29.789> mistake<00:06:30.300> off<00:06:30.479> him<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.960> do

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
stupid mistake off him to do

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.719 
stupid mistake off him to do
and<00:06:32.000> he<00:06:32.419> says<00:06:32.630> his<00:06:32.810> dog<00:06:33.220> Mentos<00:06:34.220> makes<00:06:35.120> which
