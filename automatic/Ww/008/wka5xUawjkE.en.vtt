onto the back here and the wings just
kind<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.509> fold<00:01:50.720> up<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.740> around<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.520> here's

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
kind of fold up and around and here's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.650 
kind of fold up and around and here's
where<00:01:52.880> those<00:01:52.970> missiles<00:01:53.090> might<00:01:53.450> make<00:01:53.630> a

where those missiles might make a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.359 
where those missiles might make a
difference<00:01:54.050> if<00:01:54.440> those<00:01:54.649> weren't<00:01:54.860> there<00:01:55.100> this

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
difference if those weren't there this

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.040 
difference if those weren't there this
wing<00:01:55.580> might<00:01:55.850> fold<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.300> just<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.810> little<00:01:56.840> bit

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
wing might fold in just a little bit

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.389 
wing might fold in just a little bit
more<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.410> doesn't<00:01:57.590> really<00:01:57.770> affect<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.220> back

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
more it doesn't really affect the back

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.300 
more it doesn't really affect the back
of<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.610> robot<00:01:59.020> I<00:02:00.020> mean<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.830> just<00:02:00.860> flip<00:02:01.159> this

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
of the robot I mean you just flip this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.490 
of the robot I mean you just flip this
panel<00:02:01.640> down<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.030> foremost<00:02:02.420> cover<00:02:03.290> up<00:02:03.409> the

arms rotate like out like so and then

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.690 
arms rotate like out like so and then
you<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.290> route<00:02:12.470> how<00:02:12.680> these<00:02:12.860> rotate<00:02:13.340> around<00:02:13.430> to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
you can route how these rotate around to

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.030 
you can route how these rotate around to
face<00:02:13.940> down<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.570> they<00:02:14.989> can<00:02:15.170> fire<00:02:15.350> forward<00:02:15.709> and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
face down so they can fire forward and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.300 
face down so they can fire forward and
then<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.820> arms<00:02:17.090> flip<00:02:17.299> out<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:18.980> kind<00:02:19.250> of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
then the arms flip out there is kind of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.490 
then the arms flip out there is kind of
a<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.030> rotate<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.450> wrist<00:02:20.660> there<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.470> a

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
a you can rotate the wrist there is a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.530 
a you can rotate the wrist there is a
gap<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:21.769> his<00:02:22.040> forearm<00:02:22.310> but<00:02:22.760> that's<00:02:23.209> just<00:02:23.360> a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
gap in his forearm but that's just a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.960 
gap in his forearm but that's just a
side<00:02:23.720> effect<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.110> transformation

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.640 

and<00:02:29.970> probably<00:02:30.299> my<00:02:30.599> only<00:02:30.780> real<00:02:31.019> complaint<00:02:31.049> with

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and probably my only real complaint with

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.940 
and probably my only real complaint with
the<00:02:32.629> what<00:02:33.629> one<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:34.049> two<00:02:34.409> complaints<00:02:34.769> I

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the what one of them two complaints I

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
the what one of them two complaints I
have<00:02:35.069> with<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> MEC<00:02:35.459> mode<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.299> gap<00:02:36.870> in

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
have with the MEC mode is is the gap in

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.280 
have with the MEC mode is is the gap in
the<00:02:37.200> arms<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.730> other<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.299> he's<00:02:40.140> got

figure I like him

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.569 
figure I like him
I<00:03:30.299> think<00:03:31.140> he's<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.920> for<00:03:32.159> Marvel

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
I think he's of the for Marvel

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.180 
I think he's of the for Marvel
transformers<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:34.560> are<00:03:34.680> out<00:03:34.799> right<00:03:35.010> now<00:03:35.040> I

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
transformers that are out right now I

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.240 
transformers that are out right now I
think<00:03:35.459> he's<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.760> weakest<00:03:36.150> that's<00:03:36.870> not

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
think he's the weakest that's not

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.080 
think he's the weakest that's not
necessarily<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.370> bad<00:03:38.400> thing<00:03:38.579> they're<00:03:38.970> all

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
necessarily a bad thing they're all

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.580 
necessarily a bad thing they're all
really<00:03:39.239> great<00:03:39.450> things<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:40.049> Iron<00:03:40.260> Man<00:03:40.440> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
really great things but Iron Man is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.420 
really great things but Iron Man is
definitely<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.040> weakest<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.459> four<00:03:43.430> but

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
definitely the weakest of the four but

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.640 
definitely the weakest of the four but
they<00:03:44.519> have<00:03:44.790> him<00:03:44.910> Iron<00:03:45.180> Man<00:03:45.650> Marvel

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
they have him Iron Man Marvel

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.540 
they have him Iron Man Marvel
transformers<00:03:47.639> crossovers
