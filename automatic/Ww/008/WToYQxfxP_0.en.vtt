00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
a rough estimate I'd say we got about 25

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.019 
a rough estimate I'd say we got about 25
in<00:01:36.829> here<00:01:37.069> maybe<00:01:37.819> maybe<00:01:38.420> around<00:01:38.749> there<00:01:38.959> so

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
in here maybe maybe around there so

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
kind of mess with it there for yourself

which<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.230> was<00:04:36.530> actually<00:04:36.800> expecting<00:04:37.300> because

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
which I was actually expecting because

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.970 
which I was actually expecting because
most<00:04:38.780> themes<00:04:39.169> do<00:04:39.530> have<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.160> icon<00:04:41.110> themed<00:04:42.110> but

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
most themes do have the icon themed but

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.879 
most themes do have the icon themed but

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
in this situation I guess not however

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.379 
in this situation I guess not however
