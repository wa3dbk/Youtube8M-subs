00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.860 
weren't actually that difficult to make
it<00:04:17.650> took<00:04:17.920> us<00:04:18.100> about<00:04:18.220> two<00:04:18.580> and<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.120> half<00:04:19.150> hours<00:04:19.690> to

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.550 
do and inside them they have an
injection<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:24.240> strawberry<00:04:25.240> daiquiri<00:04:25.840> icing

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
injection of strawberry daiquiri icing

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.110 
injection of strawberry daiquiri icing
in<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.860> middle<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.280> them<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.640> they<00:04:27.730> are<00:04:27.940> going

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
in the middle of them so they are going

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.090 
in the middle of them so they are going
to<00:04:28.210> taste<00:04:28.480> absolutely<00:04:28.920> amazing<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.070> just

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
to taste absolutely amazing and I just

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.770 
to taste absolutely amazing and I just
think<00:04:30.400> they're<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> really<00:04:30.760> nice<00:04:30.970> gift<00:04:31.390> as<00:04:31.750> well

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
think they're a really nice gift as well

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.460 
think they're a really nice gift as well
for<00:04:32.260> people<00:04:32.410> at<00:04:33.420> Christmastime<00:04:34.420> so<00:04:35.230> I<00:04:35.260> think

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
for people at Christmastime so I think

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.170 
for people at Christmastime so I think
it's<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.800> really<00:04:35.830> nice<00:04:36.100> idea<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.640> do<00:04:36.910> suffer

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
it's a really nice idea to do suffer

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.640 
it's a really nice idea to do suffer
because<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.600> don't<00:04:37.750> often<00:04:37.870> get<00:04:38.080> time<00:04:38.320> off<00:04:38.350> work

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
because I don't often get time off work

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.980 
because I don't often get time off work
and<00:04:38.950> then<00:04:39.130> when<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.310> do<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:39.970> nice<00:04:40.390> to<00:04:40.630> kind<00:04:40.810> of

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
and then when I do it's nice to kind of

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.960 
and then when I do it's nice to kind of
arrange<00:04:41.440> things<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.160> do<00:04:42.340> with<00:04:42.490> your<00:04:42.550> friends

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
arrange things to do with your friends

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.160 
arrange things to do with your friends
so<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.300> know<00:04:43.480> you've<00:04:43.660> got<00:04:43.840> something<00:04:44.080> in

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
so that you know you've got something in

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.670 
so that you know you've got something in
the<00:04:44.230> diary<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.890> kind<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.810> do<00:04:46.810> something<00:04:47.500> with

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
the diary to kind of do something with

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.680 
the diary to kind of do something with
them<00:04:47.860> otherwise<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.520> end<00:04:48.700> up<00:04:48.910> kind<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.330> wind<00:04:49.540> up

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
them otherwise I end up kind of wind up

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.510 
them otherwise I end up kind of wind up
not<00:04:49.810> really<00:04:50.020> doing<00:04:50.170> much<00:04:50.260> at<00:04:50.380> all<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.340> was

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
not really doing much at all and it was

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.890 
not really doing much at all and it was
quite<00:04:51.880> cheap<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.330> do<00:04:52.390> that<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.570> think<00:04:52.600> it<00:04:52.810> was

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
quite cheap to do that I think it was

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.020 
quite cheap to do that I think it was
like<00:04:53.020> 25<00:04:53.470> pounds<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.340> was<00:04:54.460> for<00:04:54.700> three

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
like 25 pounds and it was for three

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.300 
like 25 pounds and it was for three
hours<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.450> we<00:04:55.720> got<00:04:55.870> six<00:04:56.140> cupcakes<00:04:56.620> actually<00:04:57.130> I

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
hours and we got six cupcakes actually I

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.990 
hours and we got six cupcakes actually I
think<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.180> bargain<00:04:58.660> look<00:04:59.470> who<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.680> found
