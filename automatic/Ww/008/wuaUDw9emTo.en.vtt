00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.320
 each coach has his own training 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.250
 to that 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.810
 and I think we did a good job. 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.279
 bekenbauer collecting be even higher than in 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.629
 December remove 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.759
 tactical 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:11.889
 and work 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.829
 cabin of champions 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.119
 all this will allow to sell 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 transplant surgery 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.400
 so always need to be concentrated eao 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.779
 such works as okady lilac 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.359
 the employee core of this thought may be 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.359
 one question but it was just such 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.440
 I'm always concentrated 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.670
 spring if the Iranians are a weak rival 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.200
 Naturally this communication values ​​need 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 walk to concentrated 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.410
 Tomi UAH 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.550
 did not give so much Igor still looking for work 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.600
 countries 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.810
 by the words we select we type on this 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.610
 playing practice 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.700
 let's see how we are ready 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.080
 this will show the first game in 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 championship 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.600
 for protection 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.420
 and if in Moscow 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.980
 relationships with newbies 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.810
 so with us as with this year 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.920
 no team and I think that will cause 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.190
 question to beginners 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.360
 who will play it no one knows 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.300
 what 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.430
 All Ukrainians first played 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.990
 I thought that the newcomers came to the team 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.120
 army team well accepted he did not 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 tried to work apt 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.940
 all attempts the first rocket will be happy for 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.580
 I don’t know them yet because another year 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.400
 back was not so many years 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 before the start of the championship 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.890
 who will play 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.180
 so deputy 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.250
 Spartak 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.430
 but because that penalty come 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.480
 otherwise it was on emotion 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.350
 I will see all the players 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.179
 exchanged and being a real pipe 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.170
 simply 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.600
 for me I did not score 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960
 this point 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.030
 I used to score points 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.049
 completely different now such as for 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.130
 hit it failed well 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.220
 it was all 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.000
 in a match with sparta 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.780
 after the match Spartak 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.440
 so with such journalists not 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.989
 reported 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.769
 I didn't communicate between Skolkovo there 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.079
 Druze this in this team but going 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.769
 there I did not communicate only vat said 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.179
 good luck 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.120
 in Europe rejected 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.920
 it's all just
