00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
shared the same passion for engineering

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.139 
shared the same passion for engineering
the<00:00:44.109> other<00:00:44.260> students<00:00:44.680> on<00:00:45.039> the<00:00:45.460> course<00:00:45.640> were

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
the other students on the course were

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.380 
the other students on the course were
actually<00:00:46.719> working<00:00:46.949> as<00:00:47.949> civil<00:00:48.280> engineers<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
actually working as civil engineers so

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.360 
actually working as civil engineers so
which<00:00:49.690> was<00:00:49.870> great<00:00:50.140> because<00:00:50.410> we<00:00:50.800> were<00:00:50.829> able<00:00:51.010> to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370

discuss about what is it like to work as

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.979 
discuss about what is it like to work as
a<00:00:54.070> civil<00:00:54.309> engineer<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:55.059> know<00:00:55.179> what<00:00:55.750> is<00:00:55.899> it

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
a civil engineer you know what is it

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.990 
a civil engineer you know what is it
like<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.379> be<00:00:56.410> in<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.769> mr.<00:00:57.190> engineer<00:00:57.370> industry

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
like to be in it mr. engineer industry

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.590 
like to be in it mr. engineer industry
so<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:58.989> was<00:00:59.109> amazing<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.890> have<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.640> exchange
