I<00:00:22.859> figured<00:00:23.250> well<00:00:23.580> maybe<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.390> can't<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.720> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
I figured well maybe it can't be that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
I figured well maybe it can't be that
hard<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.920> really<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.789> as<00:00:26.939> easy

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
hard and it really is it's not as easy

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
hard and it really is it's not as easy
as<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> looks<00:00:27.599> well<00:00:28.349> as<00:00:28.650> easy<00:00:28.830> see<00:00:29.130> makes<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
as it looks well as easy see makes it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.299 
as it looks well as easy see makes it
look<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:31.019> actually<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.529> fun<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.980> I'm

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
was gonna just ignore it but it gets

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.999 
was gonna just ignore it but it gets
really<00:01:42.750> annoying<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.350> keep<00:01:43.530> hearing<00:01:43.890> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
really annoying when you keep hearing it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.380 
really annoying when you keep hearing it
you<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> predator<00:01:44.909> missle<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.299> have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you have a predator missle we have

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880 
you have a predator missle we have
predator<00:01:45.720> missle<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:46.770> i

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
predator missle all that so right now i

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.399 
predator missle all that so right now i
am<00:01:47.100> doing<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> care<00:01:48.119> package<00:01:48.689> glitch<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
am doing the care package glitch which I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.649 
am doing the care package glitch which I
it<00:01:49.649> makes<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.979> run<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> lot<00:01:50.610> faster<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.479> mean

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it makes you run a lot faster and I mean

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.960 
it makes you run a lot faster and I mean
a<00:01:51.689> lot<00:01:51.990> faster<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.430> how<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.640> normally

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
a lot faster if you see how you normally

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.139 
a lot faster if you see how you normally
run<00:01:54.450> without<00:01:54.720> marathon<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.649> ninja<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.670> mean

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
run without marathon or ninja I mean

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
run without marathon or ninja I mean
without<00:01:57.390> marathon<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> light<00:01:58.469> weight<00:01:58.680> or

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
without marathon or a light weight or

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.340 
without marathon or a light weight or
and<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> run<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> care

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and then if you run with the care

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.499 
and then if you run with the care
package<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.700> run<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> care

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
package or if you just run with the care

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.800 
package or if you just run with the care
package<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.479> lot<00:02:06.659> faster

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
package with it on it's a lot faster

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
package with it on it's a lot faster
either<00:02:07.170> way<00:02:07.350> well<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.860> jump<00:02:08.099> down<00:02:08.190> almost<00:02:08.459> died

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
either way well I jump down almost died

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
either way well I jump down almost died
so<00:02:09.030> i'm<00:02:09.149> trying<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> lay<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:10.200> i<00:02:10.229> did

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
in i'll lay down sometimes don't take as

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.510 
in i'll lay down sometimes don't take as
much<00:02:16.420> damage<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.010> hoping<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.400> work

another<00:03:33.370> game<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.150> i'm<00:03:35.020> now<00:03:35.320> using

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
another game and I i'm now using

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.180 
another game and I i'm now using
commando<00:03:37.060> pro<00:03:37.210> i<00:03:37.480> guess<00:03:37.780> since<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:38.530> figure<00:03:39.100> I'm

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
commando pro i guess since I figure I'm

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.300 
commando pro i guess since I figure I'm
not<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.520> great<00:03:39.700> at<00:03:39.850> knifing<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.750> figure<00:03:41.050> I

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
not that great at knifing so I figure I

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.860 
not that great at knifing so I figure I
used<00:03:42.310> commander<00:03:42.790> pro<00:03:43.060> because<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.570> helps<00:03:43.780> you

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
used commander pro because it helps you

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.650 
used commander pro because it helps you
out<00:03:43.900> let<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.710> knife<00:03:44.890> quicker<00:03:45.510> farther<00:03:46.510> away

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
out let you knife quicker farther away

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.600 
out let you knife quicker farther away
