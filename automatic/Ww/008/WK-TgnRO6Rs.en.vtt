00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.100
 great to put i would say that on 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.350
 four minutes for like six hours later 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.210
 begin to fade and requires that their 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.219
 sent on as for the most 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.930
 pigment in the champ tab people are much 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.410
 brighter but when shading on the counter 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.390
 fatina is muffled and looks more modest 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.850
 That's how it looks without shading 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.560
 making these random hands I want you 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.480
 show how each of these shades 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.010
 looks without shading saturation 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.160
 texture pigments but also just for 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.160
 comparisons 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.840
 the second daisies are such a baby from max 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.210
 factor twisted op sem soft patents 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.830
 case first time looking at this light 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.230
 it gets scary and its bright 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.390
 screaming and rich red 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.160
 I'm starting to shade it on a pike 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.500
 the whole thing just goes away and leave 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.360
 such a light transparent blush had to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.370
 take food calls several times 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.050
 contentment is more noticeable on the face that 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.850
 concerns resilience I would not say that 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.410
 they are very persistent after all cream 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.690
 blush is more suitable for owners 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.220
 dry skin on my skin they started 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.440
 roll down this strong fat texture 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.000
 I would say that they are the fattest of all 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.920
 today's blush so persistence 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.720
 leave a pen then even courage 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.440
 but what does shade 07 look like without 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.440
 feathering 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.490
 and as you can see when applying the shading on 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.490
 faces this saturation pigments disappears 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.430
 And now straight thighs won again 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.200
 I will make unhook but conveniently flakonchiki 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.210
 pocket mirror and tight-fitting 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.130
 a lid that allows you to open 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.750
 rouge themselves have a very gentle 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.430
 peach color that is on the skin 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.230
 drank the same as in the bottle 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.210
 slightly dry texture which 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.130
 possible can gain some peeling 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.320
 however the product is shaded very 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.070
 easy also glad just worth 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.390
 lasted all day without interference 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.740
 forgot to tell you about their dullness 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.880
 which gives even more 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.880
 the naturalness of Rubens 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.040
 the next blush from them is timid and younger 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.170
 tenge well from 20 people proceeding even from 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.180
 names in the grid can immediately say that 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.130
 on the face like natural beautiful and 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.020
 gentle natural brunson pretty 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.090
 a big jar of food is enough 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.830
 very long gentle and pleasant texture 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.990
 which is easily shaded to 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.390
 fingertips then with a brush or sponge 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.430
 in principle they are of that tincture although the end 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.290
 of the day we started to crawl a little bit but after 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.990
 small and interference beat again 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.880
 sat down with a beautiful gentle blush they 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:04.120
 quite easy to fall out of seven hard 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:08.220
 go too far here so the product looks without 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.220
 feathering is very gentle naturally 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.910
 and our last I am so wild in shade 32 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.590
 cream roses compact jar angry at 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.630
 which is very comfortable to carry around 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.720
 the most beautiful shade of jars that 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.250
 a little less saturated falls on the face 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.169
 the texture is pretty wise that allows 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.060
 easy to shade the product these blush 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.949
 very under this girls dry skin but 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.020
 a few minutes after applying they 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.850
 get a matte finish because 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.110
 the blush is very saturated is transferred with 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.120
 jars need to be neat with 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.560
 quantity if everything is done in moderation then 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.330
 the result will be very beautiful 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.630
 natural and rack blush on the whole 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.940
 day 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.010
 That's how they look right from the jar 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.110
 now you can compare all shades and 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.110

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.750
