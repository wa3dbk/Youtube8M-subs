oh<00:00:00.670> my<00:00:01.569> god<00:00:01.810> I<00:00:02.170> don't<00:00:02.590> even<00:00:02.710> remember<00:00:02.980> I<00:00:03.639> think

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:03.969 
oh my god I don't even remember I think

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.730 
oh my god I don't even remember I think
it's<00:00:04.299> ten<00:00:04.750> years<00:00:04.780> ago<00:00:06.180> just<00:00:07.180> this<00:00:07.360> idea<00:00:07.840> about

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
it's ten years ago just this idea about

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.299 
it's ten years ago just this idea about
talking<00:00:09.370> about<00:00:09.459> intelligence<00:00:10.499> but<00:00:11.499> I<00:00:11.530> was<00:00:12.160> not

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
talking about intelligence but I was not

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.549 
talking about intelligence but I was not
intelligent<00:00:12.940> enough<00:00:13.030> at<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.719> time<00:00:13.959> so<00:00:14.289> it

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
intelligent enough at the time so it

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.990 
intelligent enough at the time so it
takes<00:00:15.129> me<00:00:15.309> 10<00:00:15.549> years<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.800> write<00:00:18.160> just<00:00:18.850> one

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
takes me 10 years to write just one

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.350 
takes me 10 years to write just one

oblige<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.820> have<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> professor<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.960> film

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
oblige to have a professor in the film

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.830 
oblige to have a professor in the film
because<00:02:05.859> I<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.429> tell<00:02:06.700> what's<00:02:06.939> true<00:02:07.060> so

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
because I have to tell what's true so

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.610 
because I have to tell what's true so
everything<00:02:08.289> he<00:02:08.470> said<00:02:08.739> is<00:02:08.979> 90%<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:10.269> real<00:02:11.230> fact

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.460 
everything he said is 90% is real fact
and<00:02:12.129> that's<00:02:12.970> where<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.420> balance<00:02:13.840> became<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and that's where the balance became to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.259 
and that's where the balance became to
be<00:02:14.500> very<00:02:14.830> interesting<00:02:15.370> because<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:16.120> have

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
be very interesting because you you have

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.449 
be very interesting because you you have
her<00:02:16.690> which<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.650> purely<00:02:19.319> entertainment<00:02:20.459> she's

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
her which is purely entertainment she's

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.600 
her which is purely entertainment she's
it's<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.849> film<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.349> other<00:02:23.500> half<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.280> true

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
it's a film but the other half is true

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.600 
it's a film but the other half is true
and<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.319> know<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.890> mix<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.400> two

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
and it's you know if you mix the two

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.080 
and it's you know if you mix the two
half<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.080> mix<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.530> fast<00:02:30.400> enough

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
half if you mix the fast enough

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.940 
half if you mix the fast enough
you<00:02:31.690> still<00:02:32.019> know<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.379> don't<00:02:32.530> know<00:02:32.680> what's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
you still know you don't know what's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.009 
you still know you don't know what's
true<00:02:33.160> what's<00:02:33.220> not<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.510> need<00:02:34.840> this

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
true what's not and so I need this

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.949 
true what's not and so I need this
