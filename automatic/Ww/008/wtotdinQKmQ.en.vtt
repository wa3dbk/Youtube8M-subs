professional class which is the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.550 
professional class which is the
equivalent<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.820> recon<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.930> only<00:01:24.170> reason<00:01:24.470> I

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
equivalent to recon the only reason I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.700 
equivalent to recon the only reason I
really<00:01:24.860> stopped<00:01:25.190> reconning<00:01:26.180> or<00:01:26.479> sniping<00:01:27.440> in

frustrated because of the hit detection

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.370 
frustrated because of the hit detection
with<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.549> sniper<00:01:34.760> rifles<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.450> feel<00:01:35.840> they

how<00:02:17.540> they<00:02:17.720> took<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.200> textures<00:02:18.739> put<00:02:19.459> in

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
how they took the textures put in

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.670 
how they took the textures put in
different<00:02:19.819> character<00:02:20.450> models<00:02:20.870> and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
different character models and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.520 
different character models and
a<00:02:21.709> few<00:02:22.129> demos<00:02:22.609> I'm<00:02:23.329> not<00:02:23.510> trying<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.049> take<00:02:24.230> shots

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
a few demos I'm not trying to take shots

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.490 
a few demos I'm not trying to take shots
I<00:02:24.920> actually<00:02:25.219> liked<00:02:25.730> what<00:02:26.150> visceral<00:02:26.689> is<00:02:26.959> doing

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
I actually liked what visceral is doing

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.250 
I actually liked what visceral is doing
what<00:02:27.680> hard<00:02:27.890> line<00:02:28.159> but<00:02:28.939> it<00:02:29.299> depends<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.079> how

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
what hard line but it depends on how

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.800 
what hard line but it depends on how
much<00:02:30.439> content<00:02:30.769> this<00:02:31.250> game<00:02:31.519> brings<00:02:31.819> forth<00:02:32.269> to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
much content this game brings forth to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.110 
much content this game brings forth to
really<00:02:33.200> decide<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.250> worth<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.700> because

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
really decide is it worth it because

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.289 
really decide is it worth it because
battlefield<00:02:35.840> 4<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.680> already<00:02:37.189> a<00:02:37.489> great<00:02:37.849> game

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
battlefield 4 was already a great game

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.990 
battlefield 4 was already a great game
now<00:02:39.079> it<00:02:39.319> may<00:02:39.560> have<00:02:39.829> had<00:02:40.040> some<00:02:40.280> issues<00:02:40.700> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
now it may have had some issues and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.800 
now it may have had some issues and
still<00:02:41.420> does<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:42.079> it<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.219> improving<00:02:43.909> so<00:02:44.389> we

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
still does but it is improving so we

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.339 
still does but it is improving so we
really<00:02:45.049> have<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.349> see<00:02:45.680> how<00:02:46.340> far<00:02:46.639> Hartline

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
really have to see how far Hartline

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349 
really have to see how far Hartline
improves<00:02:48.349> on<00:02:48.709> what<00:02:49.010> battlefield<00:02:49.639> 4<00:02:49.969> already

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
improves on what battlefield 4 already

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.440 
improves on what battlefield 4 already
was<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.769> what<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.129> previous<00:02:52.639> battle<00:02:53.030> fields

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
was and what the previous battle fields

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.929 
was and what the previous battle fields
were<00:02:54.019> but<00:02:54.500> from<00:02:54.769> right<00:02:54.980> now<00:02:55.159> what<00:02:55.579> I<00:02:55.609> see<00:02:55.909> I

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
were but from right now what I see I

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.330 
were but from right now what I see I
think<00:02:56.419> the<00:02:56.750> game<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.230> actually<00:02:57.530> pretty

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
think the game is actually pretty

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.240 
think the game is actually pretty
awesome<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.269> has<00:02:59.599> some<00:02:59.989> great<00:03:00.260> features<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.859> I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
awesome it has some great features and I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.699 
awesome it has some great features and I
can't<00:03:01.579> wait<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:01.849> actually<00:03:02.329> play<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.470> full

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
can't wait to actually play the full

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.860 
can't wait to actually play the full
game<00:03:03.739> when<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> comes<00:03:04.669> out<00:03:04.970> because<00:03:05.629> I'm

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
game when it comes out because I'm

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.530 
game when it comes out because I'm
really<00:03:06.290> appreciating<00:03:07.219> how<00:03:07.549> this<00:03:07.969> Row<00:03:08.299> is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
really appreciating how this Row is

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.470 
really appreciating how this Row is
doing<00:03:09.319> their<00:03:09.500> map<00:03:09.709> design<00:03:09.950> now<00:03:10.819> we<00:03:10.879> only<00:03:11.359> have

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
doing their map design now we only have

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.709 
doing their map design now we only have
saw<00:03:11.930> one<00:03:12.500> map<00:03:12.799> from<00:03:13.579> battlefield<00:03:14.239> hardline

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
saw one map from battlefield hardline

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.220 
saw one map from battlefield hardline
but<00:03:15.500> i<00:03:15.799> really<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.549> high<00:03:17.239> tension<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.200> a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
but i really like high tension it is a

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.500 
but i really like high tension it is a
really<00:03:18.620> nice<00:03:18.859> map<00:03:19.219> and<00:03:19.549> i<00:03:19.609> hope<00:03:19.760> we<00:03:19.939> see<00:03:20.239> more

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
really nice map and i hope we see more

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.349 
really nice map and i hope we see more
maps<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.739> size<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.430> because<00:03:22.790> everything

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
maps the size of it because everything

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.589 
maps the size of it because everything
seems<00:03:23.719> to<00:03:23.810> fit<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.530> i<00:03:25.189> know<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.790> seems<00:03:26.479> like

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
seems to fit and i know it seems like

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.259 
seems to fit and i know it seems like
they<00:03:27.169> are<00:03:27.319> going<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.680> take<00:03:27.949> out<00:03:28.190> most<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
they are going to take out most of the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.319 
they are going to take out most of the
heavy<00:03:30.049> armored<00:03:30.799> vehicles<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.790> they<00:03:32.030> don't

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
heavy armored vehicles so they don't

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.170 
heavy armored vehicles so they don't
really<00:03:32.780> take<00:03:33.139> away<00:03:33.440> from<00:03:34.129> the<00:03:34.310> experience<00:03:34.340> of

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
really take away from the experience of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.379 
really take away from the experience of
infantry<00:03:36.049> combat<00:03:36.379> and<00:03:36.919> i<00:03:37.519> really<00:03:37.879> hope<00:03:38.120> this

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
infantry combat and i really hope this

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.530 
infantry combat and i really hope this
idea<00:03:38.840> carries<00:03:39.829> out<00:03:40.010> through<00:03:40.340> not<00:03:40.909> only<00:03:41.150> this

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
idea carries out through not only this

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.659 
idea carries out through not only this
battlefield<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.859> next<00:03:43.159> battle<00:03:43.370> field

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
after it because i always personally

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.429 
after it because i always personally
feel<00:03:46.400> like<00:03:46.669> there's<00:03:46.879> not<00:03:47.090> enough<00:03:47.569> infantry

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
feel like there's not enough infantry

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.679 
feel like there's not enough infantry
