hi so we're going to go into the day
into<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.820> naming<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.780> numbering<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
into the naming and numbering of the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.000 
into the naming and numbering of the
strings<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.100> guitar<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:12.860> this<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
strings of the guitar and this is

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.770 
strings of the guitar and this is
something<00:00:14.220> that's<00:00:14.580> great<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.300> just<00:00:15.480> get

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
something that's great to just get

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.450 
something that's great to just get
sorted<00:00:16.139> out<00:00:16.290> right<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> beginning<00:00:16.920> here

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
sorted out right at the beginning here

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.519 
sorted out right at the beginning here
all<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> way<00:00:18.540> through<00:00:18.779> these<00:00:18.930> lessons<00:00:19.170> we're

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
all the way through these lessons we're

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.810 
all the way through these lessons we're
going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.830> talking<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.580> first

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
going to be talking about the first

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
going to be talking about the first
string<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> second<00:00:21.660> string<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.020> D<00:00:22.050> string

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
string the second string the D string

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
string the second string the D string
the<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.770> string<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.550> these<00:00:23.759> things<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.720> we

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the a string and all these things and we

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.909 
the a string and all these things and we
want<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> make<00:00:25.800> sense<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.919> we

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
want that to make sense to you so we

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.609 
want that to make sense to you so we
just<00:00:29.099> listen<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:30.570> how<00:00:30.720> each<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.930> these<00:00:31.200> strings

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
just listen to how each of these strings

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.840 
just listen to how each of these strings
sounds<00:00:32.310> as<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.520> play<00:00:32.759> them

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.900 

ah

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.400 

you<00:00:42.910> can<00:00:43.090> hear<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.540> strings<00:00:43.810> get<00:00:44.080> higher

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
you can hear that the strings get higher

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.960 
you can hear that the strings get higher
as<00:00:44.770> I<00:00:44.890> move<00:00:45.070> across<00:00:45.250> them<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.440> reason

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
as I move across them for that reason

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.180 
as I move across them for that reason
this<00:00:48.970> string<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:50.080> highest<00:00:50.410> sounding<00:00:50.920> string

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
this string the highest sounding string

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.510 
this string the highest sounding string
is<00:00:51.550> called<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.060> top<00:00:52.360> string

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
is called the top string

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.820 
is called the top string
likewise<00:00:54.520> lowest<00:00:55.210> sounding<00:00:55.660> string<00:00:55.930> it's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
likewise lowest sounding string it's

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.850 
likewise lowest sounding string it's
called<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.250> bottom<00:00:57.580> string<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:59.800> there

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
called the bottom string right there

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.090 
called the bottom string right there
this<00:01:00.310> cause<00:01:00.910> for<00:01:01.180> confusion<00:01:01.360> because<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.830> top

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
this cause for confusion because the top

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.820 
this cause for confusion because the top
string<00:01:03.430> it's<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.000> one<00:01:04.150> at<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.360> bottom<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
string it's the one at the bottom the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.550 
string it's the one at the bottom the
bottom<00:01:06.010> string<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.970> one<00:01:07.120> at<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.300> top<00:01:07.560> as

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
bottom string is the one at the top as

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.960 
bottom string is the one at the top as
long<00:01:08.620> as<00:01:08.980> you<00:01:09.040> remember<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.550> they're<00:01:09.700> called

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
long as you remember that they're called

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.000 
long as you remember that they're called
that<00:01:10.180> way<00:01:10.360> because<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:10.810> how<00:01:10.930> they<00:01:11.080> sound<00:01:11.410> not

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
that way because of how they sound not

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.010 
that way because of how they sound not
by<00:01:12.190> how<00:01:12.369> how<00:01:13.150> they're<00:01:13.420> arranged<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:13.990> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
by how how they're arranged on the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.680 
by how how they're arranged on the
guitar<00:01:15.390> okay<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:18.760> can<00:01:18.940> come<00:01:19.150> on<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.479> how<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
guitar okay so we can come on to how the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.469 
guitar okay so we can come on to how the
strings<00:01:20.140> are<00:01:20.320> numbered<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.460> again<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:22.270> is

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
strings are numbered and again this is

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.660 
strings are numbered and again this is
somewhat<00:01:22.750> counterintuitive<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.369> string

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
somewhat counterintuitive the string

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.450 
somewhat counterintuitive the string
that's<00:01:24.880> furthest<00:01:25.390> away<00:01:26.190> it's<00:01:27.190> called<00:01:27.369> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
that's furthest away it's called the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.300 
that's furthest away it's called the
first<00:01:27.760> string<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:29.350> we<00:01:29.470> go<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.890> second

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
first string then we go to the second

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.130 
first string then we go to the second
string<00:01:30.670> third<00:01:31.479> string<00:01:32.580> Boston<00:01:33.660> fifth<00:01:34.660> string

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
string third string Boston fifth string

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.120 
string third string Boston fifth string
and<00:01:35.410> six<00:01:36.310> string<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.470> there<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:38.680> go

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
and six string so there we go

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.830 
and six string so there we go
string<00:01:39.580> one<00:01:39.940> two<00:01:40.420> three<00:01:40.990> four<00:01:41.500> five<00:01:41.950> six<00:01:42.840> first

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
string one two three four five six first

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.139 
string one two three four five six first
string<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.350> top<00:01:44.619> string<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.340> sixth<00:01:45.789> string<00:01:46.000> is

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
string is top string the sixth string is

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.900 
string is top string the sixth string is
the<00:01:46.270> bottom<00:01:46.600> string<00:01:50.190> in<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.310> later<00:01:51.580> lesson

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
the bottom string in a later lesson

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.480 
the bottom string in a later lesson
we'll<00:01:52.660> show<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:52.929> how<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.320> tune<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.979> guitar<00:01:54.009> to

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
we'll show you how to tune the guitar to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.050 
we'll show you how to tune the guitar to
standard<00:01:54.940> tuning<00:01:56.160> once<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:57.340> guitar<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.729> tuned

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
standard tuning once the guitar is tuned

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.809 
standard tuning once the guitar is tuned
we'll<00:01:58.899> get<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.110> specific<00:01:59.410> note<00:02:00.130> out<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.460> each

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
we'll get a specific note out of each

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.010 
we'll get a specific note out of each
open<00:02:01.360> string<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:03.130> if<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.340> open<00:02:03.580> string<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.539> mean

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
open string now if I open string I mean

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.230 
open string now if I open string I mean
the<00:02:05.110> string<00:02:05.380> that's<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:05.830> played<00:02:06.240> without

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the string that's just played without

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.270 
the string that's just played without
having<00:02:07.899> your<00:02:07.990> left<00:02:08.170> hand<00:02:08.410> on<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.740> guitar<00:02:08.830> so

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
having your left hand on the guitar so

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.630 
having your left hand on the guitar so
it's<00:02:09.399> not<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.640> threat<00:02:10.000> it's<00:02:10.060> string<00:02:10.750> with

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it's not a threat it's string with

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.400 
it's not a threat it's string with
changing<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.670> pitch<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.870> note<00:02:13.900> where

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
changing the pitch of the note where

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.930 
changing the pitch of the note where
left<00:02:14.620> hand<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.250> played<00:02:15.880> open<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:17.290> that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
left hand is just played open like that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.590 
left hand is just played open like that
I'll<00:02:18.940> want<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.900> tune<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:22.000> notes<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.480> we
