00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.810
 what's up and welcome to 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.840
 a new top five today with the theme 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.760
 the most annoying things the roleplay 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.220
 at least annoying things always me 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.260
 disturb and but I throw Japanese and 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.570
 Western role-playing games in a pot 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.070
 and rated both of them right there 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.200
 you really do not have to pay attention 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.239
 and of course that's not very much 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.330
 very very subjective and not quite 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.340
 serious top 5 but I think 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.540
 she is very interesting in this sense 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.540
 now comes fifth place 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 Of course that only comes naturally 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.640
 Western role-playing and I am 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.230
 such a one if I'm a western one 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 I can start my roleplaying 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.140
 character design 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 then I really do that sometimes 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.580
 Minutes ago and makes my face 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.800
 and distances eyes the nose tip must 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 have perfect proportions to the ears 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.119
 And the hairstyle is not important 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.800
 quite black what it know too dark 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.840
 but a bit grayer bit 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.670
 wiser looks and the beard must be cool 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.040
 look best fat really 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.780
 full davids know breaks bearded 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.460
 looks and then ten minutes in the game 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.479
 Christians are quick to help and they 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.700
 your face is not anymore 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.990
 you just did not see character anymore 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.399
 look not as an aha you see 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.800
 be yourself and how more 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.910
 his beard and that over the entire 70 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.430
 hours of playtime 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.500
 you have about five or six or ten 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 For a few minutes your character of the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.789
 Designs always make me so much 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.789
 So it still makes fun 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.729
 course four comes in many 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.460
 playing video games before but playing role games 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.350
 Of course that is often too common 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.729
 the case 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.710
 tutorial hundred thousand text boxes 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.299
 somewhere a text somehow 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.500
 mini game that I would start it 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.330
 is again a text to me 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.640
 explain how the mirror game goes because 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.840
 Anyone do not know who the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.549
 I lead with people there comes 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.680
 any lyrics I have to go everywhere 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:22.209
 read do not get diary there 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.769
 I must 500,000 books may superiors 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.569
 I read all it is easy 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.799
 sometimes too much, I do not have any teams 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.750
 I also do not mind if 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.069
 you explain something to me and in short 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.930
 a little bit ahead 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.790
 provided where I have to read something but 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.220
 sometimes the role plays are included 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.049
 then it goes off so I'm only there 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.549
 read the stop is me and the 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.790
 full flow, I'm really not 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.790
 bock on it 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.310
 if a game forces me to 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.050
 grab there I could half freak out 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.820
 I'm somebody I'm not fighting 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.410
 out of the way I fight against against 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.210
 opponent i know every experience 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.740
 is somehow helpful for the later 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.690
 gameplay but sometime my game 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.150
 Build the developers and what passages 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.410
 the ones that are impossible are the ones that are difficult 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.820
 there you have to bite through 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.530
 then you just have to be well prepared 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.410
 be or you go riding 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.910
 yes and rookies are in the absolute 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.650
 dull order and you go 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.840
 Broad against the most boring opponents 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.690
 where you do it over and over and over 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.860
 over and over again and what does it bring you? 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.030
 that you get stronger and thus further 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.750
 people would have been crazy I have none 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.370
 Time 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.630
 shall I have the last evening with it now 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.070
 spend because I'm out of work 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.270
 that I still exist 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.180
 so I can continue playing tomorrow 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.940
 or what is forgotten and just as colors 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.230
 or something like that is the same for me 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.230
 terrible 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.959
 that is only very subjective 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.330
 opinion and I know that many people 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.940
 like of you playing as knights of 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.120
 the old republic or like diablo or 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.799
 many apps or for example dragon 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.690
 age 1 and i like the fighting system 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.370
 Not at all I do not like it 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.919
 when I see an adversary 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.990
 stock yes that was twice as good at performance 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.300
 stop and now you can choose what 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.710
 you with your fellows and who goes up 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.110
 which opponents it you give a 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.970
 fireball data and you run there and 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.100
 pushed something out of his pocket 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.199
 then the opponent is not nee that's too 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.389
 boring and then you press on the 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.220
 command and comes in and if you have yours 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.440
 fig starts to beat and you look 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.240
 while as the rum and klopp 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.990
 someday the oboist might be 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.330
 getting dangerous 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.010
 I take a healing potion of cabbage 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.360
 of course there is a lot of tactics with that 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.530
 but for me it's easy too 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.630
 boring I've got a real 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.199
 huge problem with and likes that way 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.960
 can use systems like diarrho scrolls 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.030
 or as with gothic or must or the 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.220
 or something I just find a lot 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.080
 more exciting and I am rather middle 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.849
 in the game 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.860
 I do not like to dry in any dust 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.070
 fighting system and when he comes to omas 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:21.160
 block c-5 hp subtracted and here again 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.160
 Sorry that just poisoned too much 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.810
 place number one undisputed place 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.060
 number one and I'm glad that 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.570
 we are slowly redeemed from this plague 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.060
 become 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.280
 of course random counters 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.140
 mainly in Japanese role-playing games 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.910
 but I always hated her you are 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.070
 cards in a dungeon in the 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.260
 cave system must solve the first puzzle 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.240
 and which statues move element 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.560
 counter and you that will be permanent 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.630
 how to set the nose and then 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.970
 sometimes so bad that there is there 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.430
 where are you really long long long 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.990
 this known standard pug somehow 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.670
 fight and that partly because you 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.200
 still working really hard and you 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.120
 you always have to fight against them 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.740
 Now you solve two meters and you think 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.230
 gard still after the discovery to the 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.880
 fight and then sometimes you want too 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.380
 still flee the fight and that 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.690
 flying does not work you know that 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.830
 probably extra boxer fight I flee 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.930
 because I, for example, a 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.580
 one of my companions is dead if that 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.470
 that does not fly and then attack me 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.870
 the second time on the bald and me 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.820
 I think hey that does not work that is 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.440
 the worst thing is renault with hate 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.880
 is really the worst a roleplay 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.200
 that's ever been invented I am 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.310
 so glad it is now the 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.990
 Japanese role play is that you 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.910
 the opponents see and to decide 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.900
 I can go into the fight I 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.670
 Raven past me can counters me 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.980
 sometimes crosswise 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.870
 yes, that was the top 5 with the 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.360
 the topic of things is role play 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.430
 extremely annoying and I think that 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.260
 Some of you have ever played the RPG 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.850
 Also have a case where they have 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.540
 say that can not do that I can 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.890
 do not like it 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.169
 He writes his comments I am 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.540
 curious what you can say and 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:13.880
 say that with you until next time 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.880
 ten new top 5 or top level
