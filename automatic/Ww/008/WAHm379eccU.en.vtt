00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.139
 to the girls to the girls who are with 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.490
 blankets we are back in crash and something 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.860
 more talk about one of the most blocks 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.049
 undervalued the game the close tom 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.460
 let's talk about their properties and for 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.279
 what is so important when it comes to 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.410
 build circuits of rest but before 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.220
 say that today's video is complete 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.840
 and absolutely copied from a video of 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.609
 cuba hamster according to the 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.500
 description you have a link to your video 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.870
 I recommend you see it because they are 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.790
 very funny but for people who do not 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.339
 it has the dominion of the English hunger then 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.909
 decided to copy them we will copy the 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.229
 things so I hope you like it 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.140
 The first thing you have to know about 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:47.119
 tom close is that it is a block that is 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.159
 halfway between the solid blocks and 

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.659
 the transparent blocks has 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.159
 properties of transparent blocks 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.320
 but also has properties of 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.790
 the solid blocks that gives you certain 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.379
 advantage the first of which we can 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.330
 see here is that despite being medium 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.360
 transparent we can place for the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.159
 rest on top of it and what happens with this 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.189
 door let's see the peculiarity 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.579
 that has the first peculiarity is that 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.719
 you can upload current as always 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.719
 through a block of the globe 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.340
 you can not get off the current 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.899
 but it does not go down 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.670
 but razor that more the club the block of 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.670
 close ton allows another property and is 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.109
 that can not cut a subtraction signal 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.750
 agree if you have a signal from 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.579
 rest and send it up and put a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.100
 block in between will behave like a 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.659
 slot of agreement behaves like medium 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.329
 block as if this were a slow and 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.979
 allows the current to pass that allows 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.530
 this behavior because it allows things 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.060
 like this we are able to climb 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.060
 reston in vertical 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.770
 without any need to 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.009
 weird things in agreement 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.509
 that more properties the next the 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.369
 globe are have a behavior of 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.229
 transparent block at the time of 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.080
 interact with nearby objects is 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.599
 say I can activate this stream 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.220
 of the rest and not interact with the 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.110
 objects that are on the side if this instead 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.000
 of close ton off other material this is 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.400
 would extend secretary this would launch in 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.870
 end etcetera agree more 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.370
 curious behaviors 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.440
 you have problems with bass switch put 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.269
 in the solution a own the crow are 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.680
 as we said there does not interact with 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.750
 that way so I will not have this 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.890
 problem of this kind of problems already 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.510
 are you doing a circuit have 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.489
 These globe glitches are from 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.489
 the solutions more behaviors 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.819
 curious you need to divide a stream 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.170
 of the rest or rather bifurcates the 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.610
 two roads one up and towards 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.360
 back and leisure or I do not get the word and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.480
 another down 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.400
 the cloister in the solution 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.959
 can go up but as already 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.930
 we said before does not cut the current 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.960
 and lower down more curiosities of 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.940
 the close tone the next 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.640
 you can put it on top of a torch 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.410
 of the rest and is not activated according to the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.770
 pool you have left over has not been 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.120
 activated this also serves to avoid 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.970
 these curious behaviors of the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.380
 torches that are the following if I 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.630
 I'm in charge is then at my charge are 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.990
 cakes 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.890
 and here little to see and by bt as well as 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.710
 many of you know if I place here it melts 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.790
 but if I do it here it does not happen so 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.459
 with all these curious properties 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.659
 I believe that the moment we make a 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.060
 little bit more of this block's case 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.500
 curious and we use it our 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.239
 circuits because it can help us more than 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.560
 once we have had rock we have not 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.299
 had to break his head doing the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.280
 circuit and if we had done at hands 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.950
 of this block if I would have been 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.659
 more easier so nothing a very video 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.670
 cortito is very brief but I hope that 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.760
 have liked in the following video up 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.760
 then
