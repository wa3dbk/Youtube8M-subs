predict a Hurricanes intensity is
vitally<00:00:54.750> important<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.239> to

vitally important you really do have to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
vitally important you really do have to
know<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.840> intensity<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> hurricane

know the intensity of the hurricane

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
know the intensity of the hurricane

because the evacuation plans are based

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
because the evacuation plans are based
on<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.280> where<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> hurricane<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.149> going

and<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.019> can<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> system<00:02:25.920> actually

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
and you can see that the system actually

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.220 
and you can see that the system actually
becomes<00:02:26.609> enveloped<00:02:27.420> by<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.660> Saharan<00:02:28.139> air

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
becomes enveloped by the Saharan air

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.509 
becomes enveloped by the Saharan air
layer<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.889> could<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.220> one<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
layer and this could be one of the

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.430 
layer and this could be one of the
reasons<00:02:29.670> why<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.060> system<00:02:30.450> struggled<00:02:31.109> early

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
reasons why this system struggled early

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
reasons why this system struggled early
on<00:02:31.579> but<00:02:32.579> later<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> time<00:02:33.269> period<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.630> can

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
on but later in the time period you can

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080 
on but later in the time period you can
see<00:02:34.049> Aaron<00:02:35.010> pops<00:02:35.310> out<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.639> Saharan<00:02:36.000> air

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
see Aaron pops out of the Saharan air

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.150 
see Aaron pops out of the Saharan air
layer<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.569> rapidly<00:02:37.019> intensifies<00:02:37.709> into<00:02:38.130> a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
layer and rapidly intensifies into a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.729 
layer and rapidly intensifies into a
major<00:02:38.430> hurricane<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.900> next<00:02:40.230> step<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.620> for

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
major hurricane the next step is for

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.470 
major hurricane the next step is for
