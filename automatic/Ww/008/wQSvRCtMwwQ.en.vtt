Madonna<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.230> leading<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.460> 57<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> 43

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
Madonna is leading like I think 57 to 43

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
Madonna is leading like I think 57 to 43
percent<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.770> something<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
percent of something like that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.479 
percent of something like that
I<00:00:53.760> can't<00:00:54.660> believe<00:00:54.930> Khan<00:00:55.199> down<00:00:55.440> 43%<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I can't believe Khan down 43% of the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.150 
I can't believe Khan down 43% of the
votes<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:58.079> first<00:00:58.109> place<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.800> think<00:00:59.039> they

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
votes in the first place I think they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
votes in the first place I think they
need<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.399> retaliate<00:01:00.469> but<00:01:02.480> Khan<00:01:03.480> was<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.960> hi

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
need to retaliate but Khan was all hi

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.910 
need to retaliate but Khan was all hi
and<00:01:05.360> he<00:01:06.360> put<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> message<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.470> saw<00:01:07.710> on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

and he put the message that you saw on
the<00:01:07.950> board<00:01:08.689> but<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> read<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> y'all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.940 
the board but I want to read it to y'all
anyway<00:01:11.250> he<00:01:11.939> says<00:01:12.180> Mayweather<00:01:12.750> says<00:01:13.530> he<00:01:13.770> needs

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
anyway he says Mayweather says he needs

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700 
anyway he says Mayweather says he needs
an<00:01:14.189> easy<00:01:14.400> fight<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.090> fans<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.859 
an easy fight and fans want to see a
knockout<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.580> maybe<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> reason<00:01:18.540> he
