00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 and we all this time our evenings 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.210
 you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.079
 there are wires 1 to 5 . 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.200
 so we drive around constantly means 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.429
 not more than three thousand of his birth 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.429
 we will try the house 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.450
 good fifth gear allows us 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.070
 drive well enough fast for these 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.070
 turns 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.120
 but I really like the suspension here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.120
 cars rulitsya perfect 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.900
 it didn't work but it doesn't 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.960
 May 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.740
 Pay attention to the following two engine 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.740
 Here for example I put 4 transfer 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.370
 old all twist there you 4003 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.390
 night a mess of the car and felt the moment on 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390
 bottoms 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.510
 and here we have big tits practical 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.510
 90 degrees fit 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.489
 the emperor 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.489
 and we will stop a little to cool 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.930
 so for now it means we're here 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.240
 naturally after a long or long 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.860
 you can't drive anyway 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.710
 here so stands on the track on the psyche 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.450
 nettle while summer is nice to run in it 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.690
 not winter for winter probably so vinaigrette 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.650
 main on problems than powerful motor 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.150
 19 is actually very serious volume and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.310
 cooling system remains standard 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.440
 even for example if you take his nevi there 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.500
 small horses and small and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.520
 smaller volume then there is more radiator 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.650
 year naturally even the system 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.600
 fans are arranged differently and we 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.190
 try not to overheat the motor but how 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.140
 this i really try not 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.340
 interrupt mopar don't bring the temperature 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.420
 above 90 degrees and therefore so 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.290
 have to stand for minutes 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.690
 fifteen to twenty 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.730
 even on the highway sometimes 91 and 92 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.580
 rises here but the regular system 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.590
 cooling fails that's why 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.290
 Now we will think something to do and 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.600
 so already thermostats transferred to large 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.400
 a circle that is fixed on a large 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.770
 circle that is even theoretically in winter 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.270
 the car will warm up for a long time but now it's 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.510
 it helps that is, but now everything is 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.250
 a large circle immediately and well, that's the principle and 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.530
 motor with a standard mean nothing here 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.080
 there is no such problem at the moment 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.260
 passed three hundred kilometers running problems 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.810
 No, I mean, I do not eat butter 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.000
 coolant does not go all 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.890
 fine but so on 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.549
 naturally it will be useful to us now 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.489
 we will improve the cooling system 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.420
 We will now see what we are 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.640
 searched 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.330
 we mean here 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.660
 winter racing I'm here a 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.360
 pushed one viburnum well caught up with her in the circle 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.840
 and pushed me this mini punch here 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.950
 this problem has remained naturally now 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.040
 tackled a little we straightened out 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.320
 We take out the old fan enough 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.920
 small blades 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.400
 his principle throw out and so it means 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.510
 Naturally there will be a problem in the top ten 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.310
 insert these fans into this thing 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.940
 we can not cut, we just removed the radiator 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.180
 at first 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:55.690
 then put these means fans 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:57.700
 below we will fix everything now 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.230
 these fans fix defects 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.610
 body repair 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:06.130
 so that we all got up 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.600
 just unrealistically clamped by the way then 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.370
 this is nothing like a wheelbarrow in 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.070
 The original bits are not beautiful I am without 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.870
 problems can sell but the truth and so 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.620
 mean first and 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.400
 first connects the fan 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.400
 standard connector that is 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.860
 the second we connect separately from the button and 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.170
 so all means to demonstrate 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.760
 the final work of the fans then 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:41.860
 have we start the engine and we 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:48.289
 automatically starts working well 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:52.180
 I found the ignition 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.180
 Now we have 1 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.030
 sometimes i was on this button 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.050
 here and now we theoretically should 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.050
 earn two at once 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.289
 notice how smoothly it works 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.020
 engine as standard 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:23.080
 in general, that's all 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.000
 and then I will run in then we set 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.700
 sports Volyn 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.080
 nozzle receiver 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.080
 and we will be building
