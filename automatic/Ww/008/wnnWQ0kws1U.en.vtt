hello school on real agriculture comm is

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.850 
hello school on real agriculture comm is
brought<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.010> by<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.410> first<00:00:31.650> thing

brought to you by so the first thing

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.770 
brought to you by so the first thing
roars<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.910> when<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.210> start<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
roars want to do when they start to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
roars want to do when they start to
determine<00:00:34.260> their<00:00:34.410> time<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.070> swathing<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
determine their time is swathing is to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
determine their time is swathing is to
get<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.290> opening<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
get out there and start opening up the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.640 
get out there and start opening up the
pods<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:39.300> really<00:00:39.600> important<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.170> open<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
pods it's really important to open the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.270 
pods it's really important to open the
pods<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.580> pod<00:00:41.880> color<00:00:43.130> can<00:00:44.130> be

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
pods because the pod color can be

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
pods because the pod color can be
different<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> seed<00:00:45.300> color<00:00:45.690> change<00:00:46.080> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
different from the seed color change and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.950 
different from the seed color change and
the<00:00:47.040> seed<00:00:47.309> color<00:00:47.580> changes<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.210> what's<00:00:48.570> really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the seed color changes was what's really

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.070 
the seed color changes was what's really
important<00:00:49.640> there<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:51.089> varieties<00:00:51.900> or

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
important there are varieties or

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.840 
important there are varieties or
situations<00:00:52.710> where<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> pod<00:00:53.220> can<00:00:53.489> still<00:00:53.730> be

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
situations where the pod can still be

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.020 
situations where the pod can still be
green<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.230> seeds<00:00:55.530> inside<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.339> all

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
green and the seeds inside will be all

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.540 
green and the seeds inside will be all
black<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.660> brown<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.129> completely<00:00:59.129> changed

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
black or brown and completely changed

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.689 
black or brown and completely changed
color<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.930> also<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.470> other<00:01:01.699> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
color and there's also the other the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.780 
color and there's also the other the
other<00:01:02.820> end<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> where<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> pods<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:04.080> be

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
other end of that where the pods can be

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.570 
other end of that where the pods can be
turned<00:01:05.790> yellowish<00:01:06.510> either<00:01:07.290> from<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
turned yellowish either from from the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.500 
turned yellowish either from from the
Sun<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.370> or<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.640> conditions<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
Sun or you know or just conditions and

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
Sun or you know or just conditions and
the<00:01:12.570> seed<00:01:12.750> inside<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.320> still<00:01:13.620> be<00:01:13.740> green<00:01:13.950> so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the seed inside will still be green so

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
the seed inside will still be green so
it's<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.120> important<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.870> be<00:01:15.990> opening<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it's very important to be opening up the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.680 
it's very important to be opening up the
pods<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.340> assess<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> seed<00:01:18.030> color<00:01:18.330> change

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
pods to assess the seed color change

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.530 
pods to assess the seed color change
first<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.970> start<00:01:21.240> assessing

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
first of all so when we start assessing

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780 
first of all so when we start assessing
seed<00:01:21.960> color<00:01:22.170> change<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.070> first<00:01:23.310> thing<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> do

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
seed color change the first thing to do

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.790 
seed color change the first thing to do
is<00:01:23.940> find<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> main<00:01:24.540> stem<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.500> you're<00:01:25.620> going<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
is find the main stem so you're going to

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.310 
is find the main stem so you're going to
grab<00:01:25.980> your<00:01:26.250> plant<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.420> start<00:01:27.870> pulling<00:01:28.290> down

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
grab your plant you start pulling down

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.830 
grab your plant you start pulling down
the<00:01:28.890> side<00:01:29.160> branches<00:01:31.130> like<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.760> we<00:01:33.240> come<00:01:33.480> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the side branches like so and we come to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
the side branches like so and we come to
the<00:01:34.050> main<00:01:34.200> stem<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.160> this<00:01:35.370> is<00:01:35.520> where<00:01:35.670> we're

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the main stem so this is where we're

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
the main stem so this is where we're
gonna<00:01:35.850> set<00:01:36.240> seed<00:01:36.540> color<00:01:36.810> change<00:01:37.110> now

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
gonna set seed color change now

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
gonna set seed color change now
obviously<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.550> time<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> year<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.360> we're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
obviously at this time of year the we're

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.930 
obviously at this time of year the we're
not<00:01:40.320> gonna<00:01:40.500> seed<00:01:40.770> seed<00:01:41.040> color<00:01:41.370> change<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
not gonna seed seed color change at this

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.120 
not gonna seed seed color change at this
point<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:42.990> gonna<00:01:43.080> start<00:01:43.440> opening<00:01:43.980> up

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
point but we're gonna start opening up

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.300 
point but we're gonna start opening up
pods<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:45.000> looking<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.100> there

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
pods and looking to see see what there

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.890 
pods and looking to see see what there
is<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:50.070> 60%<00:01:50.640> seed<00:01:51.270> color<00:01:51.540> change

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
is there so with 60% seed color change

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.940 
is there so with 60% seed color change
this<00:01:52.740> bottom<00:01:53.280> third<00:01:53.640> will<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.950> completely

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this bottom third will be completely

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130 
this bottom third will be completely
turned<00:01:56.160> color<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.360> middle<00:01:57.630> third<00:01:57.870> will<00:01:58.110> be

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
turned color the middle third will be

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.700 
turned color the middle third will be
spotty<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.480> top<00:02:00.990> third<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.470> still

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
spotty and then the top third will still

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.310 
spotty and then the top third will still
be<00:02:01.830> green<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.760> when<00:02:02.970> it's<00:02:03.150> green<00:02:03.510> you<00:02:03.540> want<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
be green but when it's green you want it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.170 
be green but when it's green you want it
to<00:02:04.470> be<00:02:04.590> firm<00:02:05.010> when<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.370> roll<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.790> between<00:02:05.970> your

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
to be firm when you roll it between your

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.660 
to be firm when you roll it between your
fingers<00:02:06.660> if<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.470> mushy<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.039> watery<00:02:08.399> any

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
fingers if it's mushy and watery any

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.279 
fingers if it's mushy and watery any
seed<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> blow<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
seed like that is going to blow out the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.750 
seed like that is going to blow out the
back<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.619> combine<00:02:11.069> you'll<00:02:11.250> lose<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
back of the combine you'll lose that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.949 
back of the combine you'll lose that
that<00:02:12.180> yield<00:02:12.450> there

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.520 

another<00:02:15.349> thing<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.950> want<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.489> point<00:02:16.700> out<00:02:16.939> is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
another thing I want to point out is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.160 
another thing I want to point out is
your<00:02:18.530> plant<00:02:18.829> population<00:02:19.730> comes<00:02:20.599> into<00:02:20.959> play

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
your plant population comes into play

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.869 
your plant population comes into play
with<00:02:21.530> your<00:02:21.769> time<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.040> swathing<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
with your time of swathing and the

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.880 
with your time of swathing and the
maturity<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.359> your<00:02:23.480> field<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.500> if<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.739> have<00:02:24.859> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
maturity of your field so if you have a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.190 
maturity of your field so if you have a
good<00:02:25.159> plant<00:02:25.519> stand<00:02:25.879> of<00:02:26.120> about<00:02:26.359> that<00:02:26.569> seven<00:02:27.109> to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
good plant stand of about that seven to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.740 
good plant stand of about that seven to
ten<00:02:27.409> plants<00:02:27.859> per<00:02:27.980> square<00:02:28.010> foot<00:02:28.689> you're<00:02:29.689> gonna

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
ten plants per square foot you're gonna

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.839 
ten plants per square foot you're gonna
have<00:02:29.959> even<00:02:30.140> maturity<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.430> going<00:02:31.639> to<00:02:31.700> be<00:02:31.819> a

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
have even maturity it's going to be a

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.819 
have even maturity it's going to be a
lot<00:02:32.090> easier<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.659> find<00:02:32.840> your<00:02:33.049> main<00:02:33.230> stem<00:02:33.560> like

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
lot easier to find your main stem like

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.479 
lot easier to find your main stem like
this<00:02:33.859> guy<00:02:34.310> here<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:36.129> overall<00:02:37.129> time<00:02:37.370> of

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
this guy here and overall time of

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.709 
this guy here and overall time of
swapping<00:02:37.879> is<00:02:37.969> going<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.150> be<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.239> lot<00:02:38.389> easier<00:02:38.689> for

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
swapping is going to be a lot easier for

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:45.300 
swapping is going to be a lot easier for
you<00:02:39.879> if<00:02:40.879> you<00:02:41.090> have<00:02:42.069> lower<00:02:43.069> plant<00:02:43.519> populations

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
you if you have lower plant populations

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.339 
you if you have lower plant populations
your<00:02:46.310> plants<00:02:46.730> get<00:02:46.909> a<00:02:47.120> lot<00:02:47.419> more<00:02:47.450> branchy<00:02:48.169> like

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
your plants get a lot more branchy like

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.309 
your plants get a lot more branchy like
this<00:02:48.620> guy<00:02:48.859> here<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:50.870> see<00:02:50.930> it's

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
this guy here and as you can see it's

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.099 
this guy here and as you can see it's
it's<00:02:51.859> a<00:02:52.040> lot<00:02:52.250> harder<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:53.090> find<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.540> main<00:02:53.720> stem

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
it's a lot harder to find the main stem

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.069 
it's a lot harder to find the main stem
I<00:02:54.439> mean<00:02:55.239> which<00:02:56.239> there's<00:02:56.750> all<00:02:56.900> these<00:02:57.019> different

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
I mean which there's all these different

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.170 
I mean which there's all these different
branches<00:02:57.889> we're<00:02:58.069> trying<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.430> figure<00:02:58.669> out<00:02:58.819> okay

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
branches we're trying to figure out okay

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.559 
branches we're trying to figure out okay
which<00:02:59.329> one<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.719> it<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.439> it<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.909> one<00:03:02.209> here

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
which one is it and it this one here

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.990 
which one is it and it this one here
even<00:03:03.500> if<00:03:03.769> we<00:03:03.919> figure<00:03:04.219> which<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.609> one<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.909> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
even if we figure which it one is the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.140 
even if we figure which it one is the
main<00:03:05.150> stem<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.040> plant<00:03:07.310> might<00:03:07.579> be<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.909> big

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
main stem the the plant might be so big

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.699 
main stem the the plant might be so big
that<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.719> main<00:03:08.870> stem<00:03:09.169> isn't<00:03:09.439> going<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.620> be

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
that the main stem isn't going to be

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.159 
that the main stem isn't going to be
representative<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.180> plant<00:03:11.450> any<00:03:11.780> longer

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
representative of the plant any longer

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.830 
representative of the plant any longer
so<00:03:12.859> at<00:03:13.129> that<00:03:13.370> point<00:03:13.760> you're<00:03:14.150> gonna<00:03:14.329> have<00:03:14.450> to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
so at that point you're gonna have to

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.979 
so at that point you're gonna have to
assess<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.469> whole<00:03:15.739> plant<00:03:16.209> open<00:03:17.209> up<00:03:17.329> pods<00:03:17.629> all

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
assess the whole plant open up pods all

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.990 
assess the whole plant open up pods all
over<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.560> see<00:03:18.769> what<00:03:18.919> seed<00:03:19.190> color<00:03:19.430> changes

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
over to see what seed color changes

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.819 
over to see what seed color changes
you're<00:03:20.659> gonna<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.109> figure<00:03:21.319> out<00:03:21.470> where

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
you're gonna have to figure out where

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.939 
you're gonna have to figure out where
the<00:03:22.069> majority<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.549> your<00:03:22.699> yields<00:03:23.090> coming<00:03:23.479> from

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
the majority of your yields coming from

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.729 
the majority of your yields coming from
and<00:03:24.949> when<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.519> can<00:03:26.329> get<00:03:26.510> into<00:03:26.810> swath<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.409> it

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
and when you can get into swath so it

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.530 
and when you can get into swath so it
just<00:03:27.979> timing<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.549> swath<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:28.909> becomes<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:29.510> much

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
just timing of swath and becomes so much

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.860 
just timing of swath and becomes so much
harder<00:03:30.049> if<00:03:30.199> you<00:03:30.799> don't<00:03:31.099> have<00:03:31.370> an<00:03:32.150> ideal<00:03:32.479> plant

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
harder if you don't have an ideal plant

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:41.080 
harder if you don't have an ideal plant
population<00:03:33.650> so

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.080 

so<00:03:42.090> if<00:03:42.750> your<00:03:43.370> swathing<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.580> hot<00:03:44.819> dry

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
so if your swathing in the hot dry

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.680 
so if your swathing in the hot dry
weather<00:03:46.280> you're<00:03:47.280> at<00:03:47.459> risk<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:48.030> locking<00:03:48.420> in

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
weather you're at risk for locking in

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.040 
weather you're at risk for locking in
your<00:03:48.840> green<00:03:49.080> count<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:50.640> enzyme<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.120> that

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
your green count the enzyme that that

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.290 
your green count the enzyme that that
clears<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.830> green<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.400> seed<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.940> needs

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
clears the green and the seed it needs

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.369 
clears the green and the seed it needs
moisture<00:03:55.099> to<00:03:56.099> be<00:03:56.220> activated<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.379> that's

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
moisture to be activated so that's

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.490 
moisture to be activated so that's
that's<00:03:58.980> why<00:03:59.220> it's<00:03:59.430> important<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.959> not<00:04:01.110> swap

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
that's why it's important to to not swap

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.780 
that's why it's important to to not swap
in<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.799> heat<00:04:01.980> because<00:04:02.280> there's<00:04:02.459> not<00:04:02.610> going<00:04:02.670> to

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
in the heat because there's not going to

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.660 
in the heat because there's not going to
be<00:04:02.849> as<00:04:02.970> much<00:04:03.120> moisture<00:04:04.160> in<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.280> plant<00:04:05.519> and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
be as much moisture in the plant and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.070 
be as much moisture in the plant and
whatnot

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
whatnot

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.449 
whatnot
the<00:04:07.349> other<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:08.430> other<00:04:08.459> thing<00:04:08.849> too<00:04:09.150> is

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the other the other thing too is

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.460 
the other the other thing too is
swapping<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.670> heats<00:04:11.940> there's<00:04:12.330> also<00:04:12.540> more

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
swapping in the heats there's also more

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.250 
swapping in the heats there's also more
risk<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:14.099> shattering<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.269> it's<00:04:15.780> dry

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
risk of shattering because it's it's dry

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.340 
risk of shattering because it's it's dry
and<00:04:16.530> brittle<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:18.090> want<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.450> swathe<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
and brittle you want to swathe in the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.650 
and brittle you want to swathe in the
evening<00:04:19.739> or<00:04:19.919> earlier<00:04:20.250> morning<00:04:20.760> when<00:04:21.479> it's

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
evening or earlier morning when it's

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.140 
evening or earlier morning when it's
when<00:04:22.049> it's<00:04:22.200> cool<00:04:22.530> out<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.190> that's<00:04:23.340> important

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
when it's cool out so that's important

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.920 
when it's cool out so that's important
to<00:04:24.180> remember<00:04:24.600> them

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.930 

so<00:04:30.650> when<00:04:30.800> you're<00:04:30.949> assessing<00:04:31.250> seed<00:04:31.669> color

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
so when you're assessing seed color

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.270 
so when you're assessing seed color
change<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.479> want<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.780> be<00:04:32.930> out<00:04:33.080> there<00:04:33.280> every

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
change you want to be out there every

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.659 
change you want to be out there every
few<00:04:34.550> days<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:35.780> determine<00:04:36.770> when<00:04:37.100> it's<00:04:37.310> best<00:04:37.550> to

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
few days to determine when it's best to

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.680 
few days to determine when it's best to
get<00:04:37.880> into<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.180> field<00:04:39.669> your<00:04:40.669> seed<00:04:41.030> color<00:04:41.300> can

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
get into the field your seed color can

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.779 
get into the field your seed color can
change<00:04:42.190> about<00:04:43.190> 10%<00:04:44.090> every<00:04:44.360> two<00:04:45.139> to<00:04:45.289> three<00:04:45.320> days

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
change about 10% every two to three days

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.760 
change about 10% every two to three days
so<00:04:46.789> I<00:04:47.210> mean<00:04:47.810> if<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.110> hotter<00:04:48.320> it's<00:04:48.560> going<00:04:48.710> to

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
so I mean if it's hotter it's going to

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.249 
so I mean if it's hotter it's going to
change<00:04:48.979> quicker<00:04:49.340> than<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.610> if<00:04:50.300> it's<00:04:50.780> cooler

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
change quicker than that if it's cooler

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.020 
change quicker than that if it's cooler
it<00:04:51.470> might<00:04:51.650> take<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> little<00:04:52.039> bit<00:04:52.160> longer<00:04:52.340> so

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
it might take a little bit longer so

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.590 
it might take a little bit longer so
that's<00:04:53.150> about<00:04:53.449> an<00:04:53.630> average<00:04:54.669> now<00:04:55.669> optimal

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
that's about an average now optimal

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.260 
that's about an average now optimal
timing<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.110> swathing<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.860> 60%<00:04:58.460> seed<00:04:59.030> color

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
timing of swathing is 60% seed color

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.529 
timing of swathing is 60% seed color
change<00:05:00.400> when<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.490> have<00:05:01.520> growers<00:05:02.060> with<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.240> lot
