you<00:02:03.710> got<00:02:03.860> these<00:02:04.070> ramps<00:02:04.670> or<00:02:04.880> just<00:02:05.060> like

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
you got these ramps or just like

and<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:07.850> really<00:02:08.149> neat<00:02:08.510> set<00:02:08.840> one<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.290> the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
and so it's a really neat set one of the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.300 
and so it's a really neat set one of the
original<00:02:10.660> remote<00:02:11.660> control<00:02:12.110> cars<00:02:12.440> or<00:02:13.010> radio

control<00:02:13.760> cars<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.450> we<00:02:14.690> built<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.080> main<00:02:15.230> model

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
control cars and we built the main model

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.610 
control cars and we built the main model
yellow<00:02:16.610> car<00:02:17.510> with<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.810> cheetah<00:02:18.050> pattern<00:02:18.320> on

yellow car with the cheetah pattern on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.370 
yellow car with the cheetah pattern on
it<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:19.820> look<00:02:20.000> at<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.240> instructions<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
it and if we look at the instructions it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.430 
it and if we look at the instructions it
gives<00:02:21.920> these<00:02:22.190> other<00:02:22.570> four<00:02:23.570> models<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.290> you

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
gives these other four models that you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.920 
gives these other four models that you
can<00:02:24.620> build<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.070> like<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.490> green<00:02:25.730> bricks<00:02:26.570> on

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
can build I like the green bricks on

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.530 
can build I like the green bricks on
there<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.560> lot<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.959> box<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:32.480> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
there a lot and this is the box it's a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.250 
there a lot and this is the box it's a
rather<00:02:32.720> large<00:02:33.020> box<00:02:33.440> being<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.580> only<00:02:34.700> has

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
rather large box being that it only has

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.690 
rather large box being that it only has
293<00:02:36.260> pieces<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:36.860> that's<00:02:37.040> because<00:02:37.400> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
293 pieces but that's because the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.660 
293 pieces but that's because the
control<00:02:38.180> unit<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.690> large<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:40.250> here<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
control unit is large and here on the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.880 
control unit is large and here on the
back<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.090> box<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.570> shows<00:02:41.739> some<00:02:42.739> of<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
back of the box it shows some of the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.460 
back of the box it shows some of the
other<00:02:43.090> models<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.420> can<00:02:44.570> be<00:02:44.720> built<00:02:44.959> with<00:02:45.290> this

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
other models that can be built with this

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.009 
other models that can be built with this
it's<00:02:46.160> not<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.370> real<00:02:46.580> powerful<00:02:47.019> remote-control

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
it's not a real powerful remote-control

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
but it does good indoors which is what

front of the instructions that we're
looking<00:02:55.910> at<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:58.000> we're<00:02:59.000> only<00:02:59.090> going<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.480> build

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
looking at and we're only going to build

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.920 
looking at and we're only going to build
the<00:02:59.780> one<00:02:59.959> model<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.280> for<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.390> 15<00:03:02.780> year

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
the one model so for this for a 15 year

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.350 
the one model so for this for a 15 year
old<00:03:03.080> car<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> does<00:03:03.650> pretty<00:03:03.920> good<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:05.060> we're

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
old car it does pretty good and we're

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.800 
old car it does pretty good and we're
going<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.980> run<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.640> ramps<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.600> kind

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
going to run it on the ramps it's kind

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.690 
going to run it on the ramps it's kind
of<00:03:08.840> hard<00:03:09.049> lining<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.560> up<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.920> doesn't<00:03:10.130> go

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
of hard lining it up it doesn't go

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.330 
of hard lining it up it doesn't go
perfectly<00:03:10.940> straight<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.950> get<00:03:13.100> used

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
perfectly straight you have to get used

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.520 
perfectly straight you have to get used
to<00:03:13.489> steering<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.299> everything<00:03:14.390> but<00:03:14.959> those

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
to steering and everything but those

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.960 
to steering and everything but those
ramps<00:03:15.920> are<00:03:16.040> real<00:03:16.190> durable<00:03:16.459> since<00:03:16.850> they're

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
ramps are real durable since they're

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.710 
ramps are real durable since they're
just<00:03:17.209> basically<00:03:17.959> made<00:03:18.320> out<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.500> Lego<00:03:18.950> boxes

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
just basically made out of Lego boxes

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.570 
just basically made out of Lego boxes
here's<00:03:20.720> all<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.019> extra<00:03:21.380> pieces<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.890> get<00:03:22.070> like

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
here's all the extra pieces you get like

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.789 
here's all the extra pieces you get like
I<00:03:22.610> said<00:03:22.850> before<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.180> like<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.660> green<00:03:23.930> brakes<00:03:24.620> a

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
I said before I like the green brakes a

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.370 
I said before I like the green brakes a
lot<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.510> think<00:03:26.510> there's<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.840> lot<00:03:26.989> of<00:03:27.019> neat<00:03:27.350> little

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
lot I think there's a lot of neat little

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.350 
lot I think there's a lot of neat little
elements<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.100> there<00:03:28.280> some<00:03:28.519> chrome<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.180> things

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
elements in there some chrome and things

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.690 
elements in there some chrome and things
like<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.750> here's<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.890> back<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.430> the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
like that and here's the back of the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.820 
like that and here's the back of the
instructions<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.600> show<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.930> how<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.410> use

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
instructions that show you how to use

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.690 
instructions that show you how to use
your<00:03:37.510> little<00:03:38.510> ramps<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.170> stuff<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.739> it's<00:03:40.459> so

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
your little ramps and stuff and it's so

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.430 
your little ramps and stuff and it's so
earlier<00:03:41.030> we<00:03:41.240> experimented<00:03:41.780> with<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.260> lot

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
earlier we experimented with it a lot

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.840 
earlier we experimented with it a lot
that's<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.340> neat<00:03:43.459> little<00:03:43.580> carb

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
that's a neat little carb

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
that's a neat little carb
it<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.630> about<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.080> think<00:03:46.200> $60<00:03:47.240> retail<00:03:48.240> back<00:03:48.690> in

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
it was about I think $60 retail back in

this<00:04:03.480> review<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.940> radio-controlled<00:04:05.940> car

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
this review of the radio-controlled car

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.280 
this review of the radio-controlled car
set<00:04:06.480> 5600<00:04:08.240> it's<00:04:09.240> not<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> set<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.870> really<00:04:10.110> went

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
set 5600 it's not a set that really went

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.130 
set 5600 it's not a set that really went
up<00:04:10.380> in<00:04:10.530> value<00:04:10.710> that<00:04:11.310> much<00:04:11.580> so<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.810> probably

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
up in value that much so you probably

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.710 
up in value that much so you probably
still<00:04:13.350> find<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.740> relatively<00:04:14.280> cheap<00:04:14.720> anyway

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
still find it relatively cheap anyway

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.630 
still find it relatively cheap anyway
