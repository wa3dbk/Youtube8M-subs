is<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> compact<00:01:18.360> crane<00:01:18.630> set<00:01:18.900> meaning<00:01:19.159> you'll

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
is a compact crane set meaning you'll

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.830 
is a compact crane set meaning you'll
just<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.460> able<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> smash<00:01:21.090> climbed<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.720> lot

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
just be able to smash climbed a lot

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.120 
just be able to smash climbed a lot
better<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.009> getting

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
better because you want to be getting

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
bogged down as much okay so this is a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
bogged down as much okay so this is a
compact<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.400> race<00:01:26.580> into<00:01:27.210> some<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
compact and you race into some of the

compact and you race into some of the
Gerace<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.680> 9000<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.430> swap

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Gerace is that the 9000 you can swap

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.410 
Gerace is that the 9000 you can swap
between

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
between

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
compact cranks and standard cranks quite

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
compact cranks and standard cranks quite
easily<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> chain<00:01:33.840> rings<00:01:34.079> without

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
easily just so the chain rings without

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
easily just so the chain rings without
changing<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.070> crank<00:01:35.369> arm<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
changing your crank arm because the the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.179 
changing your crank arm because the the
BCD<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:38.130> diameter<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:39.650> matches<00:01:40.650> both<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.009> want

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
BCD the diameter is matches both I want

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.499 
BCD the diameter is matches both I want
me<00:01:41.250> back<00:01:41.520> confusing<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.060> don't<00:01:42.210> worry<00:01:42.360> about

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
