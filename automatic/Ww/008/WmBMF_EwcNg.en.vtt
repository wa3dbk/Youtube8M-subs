00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
application or just have a telescope so

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.970 
application or just have a telescope so
I<00:03:01.790> think<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.120> guys<00:03:03.330> at<00:03:03.660> universe<00:03:04.050> today<00:03:04.470> they

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
I think the guys at universe today they

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.920 
I think the guys at universe today they
they<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.580> their<00:03:05.910> own<00:03:05.940> hangouts<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
they have their own hangouts and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.840 
they have their own hangouts and
everything<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.710> you<00:03:08.280> want<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.520> check<00:03:08.700> those

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
everything so you want to check those

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.540 
everything so you want to check those
guys<00:03:08.910> out<00:03:09.300> as<00:03:09.480> well<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:13.190> these<00:03:14.190> are<00:03:14.250> pretty

what works for you and the app covers as
I<00:04:24.070> mentioned<00:04:24.520> over<00:04:24.820> 38<00:04:25.300> hundred<00:04:25.810> thousand

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
I mentioned over 38 hundred thousand

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.330 
I mentioned over 38 hundred thousand
stars<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:28.000> also<00:04:28.500> has<00:04:29.500> all<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.949> constellations

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
stars it also has all the constellations

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.189 
stars it also has all the constellations
and<00:04:31.240> all<00:04:31.740> galaxy's<00:04:32.740> star<00:04:33.280> clusters<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.990> also

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
and all galaxy's star clusters it also

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:49.070 
and all galaxy's star clusters it also
has<00:04:36.840> Hubble<00:04:37.840> images<00:04:38.380> for<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.550> use

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:05:12.900 

you

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.230 

you

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
you

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.270 
you
as<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:14.960> can<00:05:15.050> see<00:05:15.229> it's<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.440> fully<00:05:16.039> interactive

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
as you can see it's a fully interactive

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.550 
as you can see it's a fully interactive
and<00:05:16.729> as<00:05:17.110> i<00:05:18.110> zoom<00:05:18.139> out<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.840> can<00:05:21.020> see<00:05:21.199> all<00:05:21.229> these

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
and as i zoom out you can see all these

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.960 
and as i zoom out you can see all these
different<00:05:22.009> details<00:05:22.630> it's<00:05:23.630> very<00:05:23.840> neat<00:05:24.139> it's

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
different details it's very neat it's

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.749 
different details it's very neat it's
very<00:05:25.990> well<00:05:26.990> develop<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.590> would<00:05:27.800> say<00:05:28.039> and<00:05:28.280> I

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
very well develop I would say and I

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.189 
very well develop I would say and I
we've<00:05:28.970> tested<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.419> lot<00:05:29.479> of<00:05:29.810> other<00:05:29.990> applications

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
we've tested a lot of other applications

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.469 
we've tested a lot of other applications
in<00:05:30.860> this<00:05:30.979> category<00:05:31.370> so<00:05:31.669> you<00:05:31.759> can<00:05:31.910> you

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
in this category so you can you

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.820 
in this category so you can you
definitely<00:05:32.900> want<00:05:33.050> to<00:05:33.110> test<00:05:33.259> those<00:05:33.410> out<00:05:33.620> as

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
definitely want to test those out as

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.480 
definitely want to test those out as
well<00:05:33.910> you<00:05:34.910> do<00:05:35.030> have<00:05:35.060> all<00:05:35.419> eight<00:05:35.630> planets<00:05:36.490> Pluto

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
well you do have all eight planets Pluto

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.200 
well you do have all eight planets Pluto
is<00:05:38.259> optional<00:05:39.259> and<00:05:39.470> I'm<00:05:40.130> sure<00:05:40.400> you're<00:05:41.180> familiar

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
is optional and I'm sure you're familiar

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.809 
is optional and I'm sure you're familiar
with<00:05:41.690> all<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.080> issues<00:05:42.650> with<00:05:42.979> but<00:05:43.550> there's<00:05:43.699> a

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
with all the issues with but there's a

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:50.439 
with all the issues with but there's a
planet<00:05:44.240> or<00:05:44.360> it's<00:05:44.509> not<00:05:44.660> so<00:05:49.090> so<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.120> think<00:05:50.240> I

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
planet or it's not so so I think I

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.140 
planet or it's not so so I think I
covered<00:05:50.659> most<00:05:51.470> make<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:52.009> major<00:05:52.430> features<00:05:52.729> for

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
covered most make the major features for

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.790 
covered most make the major features for
this<00:05:53.270> application<00:05:53.479> I<00:05:55.750> still<00:05:56.750> I<00:05:57.080> like<00:05:57.680> this

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
this application I still I like this

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.339 
this application I still I like this
application<00:05:58.460> i<00:05:58.550> do<00:05:58.610> like<00:05:58.940> Lumosity<00:05:59.599> also<00:06:00.050> and

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
application i do like Lumosity also and

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.300 
application i do like Lumosity also and
i<00:06:01.250> also<00:06:01.930> enjoyed<00:06:02.930> playing<00:06:03.710> around<00:06:04.009> with<00:06:04.250> a

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
i also enjoyed playing around with a

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.879 
i also enjoyed playing around with a
star<00:06:04.639> walk<00:06:04.909> and<00:06:05.150> solar<00:06:05.389> walk<00:06:05.720> it<00:06:06.380> really<00:06:06.650> comes

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
star walk and solar walk it really comes

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.529 
star walk and solar walk it really comes
down<00:06:07.009> to<00:06:07.130> what<00:06:07.400> you<00:06:07.550> want<00:06:07.699> to<00:06:07.789> do<00:06:07.970> if<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.330> just

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
down to what you want to do if you just

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:09.879 
down to what you want to do if you just
need<00:06:08.630> an<00:06:08.750> application<00:06:09.349> that<00:06:09.380> shows<00:06:09.530> you

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
need an application that shows you

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.149 
need an application that shows you
what's<00:06:10.099> showing<00:06:11.000> in<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.300> sky<00:06:11.509> star<00:06:11.960> sky<00:06:12.830> with

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
what's showing in the sky star sky with

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.040 
what's showing in the sky star sky with
augmented<00:06:13.490> reality<00:06:14.449> there<00:06:14.720> are<00:06:14.750> a<00:06:14.840> lot<00:06:15.020> of

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
augmented reality there are a lot of

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.080 
augmented reality there are a lot of
applications<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.740> do<00:06:15.979> that<00:06:16.090> this

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
applications that do that this

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.909 
applications that do that this
application<00:06:17.330> also<00:06:17.780> does<00:06:18.169> that<00:06:18.409> but<00:06:18.620> it<00:06:18.740> has

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
application also does that but it has

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.860 
application also does that but it has
more<00:06:19.250> it<00:06:19.550> has<00:06:20.259> stars<00:06:21.460> galaxies<00:06:22.460> and
