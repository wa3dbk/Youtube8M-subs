okay so let's start with the baseline of
the<00:01:37.790> tune<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.240> very<00:01:38.450> characteristic

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
the tune the very characteristic

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.719 
the tune the very characteristic

how<00:02:05.360> i<00:02:05.390> made<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> baseline<00:02:06.110> come<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.560> life

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
how i made the baseline come to life

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.340 
how i made the baseline come to life
with<00:02:06.979> my<00:02:07.130> thumb<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.490> index<00:02:07.580> finger<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.660> this

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
with my thumb and index finger so this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.470 
with my thumb and index finger so this
is<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.649> structure<00:02:10.000> but<00:02:11.000> then<00:02:11.209> you're<00:02:11.360> going

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
is the structure but then you're going

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.910 
is the structure but then you're going
to<00:02:11.540> use<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.840> right<00:02:12.020> hand<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.410> add<00:02:12.560> some

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
to use the right hand to add some

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:37.330 
to use the right hand to add some
rhythmic<00:02:13.160> stuff

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.770 

and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.489> over<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.359> called<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and then over here this is called a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.869 
and then over here this is called a
rumba<00:02:40.379> clave<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.420> 3-2<00:02:42.420> rumba<00:02:43.139> 32<00:02:43.650> klavik<00:02:44.159> going

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
rumba clave a 3-2 rumba 32 klavik going

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.569 
rumba clave a 3-2 rumba 32 klavik going
one<00:02:45.120> two<00:02:45.439> three<00:02:46.439> forward<00:02:49.400> we're<00:02:50.400> going<00:02:50.430> to

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
one two three forward we're going to

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.899 
one two three forward we're going to
alternate<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.920> fifth<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.430> sixth<00:02:53.849> string

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
alternate the fifth and the sixth string

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.270
