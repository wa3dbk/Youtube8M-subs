00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello I am today with 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.420
 veronique expert in match and look and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 half point as she explains you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.889
 how to choose your dress 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.020
 function of his morphology let's tackle everything 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.779
 immediately morphology shaped 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.000
 reverse pyramid look good hello 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.490
 I'm going to talk to you about the inverted pyramid 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 so here she is a woman who has the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.970
 shoulders significantly wider than the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.400
 pelvis hips 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.289
 we will have to add volume to this 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.769
 level of the body to catch up with 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.010
 difference 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.350
 visually so here is a little dress 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.140
 which is a good example for a woman 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.860
 inverted pyramid for the volume is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.410
 fallen by a flying game you have 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.629
 recreate a balance with the shoulders 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 here you have the suspender girls who 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.270
 are fine for this kind of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.430
 morphology with a slight v and especially 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 everything is centered here all the directions towards 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.960
 the bottom so we bring the eye rather in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 down what's interesting it's about 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.739
 this dress is the game of buttons that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.390
 draws the eye towards the center at 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.850
 bus level so it reduce by the same 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.650
 more the build when you have a build 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.580
 quite imposing you have to have the maximum 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.159
 the necklines that lengthens you and bo 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 rather dark the small reasons d at 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.930
 background c is rather reserved leclerc where 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 one and the big reason in vain if we go 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.200
 do it once in this sense so 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.270
 on this dress you have the sleeve that 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.900
 is very flexible very fluid very light 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.060
 no poles marked here and then you 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.329
 have the look that passes on the center 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.520
 of the body and who stops with this 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.899
 belt a little this route and that is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.210
 laid straight to widen the hips and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.670
 then the whole skirt that moves with the game 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.229
 de France all that gives volume and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.170
 gives more presence to the lower body 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.930
 so to finish in summary when we will have 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 an inverted pyramid morphology 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 either we shrink his build with 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.630
 neckline v small straps and one 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.400
 add volume here or you can 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.590
 put a loose garment 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.810
 a bit wide a little floating and we 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.060
 catches the eye with a belt or 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.100
 color patterns down and have 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.050
 afraid of swaddling very light and especially 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.950
 no epaulets then what it takes 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.930
 avoid doing 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.080
 obviously it is to wear 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.900
 necklines boat wearing stripes 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.580
 horizontal round but rather down this 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.680
 would be welcome and to wear things 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.140
 who are crossed and who always spreads 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.470
 the look is again not 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.470
 epaulettes
