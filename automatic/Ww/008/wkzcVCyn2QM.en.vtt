 and hello everyone to sit down with you today i 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.500
 I will tell you about the bug in the house in the game dota 2 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 how do u remove a wrong prediction with 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 amulet that's how you see me now 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:38.280
 wrong predictions here to remove 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:39.570
 Places for on Tesla and his mentor go 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 inventory 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.870
 arsenal and we need any sheep that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.610
 again which is a gem or there 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.559
 may become a gem or 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:56.000
 or steering and clamping that is 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.730
 we clamp on the amulet the left mouse button and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.219
 let's say here I have a rune here 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 we transfer here 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:15.990
 but but leave that is finger and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:20.390
 leave on the left mouse button on so 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.460
 now also holding the left mouse button - 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.110
 we press the right mouse button just 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.600
 I click and here we have opened 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 the frame is now already a major finger left 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 mouse buttons click in the gems and here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.299
 is it on here whether there is any clever successful 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.509
 predictions from the holes are not without predictions 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.409
 as you see with me now 1 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.810
 one wrong predicted now press 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.090
 on this rune 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.710
 right click and here's reset 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.000
 painted the score yes and how you see smart 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.530
 now but the innocence of the predictions 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.360
 that's all with you was all hope you 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.360
