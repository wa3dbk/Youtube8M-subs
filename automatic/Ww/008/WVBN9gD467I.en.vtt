know<00:01:53.100> she<00:01:53.159> could<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.520> jump<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:53.850> into<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
know she could just jump right into it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.810 
know she could just jump right into it
but<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> already<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:55.829> only<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.369> able<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
but you can already see only not able to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.149 
but you can already see only not able to
really<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.149> anything<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.990> controls<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.979> this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
really do anything the controls in this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520 
really do anything the controls in this
game<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.520> stiffer<00:02:00.030> than<00:02:00.240> jello<00:02:00.540> yes<00:02:01.320> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
game are stiffer than jello yes that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.380 
game are stiffer than jello yes that
made<00:02:01.649> no<00:02:01.799> sense<00:02:01.829> no<00:02:02.340> no<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.210> they're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
made no sense no no but they're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
made no sense no no but they're
extremely<00:02:03.990> extremely<00:02:04.979> stiff<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.520> have

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
extremely extremely stiff and you have

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.039 
extremely extremely stiff and you have
to<00:02:05.850> use<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> analog<00:02:06.210> stick<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.780> move<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
to use the analog stick to move you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.559 
to use the analog stick to move you
can't<00:02:07.290> use<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> d-pad<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.340> although<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.360> can

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
can't use the d-pad and although you can

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.940 
can't use the d-pad and although you can
use<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.780> d-pad<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.229> turn<00:02:10.379> left<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.739> right

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
use the d-pad to turn left and right

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.700 
use the d-pad to turn left and right
which<00:02:11.280> makes<00:02:11.520> them

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
which makes them

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.740 
which makes them
sense<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.340> these<00:02:12.550> little<00:02:12.820> star<00:02:13.150> things<00:02:13.510> are

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
sense and these little star things are

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.720 
sense and these little star things are
pretty<00:02:13.930> much<00:02:14.080> useless<00:02:14.380> for<00:02:14.800> right<00:02:14.950> now<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
pretty much useless for right now and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.450 
pretty much useless for right now and
the<00:02:16.030> only<00:02:16.120> thing<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.480> good<00:02:16.630> for<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.900> building

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
the only thing that good for is building

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.590 
the only thing that good for is building
but<00:02:18.460> basically<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> beginning<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
but basically in the beginning of the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.300 
but basically in the beginning of the
game<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.960> could<00:02:20.080> either<00:02:20.200> choose<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.620> build<00:02:21.010> or

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
game you could either choose to build or

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.210 
game you could either choose to build or
you<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.550> move<00:02:21.670> your<00:02:21.730> troops<00:02:22.060> out<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:23.440> tend<00:02:24.160> to

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
you can move your troops out I tend to

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.890 
you can move your troops out I tend to
move<00:02:24.370> my<00:02:24.520> troops<00:02:24.820> out<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.600> another

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
move my troops out just like another

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.230 
move my troops out just like another
worms<00:02:26.200> game<00:02:26.440> but<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.800> three<00:02:27.040> dimension<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
worms game but in a three dimension the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.390 
worms game but in a three dimension the
only<00:02:28.480> problem<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.440> not<00:02:29.500> done<00:02:29.980> right<00:02:30.010> at

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
stuff you know that you didn't really

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.980 
stuff you know that you didn't really
have<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.210> see<00:02:52.360> right<00:02:52.390> now<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.750> computer

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
have you can see right now the computer

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.960 
have you can see right now the computer
is<00:02:53.230> actually<00:02:53.590> building<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.310> catapults<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
is actually building like catapults and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.420 
is actually building like catapults and
stuff<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.510> building<00:02:55.740> ways<00:02:56.740> for<00:02:57.070> me<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.190> get

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
stuff and building ways for me to get

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.340 
stuff and building ways for me to get
killed<00:02:57.730> basically<00:02:58.360> but<00:02:58.870> even<00:02:58.990> when<00:02:59.200> they

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
killed basically but even when they

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.140 
killed basically but even when they
build<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.040> only<00:03:00.190> time<00:03:00.460> it's<00:03:00.850> really

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
build it the only time it's really

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.550 
build it the only time it's really
useful<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.660> that<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.900> players<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.440> are<00:03:02.530> a

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
useful is that the players that are a

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.100 
useful is that the players that are a
complete<00:03:03.280> hbu<00:03:03.640> typically<00:03:04.420> in<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.630> worms<00:03:04.900> game

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
complete hbu typically in a worms game

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.110 
complete hbu typically in a worms game
you<00:03:05.440> have<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.680> worry<00:03:05.980> about<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.280> AI<00:03:06.400> being<00:03:06.820> bad

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
you have to worry about the AI being bad

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.570 
you have to worry about the AI being bad
and<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.600> game<00:03:07.900> they're<00:03:08.290> good<00:03:08.560> which<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.370> bad

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
and this game they're good which is bad

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.670 
and this game they're good which is bad
because<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:10.150> game<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.570> bad<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.080> hard<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.440> see

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
because the game is bad and hard to see

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.340 
because the game is bad and hard to see
says<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.790> see<00:03:13.030> he's<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> master<00:03:14.200> he's

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
says you can see he's a master he's

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.810 
says you can see he's a master he's
going<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.710> throw<00:03:14.830> grenade<00:03:15.250> from<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.670> other

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
way to get close to him so you can also
