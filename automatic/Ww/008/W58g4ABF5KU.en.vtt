and<00:00:01.290> Photoshop<00:00:01.740> can<00:00:02.070> be<00:00:02.159> applied<00:00:02.490> as<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:03.120> now

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
and Photoshop can be applied as is now

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.639 
and Photoshop can be applied as is now
I've<00:00:04.290> got<00:00:04.589> go<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.160> gradient<00:00:05.640> tool<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
I've got go to the gradient tool and

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.919 
I've got go to the gradient tool and
gradient<00:00:07.649> palette<00:00:07.950> now<00:00:08.400> got<00:00:09.360> course<00:00:09.660> apply

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
gradient palette now got course apply

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.709 
gradient palette now got course apply
the<00:00:09.990> gradient<00:00:10.349> just<00:00:11.040> as<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.429> there<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.570> you

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the gradient just as it is there but you

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.330 
the gradient just as it is there but you
might<00:00:12.929> say<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.349> want<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.650> change<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.070> grading

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340

those along move them to pop sea Krait
the<00:00:53.219> slightly<00:00:53.489> different<00:00:53.699> gradients<00:00:54.239> I'm

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the slightly different gradients I'm

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
the slightly different gradients I'm
just<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> quickly<00:00:55.170> show<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
just going to quickly show you the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.569 
just going to quickly show you the
effect<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.539> red

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
effect of that you can see more red

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.090 
effect of that you can see more red
get<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.760> there<00:01:00.289> of<00:01:01.289> course<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.739> also

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
get on there of course you can also

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.640 
get on there of course you can also
select<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.910> gradient<00:01:03.300> stop<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.989> drag<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
select the gradient stop just drag it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.550 
select the gradient stop just drag it
off<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.939> drag<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> will

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
off that's it just drag it and that will

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
off that's it just drag it and that will
remove<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.700> grain<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> have

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
remove the grain now you have to have

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.730 
remove the grain now you have to have
two<00:01:10.110> gradients<00:01:10.470> widened<00:01:11.310> stopped<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:13.229> off<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
two gradients widened stopped to off to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.109 
two gradients widened stopped to off to
your<00:01:13.830> wall<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> could<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.610> 10<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
your wall so you could have like 10 and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.499 
your wall so you could have like 10 and
20<00:01:15.509> gradients<00:01:16.430> creighton<00:01:17.430> stops<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> can

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
20 gradients creighton stops so you can

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.570 
20 gradients creighton stops so you can
just<00:01:18.630> drag<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.869> along<00:01:19.320> game<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:20.280> you've<00:01:20.460> got

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
just drag that along game now you've got

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.609 
just drag that along game now you've got
a<00:01:20.610> midpoint<00:01:20.880> too

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
a midpoint too

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.820 
a midpoint too
you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.830> make<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.280> obviously<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:25.020> red<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.470> lot

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you can make it obviously the red a lot

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.700 
you can make it obviously the red a lot
less<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:27.000> you've<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.840> purple

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
less so you've got more of the purple

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.520 
less so you've got more of the purple
it's<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:28.950> scar<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:30.079> just<00:01:31.079> go<00:01:31.229> undo

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it's not scar there now just go undo

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.399 
it's not scar there now just go undo
that<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:33.090> apply<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.259> see

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that just apply that so you just see

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.130 
that just apply that so you just see
very<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.189> red<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.810> click<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
very little of the red just click that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.219 
very little of the red just click that
go<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:39.210> modify<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:41.030> now<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:43.079> can

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
go and just can modify that now you can

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.130 
go and just can modify that now you can
also<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.920> said<00:01:44.549> pad<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.810> basically

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
also I said pad so you just basically

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
also I said pad so you just basically
going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.100> position<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:47.909> drag<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
going to do just position what drag to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
going to do just position what drag to
stop<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.500> click<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.979> that

stop so you can just click there that
will<00:01:50.490> take<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> color<00:01:50.970> there<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> just

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
will take the color there so you just

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.399 
will take the color there so you just
click<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.640> stop<00:01:54.229> saying<00:01:55.229> like

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
click on the actually stop saying like

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.749 
click on the actually stop saying like
it<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:55.770> blue<00:01:56.540> okay<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.189> I've<00:01:59.520> got

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.149 
it don't blue okay and so now I've got
three<00:01:59.969> stops<00:02:00.299> gonna<00:02:01.259> stick<00:02:01.469> click<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.100> hold

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
three stops gonna stick click and hold

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.480 
three stops gonna stick click and hold
on

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
on

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.780 
on
maybe<00:02:03.420> white<00:02:03.950> some<00:02:04.950> change<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> color<00:02:05.520> there

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
maybe white some change of color there

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.340 
maybe white some change of color there
and<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:09.140> okay<00:02:10.140> there

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
and I can now go okay there

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.410 
and I can now go okay there
and<00:02:12.350> apply<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.620> gradient<00:02:12.860> there<00:02:13.300> click<00:02:14.300> on

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and apply the gradient there click on

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.310 
and apply the gradient there click on
there<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:14.720> go<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.820> just<00:02:16.820> say<00:02:16.910> new<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.540> that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
there we go and just say new and that

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.150 
there we go and just say new and that
will<00:02:18.500> add<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.520> color<00:02:19.810> gradient<00:02:20.810> there<00:02:21.230> into

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
will add the color gradient there into

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.100 
will add the color gradient there into
the<00:02:22.280> palette<00:02:22.610> now<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.450> course<00:02:23.600> I've<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.900> save

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the palette now of course I've to save

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.200 
the palette now of course I've to save
it<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.380> point<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:24.830> say<00:02:24.950> save<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:26.120> I'm

it this point up and say save but I'm
just<00:02:26.330> looking<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.810> do<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.020> here

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
just looking to do that here

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.320 
just looking to do that here
right<00:02:28.100> also<00:02:28.730> there's<00:02:28.910> an<00:02:29.000> other<00:02:29.210> option

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
right also there's an other option

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.450 
right also there's an other option
there's<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.810> noise<00:02:29.960> option<00:02:30.440> which<00:02:31.100> gives<00:02:31.340> it

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
there's a noise option which gives it

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.340 
there's a noise option which gives it
offers<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.790> number<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.150> selections<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.870> color

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
offers a number of selections of color

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.460 
offers a number of selections of color
models<00:02:33.740> this<00:02:34.340> was<00:02:34.610> put<00:02:35.360> crates<00:02:35.630> brick<00:02:35.900> unusual

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
models this was put crates brick unusual

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.620 
models this was put crates brick unusual
crayons<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:38.990> lab<00:02:39.590> load<00:02:40.630> restrict

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
crayons so you can lab load restrict

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.270 
crayons so you can lab load restrict
color<00:02:41.840> randomizing<00:02:42.620> goes<00:02:42.890> through<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.100> whole

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
color randomizing goes through a whole

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
color randomizing goes through a whole
range<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.640> different<00:02:44.230> color<00:02:45.230> options<00:02:46.300> click

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
range of different color options click

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.020 
range of different color options click
OK<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.290> will<00:02:48.500> apply<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.160> alright

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
OK and that will apply it there alright

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.720 
OK and that will apply it there alright
so<00:02:50.300> that's<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.690> basic<00:02:50.840> step<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.740> changing<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
so that's a basic step of changing the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.180 
so that's a basic step of changing the
gradient<00:02:53.180> from<00:02:53.780> using<00:02:54.200> color<00:02:54.560> stops<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.130> you

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
gradient from using color stops so you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.710 
gradient from using color stops so you
don't<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.550> go<00:02:55.670> with<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:55.970> current<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
don't have to go with the current the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.140 
don't have to go with the current the
colors<00:02:57.260> you've<00:02:57.410> actually<00:02:57.560> got<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.880> can

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
colors you've actually got so you can

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.840 
colors you've actually got so you can
say<00:02:59.810> change<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.470> at<00:03:00.620> any<00:03:00.709> point<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.610> of

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
say change that at any point and of

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.250 
say change that at any point and of
course<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.150> can<00:03:02.270> go<00:03:02.330> back<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.170> original

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
course you can go back to the original

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.310 
course you can go back to the original
design<00:03:03.830> if<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.130> wish
