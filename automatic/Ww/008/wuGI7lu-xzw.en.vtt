00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
I have all my extended motor phase wires

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.700 
I have all my extended motor phase wires
ready<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.270> go<00:00:03.419> I<00:00:03.600> cut<00:00:03.870> them<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.110> length<00:00:04.140> to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
ready to go I cut them to length to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.900 
ready to go I cut them to length to
where<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:04.859> want<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.250> wire<00:00:05.400> them<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.790> the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
where I want to wire them to the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.120 
where I want to wire them to the
controller<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.509> as<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.560> can<00:00:07.710> see<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:07.919> already

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
controller and as you can see I already

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.190 
controller and as you can see I already
got<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.370> heat<00:00:08.639> shrink<00:00:08.970> prepared<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.960> ready<00:00:10.050> on

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
got my heat shrink prepared and ready on

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.190 
got my heat shrink prepared and ready on
the<00:00:10.469> wire<00:00:10.860> sleep<00:00:11.370> down<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.090> once<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.900> solder

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the wire sleep down so once I solder

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.140 
the wire sleep down so once I solder
them<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.740> sleep<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.580> back<00:00:14.730> over<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
them I can sleep it back over to the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.080 
them I can sleep it back over to the
connection<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.750> heat<00:00:15.929> them<00:00:16.049> down<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
connection and heat them down and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.779 
connection and heat them down and
isolate<00:00:18.090> them<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> after<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> got<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
isolate them so after I got the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.269 
isolate them so after I got the
controller<00:00:21.119> widen<00:00:21.590> I'll<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.740> able<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.949> fire<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
controller widen I'll be able to fire it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.630

on<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> controller<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.430> give<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
on the controller and we can give it a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.700 
on the controller and we can give it a
couple<00:00:32.850> test<00:00:33.120> runs

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
couple test runs

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.170 
couple test runs
now<00:00:34.710> before<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> mount<00:00:35.520> any<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> batteries

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
now before I mount any of the batteries

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.360 
now before I mount any of the batteries
I'm<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.890> obviously<00:00:37.890> giving<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
I'm going to be obviously giving it a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700 
I'm going to be obviously giving it a
couple<00:00:38.550> discharges<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.649> see

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
couple discharges and as you can see

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.369 
couple discharges and as you can see
right<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> 5<00:00:42.090> amp<00:00:42.300> power<00:00:42.420> lipo<00:00:43.079> pack

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
right here I get a 5 amp power lipo pack

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.490 
right here I get a 5 amp power lipo pack
it<00:00:44.010> puts<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.399> 84<00:00:44.940> volts<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> 20<00:00:46.110> cells<00:00:46.320> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it puts out 84 volts it's a 20 cells in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.819 
it puts out 84 volts it's a 20 cells in
series<00:00:49.760> also<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:52.760> 100<00:00:53.760> volt<00:00:54.829> digital

mounting<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.210> top<00:01:03.420> tube<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.110> stem<00:01:04.710> here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
mounting on the top tube of my stem here

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670 
mounting on the top tube of my stem here
I<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.700> need<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.260> find<00:01:07.260> what<00:01:07.500> type<00:01:07.650> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
I just need to find what type of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.080 
I just need to find what type of
materials<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> make<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
materials that I want to make the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
materials that I want to make the
housing<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.740> obviously<00:01:11.250> make

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
housing out of and then obviously make

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.190 
housing out of and then obviously make
the<00:01:11.850> housing<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.360> waterproof<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the housing and then waterproof it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
the housing and then waterproof it
that's<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> hardest<00:01:14.369> part<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that's going to be the hardest part is

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.230 
that's going to be the hardest part is
because<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> screen<00:01:15.960> can't<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.409> wet<00:01:17.240> it's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because the screen can't get wet it's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.420 
because the screen can't get wet it's
very<00:01:18.420> cheap<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.810> unit<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> Bay<00:01:20.220> from

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
very cheap a little unit on a Bay from

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
very cheap a little unit on a Bay from
China<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.930> power<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.439> one

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
China that you just power it with one

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580 
China that you just power it with one
cell<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> lithium<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.170> puts<00:01:25.470> out

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
cell of the lithium and then it puts out

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
cell of the lithium and then it puts out
your<00:01:25.710> voltage<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> other<00:01:26.310> two<00:01:26.460> wires<00:01:29.119> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
your voltage on the other two wires so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.280 
your voltage on the other two wires so
after<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> controller<00:01:30.869> wired<00:01:31.110> up

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
after we get the controller wired up

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.370 
after we get the controller wired up
we'll<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.250> able<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.900> fire<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
we'll be able to fire it up with the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.810 
we'll be able to fire it up with the
lipo<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:34.979> what<00:01:35.100> happens<00:01:37.610> also<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> don't

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
lipo and see what happens also I don't

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.319 
lipo and see what happens also I don't
think<00:01:39.000> anybody<00:01:39.990> saw<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.229> torque<00:01:40.650> arm

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
think anybody saw this torque arm

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.490 
think anybody saw this torque arm
finished<00:01:42.329> up<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.659> got<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.840> allen<00:01:43.170> bolt<00:01:43.320> going

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
finished up I got the allen bolt going

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.160 
finished up I got the allen bolt going
through<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.860> onto<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> backside<00:01:45.140> with<00:01:46.140> a

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.530 
okay so I'm finishing up my connections
from<00:02:02.990> my<00:02:03.170> motor<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:04.100> my<00:02:04.340> controller<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:05.000> have

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
from my motor to my controller I have

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.240 
from my motor to my controller I have
all<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.840> five<00:02:06.170> Hall<00:02:06.440> sensor<00:02:06.800> wires<00:02:06.980> already

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
all the five Hall sensor wires already

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.730 
all the five Hall sensor wires already
done<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.910> I'm<00:02:08.780> going<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.050> be<00:02:09.200> doing<00:02:09.290> my<00:02:09.500> phase

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
done and I'm going to be doing my phase

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.660 
done and I'm going to be doing my phase
wires<00:02:10.010> next

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
wires next

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.060 
wires next
I<00:02:10.960> haven't<00:02:11.960> heat-shrink<00:02:12.260> them<00:02:12.500> yet<00:02:12.680> I'm<00:02:12.860> just

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
I haven't heat-shrink them yet I'm just

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.130 
I haven't heat-shrink them yet I'm just
my<00:02:13.610> soldering<00:02:14.000> iron<00:02:14.060> still<00:02:14.540> plugged<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
my soldering iron still plugged in and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.740 
my soldering iron still plugged in and
ready<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.800> go<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:17.000> what<00:02:17.240> I'm<00:02:17.330> doing<00:02:17.390> now<00:02:17.720> is

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
ready to go now what I'm doing now is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.860 
ready to go now what I'm doing now is
because<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.320> have<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.470> golden<00:02:18.800> motor<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.720> have

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
because I have a golden motor and I have

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.140 
because I have a golden motor and I have
a<00:02:20.960> lion<00:02:21.200> controller<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.640> switch<00:02:22.940> some

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
a lion controller I have to switch some

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.820 
a lion controller I have to switch some
of<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.330> colors<00:02:23.630> around<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:24.170> my<00:02:24.260> Hall<00:02:24.440> sensors

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
of the colors around on my Hall sensors

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.740 
of the colors around on my Hall sensors
and<00:02:24.980> my<00:02:25.040> phase<00:02:25.250> wires<00:02:25.550> found<00:02:26.330> out<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> big

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and my phase wires found out the big

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.270 
and my phase wires found out the big
green<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.170> yellow<00:02:27.410> needs<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.800> swap<00:02:28.010> on

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
green in the yellow needs to swap on

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.730 
green in the yellow needs to swap on
both<00:02:28.430> sides<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> already<00:02:30.230> swapped<00:02:30.440> them<00:02:30.650> on

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
both sides so I already swapped them on

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.890 
both sides so I already swapped them on
my<00:02:30.890> hall<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.340> now<00:02:32.300> I'm<00:02:32.390> going<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.570> be<00:02:32.660> swapping

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
my hall and now I'm going to be swapping

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.630 
my hall and now I'm going to be swapping
them<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.260> my<00:02:33.410> phases<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:34.400> going<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.580> be

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
them on my phases I'm going to be

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.220 
them on my phases I'm going to be
putting<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.940> green<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.480> my<00:02:35.570> motor<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.050> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
putting the green for my motor to the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
putting the green for my motor to the
yellow<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.650> my<00:02:36.770> controller<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.450> obviously

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
yellow of my controller and obviously

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.680 
yellow of my controller and obviously
the<00:02:38.600> same<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.020> opposite<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.420> let's<00:02:41.570> see

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
the same with the opposite so let's see

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.340 
the same with the opposite so let's see
how<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.810> goes<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.670> also<00:02:43.670> needed<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.090> have<00:02:44.630> a

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
how it goes I also needed to have a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.810 
how it goes I also needed to have a
little<00:02:45.470> flat<00:02:45.830> working<00:02:46.070> surface<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.700> put

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
little flat working surface to put

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.400 
little flat working surface to put
pressure<00:02:47.090> against<00:02:47.540> when<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.750> was<00:02:47.870> soldering<00:02:48.230> my

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
pressure against when I was soldering my

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.370 
pressure against when I was soldering my
Hall<00:02:48.590> sensors<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.550> used<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.390> piece<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.320> that

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
Hall sensors so I used a piece of that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.020 
Hall sensors so I used a piece of that
aluminum<00:02:51.800> stop<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.280> have<00:02:52.459> kicking<00:02:52.790> around

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
aluminum stop that I have kicking around

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.370 
aluminum stop that I have kicking around
and<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:53.270> just<00:02:53.300> see<00:02:53.540> clamped<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> little

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
and I just see clamped it to a little

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.470 
and I just see clamped it to a little
table<00:02:54.890> I'm<00:02:55.100> working<00:02:55.459> off<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.000> get<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.330> right

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
table I'm working off so I get it right

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.940 
table I'm working off so I get it right
under<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.720> bike<00:02:56.959> under<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.350> control<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.830> put

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
under the bike under the control and put

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.740 
under the bike under the control and put
some<00:02:58.130> pressure<00:02:58.280> on<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.730> works<00:02:59.420> out<00:02:59.600> pretty

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
some pressure on it works out pretty

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.720 
some pressure on it works out pretty
good<00:03:02.950> alright<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.160> there<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.520> it<00:03:04.640> all

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
good alright and there you have it all

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.790 
good alright and there you have it all
of<00:03:04.880> my<00:03:05.060> connections<00:03:05.930> from<00:03:06.170> my<00:03:06.290> motor<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.590> my

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
of my connections from my motor to my

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.010 
of my connections from my motor to my
controller<00:03:07.220> are<00:03:07.570> soldered<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:08.720> heat-shrink

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
controller are soldered and heat-shrink

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.830 
controller are soldered and heat-shrink
I<00:03:09.640> doubled<00:03:10.640> up<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.790> heat<00:03:11.239> shrink<00:03:11.420> with<00:03:11.810> a

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
I doubled up the heat shrink with a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.960 
I doubled up the heat shrink with a
larger<00:03:12.260> size<00:03:12.440> on<00:03:12.769> my<00:03:12.800> phase<00:03:13.280> wires<00:03:13.519> just<00:03:13.700> in

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
larger size on my phase wires just in

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.250 
larger size on my phase wires just in
case<00:03:14.120> they<00:03:14.330> shorted<00:03:14.690> out<00:03:14.780> with<00:03:14.930> each<00:03:15.050> other

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
case they shorted out with each other

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.250 
case they shorted out with each other
and<00:03:15.410> it's<00:03:16.160> very<00:03:16.489> thick<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.000> very<00:03:17.300> glued<00:03:18.110> on

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
and it's very thick and very glued on

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.050 
and it's very thick and very glued on
there<00:03:18.470> tight<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:21.280> like<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> results<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.910> think

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
there tight I like the results I think

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.670 
there tight I like the results I think
it's<00:03:23.180> going<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.330> come<00:03:23.510> out<00:03:23.630> good<00:03:23.810> well<00:03:24.500> now<00:03:24.620> all

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
it's going to come out good well now all

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.740 
it's going to come out good well now all
I<00:03:24.890> got<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.070> do<00:03:25.220> is<00:03:25.400> temporarily<00:03:25.880> wire<00:03:26.480> up<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
I got to do is temporarily wire up the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.449 
I got to do is temporarily wire up the
throttle<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.410> hook<00:03:27.709> hook<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.160> up<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.370> this

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
throttle and hook hook it up to this

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.040 
throttle and hook hook it up to this
lipo<00:03:28.820> battery<00:03:29.180> pack<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.540> see<00:03:29.690> if<00:03:29.750> we<00:03:29.840> can<00:03:29.959> get

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
lipo battery pack and see if we can get

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.530 
lipo battery pack and see if we can get
the<00:03:30.140> test<00:03:30.350> run<00:03:30.530> going<00:03:34.150> okay<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.300> get<00:03:35.450> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
the test run going okay so I get the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.820 
the test run going okay so I get the
bike<00:03:35.690> propped<00:03:35.989> up<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.290> ready<00:03:36.440> for<00:03:36.500> our<00:03:36.650> test

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
bike propped up and ready for our test

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.590 
bike propped up and ready for our test
run<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.310> got<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.700> just<00:03:37.790> clamped<00:03:38.239> down<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.360> the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
run I got it just clamped down to the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.680 
run I got it just clamped down to the
table<00:03:38.930> with<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.170> 2x4<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.760> wheel<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.180> mean

table with a 2x4 and the wheel I mean

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.479 
table with a 2x4 and the wheel I mean
the<00:03:41.870> seat<00:03:42.200> post<00:03:42.350> resting<00:03:42.830> on<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.400> the

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
the seat post resting on it so the

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.170 
the seat post resting on it so the
wheels<00:03:43.700> up<00:03:43.880> off<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.150> ground<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:46.340> got<00:03:47.060> my

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
wheels up off the ground and I got my

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.940 
wheels up off the ground and I got my
throttle<00:03:47.660> connections<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.290> think<00:03:48.709> they're

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
throttle connections I think they're

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.800 
throttle connections I think they're
right<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.580> just<00:03:49.640> kind<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.030> guessed<00:03:50.480> on<00:03:50.690> it

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
right but I just kind of guessed on it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.810 
right but I just kind of guessed on it
because<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.200> coloring<00:03:51.739> is<00:03:51.830> different<00:03:52.220> but<00:03:52.760> I

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
because the coloring is different but I

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.250 
because the coloring is different but I
just<00:03:53.030> matched<00:03:53.180> your<00:03:53.480> red<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.750> red<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.110> then

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
just matched your red to red and then

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.199 
just matched your red to red and then
just<00:03:54.470> guessed<00:03:54.709> color<00:03:55.160> color<00:03:55.730> wise<00:03:55.910> with<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
just guessed color color wise with the

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.509 
just guessed color color wise with the
other<00:03:56.330> two<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.840> let's<00:03:57.830> see<00:03:58.010> if<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.190> works

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
other two and let's see if it works

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.449 
other two and let's see if it works
I<00:03:58.640> got<00:03:59.360> my<00:03:59.480> lipo<00:03:59.840> pack<00:04:00.080> here<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.560> got<00:04:01.280> the

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
I got my lipo pack here I got the

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.610 
I got my lipo pack here I got the
negative<00:04:01.730> hooked<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:02.330> I'm<00:04:02.989> going<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.290> hook<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
negative hooked up I'm going to hook the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.620 
negative hooked up I'm going to hook the
positive<00:04:04.070> up<00:04:04.220> button<00:04:04.549> like<00:04:04.760> it's<00:04:05.359> probably

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
positive up button like it's probably

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.009 
positive up button like it's probably
going<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.810> spark<00:04:06.139> on<00:04:06.320> me

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
going to spark on me

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.750 
going to spark on me
it<00:04:07.590> will<00:04:07.680> put<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.890> camera<00:04:08.099> down<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.489> do<00:04:08.579> that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
it will put the camera down to do that

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.520 
it will put the camera down to do that
the<00:04:08.909> hold<00:04:09.120> on<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.239> second

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.270 

little<00:04:17.519> spark<00:04:17.820> there<00:04:21.260> alright<00:04:22.260> now<00:04:22.530> we'll<00:04:23.010> see

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
little spark there alright now we'll see

00:04:23.280 --> 00:05:03.460 
little spark there alright now we'll see
if<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:24.060> works<00:04:24.240> let's<00:04:24.540> see<00:04:25.020> what<00:04:25.170> happens

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.650 

while<00:05:04.100> it's<00:05:04.310> going<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:04.700> fast<00:05:04.940> I'm<00:05:05.330> not<00:05:05.450> even<00:05:05.630> a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
while it's going so fast I'm not even a

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.090 
while it's going so fast I'm not even a
full<00:05:05.900> speed<00:05:06.140> yet<00:05:06.320> as<00:05:06.440> you're<00:05:06.590> shaking<00:05:07.070> the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
full speed yet as you're shaking the

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:21.410 
full speed yet as you're shaking the
table<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:08.170> little<00:05:09.170> up<00:05:09.290> sure<00:05:09.590> oh<00:05:11.380> whoa

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:57.830 

that<00:05:22.020> was<00:05:22.170> full-speed

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.380 

there<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:58.930> go<00:05:59.140> no<00:06:00.010> load<00:06:00.250> wheel<00:06:00.430> speed<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.940> don't

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
there you go no load wheel speed I don't

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.730 
there you go no load wheel speed I don't
know<00:06:01.450> what<00:06:01.570> it<00:06:01.660> is<00:06:01.750> right<00:06:01.780> now<00:06:01.990> because<00:06:02.260> I

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
know what it is right now because I

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.130 
know what it is right now because I
still<00:06:03.160> don't<00:06:03.280> have<00:06:03.340> my<00:06:03.520> cat<00:06:03.730> I<00:06:03.760> hooked<00:06:04.030> up<00:06:04.180> but

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
still don't have my cat I hooked up but

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.620 
still don't have my cat I hooked up but
that<00:06:05.440> is<00:06:05.590> pretty<00:06:05.800> darn<00:06:06.010> fast

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
that is pretty darn fast

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.150 
that is pretty darn fast
that's<00:06:07.630> much<00:06:07.900> faster<00:06:07.930> than<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.560> 48<00:06:08.920> volts

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
that's much faster than the 48 volts

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.630 
that's much faster than the 48 volts
system<00:06:09.460> I<00:06:09.520> can<00:06:09.670> tell<00:06:09.820> you<00:06:09.910> that<00:06:10.030> right<00:06:10.240> now

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
system I can tell you that right now

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.940 
system I can tell you that right now
alright<00:06:12.640> well<00:06:13.480> that's<00:06:13.780> it<00:06:13.990> for<00:06:14.110> now<00:06:14.230> let's<00:06:14.650> see

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
alright well that's it for now let's see

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.650 
alright well that's it for now let's see
if<00:06:15.040> I<00:06:15.100> can<00:06:15.310> finish<00:06:15.580> up<00:06:15.820> these<00:06:15.940> connections<00:06:16.450> and

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
if I can finish up these connections and

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.900 
if I can finish up these connections and
get<00:06:16.960> ready<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.320> finish<00:06:18.070> my<00:06:18.310> second<00:06:18.670> battery

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
get ready to finish my second battery

shrink<00:06:20.680> to<00:06:20.800> come<00:06:20.950> in<00:06:21.070> so<00:06:21.310> for<00:06:22.030> now<00:06:22.150> I'm<00:06:22.240> just

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
shrink to come in so for now I'm just

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.670 
shrink to come in so for now I'm just
going<00:06:22.450> to<00:06:22.510> be<00:06:22.600> using<00:06:22.780> these<00:06:22.900> test<00:06:23.230> lipo's

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
going to be using these test lipo's

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.740 
going to be using these test lipo's
they're<00:06:24.280> a<00:06:24.310> lot<00:06:24.850> more<00:06:24.880> powerful<00:06:25.270> though<00:06:25.510> even

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
they're a lot more powerful though even

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.940 
they're a lot more powerful though even
though<00:06:25.840> they're<00:06:25.960> generic<00:06:26.380> they<00:06:26.590> still<00:06:26.800> put

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
though they're generic they still put

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.670 
though they're generic they still put
out<00:06:27.040> more<00:06:27.280> of<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.460> C<00:06:27.640> rating<00:06:27.970> can<00:06:28.930> probably<00:06:29.230> draw

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
out more of a C rating can probably draw

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.460 
out more of a C rating can probably draw
50<00:06:29.920> amps<00:06:30.310> from<00:06:30.430> these<00:06:31.260> even<00:06:32.260> though<00:06:32.320> they're

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
50 amps from these even though they're

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.530 
50 amps from these even though they're
20<00:06:32.920> C<00:06:33.100> rated<00:06:33.460> they're<00:06:33.760> generic<00:06:34.060> so<00:06:34.360> it'll

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
20 C rated they're generic so it'll

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.520 
20 C rated they're generic so it'll
probably<00:06:34.570> only<00:06:34.840> pull<00:06:35.140> about<00:06:35.350> 8<00:06:35.590> C<00:06:37.350> okay<00:06:38.350> so<00:06:38.380> I

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
probably only pull about 8 C okay so I

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.010 
probably only pull about 8 C okay so I
reconfigured<00:06:39.280> my<00:06:39.400> lipo<00:06:39.760> packs<00:06:40.060> and<00:06:40.570> I<00:06:40.780> just

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
reconfigured my lipo packs and I just

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.710 
reconfigured my lipo packs and I just
put<00:06:41.230> some<00:06:41.550> masking<00:06:42.550> tape<00:06:42.580> nice<00:06:42.970> and<00:06:43.180> cheap<00:06:43.570> and

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
put some masking tape nice and cheap and

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.150 
put some masking tape nice and cheap and
ugly<00:06:43.810> just<00:06:44.230> taping<00:06:44.440> them<00:06:44.650> around<00:06:44.800> the<00:06:44.920> frame

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
ugly just taping them around the frame

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.280 
ugly just taping them around the frame
temporarily<00:06:45.760> just<00:06:46.750> so<00:06:46.810> I<00:06:46.870> can<00:06:46.960> get<00:06:47.050> the<00:06:47.140> bike

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
temporarily just so I can get the bike

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.020 
temporarily just so I can get the bike
up<00:06:47.440> and<00:06:47.530> running<00:06:47.860> and<00:06:49.110> yeah<00:06:50.110> it's<00:06:50.410> fast<00:06:50.880> it's<00:06:51.880> a

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
lot of fun if 84 volts doesn't give you

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.340 
lot of fun if 84 volts doesn't give you
an<00:06:54.970> e<00:06:55.120> v<00:06:55.300> grin<00:06:55.600> I<00:06:55.630> don't<00:06:55.960> know<00:06:56.020> what<00:06:56.200> will
