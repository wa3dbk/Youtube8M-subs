00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.430
 really 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.170
 and today the studio leaves 10m radio have 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.880
 come two guys that surely the 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.459
 you will know on the one hand damián molla 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.020
 canyons in the anthill co-founder 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.420
 also three skulls cueca e 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.240
 member of lantern man and on the other 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.009
 Alberto Alberto Alonso also professor and 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.170
 radio presenter television on pump 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.929
 I'm wrong about everyone and in 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.230
 vaughan professor of the anthill a little 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.759
 of all that I do not sleep much good together 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.740
 you have taken out the book that is titled 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.150
 this book is the mic and I think that we 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.950
 you count then what is it that we can 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.930
 find in it as we can find 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.670
 all the English that we already know how to ask or 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.080
 that we do not know what we know because we have 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.460
 I've been thinking and we've realized 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.870
 that there are between two thousand and four thousand 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 words that more or less all 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.730
 Spanish people know a lot of words 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.790
 the frost and those with flex that if the ford 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.530
 focus that is all full of happy fm is 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.480
 that everything is in English 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.180
 everything is in English is amazing 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.160
 So what we have done is make a 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.870
 method to be able to make profitable all the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.400
 English that we already know and that directly 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.380
 happen to be in your head in a way 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.820
 practicable because you know it but not 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.710
 you know how to use them then it's super easy 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.330
 According to Terol, your CV is going away 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.610
 ordering in the head and you know 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.440
 use 2000 or almost 4,000 words 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.909
 depending on what geek you are because 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.950
 for example there are people who do not know who 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.450
 is but for example you know with the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.450
 papers because you are very young 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.840
 exactly 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.229
 efe 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.110
 I tell you in secret because they are 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.210
 pocket monsters are monsters of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.280
 pocket but they take them in the little ball 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.350
 it's in your pocket they're pocket monsters 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.179
 and wells for example maybe you 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.460
 you remember the Flintstones that the girl 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.960
 little emape bots ipv6 a pebble 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.909
 a tiny stone per day because it is 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.530
 the smallest of the pebbles and 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.149
 done flins tom that sure sounds to you 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.500
 the word because it stings ask all the 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.729
 world knows it's princeton thinks it's 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.729
 clint nobody knows 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.350
 exact 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.630
 Stone is lighter this source 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.740
 information is everything makes sense all 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.450
 it makes sense that everything has to do with 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.130
 stones all the characters of the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.890
 TV star are named 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.330
 for something everything makes sense to me too 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.100
 I am very struck by the way in which 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.980
 that you tell it not because it is not a book 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.360
 of my line but a lot of colorful drawings 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.460
 that are also made by you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.320
 tell us which is the section that most 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.930
 like it because there are several not good is 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.910
 difficult what each section has a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.430
 little of everything movies has culture 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.080
 popular in general but then every five 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.270
 chapters we have a section that 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.490
 call game break which means give me a 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.920
 rest or you do not read me much cane has 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.080
 double meaning and that's where we expect 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.140
 like the jokes of classic movies 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.630
 return to the future young frankenstein 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.520
 that you have not caught because they are 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 untranslatable I just invented that 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.900
 word that can not be translated these 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.020
 then all your life you have lost 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.209
 these songs and their senses then 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.700
 What we have done is a little 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.060
 emphasize and explain a little bit 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.760
 then 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.800
 qr codes so you can see the scene 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.569
 from a joke that has never been 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.310
 pulp fiction of all life and I've 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.440
 seen a thousand times but it's a joke that 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.720
 you could never translate because it's a 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.760
 wordplay and for that I like 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.880
 more things that are cultural the 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.849
 things that you say and that's why he said that 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.980
 20 times in the movie I never found out about 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.300
 blog in pulp fiction do you like it for 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.830
 fiction I believe that everything on a slope 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.230
 by fission you remember when they go in the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.209
 car that goes to john travolta with mia 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.250
 wallace and they both go there and suddenly 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.060
 the slope like he does not want to enter and the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.110
 throw efe as it says let's go do not be me 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.209
 and we're all left with that ace that 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.489
 draw a square then what 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.580
 means in English this and square that does not 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.069
 I know it's a pain in the ass then this sends 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.840
 square and square means a square 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.940
 literally but also in that sense 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.370
 of tomb and square men as you help 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.560
 also to things that have been there in 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.519
 the air because to see them not 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.519
 illustrations are yours 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.190
 you can not call if the illustrations 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.049
 it's mine that I've always liked a lot 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.220
 draw and here in this book the wta is 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.880
 that I have been able to gather everything that 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.620
 like 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.989
 the English that I love the drawing that 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.609
 I love it and my friend Alberto that I 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.010
 love everything together 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.270
 We have been able to do it for almost 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.340
 two years that we have worked hard 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.960
 because it's not easy to do is true 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.340
 that has cost us a lot of work on 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.040
 everything to organize because we are a 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.920
 little disaster 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.840
 and in the end we have achieved it with a lot 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.730
 the drawings also another thing that the 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.760
 drawings are not there to put a drawing 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.040
 Each drawing has its purpose because it 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.870
 helps to cut something is a character 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.280
 then there is nothing and by chance not 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.070
 we put a drawing to fill the 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.140
 page was not a drawing we say yes 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.120
 they associate this because never and that is a 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.860
 little of the characters for example to see 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.690
 tell us to move forward so that they center 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.980
 In more desire to buy it there are many 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.560
 famous people whether they are athletes 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.570
 singers whose last names have a 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.310
 meaning that we know 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.740
 clear tom cruise for example tomás 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.570
 cruise then like this more cruise 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.640
 what we do we choose tom cruise and 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.220
 we put you driving a cruise and that 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.770
 way to be visual there are many people who 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.870
 has better visual memory than elective 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.850
 auditory because with this we are going to make 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.610
 stay much better or alicia keys 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.790
 for example but it's a name opened for 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.190
 appropriate for the boat is a lightning 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.230
 then the fastest guy in the world 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.420
 it has the best name in the world will 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.940
 Come on is a perfect name for him 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.630
 another way to say lightning bolts is 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.270
 flash is worth as the flash superior that 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.580
 have if you notice a lightning here in 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.700
 the chest that is called flash for that but 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.280
 your life was to be your phase the verb that 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.420
 is to make an exhibitionism then the 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.460
 book you will find a drawing of the 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.880
 silver superhero doing and teaching 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.330
 the fun 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.310
 it has to be fun good already for 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.170
 finish to see if it really works 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.630
 web that we're a bit clueless I'm going to 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.130
 call my partner nacho hernandez and 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.380
 I 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.210
 and I want you to give us a test to see 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.320
 if we have read it well we have to 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.880
 pay a little more attention because 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.470
 we are very clueless although we are going to 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.780
 start with the basic one in which you said 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:25.490
 you before, how do you say snowflake and 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.740
 reason to people who do not know let's see 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.650
 I have been told that the flex 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.310
 they are not cornflakes and that's fine with 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:46.160
 that's fine so yes snow snow 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:49.440
 snow and cheer in English cheer up you know 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.970
 encourage somebody the leader of cheerleaders 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.970
 it's called milk 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.620
 if it is animated 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:59.850
 very well 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.010
 come and the last one we are not going to put it 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.280
 difficult come and see how it is said 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:08.610
 noon and I do not want you to say so 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.470
 so I'm not going to teach you and I'm going to 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.870
 let the birds are worth as they say 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.729
 good afternoon and says rafter 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.580
 exactly if you think about the word 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:19.949
 kurt afternoon means good after 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.330
 after noon you know why the 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.310
 late is what goes after noon 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.310
 that's how the super Englishmen think 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.990
 logically then good afternoon is 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:33.270
 good after noon therefore 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.830
 half a day is said and if a lot of information 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.389
 the book is very well pérez much 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.889
 information what he tells me is also 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.479
 that goes very fast slowly postures 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.919
 quiet 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:42.500
 the first thing he puts in the first 

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.639
 pages that you have to read slowly 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.680
 enjoy it and little by little in another 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.510
 meaning I say leave it in the bathroom is the 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.460
 perfect site you know why you're there 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.110
