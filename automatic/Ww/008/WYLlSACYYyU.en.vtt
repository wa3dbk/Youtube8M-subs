00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
you do not need to improve that their

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.440 
you do not need to improve that their

quality will start to decline simply

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.920 
quality will start to decline simply
because<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.580> are<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:26.730> making<00:02:27.630> any<00:02:27.810> changes

get them to improve their content if you

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.720 
get them to improve their content if you
give<00:03:08.730> them<00:03:08.940> feedback<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:10.490> obviously<00:03:11.490> they

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
give them feedback and obviously they

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.820 
give them feedback and obviously they
have<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.540> incorporate<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.320> feedback

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
but if you give them feedback and they

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.990 
but if you give them feedback and they
take<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.560> heart<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:16.890> they<00:03:17.040> really<00:03:17.400> do<00:03:17.610> use

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
take it to heart and they really do use

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.840 
take it to heart and they really do use
it<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.740> is<00:03:19.950> how<00:03:20.130> their<00:03:20.340> content

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850

that my viewers liked and they told me
that<00:04:01.200> they<00:04:01.680> liked<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.130> specific<00:04:02.850> thing<00:04:03.060> I

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
that they liked that specific thing I

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.300 
that they liked that specific thing I
definitely<00:04:04.080> tried<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.500> incorporate<00:04:04.770> that<00:04:05.160> in

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
definitely tried to incorporate that in

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.550 
definitely tried to incorporate that in
the<00:04:05.370> future<00:04:05.580> video<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.930> tried<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.170> improve

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
the future video and I tried to improve

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.380 
the future video and I tried to improve
it<00:04:07.740> as<00:04:07.860> well<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.250> make<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.610> better<00:04:08.910> because

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
it as well to make that better because

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.000 
it as well to make that better because
it<00:04:09.570> was<00:04:09.750> something<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.140> they<00:04:10.350> enjoyed<00:04:10.710> and

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
it was something that they enjoyed and

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.580 
it was something that they enjoyed and
obviously<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.180> inverse<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.780> true<00:04:12.810> where<00:04:13.320> if

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
obviously the inverse is true where if

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.920 
obviously the inverse is true where if
there's<00:04:14.520> something<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.090> they<00:04:15.360> did<00:04:15.510> not<00:04:15.660> like

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
there's something that they did not like

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.410 
there's something that they did not like
in<00:04:16.170> one<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.530> my<00:04:16.680> videos<00:04:16.850> then<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.880> will

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
in one of my videos then I will

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.930 
in one of my videos then I will
constantly<00:04:18.840> try<00:04:19.170> to<00:04:19.200> improve<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.070> make

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
constantly try to improve that and make

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.850 
constantly try to improve that and make
it<00:04:20.970> something<00:04:21.390> that<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.989> bearable<00:04:22.470> make<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
it something that is bearable make it

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.250
