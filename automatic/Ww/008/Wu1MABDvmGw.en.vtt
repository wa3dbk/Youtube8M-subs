00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
pairing to put the vegan firmware onto

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.710 
pairing to put the vegan firmware onto
this<00:02:24.890> device<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.060> what<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.239> going<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.420> do<00:02:26.569> is

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
this device so what I'm going to do is

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.150 
this device so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:26.840> actually<00:02:26.900> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.230> clear<00:02:27.560> out<00:02:27.770> all<00:02:28.069> of

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
I'm actually going to clear out all of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.839 
I'm actually going to clear out all of
my<00:02:28.660> clockworkmod<00:02:29.660> backups<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.520> way<00:02:31.700> I'm

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
my clockworkmod backups and the way I'm

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.610 
my clockworkmod backups and the way I'm
going<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.180> do<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.930> I'm<00:02:33.290> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> go

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
going to do that and I'm going to go

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.720 
going to do that and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.800> show<00:02:34.040> how<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
ahead and show how to do that on the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.170 
ahead and show how to do that on the
computer<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:37.340> I'm<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.580> change<00:02:37.880> focus

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
computer so I'm going to change focus

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.740 
computer so I'm going to change focus
from<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.989> G<00:02:39.170> tablet<00:02:39.620> over<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.069> my<00:02:40.160> computer

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
from the G tablet over to my computer

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.350 
from the G tablet over to my computer
right<00:02:41.750> there<00:02:42.019> where<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.230> says<00:02:42.260> clockworkmod

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
right there where it says clockworkmod

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.640 
right there where it says clockworkmod
that's<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.540> folder<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.080> want<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.349> go<00:02:45.470> into

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
that's the folder we want to go into

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.690 
that's the folder we want to go into
right<00:02:46.580> here<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:48.860> go<00:02:49.010> into<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.190> clockwork<00:02:49.550> mod

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
right here so I go into a clockwork mod

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.030 
right here so I go into a clockwork mod
folder<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.300> then<00:02:50.360> into<00:02:50.989> backup<00:02:51.230> which<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.890> up

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
folder and then into backup which is up

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.090 
folder and then into backup which is up
at<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.310> top<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:53.200> right<00:02:54.200> now<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.380> only<00:02:54.500> have<00:02:54.739> one

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
at the top and right now I only have one

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.030 
at the top and right now I only have one
back<00:02:55.340> up<00:02:55.580> there<00:02:56.330> I'm<00:02:57.319> going<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.590> take<00:02:57.769> that<00:02:57.920> out

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
back up there I'm going to take that out

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.490 
back up there I'm going to take that out
of<00:02:58.069> here<00:02:58.310> anyway<00:02:58.730> only<00:02:59.540> because<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:00.170> want<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
of here anyway only because I want the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.460 
of here anyway only because I want the
space<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:02.330> I've<00:03:02.420> got<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> folder<00:03:03.080> right<00:03:03.290> over

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
space so I've got a folder right over

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.240 
space so I've got a folder right over
here<00:03:03.860> called<00:03:04.340> backups<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.799> when<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:06.890> says<00:03:07.069> gee

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
here called backups and when it says gee

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.089 
here called backups and when it says gee
tab<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.730> as<00:03:07.849> you<00:03:07.940> can<00:03:08.090> see<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.569> have<00:03:09.140> quite<00:03:10.040> a

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
tab and as you can see I have quite a

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.449 
tab and as you can see I have quite a
few<00:03:10.239> backups<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.540> I've<00:03:12.230> been<00:03:12.380> keeping<00:03:12.620> now

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
few backups that I've been keeping now

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.330 
few backups that I've been keeping now
an<00:03:13.580> average<00:03:13.910> my<00:03:14.120> backups<00:03:14.569> are<00:03:14.720> running<00:03:15.340> there

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
an average my backups are running there

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.020 
an average my backups are running there
it<00:03:16.489> looks<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.819> around<00:03:18.310> 366<00:03:19.310> megabytes<00:03:19.760> for

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
it looks like around 366 megabytes for

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.560 
it looks like around 366 megabytes for
this<00:03:20.180> one<00:03:21.790> that's<00:03:22.790> because<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.329> a<00:03:23.359> lot<00:03:23.390> of

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
this one that's because I have a lot of

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.039 
this one that's because I have a lot of
stuff<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.140> guess<00:03:24.380> gets<00:03:25.040> backed<00:03:25.280> up<00:03:25.840> as<00:03:26.840> you

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
stuff that I guess gets backed up as you

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.660 
stuff that I guess gets backed up as you
see<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.320> goes<00:03:27.500> pretty<00:03:27.650> quickly<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.310> mean<00:03:28.549> this

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
see it goes pretty quickly I mean this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.280 
see it goes pretty quickly I mean this
is<00:03:28.730> transferring<00:03:29.299> right<00:03:29.480> from<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.780> G<00:03:29.900> tablet

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
is transferring right from the G tablet

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.120 
is transferring right from the G tablet
right<00:03:30.410> now<00:03:30.590> as<00:03:31.489> soon<00:03:31.700> as<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.090> done<00:03:33.130> I'm

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
right now as soon as that is done I'm

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.729 
right now as soon as that is done I'm
going<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.760> actually<00:03:36.010> load<00:03:37.010> up<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:40.310> latest

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
going to actually load up the the latest

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.059

flashing my G tablet with that so that's

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.069 
flashing my G tablet with that so that's
going<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.819> be<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:49.970> separate<00:03:50.359> video<00:03:50.510> from<00:03:50.930> this

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
going to be a separate video from this

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.259 
going to be a separate video from this
one<00:03:51.319> with<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:52.400> video<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.700> just<00:03:52.850> want<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.120> kind

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.970 
one with this video I just want to kind
of<00:03:53.389> touch<00:03:54.049> on<00:03:54.290> some<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.620> things<00:03:54.769> in<00:03:54.920> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
of touch on some of the things in the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.800 
of touch on some of the things in the

notification bar alerts and I guess I

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.789 
notification bar alerts and I guess I
also<00:03:59.959> wanted<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.260> discuss<00:04:00.620> about<00:04:02.560> removing<00:04:03.560> or

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
also wanted to discuss about removing or

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.000 
also wanted to discuss about removing or
