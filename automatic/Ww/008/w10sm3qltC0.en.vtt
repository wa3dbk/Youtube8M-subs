00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everyone , Alexander and the channel 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.639
 private technology has come with us 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 the repair process is such a period when 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:22.380
 we will need to cut in drywall 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.890
 square hole what are we for this 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.500
 make the beginning and pencil outlines 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.710
 contours for we need holes and dog 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.510
 cardboard we already plastered here 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.960
 you can manage this hole 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.200
 1 way is possible in several ways 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.200
 so take just such a small nail file 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.219
 well or hacksaw blade can be taken from 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.050
 big hacksaw that goes for metal 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.539
 also break off a piece here then we take 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.590
 drill 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:04.439
 bore a hole either two or 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.040
 three holes so in a row then insert 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.670
 in this hole in this nail file and start 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 So prescribe this one way well, I'm with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.110
 I use for example this way 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.930
 I have this hacksaw 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.729
 usually a hacksaw is just she 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.439
 small here has this form 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.450
 me here 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:32.670
 hacksaw this ends up with one 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.890
 tines he and here's a sharp prong 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.670
 I start drinking without any drills without 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.549
 holes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.920
 water code I put a prong on the line I put 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.530
 a prong on a line like this 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.530
 spend spent 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:13.660
 on scratching it to them 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:17.620
 start and so quietly knock out those 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.680
 one tooth we will need you script 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.310
 so that we have a hacksaw passed through 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.670
 here it is with us and now my sword 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.670
 and so on line video 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.519
 quietly will not help much escaped 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.519
 papers 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.000
 from cardboard 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:56.590
 here we have reached its end up now 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.849

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:05.329
 modifying up but sawed off one 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.799
 the side is doing the same thing then 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.799
 this side is this 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:35.470
