 or at a tobacconist's in your area or at the gvb counter 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.680
 on the bus and the trend I think you can only buy more expensive deventer tickets

 You can buy different OV chip card 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.440
 for example, these are all disposable chip cards 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.040
 great to use for short periods 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 for example for 24 hours 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560
 main village 48 hours 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.100
 after putting a disposable chip card, it is exactly how long the ticket is valid 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 in the bus and the trend and charlene bad luck you have marinated and 24 year old ticket 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.150
 to buy 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.210
 so in the night 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 you can only buy a midnight mass ticket 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.439
 the price that often with public transportation 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.750
 also a little better and OV chip card purchase that is valid longer 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.319
 an anonymous public transport chip card, for example, it is four to five years 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.229
 valid 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.849
 there is no names on this card 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.039
 the card can therefore be used by several people 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.989
 but the anonymous public transport chip card 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.469
 that cannot be used by multiple people at the same time 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.969
 if you are two 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.189
 van and now traveling companion need their own public transport chip card 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.809

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.749
 this card is valid for five years 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:50.529
 For example, you need a personal OV chip card if you have a week 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.639
 buy a month or an annual subscription 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.060
 if you go at a cheaper rate that travels like with children up to 12 years old 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:00.089
 65+ 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.720
 anonymous card and a personal card 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.629
