00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
here's why you worked so hard on this

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.350 
here's why you worked so hard on this
piece<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.040> art<00:00:05.280> and<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.760> want<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.000> protect<00:00:06.120> it

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:06.360

piece of art and you want to protect it
for<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.570> long<00:00:06.750> time<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.110> want<00:00:07.260> to<00:00:07.320> make<00:00:07.410> sure<00:00:07.440> it

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:07.650 
for a long time you want to make sure it

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.020 
for a long time you want to make sure it

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
lasts and it's permanent

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.060 
lasts and it's permanent
because<00:00:09.450> varnishing<00:00:10.049> protects<00:00:10.440> from<00:00:10.679> dirt

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
because varnishing protects from dirt

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.789 
because varnishing protects from dirt
dust<00:00:11.910> abrasion<00:00:12.839> it<00:00:13.169> also<00:00:13.289> is<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.589> to<00:00:13.650> boost

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
dust abrasion it also is going to boost

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.589 
dust abrasion it also is going to boost
the<00:00:14.009> color<00:00:14.219> saturation<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:15.059> your<00:00:15.179> pain<00:00:15.389> and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the color saturation in your pain and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.410 
the color saturation in your pain and
it's<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> unify<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> sheen<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:18.120> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
it's going to unify the sheen all the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.270 
it's going to unify the sheen all the

apply the varnish the non-removable
range<00:00:42.659> is<00:00:42.839> called<00:00:43.050> solu<00:00:43.530> bar<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.219> comes<00:00:44.550> in

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
range is called solu bar it comes in

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.270 
range is called solu bar it comes in
gloss<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.569> matte<00:00:46.230> finishes<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.190> be

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
gloss and matte finishes they can be

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.189 
gloss and matte finishes they can be
thinner<00:00:47.519> mixed<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.210> create<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:48.510> satin<00:00:48.870> finish

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
thinner mixed it's create a satin finish

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.009 
thinner mixed it's create a satin finish
and<00:00:49.319> solu<00:00:50.159> bar<00:00:50.370> means<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> solvent-based

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
and solu bar means it's a solvent-based

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.229 
and solu bar means it's a solvent-based
varnish<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:53.010> where<00:00:53.159> the<00:00:53.219> name<00:00:53.429> comes<00:00:53.670> from

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
varnish that's where the name comes from

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
varnish that's where the name comes from
so<00:00:54.659> it's<00:00:54.809> removable<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:56.039> mineral<00:00:56.519> spirits

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so it's removable with mineral spirits

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.059 
so it's removable with mineral spirits
so<00:00:57.420> later<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.719> down<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> road<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.889> should

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
so later on down the road if you should

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.829 
so later on down the road if you should
get<00:00:59.219> an<00:00:59.309> abrasion<00:00:59.850> or<00:00:59.999> something<00:01:00.389> else<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
get an abrasion or something else on the

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.989 
get an abrasion or something else on the
painting<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.559> remove<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> good

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
painting you can remove it it's a good

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:04.939 
painting you can remove it it's a good
idea<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> put<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.600> isolation<00:01:04.290> coat<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
idea to put an isolation coat down or a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.880 
idea to put an isolation coat down or a
barrier<00:01:05.219> coat<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.149> that<00:01:06.329> means<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.079> you<00:01:07.740> can

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
barrier coat what that means is you can

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.889 
barrier coat what that means is you can
put<00:01:08.070> something<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.399> liquid<00:01:09.270> X<00:01:09.420> gloss<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
put something like liquid X gloss to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.240 
put something like liquid X gloss to
medium<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.229> varnish<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> surface<00:01:11.219> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
medium and varnish on the surface of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.870 
medium and varnish on the surface of
your<00:01:11.369> painting

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
your painting

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.539 
your painting
that'll<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.390> non<00:01:12.600> removable<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.829> soluble<00:01:14.250> on

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that'll be non removable with soluble on

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
that'll be non removable with soluble on
top<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.149> if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.539> need<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> remove<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
top of that if you need to remove this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.840 
top of that if you need to remove this
all<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.829> are<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.039> you<00:01:17.159> need<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.399> remove<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
all you are if you need to remove that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.730 
all you are if you need to remove that
layer<00:01:18.090> you'll<00:01:18.600> never<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.079> get<00:01:19.439> down<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
layer you'll never actually get down to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.380 
layer you'll never actually get down to
the<00:01:19.829> paint<00:01:20.070> layer<00:01:20.250> only<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> isolation

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the paint layer only of that isolation

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.029 
the paint layer only of that isolation
coat<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.259> your<00:01:22.350> painting<00:01:22.649> is<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> be

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
coat so your painting is going to be

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.950 
coat so your painting is going to be
protected<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.329> an<00:01:24.479> important<00:01:24.930> thing

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
protected and that's an important thing

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.230 
protected and that's an important thing
if<00:01:25.259> they're<00:01:25.409> gonna<00:01:25.500> last<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.950> long<00:01:26.130> time<00:01:26.399> when

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
if they're gonna last a long time when

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
if they're gonna last a long time when
you<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.479> varnish<00:01:27.930> choose<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> dedicated

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you do varnish choose a dedicated

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
you do varnish choose a dedicated
varnish<00:01:29.670> brush<00:01:29.969> what<00:01:30.539> I<00:01:30.570> mean<00:01:30.750> by<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.899> is

don't use it for something else don't

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.240 
don't use it for something else don't
