00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to all the background friends on 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.730
 italia.com magazine we are back in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 company of nokia lumia 920 this time 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.070
 I want to focus on the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.590
 playability of the various titles released 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.050
 for windows phone 8 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 I must say that all the titles I have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.680
 downloaded run very very much 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 well 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.300
 let's see wakfu dvd with a sky 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.300
 the game that was released today 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.300
 ok we are not easy then me 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.489
 I'll show you a little bit more 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.200
 complicated to see how it behaves 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.960
 also the touch screen 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.520
 when we have to give more commands 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.690
 repeatedly as you can see this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 it's very simple 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.790
 michele we return to the map we pass a 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.450
 level a little bit more complicated 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.740
 where the obstacles are a little bit more 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.740
 closer 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.260
 it must also be said that my readiness 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 of reflexes and almost equal to zero 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.230
 so if something is wrong sometimes 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.760
 or I lose a few coins is not a fault 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.760
 of the touch but that pavia 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:47.119
 however you can see the fluidity and 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.789
 very good short, the graphics of the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.000
 new games 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:55.280
 we say it's really really good we can 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.490
 a racing game that I think are 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.250
 those that make it better to show 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 the performance of both the processor and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.380
 of the ram memory we see if 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.750
 I can take another car this 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.549
 is asphalt 5 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.819
 unfortunately on the other platforms 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.750
 android and ios we are already in seventh 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.819
 asphalt chapter here we are left 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.400
 again to asphalt 5 but will soon arrive 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.880
 however also the last one 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.880
 chapter 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.430
 good command response here too 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.430
 when we use the accelerometer 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.819
 I run just like this for less than 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.239
 half a little bit even the times of 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.239
 video 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.050
 rEGGIO 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.239
 I dreamed of some positions are not 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.680
 shortcuts 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:15.310
 ok, however, as you have seen 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.120
 does not give any indication of stumbling 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.109
 ag 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.349
 ok now let's see fruit ninja 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.210
 so at least we understand even a little bit 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.210
 how multitouch behaves 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.530
 here too trial version 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.490
 as you can see it works at 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.490
 multitouch and three touches 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.420
 stops at 3 everything on this game 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.880
 anyway it was just to let you see that 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.710
 a multitouch works very well 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.430
 well 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:15.009
 what to say happy with the games 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.889
 I just hope to see some of them soon 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.379
 exclusively for this new windows 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.089
 phone 8 then developed with developed 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.580
 with the new code 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:27.659
 and with the new bees of the new system 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.919
 operating system 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.360
 I would say, however, that it has now ended 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.990
 continued to follow both ours 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.089
 YouTube channel is our blog 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.389
 a greeting from stefano and the next video 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.389
 Hello
