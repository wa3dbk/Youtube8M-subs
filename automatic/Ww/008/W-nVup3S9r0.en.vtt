of the things like I was saying earlier
I<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.899> noticed<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.500> most<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:46.860> are

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950

some<00:00:47.070> teams<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.539> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
some teams there I think the one that

or 900 can I want to say that was a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479 
or 900 can I want to say that was a
Manchester<00:00:52.289> United<00:00:52.500> go<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> biggest

really really dramatic I don't know if
that's<00:01:51.090> gonna<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.420> final<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.049> they<00:01:52.170> are

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that's gonna be final because they are

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.080 
that's gonna be final because they are
really<00:01:52.590> quite<00:01:52.890> big<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.579> they<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> just

like<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> said<00:03:02.500> pretty<00:03:02.620> dramatic<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.340> then<00:03:03.640> we

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
like I said pretty dramatic and then we

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.819 
like I said pretty dramatic and then we
have<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.030> other<00:03:04.269> half<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.930> Manchester<00:03:05.650> that's

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
have the other half of Manchester that's

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.190 
have the other half of Manchester that's
Manchester<00:03:06.310> United<00:03:06.819> they<00:03:07.209> have<00:03:07.360> got<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> nice

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
Manchester United they have got a nice

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.869 
Manchester United they have got a nice
little<00:03:08.349> increase<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.920> around<00:03:09.099> 6<00:03:09.400> million<00:03:09.760> on

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
little increase of around 6 million on

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.069 
little increase of around 6 million on
the<00:03:09.970> transfer<00:03:10.360> budget<00:03:10.660> I'm<00:03:10.750> sure<00:03:10.900> there'll<00:03:11.049> be

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
the transfer budget I'm sure there'll be

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.780 
the transfer budget I'm sure there'll be
no<00:03:11.319> complaints<00:03:11.769> there<00:03:11.920> but<00:03:12.250> that's<00:03:12.340> still<00:03:12.640> not

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
no complaints there but that's still not

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.699 
no complaints there but that's still not
even<00:03:12.940> half<00:03:13.299> of<00:03:13.510> what<00:03:13.569> Manchester<00:03:14.200> City<00:03:14.470> have

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
even half of what Manchester City have

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.710 
even half of what Manchester City have
to<00:03:14.890> splash<00:03:15.190> out<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.700> then<00:03:16.090> their<00:03:16.239> weekly<00:03:16.480> wage

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
to splash out and then their weekly wage

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.970 
to splash out and then their weekly wage
is<00:03:16.870> very<00:03:17.049> similar<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.410> Manchester<00:03:17.950> City

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
is very similar to Manchester City

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.059 
is very similar to Manchester City
actually<00:03:18.609> just<00:03:19.060> around<00:03:19.359> 2.5<00:03:20.319> million<00:03:20.769> and

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
actually just around 2.5 million and

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.640 
actually just around 2.5 million and
they've<00:03:21.310> actually<00:03:21.459> gone<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:21.850> by<00:03:22.000> around

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
they've actually gone up by around

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.890 
they've actually gone up by around
600,000<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:24.310> week<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> weekly<00:03:25.180> wages<00:03:25.389> so<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.750> get

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
600,000 a week a weekly wages so you get

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.300 
600,000 a week a weekly wages so you get
to<00:03:25.989> spend<00:03:26.170> lots<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.470> money<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.859> give<00:03:27.160> your

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
to spend lots of money and give your

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.099 
to spend lots of money and give your
players<00:03:27.579> lots<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.970> money<00:03:28.150> fun<00:03:28.359> fun<00:03:28.630> times<00:03:28.930> and

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
players lots of money fun fun times and

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.170 
players lots of money fun fun times and
then<00:03:29.470> Newcastle<00:03:30.069> here<00:03:30.250> I've<00:03:30.519> gone<00:03:30.730> on<00:03:30.790> by<00:03:30.970> just

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
then Newcastle here I've gone on by just

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.879 
then Newcastle here I've gone on by just
a<00:03:31.269> 1<00:03:31.420> million<00:03:31.750> which<00:03:31.930> seems<00:03:32.200> about<00:03:32.440> right<00:03:32.500> and

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
a 1 million which seems about right and

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.530 
a 1 million which seems about right and
then<00:03:33.340> their<00:03:33.549> weekly<00:03:33.880> wages<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.299> actually

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
then their weekly wages have actually

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.970 
then their weekly wages have actually
gone<00:03:34.630> off<00:03:34.810> quite<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.079> bit<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.440> they've<00:03:35.620> gone

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
gone off quite a bit and they've gone

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.710 
gone off quite a bit and they've gone
over<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.549> 1<00:03:36.700> million<00:03:37.060> marker<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.480> I'm<00:03:37.569> sure

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
over the 1 million marker and I'm sure

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.819 
over the 1 million marker and I'm sure
you<00:03:37.810> guys<00:03:37.959> will<00:03:37.989> be<00:03:38.200> able<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.410> find<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.650> really

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
you guys will be able to find a really

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.129 
you guys will be able to find a really
nice<00:03:39.010> balance<00:03:39.459> between<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.790> two<00:03:40.060> moving<00:03:40.959> on

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
nice balance between the two moving on

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.319 
nice balance between the two moving on
though<00:03:41.530> we<00:03:41.950> now<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.370> Norwich<00:03:42.760> City<00:03:43.030> they've

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
though we now have Norwich City they've

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.539 
though we now have Norwich City they've
again<00:03:43.780> not<00:03:44.049> had<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.440> biggest<00:03:44.859> of<00:03:45.069> increases

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
again not had the biggest of increases

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.710 
again not had the biggest of increases
but<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.819> don't<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.060> expect<00:03:46.209> something

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
but you don't really expect something

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.780 
but you don't really expect something
like<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:47.049> they've<00:03:47.410> gone<00:03:47.560> up<00:03:47.709> by<00:03:47.829> 1.5<00:03:48.459> million

said<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:44.110> lot<00:05:44.409> of<00:05:44.469> these<00:05:44.650> numbers<00:05:45.009> are<00:05:45.129> really

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
said a lot of these numbers are really

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.529 
said a lot of these numbers are really
big<00:05:45.520> so<00:05:45.669> I'm<00:05:45.729> not<00:05:45.849> entirely<00:05:46.089> sure<00:05:46.240> if<00:05:46.419> they're

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
big so I'm not entirely sure if they're

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.850 
big so I'm not entirely sure if they're
gonna<00:05:46.599> be<00:05:46.810> final<00:05:47.139> I<00:05:47.169> kind<00:05:47.409> of<00:05:47.440> hope<00:05:47.589> they<00:05:47.740> are

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
gonna be final I kind of hope they are

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.200 
gonna be final I kind of hope they are
it<00:05:48.190> just<00:05:48.219> means<00:05:48.490> we<00:05:48.639> get<00:05:48.729> to<00:05:48.789> spend<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.120> little

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
it just means we get to spend a little

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.570 
it just means we get to spend a little
bit<00:05:49.419> more<00:05:49.629> money<00:05:49.810> on<00:05:49.930> our<00:05:50.139> players<00:05:50.409> but<00:05:50.979> yeah

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
bit more money on our players but yeah

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.890 
bit more money on our players but yeah
just<00:05:51.849> keep<00:05:52.120> that<00:05:52.210> in<00:05:52.270> mind<00:05:52.330> maybe<00:05:52.569> take<00:05:52.810> it

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
just keep that in mind maybe take it

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.420 
just keep that in mind maybe take it
with<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.050> bit<00:05:53.199> of<00:05:53.229> a<00:05:53.319> pinch<00:05:53.469> of<00:05:53.589> with<00:05:54.069> a<00:05:54.099> pinch<00:05:54.310> of
