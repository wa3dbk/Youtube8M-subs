 relationships on demand and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.670
 offers as well as differentiates 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.840
 commodity producers using 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:41.330
 competition at the heart of the market mechanism 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.990
 There are such things as a sentence 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.520
 demand and price 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.520
 let's look at them in more detail 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.990
 demand is the quantity of goods and services 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:00.840
 which buyers wish to purchase 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.880
 the law of demand states the demand for goods 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.040
 changes inversely to 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:14.070
 prices , the lower the price the higher 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:20.370
 demand for the product the higher the price the 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.680
 correspondingly less demand supply 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.540
 the amount of goods and services that 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.140
 manufacturers wish to sell or 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:32.850
 offer the law of supply on the market 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.400
 the volume of supply of goods varies in 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.280
 direct dependence on price changes 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.290
 here all the way around, respectively, than 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.290
 the higher the price the higher the offer 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.830
 the result of the interaction of demand and 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.920
 offers are set by the market 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.920
 price 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.200
 it should be noted that the law is market 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.780
 hence the pricing states that 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.630
 archers on seeking to this level 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.560
 at which you demand was equal 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.560
 sentence 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.550
 The following market laws 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.560
 pricing 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:22.450
 if three increase in demand is not supply 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:26.870
 will change in this case the price will increase 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.730
 that is, if for example the store is sharp 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.950
 increased demand for yogurt certain 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.290
 the brand is accordingly the store is very 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.230
 quickly raise its price if 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:41.330
 on the contrary, the supply will decrease 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:45.230
 it will be less with constant demand 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.460
 then the same price will increase accordingly 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.350
 for example, let's say it became less 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.430
 yogurt makers in demand 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.620
 stayed right there 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.620
 and, accordingly, the price will also grow 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.060
 now consider the opposite situation 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.380
 we invariably offer and demand 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.580
 decreased in this case the price too 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.890
 will decrease 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.340
 but again let's get on the same yogurt 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.980
 then let's say when you come to the store 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.650
 and see a huge variety of yogurt 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.470
 Well, let's say buyers stopped there 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.330
 buy let's say these yogurt they became 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.669
 buy less overstock 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.480
 in this case the store is natural 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:35.630
 reduce the amount or vice versa if we have 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.800
 again constant supply and demand 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.310
 we will grow then again the price too 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.310
 will decrease
