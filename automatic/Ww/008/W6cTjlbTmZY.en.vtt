was someone had replaced it bought this
and<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.890> person<00:00:41.219> did<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:41.460> describe<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.149> very

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and the person did not describe it very

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
and the person did not describe it very
well<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:43.320> said<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.920> know<00:00:44.010> everything<00:00:44.370> was

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
well they said you know everything was

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.170 
well they said you know everything was
working<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.629> fine<00:00:46.550> there's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> headstock

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
working it was fine there's a headstock

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
working it was fine there's a headstock
very<00:00:48.570> cool<00:00:48.870> shape<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> try<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.789> read

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
very cool shape you can try and read

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.270 
very cool shape you can try and read
Galante<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.070> good<00:00:53.219> condition

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
Galante and so it was in good condition

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.680 
Galante and so it was in good condition
but<00:00:55.309> it's<00:00:56.309> most<00:00:56.550> certainly<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.570> can

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
but it's most certainly not as you can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.389 
but it's most certainly not as you can
see<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> front<00:00:58.350> looks<00:00:58.590> okay

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
see the front looks okay

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.360 
see the front looks okay
but<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.930> look<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.980> see<00:01:02.160> all

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
but if you really look you can see all

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
but if you really look you can see all
the<00:01:02.730> checking<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> entire<00:01:04.619> front<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> doing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the checking the entire front is doing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.570 
the checking the entire front is doing
that<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:07.130> another<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> sides<00:01:10.580> this

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that now another thing is the sides this

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
that now another thing is the sides this
base<00:01:11.880> has<00:01:12.150> gone<00:01:12.420> through<00:01:12.689> everything<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.439> can

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
base has gone through everything you can

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.940 
base has gone through everything you can
imagine<00:01:14.360> I'm<00:01:15.360> assuming<00:01:15.960> since<00:01:16.380> I've<00:01:16.590> only<00:01:16.710> had

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
imagine I'm assuming since I've only had

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.840 
imagine I'm assuming since I've only had
it<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.330> about<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.450> month<00:01:19.009> again<00:01:20.009> entire<00:01:20.549> back

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it for about a month again entire back

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.390 
it for about a month again entire back
is<00:01:20.880> checking<00:01:21.320> no<00:01:22.320> cracks<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:23.159> in

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
is checking no cracks are actually in

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.940 
is checking no cracks are actually in
the<00:01:23.700> wood<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:24.780> solid<00:01:25.049> base<00:01:25.909> I

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
the wood so it's a very solid base I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.140 
the wood so it's a very solid base I
can't<00:01:28.950> tell<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> neck<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.820> because<00:01:30.030> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
can't tell what the neck is because it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.899 
can't tell what the neck is because it
could<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> finish<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.140> aged<00:01:31.619> but

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
could be just a finish that's aged but

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.660 
could be just a finish that's aged but
most<00:01:32.909> likely<00:01:33.560> maple<00:01:34.560> possibly<00:01:35.189> mahogany

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
most likely maple possibly mahogany
