00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Hi, how are you girls, I know that 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.440
 It will be done and you life is not 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.090
 pink 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.190
 [Applause] 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.510
 to you has also happened and if not 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.350
 they know a friend who has 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.940
 past 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 we meet a boy asks us the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.040
 phone invites us to leave and we started 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.730
 to leave a week two weeks a month 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.949
 two months six months eight months and never 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.990
 asks you to be your average one good day 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.330
 you despair and the USSR goes out or the one who lives 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.039
 within you and demand clear accounts do not 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.600
 without first having passed in the past 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.920
 months of your life spinning and 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.690
 round and round and round in your head 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.220
 to know when he is going to ask you to be 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.660
 his girlfriend or if he wants his girlfriend and you do not 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.220
 you've noticed but if you know the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.840
 papÃ¡s has introduced you with friends 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.790
 round and round and round and round in 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.070
 head then you decide to put the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.930
 things clear and the boy says to you 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.520
 I'm not so interested because they do 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.649
 this because men will be able to leave 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.329
 many months with a girl and never 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.010
 formalize and then when we 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.540
 we get half pons if we start 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.850
 demand accounts and say what it is that 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.680
 It's going ok sometimes decide to let 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.629
 give us an opportunity and if they do not grab 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.370
 your little things and they go away far away 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.800
 because they do this because they can pass 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 so much time with a girl without talking about 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.020
 what is happening between you 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.100
 and make things clear 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.869
 to clarify all these issues 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.700
 we have the cameras of life is not 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.079
 pink so we went out to the streets of the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.570
 Mexico City to ask the 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.820
 guys that makes them decide to have 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.250
 bride or formalize a situation that 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.229
 they have with a girl and what is the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.429
 difference between just going out and asking 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.429
 that is his girlfriend accompany me 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.320
 and go out with her because suddenly nothing 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.720
 more is this 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 one night or once in a while and I wanted to be 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.760
 her boyfriend is obviously older 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.850
 the commitment is greater 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.430
 you also want to be sure 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.510
 with her do not give if you go out with your girlfriend 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.610
 so you take her to dinner things like that more 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.200
 I think so and when you go out 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.330
 with her and also something like partying 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.550
 just like a smart bar that knows a 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.860
 conversation topic that communication 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.630
 that there is a friendship first, not if not 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.540
 there is a friendship first of all 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.490
 is pure sex, well, no, not if you want a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 relationship with someone has to draw a 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.260
 friendship first the difference if they are the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.000
 intentions do not always come out with a 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.770
 friend taking a beer is different 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.290
 try to date someone to be 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.450
 with him not to ask him to be your girlfriend 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.070
 has many commitments to go out with the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.640
 girl has no commitment more than 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.640
 have a good time 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.209
 Well it is not called depending 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.629
 how do you get along with her chemistry 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.069
 what about the feelings that are put 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.129
 in the middle 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.230
 that there is something real or that what is 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.969
 looking for it already depends if there is 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.920
 some feeling for example because already if 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.180
 you start to love the girl or something like that 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.920
 I think good for me in my point 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.019
 view is that if you're going to walk with the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.109
 line is when there is something more than just what 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.810
 physical when already after leaving a 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.090
 time you realize that it already exists as 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 a connection not so much 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.810
 Friendship is as much as I am 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.900
 with spirit at least they are 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.209
 connected and the sexual manna is also 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.469
 the three things you know that it can be your 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.450
 new and very clearly so turn on 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.189
 with your parents is that I just do not know 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.769
 that shoots it there are no people with whom 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.359
 you connect well but for example also 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.280
 there's the matter of maybe the other 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.349
 person does not see you as a possibility 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.360
 not at all somehow from the 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.160
 principle you realize 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.710
 good using an english ism maybe 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.140
 let's say the matter at first you 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.790
 you see and see that if I continue in or that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.830
 it works that already cooperates and your functions 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.070
 then another encourages no and there's also 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.900
 people with whom you have let's say plans 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.730
 that the thing is more serious but not 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.880
 concrete never because you do not connect so much 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.069
 I do not think so, what do you think 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.879
 they have many things in common 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.370
 I mean, maybe for you 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.930
 get to formalize a relationship is 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.700
 because it already analyzes this many other 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.790
 things you already went out with that person and 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.049
 you said if I want to go out I want to have a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.819
 relationship with this person not much more 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.439
 formal says that women are 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.480
 complicated but the mind of them 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.920
 nor is it a simple place like 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.989
 they could account for none do not know 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.699
 explain exactly how many the moment 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.530
 in which they decide what a girl is going to be 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.009
 his girlfriend or that they can only go out with 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.210
 she for months without any commitment 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.310
 in which all agree is that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.289
 they need a connection a lot 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.449
 beyond the physical to be able 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.070
 formalize that relationship what seems 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.389
 remain half clear after these 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.210
 interviews is that men always 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.490
 you know if that girl goes for girlfriend or just 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.830
 they are having a good time, that is without 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.270
 commitments in my experience girls the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.380
 truth is that when a man wants 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.930
 be with us will do what 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.490
 impossible to be with us and that 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.080
 implies that he will want no other 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.699
 man can approach you is to say that 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.160
 is going to ask you to be his girlfriend for 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.169
 be able to know that only the one will be 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.000
 with the other that does not mean that no 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.169
 they can leave six eight months or a year 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.539
 with a girl with whoever 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.430
 well without formalizing anything because girls 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.800
 life is wonderful but not always 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.939

 that we asked the men or 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.029

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.919
