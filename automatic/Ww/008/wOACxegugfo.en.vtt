00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello guys today we will do 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 makeup on september so for 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.460
 start we pin up the hair and before 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.290
 applying makeup I advise you Nastya 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 some kind of light moisturizer has 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.730
 gel from faberlic it instantly 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 absorbs and lays well on it 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.619
 then foundation cream foundation i 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.449
 I take from garnier this bibi cream and many 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 I do not like him, I know, but I am very 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.800
 I like it a lot because in my opinion 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.800
 he looks very natural very 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 naturally and keeps the whole day on 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 lips on our nourishing balm to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 they have become more tender softer and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.670
 it's time to disguise hiding different 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.010
 redness around the nose with concealer and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 also try different jumps 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.410
 block and now roller 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 concealer from garnier disguise the dark 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.280
 circles under the eyes 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 to fix the foundation and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 concealer on our thin-thin 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.890
 a layer of powder is now on all moving eyelids 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.739
 down to the brow but what is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.780
 Neutral shade beige very 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.780
 close to natural skin tone 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.420
 she is the center of the moving age 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.170
 such nacreous shadows with easy 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.689
 rozovinkoy but to look more 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.420
 so deep more expressive 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.650
 slightly draw the crease of the century light 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 brown shadows 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.509
 exactly light brown shadows never 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.640
 you can't spoil everything, they look very 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.700
 naturally 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.560
 matte brown 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.740
 and with a beveled brush I begin to draw 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.110
 Brogues, first from the middle and then 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.520
 I deal with the part of the provinces that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.540
 closer to the nose 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.000
 I always have enough eyebrows 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.020
 a lot of time but this addition 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.880
 standing and where the hair is missing I 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.710
 I use special brow markers 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.979
 which is exactly drawing these 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.180
 hairs and to fix eyebrows i 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.180
 I use gel from catrice 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.380
 It seems to me that he is such an event as 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.239
 September 1 is best suited 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.730
 extension mascara and i'm using now 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.280
 just super mascara from faberlic she 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.750
 lengthens lashes very much but between 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.080
 the first and second layer must pass 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.090
 for a while now just a bronzer 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 I create such a tan effect on my face 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.730
 account nanoshu 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.319
 and on all such protruding parts 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.260
 which could naturally 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.730
 to tan 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.130
 a fluffy brush I apply such pink 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.200
 peach blush with light mother-of-pearl and 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.250
 it seems to me that from such Romans all face 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.250
 just glows from the inside 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.909
 well now it's time laying is not in 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.220
 the last time like yes hair 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.319
 just so carelessly naturally lie but 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.750
 September 1 is still better if the hair 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.970
 will somehow neatly lie like that and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.099
 neat styling this brand they can 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.049
 just straighten too to speed 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.480
 this process just needs to be divided 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.700
 hair on 2 unequal partings and first 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.040
 pull those hairs that are in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.799
 smaller volume and then straighten hair 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.900
 are at a higher level and then again 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.730
 do not even parting for dinner another 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.780
 side and repeat all these steps 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.780
 only from the other side 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.880
 that is, until we just pull out 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.190
 first that part of the hair in their smaller and 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.110
 after that we will proceed to 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.640
 that part of the hair more when Dejah 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.640
 I'm pulling it out now 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.459
 now you just have to comb your hair and 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.980
 lately I have been very strong 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.420
 like tucking one part of hair with 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.209
 one side of the ear does not seem it 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.310
 very nice on the lip will be cool to apply 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.140
 some sort of crimson for pink shine or 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.940
 balms I think you're a hundred times better 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.180
 than going to school with brightly made up 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.130
 lips and you have not forgotten about our mascara 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.319
 which we have dealt so far with only one 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.599
 layer so here the first layer is already dry and 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.349
 it's time to put the second one then yours 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:08.360
 eyelashes will be real to heaven 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.130
 This is how we ended the image with 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.230
 on the one hand it is very bright and on the other 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.310
 the parties are absolutely not defiant 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.310
 coming on September 1st 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.710
 so what a great start to you 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.790
 shine years 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.790
 and conquer new heights
