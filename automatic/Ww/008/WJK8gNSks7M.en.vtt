00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I think that's right the theme has been

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.089 
I think that's right the theme has been
in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> k2<00:00:24.630> line<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.170> quite<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> few<00:00:25.500> years<00:00:25.680> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
in the k2 line for quite a few years it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.189 
in the k2 line for quite a few years it
has<00:00:26.189> been<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> mainstays<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.960> think

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
has been one of the mainstays in I think

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.050 
has been one of the mainstays in I think
