community of learning and I think that's

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.279 
community of learning and I think that's
really<00:05:31.050> huge<00:05:31.469> in<00:05:31.919> a<00:05:32.039> school<00:05:32.309> I<00:05:33.050> honestly<00:05:34.050> can

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
really huge in a school I honestly can

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.839 
really huge in a school I honestly can
say<00:05:34.319> that<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:34.770> wake<00:05:35.009> up<00:05:35.129> in<00:05:35.249> the<00:05:35.309> morning<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.729> I

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
say that I wake up in the morning and I

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.469 
say that I wake up in the morning and I
want<00:05:36.629> to<00:05:36.809> be<00:05:36.959> here<00:05:37.199> I<00:05:37.319> come<00:05:38.270> I've<00:05:39.270> actually

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
want to be here I come I've actually

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.500 
want to be here I come I've actually
showed<00:05:40.259> up<00:05:40.379> a<00:05:40.439> few<00:05:40.589> times<00:05:40.679> early

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
showed up a few times early

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.120 
showed up a few times early
I'm<00:05:41.900> like<00:05:42.110> so<00:05:42.350> excited<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.860> get<00:05:42.950> my<00:05:43.070> day

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
I'm like so excited to get my day

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.030 
I'm like so excited to get my day
started<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.940> I<00:05:44.570> think<00:05:44.930> that<00:05:45.260> all<00:05:45.830> of<00:05:45.890> our

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
started and I think that all of our

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.710 
started and I think that all of our
teachers<00:05:46.130> share<00:05:46.730> that<00:05:46.940> sentiment<00:05:47.450> and<00:05:47.630> I

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
teachers share that sentiment and I

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.960 
teachers share that sentiment and I
think<00:05:48.050> whatever<00:05:48.260> hopefully<00:05:48.770> happens<00:05:49.250> is<00:05:49.400> the

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
think whatever hopefully happens is the

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.900 
think whatever hopefully happens is the
the<00:05:50.000> kids<00:05:50.510> pick<00:05:50.690> up<00:05:50.780> on<00:05:50.930> that<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:51.290> they<00:05:51.910> run

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
the kids pick up on that and they run

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:18.600 
the kids pick up on that and they run
with<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.390> they<00:05:53.540> all<00:05:53.660> want<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:53.930> be<00:05:54.020> here<00:05:54.170> too

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:28.900 

welcome<00:06:19.539> to<00:06:19.689> the<00:06:19.780> a<00:06:19.810> GCSE<00:06:20.409> Micro<00:06:20.889> farm

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.850 

so<00:06:29.570> what<00:06:29.750> you<00:06:29.870> have<00:06:30.050> here<00:06:30.290> is<00:06:30.410> a<00:06:30.440> variety<00:06:30.620> of

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
so what you have here is a variety of

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.320 
so what you have here is a variety of
animals<00:06:31.310> that<00:06:31.490> we'll<00:06:31.640> show<00:06:31.820> you<00:06:31.850> in<00:06:32.030> a<00:06:32.120> few

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
animals that we'll show you in a few

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.600 
animals that we'll show you in a few
minutes<00:06:32.450> and<00:06:32.870> we<00:06:33.560> have<00:06:33.770> classes<00:06:34.130> that

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
minutes and we have classes that

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.070 
minutes and we have classes that
essentially<00:06:35.150> use<00:06:35.300> this<00:06:35.450> as<00:06:35.630> their<00:06:35.780> outdoor

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
essentially use this as their outdoor

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.960 
essentially use this as their outdoor
classroom<00:06:36.680> so<00:06:36.950> the<00:06:37.040> teachers<00:06:37.370> can<00:06:37.400> come<00:06:37.790> out

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
classroom so the teachers can come out

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.120 
classroom so the teachers can come out
and<00:06:38.390> show<00:06:38.630> them<00:06:38.870> the<00:06:39.080> practical<00:06:39.590> application

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
and show them the practical application

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.080 
and show them the practical application
of<00:06:40.220> what<00:06:40.280> they're<00:06:40.580> learning<00:06:40.730> in<00:06:41.000> the

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
of what they're learning in the

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:51.619 
of what they're learning in the
classroom

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:51.629 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.360 

we<00:06:52.629> have<00:06:52.840> like<00:06:53.169> your<00:06:53.440> mayor's<00:06:53.620> in<00:06:53.860> the<00:06:54.009> future

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
we have like your mayor's in the future

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.770 
we have like your mayor's in the future
that<00:06:54.610> we<00:06:54.729> want<00:06:54.909> to<00:06:55.030> do<00:06:55.180> something<00:06:55.539> to<00:06:55.659> work

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.379 
that we want to do something to work
with<00:06:55.810> animals<00:06:56.409> then<00:06:57.009> it's<00:06:57.550> definitely<00:06:57.789> a<00:06:58.180> good

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
with animals then it's definitely a good

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.809 
with animals then it's definitely a good
thing<00:06:58.449> to<00:06:58.900> like<00:06:59.050> start<00:06:59.440> now<00:06:59.710> and<00:07:00.310> get<00:07:00.490> to<00:07:00.669> know

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
thing to like start now and get to know

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.200 
thing to like start now and get to know
everything<00:07:01.180> and<00:07:02.050> also<00:07:02.919> some<00:07:03.550> people<00:07:03.849> want<00:07:04.090> to

everything and also some people want to
like<00:07:04.479> just<00:07:05.379> you<00:07:05.740> know<00:07:05.979> farm<00:07:06.340> when<00:07:06.520> they<00:07:06.639> grow

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:06.849 
like just you know farm when they grow

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:08.369 
like just you know farm when they grow
up<00:07:06.909> for<00:07:07.449> example<00:07:07.780> I<00:07:07.870> don't

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:08.379 
up for example I don't

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:10.499 
up for example I don't
so<00:07:08.740> was<00:07:08.949> getting<00:07:09.250> to<00:07:09.400> know<00:07:09.550> like<00:07:09.789> in<00:07:10.060> different

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:10.509 
so was getting to know like in different

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:12.540 
so was getting to know like in different
animals<00:07:10.659> what<00:07:11.409> you<00:07:11.530> get<00:07:11.710> from<00:07:12.009> them<00:07:12.220> how<00:07:12.490> she

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
animals what you get from them how she

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:20.159 
animals what you get from them how she
care<00:07:12.970> of<00:07:13.090> them<00:07:13.270> it's<00:07:13.599> always<00:07:19.050> we<00:07:20.050> have

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
care of them it's always we have

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.080 
care of them it's always we have
multiple<00:07:20.620> pathways<00:07:20.889> for<00:07:21.490> students<00:07:21.879> in<00:07:22.060> terms

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
multiple pathways for students in terms

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.180 
multiple pathways for students in terms
of<00:07:22.389> course<00:07:22.719> leveling<00:07:23.259> so<00:07:23.650> that<00:07:23.770> we<00:07:23.949> need

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
of course leveling so that we need

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.189 
of course leveling so that we need
students<00:07:24.699> wear<00:07:24.940> their<00:07:25.180> hat<00:07:25.419> to<00:07:25.870> be<00:07:25.960> able<00:07:26.050> to

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
students wear their hat to be able to

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.469 
students wear their hat to be able to
provide<00:07:26.530> them<00:07:26.889> the<00:07:27.280> educational<00:07:27.879> experience

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 
provide them the educational experience

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.510 
provide them the educational experience
that<00:07:28.719> they<00:07:29.139> most<00:07:29.379> desire<00:07:29.560> and<00:07:30.129> are<00:07:30.219> able<00:07:30.490> to

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
that they most desire and are able to

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.780 
that they most desire and are able to
get<00:07:30.729> invested<00:07:31.629> in
