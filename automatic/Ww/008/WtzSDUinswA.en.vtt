00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.170
 i Today's high Today is a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:14.230
 It is arm of biceps arm with dop and let's all train together together 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.230
 Dumbbell offers a 10 km 6 km 3 km 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.330
 Yes 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.330
 Fix the elbow firmly 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.650
 I will raise it to 90 degrees 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.540
 The elbow is really light 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.800
 Down to a good state to say that the most extended Kittel to the state to bend 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 I am also going 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.700
 A common mistake is with dumbbells 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.200
 It is in a state of being inclined 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.330
 Don't skew the dumbbell 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.630
 Leave the firm parallel to the dumbbell to the ground 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.630
 Bang 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.520
 It is six kilometers after another 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.840
 Not to do this 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.100
 It is such a thing that man wants to do 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.890
 When we keep sound of voice one by one 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.890
 You can make body makeup efficiently 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.590
 This also we have a straight to the body 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.849
 It is also to do with the nature and sit-ups Toka chest muscle 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.849
 You stimulus go 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 Hmm 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.480
 The other party will do in the next 3 km 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.599
 Anyway, the position of the elbow 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.599
 You should not shift it 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.230
 Do not change the direction of the dumbbell 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.270
 This can stimulate quite efficiently 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.739
 Do not try hard and be heavy 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.739
 Because you should make it light positively 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.349
 If you think that you can not go further with light, it is better if you have the mind again 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.890
 It looks like it's still cool 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.360
 I will come back again 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.560
 Weight 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.330
 I think it will be tight after all 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.330
 And or lightly-mer Sukke 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.840
 Without taking a break 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.840
 You should write the weight 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:06.260
 It is the most efficient way to train by not giving a rest 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.080
 Just say 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.630
 Even if I'm really tired, I'll have to put in a reaction if I return 10 kilometers again 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.989
 I'm getting lost 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.690
 Also it's good be lightly it was Once also meaning there is no longer sound 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.570
 Light and firmly form 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.560
 do while doing age 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.940
 You can easily pump it by 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.400
 Arms 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.670
 It is in a state of swelling in the pan 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:42.500
 This Masu because with easily in this state 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:46.920
 It's okay to switch to a lighter one positively instead of forcing it. 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.139
 If it seems like you can continue going for a while then it will be heavy 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.110
 Lighten again 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.220
 If it really gets tight then take a break 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.110
 I will do it again 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.820
 I hope wooden spoon sprout in Fu say many times what set 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.639
 And lightly Once you become tight or followed by Tteyuu in the wind 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.330
 But anyway 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:12.159
 Related limits and 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.249
 Once you become when going tough just met the other this double 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:19.920
 It is the end for the first time 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:22.569
 By And then do you have to be enough even complete defeat in once a week 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.620
 Can be trained quickly 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.430
 Please try it by all means 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.430
 that's all
