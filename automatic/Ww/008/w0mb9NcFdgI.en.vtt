moon tomorrow with a two-ton bomb and

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.430 
moon tomorrow with a two-ton bomb and
they're<00:00:10.889> trying<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.219> create<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.550> five-mile

they're trying to create a five-mile
crater<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.860> moon<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.940> when<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.179> crater

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
crater on the moon and when the crater

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.500 
crater on the moon and when the crater
is<00:00:16.740> formed<00:00:17.520> there's<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> bunch<00:00:18.390> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
is formed there's going to be a bunch of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540 
is formed there's going to be a bunch of
debris<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:19.050> gets<00:00:19.109> shot<00:00:19.619> up<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.039> they're

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
debris that gets shot up and they're

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.920 
debris that gets shot up and they're
trying<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> see<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.390> there's<00:00:21.570> water<00:00:22.220> from<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
rock and if there is water then we might

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.290 
rock and if there is water then we might
be<00:00:28.920> able<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> use<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.460> water<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.939> future

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
be able to use that water for future

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.209 
be able to use that water for future
biodomes<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.199> whatever<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.740> people<00:00:32.070> can

biodomes and whatever so people can
actually<00:00:32.460> start<00:00:32.640> living<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.120> when<00:00:33.570> they

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
actually start living up there when they

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
actually start living up there when they
do<00:00:33.719> experiments<00:00:34.500> it'd<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.219> convenient<00:00:35.670> for

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
do experiments it'd be convenient for

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.750 
do experiments it'd be convenient for
the<00:00:36.230> astronauts<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.219> interesting<00:00:38.520> thing

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the astronauts but the interesting thing

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.780 
the astronauts but the interesting thing
about<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.300> debate<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:41.280> about<00:00:41.550> whether

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
about this debate is what about whether

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.030 
about this debate is what about whether
the<00:00:42.210> bomb<00:00:42.450> should<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.960> exploited<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> moon

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the bomb should be exploited on the moon

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
the bomb should be exploited on the moon
or<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.110> cording<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
or not is that the cording to this

here<00:00:48.270> there's<00:00:49.140> apparently<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.190> colonization

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
here there's apparently a colonization

here there's apparently a colonization
of<00:00:51.800> extraterrestrials<00:00:52.800> already<00:00:53.219> living<00:00:53.430> on

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the moon you might think that's crazy

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
the moon you might think that's crazy
but<00:00:56.100> apparently<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:56.969> Neil<00:00:57.210> Armstrong<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
but apparently when Neil Armstrong and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.200 
but apparently when Neil Armstrong and
Buzz<00:00:58.020> Aldrin<00:00:58.260> went<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.949> 1969<00:00:59.760> landed<00:01:00.120> on

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
Buzz Aldrin went there in 1969 landed on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.280 
Buzz Aldrin went there in 1969 landed on
the<00:01:00.300> moon<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:01.230> saw<00:01:01.770> UFOs<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.080> aliens<00:01:04.080> all

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the moon they saw UFOs and aliens all

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.399 
the moon they saw UFOs and aliens all
walking<00:01:04.589> around<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.640> flew<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.409> right

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
walking around and they flew off right

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.580 
walking around and they flew off right
when<00:01:07.590> Buzz<00:01:08.100> Aldrin<00:01:08.220> them<00:01:08.670> landed<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.990> shortly

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
when Buzz Aldrin them landed but shortly

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.490 
when Buzz Aldrin them landed but shortly
after<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.040> landed<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> moon<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
after they landed on the moon and the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.670 
after they landed on the moon and the
fear<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.790> bomb<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.869> get<00:01:16.080> shot<00:01:16.409> at

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
fear is that this bomb they get shot at

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.440 
fear is that this bomb they get shot at
the<00:01:16.920> moon<00:01:17.130> may<00:01:18.350> disrupt<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> aliens<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
the moon may disrupt the aliens and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.160 
the moon may disrupt the aliens and
might<00:01:21.450> start<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.869> global<00:01:22.049> war<00:01:22.530> or<00:01:22.710> whatever<00:01:23.030> so

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
might start a global war or whatever so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.690 
might start a global war or whatever so
just<00:01:25.170> wanted<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> ask<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.520> your

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
just wanted to ask you what your

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
just wanted to ask you what your
opinions<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.689> put<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
opinions are on that and put them in the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530 
opinions are on that and put them in the
comments<00:01:28.650> down<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.250> another<00:01:29.970> thing<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.509> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
comments down here another thing is that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.590 
comments down here another thing is that
the<00:01:31.170> u.s.<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.829> apparently<00:01:32.460> breaking<00:01:33.060> space

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the u.s. is apparently breaking space

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.530 
the u.s. is apparently breaking space
laws<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.560> didn't<00:01:34.770> even<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.100> had

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
laws which I didn't even know we had

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
laws which I didn't even know we had
them<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.290> allowed<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.470> bomb<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
them and you're not allowed to bomb the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.609 
them and you're not allowed to bomb the
moon<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> u.s.<00:01:38.939> ratified<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.780> but

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
moon and the u.s. ratified this but

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
moon and the u.s. ratified this but
they're<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> break<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> anyways<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
they're going to break it anyways I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
they're going to break it anyways I
don't<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.350> understand<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
don't really understand that and if this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.999 
don't really understand that and if this
is<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.079> scientific<00:01:47.119> knowledge<00:01:48.119> then

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
is really for scientific knowledge then

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
is really for scientific knowledge then
why<00:01:50.009> are<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.369> using<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.790> bomb<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.840> why<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.320> we

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
why are we using a bomb but why are we

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.490 
why are we using a bomb but why are we
using<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:53.369> else<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.320> know

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
using something else like a I don't know

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.190 
using something else like a I don't know
a<00:01:55.619> drill<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.070> something<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.810> because<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
a drill or something like that because a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.100 
a drill or something like that because a
bomb<00:01:58.649> seems<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.369> might<00:01:59.750> blow<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
bomb seems like it might blow up the
