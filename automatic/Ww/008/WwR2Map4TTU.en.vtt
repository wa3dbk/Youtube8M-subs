00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
released into the food so for example I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.390

pans out there that have non-toxic
coatings<00:01:00.050> there's<00:01:00.500> one<00:01:00.680> made<00:01:00.860> by<00:01:00.890> Cuisinart

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
coatings there's one made by Cuisinart

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.520 
coatings there's one made by Cuisinart
and<00:01:01.880> there's<00:01:02.090> others<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:02.930> can<00:01:03.050> also<00:01:03.200> use

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
and there's others and you can also use

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.310 
and there's others and you can also use
a<00:01:03.740> stainless<00:01:04.729> steel<00:01:04.939> pan<00:01:05.509> although<00:01:06.140> they're

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.550 
a stainless steel pan although they're
more<00:01:06.500> expensive<00:01:07.390> but<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.540> idea<00:01:08.870> is<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.110> use<00:01:09.440> a

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
more expensive but the idea is to use a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.010 
more expensive but the idea is to use a
pan<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.310> isn't<00:01:10.640> going<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> put<00:01:11.030> toxins<00:01:11.570> into

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
pan that isn't going to put toxins into

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.530 
pan that isn't going to put toxins into
your<00:01:12.140> food<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.650> above<00:01:13.400> all<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:14.090> want<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.390> stay

your food and above all you want to stay

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.570 
your food and above all you want to stay
away<00:01:14.810> from<00:01:14.870> aluminum<00:01:15.620> pans<00:01:15.890> because<00:01:16.340> they

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
away from aluminum pans because they

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.480 
away from aluminum pans because they
definitely<00:01:16.880> put<00:01:17.330> toxins<00:01:17.840> into<00:01:18.350> your<00:01:18.470> food<00:01:18.710> so

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
so your next question is probably what

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.620 
so your next question is probably what
should<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.380> stir-fry<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.970> video<00:02:20.270> isn't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
should you stir-fry and this video isn't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.740 
should you stir-fry and this video isn't
really<00:02:20.660> about<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.770> recipe<00:02:22.700> per<00:02:22.970> se<00:02:23.240> it's<00:02:23.510> about

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
really about a recipe per se it's about

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.040 
really about a recipe per se it's about
philosophy<00:02:24.200> or<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:25.100> way<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.790> approach<00:02:26.300> creating

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
philosophy or a way to approach creating

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.540 
philosophy or a way to approach creating
your<00:02:27.350> stir-fry<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:29.210> basic<00:02:30.170> idea<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:31.280> you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
your stir-fry so the basic idea is you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.250 
your stir-fry so the basic idea is you
start<00:02:31.580> with<00:02:31.820> dense<00:02:32.120> food<00:02:32.420> first<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.990> then<00:02:33.140> you

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
start with dense food first and then you

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.710 
start with dense food first and then you
work<00:02:33.470> with<00:02:33.680> less<00:02:34.220> dense<00:02:34.490> food<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.270> if<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.630> have

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
work with less dense food so if you have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600 
work with less dense food so if you have
potatoes<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:36.590> burdock<00:02:36.950> root<00:02:37.220> or<00:02:37.370> something

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
potatoes or burdock root or something

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.510 
potatoes or burdock root or something
dense<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.390> put<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.960> first<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.680> then

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
dense you put that in first and then

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.880 
dense you put that in first and then
something<00:02:41.240> less<00:02:41.570> dense<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.050> say<00:02:42.290> broccoli

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
something less dense like say broccoli

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.860 
something less dense like say broccoli
and<00:02:43.130> then<00:02:43.610> something<00:02:44.000> even<00:02:44.090> less<00:02:44.390> dense<00:02:44.660> like

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and then something even less dense like

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.530 
and then something even less dense like
leafy<00:02:45.290> greens<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.190> doesn't<00:02:46.460> matter<00:02:46.670> choose

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
leafy greens so it doesn't matter choose

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.170 
leafy greens so it doesn't matter choose
a<00:02:47.810> bunch<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.230> vegetables<00:02:48.700> dense<00:02:49.700> goes<00:02:49.970> in

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
a bunch of vegetables dense goes in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.200 
a bunch of vegetables dense goes in
first<00:02:50.420> less<00:02:51.230> dense<00:02:51.500> next<00:02:52.010> leafy<00:02:52.670> greens<00:02:52.940> are

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
first less dense next leafy greens are

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.320 
first less dense next leafy greens are
very<00:02:53.270> very<00:02:53.840> light<00:02:54.080> goes<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.770> last<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.910> as<00:02:56.120> you

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
very very light goes in last so as you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.480 
very very light goes in last so as you
put<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.660> vegetables<00:02:57.110> into<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.500> pan<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:58.310> want

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
put the vegetables into the pan you want

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.310 
put the vegetables into the pan you want
to<00:02:58.610> continually<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.420> stirring<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
to continually be stirring the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.050 
to continually be stirring the
vegetables<00:03:00.800> around<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.400> they're<00:03:01.610> browning<00:03:01.820> on

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
vegetables around so they're browning on

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.720 
vegetables around so they're browning on
all<00:03:02.180> sides<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:03.200> dark<00:03:03.680> brown<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.520> know

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
all sides not dark brown but you know

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.880

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
just a little bit brown so that's kind

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.260 
just a little bit brown so that's kind
of<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.040> point<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.460> stir-fry<00:03:07.670> everything

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
of the point of a stir-fry everything

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.450 
of the point of a stir-fry everything
gets<00:03:08.480> just<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.810> little<00:03:09.050> bit<00:03:09.140> browned<00:03:09.410> okay<00:03:10.310> now

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
gets just a little bit browned okay now

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.470
