00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 hello right now putting 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 a permaculture garden in place so 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.470
 we have based our garden on two 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 quite important techniques that are the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 purpose of construction and high culture 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.439
 so in fact the inside of our 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480
 inside our goals c composed of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.210
 Decaying wood of old wood 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.739
 we found in the forest from above 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 that's actually putting a layer of a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.730
 ten centimeters of compost a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.739
 ten centimeters of earth and then 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 about twenty centimeters 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.520
 straw and in fact we will come to plant 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 in seven goals that will take several 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.430
 years for what have posted 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.840
 turn into good ground the advantage 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.280
 is that we do not need to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.969
 work the earth during during 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.340
 several years 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.280
 we just plant replant transplanted 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.070
 directly in and between these goals have 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 made of elite culture where we go on the ground 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
 apply a little bit of manure 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.739
 cardboard horse a dozen 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.170
 centimeters of compost and straw 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.729
 and we will plant directly in the one 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 of culture that will turn into 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.069
 earth quite quickly the provision of 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.429
 field has been really long 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:19.740
 thought about that inside these of 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.060
 these enclaves between the goals of the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.189
 heat build up one recreates a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.249
 microclimate we need to try to 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.029
 grow plants that 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.829
 do not grow up very well in chamonix 

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:32.099
 like tomatoes this kind of thing 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.659
 when logically with this design we 

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.889
 should be able to accumulate heat 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.439
 and have plants that happens to 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:38.729
 maturity 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.560
 Esterel charge production how much rate 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.969
 down there we can expect to see 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.580
 first harvests as early as June 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.680
 July it will improve 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.240
 and from next year we will have 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.720
 really really good ones 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.130
 crops 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.930
 this year it should already be pretty 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.160
 interesting almost we will try to 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.440
 to do on the ground is to reproduce 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.180
 the species that are there or even the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.640
 let reproduce itself and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.470
 let ben let them sell themselves 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.700
 seed and around her to see a 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.690
 little bit next year in the spring 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.400
 what are the plants they have 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.470
 taken and that pushed back naturally 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.479
 and we will promote these plants to for 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.160
 just trying to give an eco 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.250
 system in place try to do in 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 so that this garden is not needed a 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.300
 very thorough human intervention but 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.560
 that it is still productive 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.550
 click the big difference with the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.750
 traditional culture and the world I 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.330
 especially see a big common point 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.880
 feed humans but the fat 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.530
 difference is that we are really going 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.580
 work with nature is not against 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.650
 she's going to be back 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.060
 and if not to produce waste 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.310
 really serve what was around 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.680
 we are really going to work with her 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.670
 rather than tearing 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.630
 weeds we bad 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.070
 herbs if they are there is that they 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.720
 have a reason they do something 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.130
 to the earth it brings back nutrients 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.620
 or in any case prevents him from 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.420
 dehydrate and we will serve a little bit of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.550
 all of that here today the setting up 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.200
 it's a bit like a bulldozer was 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.520
 gone through there and the goal of the game is 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.030
 to really get back to a garden 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.730
 natural 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.410
 we are recreating in the ecosystem that the plants 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.390
 protected themselves in fact with the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.080
 biodiversity that will be around and after 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.000
 the plow 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.800
 not at all there we just remove the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.900
 grass layer that is a little intense 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.490
 we not return all the land it 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.000
 leave like this and we come to build 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.010
 from above ground actually process of 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.440
 composting down on it and 7 million 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.510
 rain hard there we left for two 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.310
 days we have thirty people there 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.240
 is basically the field is roughly 500 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.400
 sqm so logically at the end so at the 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.760
 end of tomorrow sunday end of the day 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.190
 we should have three goals of 10m 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.459
 two big space in lead culture a corner 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.950
 a compost his spiraling herbs 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.320
 also aromatic and should be a 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.680
 sending is pretty and inspiration for 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.680
 others
