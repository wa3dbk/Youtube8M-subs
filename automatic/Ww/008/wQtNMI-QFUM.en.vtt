00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
I'm in the key of C I'm gonna play the

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:44.460 
I'm in the key of C I'm gonna play the
root<00:01:36.550> C<00:01:36.850> v<00:01:38.610> 9<00:01:40.830> jump<00:01:41.830> up<00:01:41.920> here<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.850> G<00:01:43.240> which<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.630> Z

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
root C v 9 jump up here to G which is Z

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.660 
root C v 9 jump up here to G which is Z
v<00:01:44.710> again<00:01:44.910> see<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.090> root<00:01:46.270> G<00:01:47.200> v<00:01:47.560> I'll<00:01:48.040> slide<00:01:48.400> up<00:01:48.550> a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
v again see the root G v I'll slide up a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.030 
v again see the root G v I'll slide up a
whole<00:01:48.850> step<00:01:49.180> here<00:01:49.479> I'll<00:01:50.229> do<00:01:50.470> basically

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
whole step here I'll do basically

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.620 
whole step here I'll do basically
backtrack<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:54.940> do<00:01:55.060> everything<00:01:55.330> that<00:01:55.510> I

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
backtrack so I do everything that I

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.290 
backtrack so I do everything that I
didn't<00:01:55.960> see<00:01:56.290> here<00:01:59.550> and<00:02:00.550> I'll<00:02:00.670> slide<00:02:00.970> up<00:02:01.120> here

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
didn't see here and I'll slide up here

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.590 
didn't see here and I'll slide up here
from<00:02:01.480> this<00:02:01.600> G<00:02:01.870> v<00:02:02.700> basically<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.790> into<00:02:04.060> an<00:02:04.240> A

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
from this G v basically up into an A

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.840 
from this G v basically up into an A
there<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.229> key<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.590> which<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.430> fifth<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.670> D

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
there the key on which is the fifth of D

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.919 
there the key on which is the fifth of D
I<00:02:08.519> do<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.729> same<00:02:09.910> thing<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.420> go

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
I do the same thing and just go

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.860 
I do the same thing and just go
backwards<00:02:11.739> so<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.700> at<00:02:13.060> slide<00:02:13.360> backwards

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
backwards so it's at slide backwards

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.930 
backwards so it's at slide backwards
there<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> lowest<00:02:14.800> note<00:02:15.010> it's<00:02:15.730> one

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
there on the on the lowest note it's one

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.240 
there on the on the lowest note it's one
of<00:02:16.030> those<00:02:16.150> things<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.799> keep<00:02:17.980> saying

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
of those things that and I keep saying
