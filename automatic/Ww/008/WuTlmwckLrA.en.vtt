00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.820
 yo have just like a gsk and today it 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.349
 filling new call of duty had from swol 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.660
 either come against you today it's apps 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.270
 to count us wolves for life and this 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.920
 kind of free-for-all detroit and I hope 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.850
 I thought you liked clip fat 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.830
 it quite sick 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.210
 I sleep down by three people in a row and 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.920
 now let someone with two kings 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.120
 from the air as smash and the as and 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.220
 Kinberg case 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.260
 where u fall a bit too 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.760
 thinking is prepvlog 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.680
 I already had a lot of fun letters 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.690
 and then when I am a team based 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.970
 I always have games stuff ready 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.350
 I was thinking about my teammate 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.000
 maybe there is an idea to one 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.409
 to make a free-for-all series so name it 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.850
 I am a want with armin 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.010
 and then I just go especially those 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.430
 and then see what we do a lot 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.940
 rest in those blades but really 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.440
 for example, what a dinner voucher is 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.909
 quite difficult because you can say 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.190
 just derek jos alevi especially 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.600
 Dinner voucher is 30 times so if you order once 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.100
 it never ca n't do it then you can 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.900
 then a hazelnut 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.540
 how you are bad if he get one 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.100
 get shot as he and allah 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.150
 on us on i could do this all the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.310
 up the ladder 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.210
 but if the smart know that in 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.740
 that will affect life 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.690
 but everyone has the ball is it too 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.510
 with the fact of being a ball yourself 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.660
 I just didn't take it 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.960
 but the ball is yes yes this is good at home 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.670
 about power but that's why I don't want to 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.580
 because everyone uses it and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.280
 you want 80 times the zelda game fun this way 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.170
 thin in it analogy and bad gods 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.270
 therefore rather happy and able to 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.260
 throws rambo 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.140
 it's a bit in one thing too 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.890
 doubt and this time and that is to give 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.170
 n squared 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.990
 grab works extremely well in this game again 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.910
 and yet I really want point leader 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.459
 but i am not from my class i have 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.470
 stop needed and so everything yes that the need 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.690
 not necessarily me I prefer that too 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.660
 so a colonial teak with you 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.819
 doubts and crawling and quingo and what 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.410
 you would do because club works really extreme 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.510
 feels like a five mark spoonbill it is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.060
 just always nice that you like your fast 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.159
 to win a large can and to cook 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.920
 average can fuck 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.110
 so choose against someone you can 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.620
 certainly a lot in my back 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.000
 now in 1 2 3 no it already often did 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.250
 expected but there is someone completely 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.620
 behind a cloth of this weird I knew the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.820
 eating fucking knew 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.080
 I maybe heard and I don't hear 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.930
 walk so then you actually already know 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.670
 enough hello 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.620
 then it would be as brave as it does 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.810
 to get that bike on you sooner than it is 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.520
 for them the big advantage and or everything 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.660
 is there for it 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.700
 oh my brow it is someone bitsingen 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.340
 I walk part that settles iris and sits 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.320
 i know they could cline little bit 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.770
 very good but I count on it 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.320
 arabic athlete in the game of noticed 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.750
 just be able to really take effort and 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.220
 then again 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.989
 Still you can kilo that according to Paul 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.380
 right in front of you and just in it 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.580
 simple moan of weapons on you 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.590
 I often have a surprise 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.150
 you will just go away I guess we walk 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.290
 just a round 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.370
 develop constantly or even pots 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.459
 crows may not really be whole 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.430
 nice that i heard a boost who 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.989

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.540
 format can package invigilators 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.030

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.180

 A few idiot way was the set 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.479

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.150

 just say rambo yes really 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.560

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.659
 but that was not officially new sentry 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.490

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.870

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.289
 that the 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.320
 what i slowly i hear someone there 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.770
 something was what were you you i could air 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.699

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:55.139
 well well nice that motherfucker 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.820
 okay maria from we have a cake me 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.760
 now know what a street sat direction 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.409
 twenty miles was amazing artificial cane 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.060
 but do not count it before you can 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.060
 sits like a pretty nice with 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.360
 All that shit I was stuck in francs unit 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.219
 the table the sorry then 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.050
 I actually always do something like that and not 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:18.400
 so i just don't get that often about us 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.400
 oh then what both at the same time 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.499
 i just like to take with 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.870
 a nice thing very many people 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.779
 they wrote something and try a man 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.150
 with your bullets the deutsche 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:31.150
 succeeds in general also called on 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:38.620
 well that guy smart but not so smart and 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.620
 ha motherfucker 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.309
 I now know what freefall is about this 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.469
 game is so much nicer on free especially in 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.699
 in koos or something and chose koos was very easy 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.249
 of course a lot with its footsteps 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.789
 words but I think it's nice because 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:52.610
 you too 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:55.159
 aldo luck he is so nice probably 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.870
 because you here that got a boost 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.909
 zone very quickly and so you have constant 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:03.409
 action and then it's his way 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:04.909
 or even better at the moments you have to 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.379
 only once you deal with this me 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:09.099
 still my own weapon i will honest it 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.099
 pushing my own weapon 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:16.969
 love number I had the courage to already 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:19.249
 I'm fine we have that started with 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:20.990
 thirty to four angry my very nice game 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:22.550
 if tip and knocking is no longer a 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.719
 girl liked it and that clip too 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.979
 I probably have for this with 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:26.629
 placed 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.580
 mark you so my question is within this 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:29.810
 nice to see free especially if you are freefall 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.399
 like I can do just 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.839
 series did not upload too much 

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:34.669
 but that might be easier 

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:36.319
 just to make a series of it 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.479
 just won with army 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.069
 and then hear nice solo this is late 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.749
 me know what you think makes it 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:44.149
 notice the likes as just like 

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:46.669
 give a lot of likes then I know that too 

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:51.009
 so ernie ball like fun leaves a like 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:51.009
 behind subscribers and cry again until folio
