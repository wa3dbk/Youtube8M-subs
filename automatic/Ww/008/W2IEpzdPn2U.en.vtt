to<00:00:25.350> import<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> track<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.519> easiest<00:00:26.880> way<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
to import a track the easiest way is to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.730 
to import a track the easiest way is to
just<00:00:27.480> navigate<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.199> tracks<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.650> your

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
just navigate to some tracks on your

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710 
just navigate to some tracks on your
hard<00:00:29.189> drive<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.670> drag<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.150> drop<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.510> into

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
hard drive and drag and drop them into

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.209 
hard drive and drag and drop them into
your<00:00:30.960> collection<00:00:31.500> once<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.769> import<00:00:32.070> them

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
your collection once you import them

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.590 
your collection once you import them
into<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> collection<00:00:32.880> it'll<00:00:33.059> automatically

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
into the collection it'll automatically

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.630 
into the collection it'll automatically
start<00:00:33.930> analyzing<00:00:34.530> all<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> tracks<00:00:35.250> when

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
start analyzing all the tracks when

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
start analyzing all the tracks when
rekordbox<00:00:35.940> analyzes<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> tracks<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> does<00:00:37.320> a

rekordbox analyzes the tracks it does a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
rekordbox analyzes the tracks it does a
couple<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.770> things<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.309> will<00:00:38.430> assign<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.790> BPM

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
couple of things it will assign a BPM

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.119 
couple of things it will assign a BPM
value<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:40.079> track<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.559> will<00:00:40.680> detect<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
value to your track it will detect the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.440 
value to your track it will detect the
key<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> track<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.030> also<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
key of the track it's also going to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
key of the track it's also going to
create<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> visual<00:00:43.170> waveform<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.920> you'll<00:00:44.070> be

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
create a visual waveform that you'll be
