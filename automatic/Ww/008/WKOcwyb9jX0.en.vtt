00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.340
 ask a question how did you create yourself 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.520
 and how to make yourself an admin now I tell you 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.640
 I'll show it for this we need 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.119
 only es and conductor nothing else 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.000
 need to 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:09.770
 find in and out of the conductor so I was that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.929
 Here we go such a folder as a package in May 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.530
 that 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.959
 here it is such an opus here we go 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.250
 her and 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:26.409
 total cmd click edit if you have it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:30.700
 No, you will have to download and here it is 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:35.200
 then 2 administrators who can come on 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 server and admin 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.189
 but the point is that you enter your 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:47.099
 Nick here and close like this save 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:48.669
 and all immediately explain what's behind the ass 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.000
 for example a bank 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:55.510
 This is when you banned a person here 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.169
 caterpillar is his nickname if you erase what he 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:05.290
 I will be banned if you suddenly there 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:09.269
 ask me if I get lost 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.000
 this is the server about what you can go 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:16.229
 your internet dark server 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.060
 for example change the nickname of your server 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:25.930
 port change how many players here but 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.449
 a lot of things can be stupidly changed immediately 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:38.810
 I'll say nothing here you will find 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:40.489
 that's just 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.520
 and the price when students change 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:49.030

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.630

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.630
