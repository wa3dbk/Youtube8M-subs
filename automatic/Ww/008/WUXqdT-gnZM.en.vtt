and<00:03:17.250> nice<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:17.760> airplane

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and nice on this airplane

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.479 
and nice on this airplane
slow<00:03:18.900> down<00:03:19.049> very<00:03:19.349> nicely<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.040> minimum<00:03:20.370> of

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
slow down very nicely to the minimum of

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
about 40 knots the minimum is 45 knots

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.860 
about 40 knots the minimum is 45 knots
but<00:03:23.790> they<00:03:23.939> get<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.239> little<00:03:24.359> lower<00:03:24.629> than<00:03:24.810> that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
but they get it a little lower than that

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.929 
but they get it a little lower than that
through<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.290> nice<00:03:25.530> it's<00:03:26.129> got<00:03:26.219> a<00:03:26.280> nice<00:03:26.459> thick<00:03:26.760> air

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939
