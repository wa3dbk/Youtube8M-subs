should have gone to other priorities we

unemployment<00:01:21.820> we<00:01:22.479> have<00:01:22.720> people<00:01:23.500> living<00:01:23.830> in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
unemployment we have people living in

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.250 
unemployment we have people living in
appalling<00:01:24.220> circumstances<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:25.660> those<00:01:26.020> issues

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
appalling circumstances and those issues

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.280 
appalling circumstances and those issues
should<00:01:26.440> have<00:01:26.740> been<00:01:26.860> addressed<00:01:27.190> before<00:01:27.369> having

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
should have been addressed before having

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.750 
should have been addressed before having
the<00:01:29.290> expenditure<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:29.950> went<00:01:30.220> into<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.610> World

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
the expenditure that went into the World

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.330 
the expenditure that went into the World
Cup<00:01:31.000> some<00:01:31.540> people<00:01:31.750> have<00:01:31.900> argued<00:01:31.930> that<00:01:32.590> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
Cup some people have argued that the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.390 
Cup some people have argued that the
World<00:01:34.000> Cup<00:01:34.119> was<00:01:34.510> a<00:01:34.540> good<00:01:34.780> thing<00:01:35.020> because<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
World Cup was a good thing because the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.100 
World Cup was a good thing because the
infrastructure<00:01:37.090> expenditure<00:01:37.300> came<00:01:37.869> at<00:01:38.050> a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
infrastructure expenditure came at a

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.370 
infrastructure expenditure came at a
time<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.180> financial<00:01:40.450> crisis<00:01:40.869> hits<00:01:41.050> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
time when the financial crisis hits the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.700 
time when the financial crisis hits the
rest<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.130> world<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:43.410> so<00:01:44.410> there<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.649> an

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
rest of the world and so there is an

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.650 
rest of the world and so there is an
extent<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.070> which<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:46.360> government

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
extent to which the the government

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.040 
extent to which the the government
spending<00:01:47.050> did<00:01:47.410> cushion<00:01:47.770> us<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.810> from

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
spending did cushion us from that from

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.010 
spending did cushion us from that from
the<00:01:50.530> negative<00:01:50.830> impacts<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.280> that<00:01:51.340> event<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.990> I

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
the negative impacts of that event but I

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.779 
the negative impacts of that event but I
think<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.289> really<00:01:53.380> important<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.130> the

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
think it's really important to the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.790 
think it's really important to the
people<00:01:54.910> notes<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:55.960> any<00:01:56.229> kind<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.619> government

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
people notes that any kind of government

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.200 
people notes that any kind of government
expenditure<00:01:57.520> would<00:01:57.640> have<00:01:57.729> done<00:01:57.880> that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
expenditure would have done that

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.359 
expenditure would have done that
so<00:01:58.570> if<00:01:58.780> we'd<00:01:58.960> spent<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> money<00:01:59.470> on<00:01:59.740> health

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
so if we'd spent the money on health

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.070 
so if we'd spent the money on health
care<00:02:00.460> or<00:02:00.820> education<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:01.600> also<00:02:01.899> would<00:02:02.020> have

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
care or education that also would have

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.609 
care or education that also would have
cushioned<00:02:02.410> us<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:04.030> did<00:02:04.240> have<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.840> valuable

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
cushioned us so it did have a valuable

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.580 
cushioned us so it did have a valuable
counter-cyclical<00:02:06.520> effect<00:02:07.289> but<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.320> could

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
counter-cyclical effect but that could

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.719 
counter-cyclical effect but that could
have<00:02:08.679> been<00:02:08.770> achieved<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.310> number<00:02:09.519> of<00:02:09.580> other

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
have been achieved in a number of other

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.539 
have been achieved in a number of other
ways<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.149> think<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:12.070> negatives

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
ways I think the the the negatives

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.880 
ways I think the the the negatives
outweigh<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.239> benefits<00:02:13.660> yes<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:14.110> needed<00:02:14.440> some

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
outweigh the benefits yes we needed some

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.259 
outweigh the benefits yes we needed some
of<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.070> infrastructure<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.850> we<00:02:15.940> do<00:02:16.090> need

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
of the infrastructure and we do need

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.420 
of the infrastructure and we do need
more<00:02:16.510> infrastructure<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.890> went<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
more infrastructure but it went to the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.090 
more infrastructure but it went to the
wrong<00:02:18.519> places

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
wrong places

so<00:05:25.919> it's<00:05:26.919> not<00:05:27.099> at<00:05:27.220> all<00:05:27.310> clear<00:05:27.789> that<00:05:27.880> we're<00:05:28.090> in<00:05:28.150> a

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
so it's not at all clear that we're in a

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.290 
so it's not at all clear that we're in a
better<00:05:28.300> place<00:05:28.449> than<00:05:28.840> we<00:05:28.930> were<00:05:29.050> before

it<00:05:31.300> seemed<00:05:31.570> like<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.900> economic<00:05:32.289> analysis

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
it seemed like the economic analysis

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.400 
it seemed like the economic analysis
just<00:05:33.039> that<00:05:33.520> upgrading<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.539> athlone<00:05:34.900> stadium

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
just that upgrading the athlone stadium

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.279 
just that upgrading the athlone stadium
would<00:05:35.560> have<00:05:35.620> been<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.759> better<00:05:36.940> option<00:05:37.360> in

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
would have been the better option in

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.409 
would have been the better option in
terms<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:38.770> cost<00:05:39.010> but<00:05:39.669> in<00:05:39.820> addition<00:05:40.270> the

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
terms of cost but in addition the

prospects<00:05:40.990> for<00:05:41.020> subsequent<00:05:41.740> use<00:05:42.070> were<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.580> lot

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
prospects for subsequent use were a lot

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.370 
prospects for subsequent use were a lot
better<00:05:42.880> that<00:05:43.419> loans<00:05:43.630> already<00:05:43.930> used<00:05:44.229> for
