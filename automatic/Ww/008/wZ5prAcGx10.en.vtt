00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.927
 "Lifestyle treatment is a standard procedure for pre-diabetic patients" 

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:09.029
 For people with prediabet 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:14.269
 lifestyle modification is now considered the cornerstone of diabetes prevention. 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.803
 In terms of diet, this means that individuals with prediabet or diabetes alone 

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:23.770
 should reduce the intake of excess calories, saturated fats and trans fatty acids. 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.183
 Too many of us consume a diet that is too high in fat and added sugars. 

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:34.669
 Fortunately, the latest dietary guidelines are in favor of eating plant foods. 

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:41.125
 Lifestyle adjustment is now the basis of the American Clinical Endocrinology Association guidelines 

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.850
 guidelines of the European Diabetes Association, 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.187
 as well as the official standards of care of the American Diabetic Association. 

00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:53.170
 Eating strategies include reduced fat intake and increased fat intake 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.504
 fiber intake, which represents unrefined vegetable foods, including wholegrain. 

00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:00.937
 This is based on research like this. 

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:06.300
 We know that abundant whole grain consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.299
 This recent study has widened this; proves that eating whole grain foods 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.134
 he can even, in the first place, protect against prediabet. 

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:17.211
 To prevent diabetics from dying 

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:23.799
 recommendations should emphasize lower intake of saturated fats, cholesterol and trans fatty acids 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.767
 acid, which is basically the code for meat and dairy products, eggs and junk food. 

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:33.167
 Furthermore, there is an increase in omega-3, soluble fiber and phytosterols, 

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.086
 which can be found, for example, in flax seed, 

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:39.908
 an effective but still unusual precautionary measure. 

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:43.060
 Scientists have found that about 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed daily 

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:46.960
 reduce insulin resistance, which is a hallmark of the disease. 

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:51.630
 So if standards of care for all major groups of diabetics say 

00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.920
 that lifestyle is the preferred treatment for prediabetes 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.630
 because it is a safe and highly effective way 

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:58.050
 why does not more doctors intervene? 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.380
 Unfortunately, the possibility of treating this disease is not very much recognized. 

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:07.200
 Only about 1 in 3 patients report having ever been informed about diet or movement. 

00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:11.330
 The possible reasons why doctors do not consult patients include inadequate 

00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:14.160
 financial performance, lack of resources, lack of time and lack of knowledge. 

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:17.320
 We simply do not teach doctors how to go about it. 

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:22.830
 Inadequate clinical education is the result of health care failure and medical education, 

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:26.830
 which have failed to adapt to a major change in disease from acute to chronic 

00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:29.800
 - from broken legs to broken hearts. 

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:33.520
 Chronic diseases are now a major cause of disability; 

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:36.300
 consume three quarters of our sickness care system. 

00:02:36.297 --> 00:02:41.180
 Why is the response to the growing incidence of chronic diseases so small on campus? 

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:44.960
 Maybe it's because doctors aren't paid for this. 

00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:49.060
 An attempt to move to a rational model of care for the chronically ill is practically unthinkable, 

00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:51.990
 unless there is a radical change in the remuneration of doctors. 

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:55.830
 Why hasn't the remuneration policy changed yet? 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.930
 One of the most important reasons may be the failure of leading medical professionals 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:05.230
 and medical education who did not recognize and respond to this in time 

00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:08.510
 the changing nature of the disease. How far behind is the medical profession? 

00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:11.880
 The Medical Institute's Report on Medical Education concluded 

00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:19.430
 that the basic approach to medical education has not changed since 1910.
