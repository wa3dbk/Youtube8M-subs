side to paint I'm choosing this side it
really<00:01:14.610> doesn't<00:01:15.060> matter<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.600> um<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.590> side

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
really doesn't matter but um this side

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.050 
really doesn't matter but um this side
my<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.869> bent<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.350> bit<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
my is actually bent a little bit and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.330 
my is actually bent a little bit and
this<00:01:21.060> side<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.259> side<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.950> curves

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this side is like the side that curves

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.640 
this side is like the side that curves
upwards<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:24.689> using<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> other<00:01:25.200> side

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
upwards so I'm using the other side

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.899 
upwards so I'm using the other side
which<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> easier<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> file<00:01:27.240> my<00:01:27.509> nails<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:28.049> um
