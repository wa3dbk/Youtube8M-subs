00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
then we make the rabbit on the interior

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:16.190 
then we make the rabbit on the interior
side<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.530> frame

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.080

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
we tried to assemble the frame and he

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.660 
we tried to assemble the frame and he
made<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.510> four<00:02:19.780> corners<00:02:20.260> straight<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.520> best

made the four corners straight the best
he<00:02:21.819> could<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> bandsaw<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:25.450> make<00:02:25.630> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
he could with the bandsaw we make the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.910 
he could with the bandsaw we make the
angles<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.530> corners<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.340> frame

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.619
