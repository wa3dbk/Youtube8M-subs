we're<00:00:02.879> making<00:00:03.300> really<00:00:03.540> cool<00:00:03.659> wooden<00:00:04.200> crate

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
we're making really cool wooden crate

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.920 
we're making really cool wooden crate
using<00:00:05.100> an<00:00:05.190> old<00:00:05.430> wooden<00:00:05.730> pallet<00:00:06.150> doesn't<00:00:06.810> take

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
using an old wooden pallet doesn't take

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.419 
using an old wooden pallet doesn't take
that<00:00:07.049> many<00:00:07.200> tools<00:00:07.529> or<00:00:07.830> even<00:00:07.980> all<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.250> much

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
that many tools or even all that much

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.980 
that many tools or even all that much
skill<00:00:08.700> so<00:00:09.000> pretty<00:00:09.179> much<00:00:09.300> anybody<00:00:09.540> computer

skill so pretty much anybody computer
this<00:00:10.080> project<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:11.040> let's<00:00:11.070> get<00:00:11.309> started

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
this project so let's get started

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.509 
this project so let's get started
the<00:00:12.929> first<00:00:13.139> thing<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.380> need<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.370> cut

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the first thing I need to do is to cut

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790 
the first thing I need to do is to cut
the<00:00:14.610> slats<00:00:14.849> off<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.389> wooden<00:00:15.660> pallet<00:00:16.020> you

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the slats off in the wooden pallet you

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.740 
the slats off in the wooden pallet you
can<00:00:16.920> use<00:00:17.039> either<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.490> circular<00:00:17.910> saw<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.539> did

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
can use either a circular saw like I did

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
can use either a circular saw like I did
here<00:00:18.990> or<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.230> handsaw<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.300> you'll

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
here or a handsaw all you do is you'll

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.120 
here or a handsaw all you do is you'll
simply<00:00:21.630> cut<00:00:21.960> inside<00:00:22.439> where<00:00:22.830> those<00:00:22.949> main

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
simply cut inside where those main

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.460 
simply cut inside where those main
support<00:00:23.490> beams<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> slats<00:00:24.930> will<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.230> cut

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
support beams so the slats will be cut

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.540 
support beams so the slats will be cut
off<00:00:25.500> they'll<00:00:26.099> fall<00:00:26.310> down

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
off they'll fall down

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.279 
off they'll fall down
and<00:00:27.390> when<00:00:27.480> you're<00:00:27.570> done<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.869> three<00:00:28.140> main

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and when you're done you have three main

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.009 
and when you're done you have three main
support<00:00:28.619> pieces<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> big<00:00:29.400> pile<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> slides

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
support pieces in a big pile of slides

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.089 
support pieces in a big pile of slides
now<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.260> figure<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.500> how<00:00:31.650> big<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.920> want

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
now if you figure out how big you want

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
now if you figure out how big you want
your<00:00:32.130> crate<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.239> how<00:00:33.360> long<00:00:33.600> pieces

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
your crate to be and how long pieces

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
your crate to be and how long pieces
need<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.320> good<00:00:34.710> measure<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.190> slat<00:00:35.460> pieces

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
need to be good measure the slat pieces

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.590 
need to be good measure the slat pieces
and<00:00:36.270> cut<00:00:36.989> them<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> length<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.239> easy<00:00:39.360> our

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and cut them to length you can easy our

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.389 
and cut them to length you can easy our
hands<00:00:39.870> off<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.230> we're<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> compound

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
hands off of that we're going a compound

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
hands off of that we're going a compound
miter<00:00:41.520> saw<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.059> did<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.870> slower

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
miter saw like I did here is it slower

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.529 
miter saw like I did here is it slower
faster

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
faster

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.939 
faster
when<00:00:45.989> you're<00:00:46.079> done<00:00:46.170> cutting<00:00:46.440> all<00:00:46.620> those<00:00:46.800> in

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
when you're done cutting all those in

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.560 
when you're done cutting all those in
length<00:00:47.129> go<00:00:47.550> ahead<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.820> sand<00:00:48.000> them<00:00:48.179> all<00:00:48.329> down

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
length go ahead and sand them all down

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.020 
length go ahead and sand them all down
so<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.109> you<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> splinter<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.879> in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
so that you don't get a splinter now in

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.670 
so that you don't get a splinter now in
order<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> handle<00:00:51.839> on<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> end<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
order to make a handle on one the end to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.189 
order to make a handle on one the end to
the<00:00:52.769> great<00:00:53.000> trace<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> Halfmoon<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> where

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the great trace a Halfmoon on to where

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.560 
the great trace a Halfmoon on to where
these<00:00:55.289> slats<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.129> slab<00:00:56.460> cut<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.449> with

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
these slats and slab cut it out with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
these slats and slab cut it out with
your<00:00:57.659> jigsaw

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
your jigsaw

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
your jigsaw
after<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> cut<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.360> out<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> sand

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
after you cut it out you want to sand

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920 
after you cut it out you want to sand
this<00:01:01.770> down<00:01:01.830> as<00:01:02.160> well<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.550> you'll<00:01:02.760> guess<00:01:02.970> what

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this down as well so you'll guess what

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.110 
this down as well so you'll guess what
then<00:01:04.500> lay<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.710> bottom<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> crane<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.970> on

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
then lay the bottom of the crane out on

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.090 
then lay the bottom of the crane out on
the<00:01:06.210> table<00:01:06.570> throw<00:01:07.290> some<00:01:07.470> wood<00:01:07.590> glue<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.890> there
