trees to the game so here's the first

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.130 
trees to the game so here's the first
one<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.460> dark<00:00:24.180> oak<00:00:24.420> sapling<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
one we have the dark oak sapling and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529 
one we have the dark oak sapling and
also<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> Acacia<00:00:26.160> sapling<00:00:26.699> which<00:00:26.939> I'll<00:00:27.180> show

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
also the Acacia sapling which I'll show

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.529 
also the Acacia sapling which I'll show
you<00:00:27.599> next<00:00:28.170> now<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> plant<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.699> obviously

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you next now to plant this obviously

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.860 
you next now to plant this obviously
just<00:00:30.779> put<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.050> down<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.059> jungle

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
just put it down but like the jungle

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.740 
just put it down but like the jungle
trees<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.239> two<00:00:36.960> by<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.730> tree

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
trees you have to have a two by two tree

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.090 
trees you have to have a two by two tree
because<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.290> keep<00:00:40.469> spamming<00:00:40.800> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
because if you just keep spamming that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
because if you just keep spamming that
then<00:00:41.340> you'll<00:00:41.520> lose<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:41.969> bone<00:00:42.300> mill<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
then you'll lose all your bone mill so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.950 
then you'll lose all your bone mill so
if<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.280> another<00:00:44.579> couple<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
if we get another couple of these up and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.260 
if we get another couple of these up and
running<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.710> you've<00:00:47.670> got<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> two<00:00:48.059> by

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
running like that you've got a two by

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.680 
running like that you've got a two by
two<00:00:48.300> tree<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.520> eventually<00:00:51.180> grow

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
two tree which you can eventually grow

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.220 
two tree which you can eventually grow

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
we've got is the acacia tree a child

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.740 
we've got is the acacia tree a child
plant<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.619> grow<00:01:07.890> this

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
plant just there now if I grow this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.609 
plant just there now if I grow this
you'll<00:01:09.750> notice<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:12.630> looks<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.290> some

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you'll notice that it looks like some

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
you'll notice that it looks like some
kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.130> accident<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> chainsaw<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
kind of accident with a chainsaw and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
kind of accident with a chainsaw and
then<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.110> tried<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> fix<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.070> Wingardium

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
then it tried to fix it with Wingardium

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
then it tried to fix it with Wingardium
Leviosa<00:01:18.080> because<00:01:19.080> obviously<00:01:19.259> there's<00:01:19.710> no

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
Leviosa because obviously there's no

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.380 
Leviosa because obviously there's no
slopes<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.400> Minecraft<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.210> rather

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
slopes in Minecraft which is rather

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
slopes in Minecraft which is rather
unfortunate<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.200> yeah<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> slopes

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
unfortunate but yeah it kind of slopes

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.780 
unfortunate but yeah it kind of slopes
off<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> side<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.979> guess<00:01:26.369> we'll<00:01:26.640> be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
off to the side so I guess we'll be

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490 
off to the side so I guess we'll be
seeing<00:01:26.820> those<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> savannas<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> sort

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
seeing those in the savannas that sort

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.950 
seeing those in the savannas that sort
of<00:01:28.560> tree<00:01:29.130> generation<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.939> used<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
of tree generation is used for the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.490 
of tree generation is used for the
savanna<00:01:31.350> trees<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.920> well<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.930> also<00:01:34.140> come

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
savanna trees as well so they also come

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.240 
savanna trees as well so they also come
with<00:01:34.530> brand<00:01:35.100> new<00:01:35.220> leaf<00:01:35.729> blocks<00:01:36.140> which<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.320> have

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
leader blocks and these ones here are

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.940 
leader blocks and these ones here are
the<00:01:47.579> oak<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.390> birch<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.680> I'll<00:01:49.890> show<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.250> now

only one who looks any different the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.469 
only one who looks any different the
birch<00:02:00.590> leaves<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.520> all<00:02:01.640> four<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:01.880> these<00:02:02.119> use

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
birch leaves and all four of these use

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.260 
birch leaves and all four of these use
the<00:02:02.630> same<00:02:03.070> texture<00:02:04.070> but<00:02:04.549> slightly<00:02:04.850> different

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the same texture but slightly different

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.729 
the same texture but slightly different
colors<00:02:05.600> if<00:02:06.469> we<00:02:06.649> have<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.829> look<00:02:07.039> at<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.789> the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
colors if we have a look at the the

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.059 
colors if we have a look at the the
leaves<00:02:09.739> here<00:02:10.630> spruce<00:02:11.630> leaves<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.260> jungle

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
leaves here spruce leaves and jungle

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.280 
leaves here spruce leaves and jungle
leaves<00:02:13.250> have<00:02:13.849> different<00:02:14.420> texture<00:02:14.810> entirely

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
leaves have different texture entirely

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.979 
leaves have different texture entirely
but<00:02:15.560> yeah<00:02:15.769> in<00:02:16.340> your<00:02:16.519> inventory<00:02:17.030> they<00:02:17.810> have

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
but yeah in your inventory they have

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.009 
but yeah in your inventory they have
slightly<00:02:18.290> different<00:02:18.410> colors<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.840> how<00:02:20.840> they

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
slightly different colors to how they

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.250 
slightly different colors to how they
appear<00:02:21.410> as<00:02:21.620> blocks<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:23.269> I'm<00:02:23.599> guessing<00:02:24.049> that

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
appear as blocks so I'm guessing that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.220 
appear as blocks so I'm guessing that
might<00:02:24.709> be<00:02:24.890> changed<00:02:25.400> before<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.910> actual<00:02:26.330> 1.7

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
might be changed before the actual 1.7

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.960 
might be changed before the actual 1.7
release<00:02:27.500> but<00:02:28.280> that's<00:02:28.459> what<00:02:28.670> they<00:02:28.790> look<00:02:28.910> like

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
release but that's what they look like

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.970 
release but that's what they look like
now<00:02:29.180> that's<00:02:30.019> how<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.290> grow<00:02:30.530> them<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:30.860> that's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
now that's how to grow them and that's

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.229 
now that's how to grow them and that's
what<00:02:31.190> they<00:02:31.310> look<00:02:31.459> like<00:02:31.489> that's<00:02:31.910> how<00:02:32.090> they

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
what they look like that's how they

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.569 
what they look like that's how they
generate<00:02:32.530> all<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.739> sort<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.130> thing<00:02:34.190> that's

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
generate all that sort of thing that's

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.640 
generate all that sort of thing that's
all<00:02:34.760> there<00:02:34.910> really<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.239> say<00:02:35.599> my<00:02:36.410> name<00:02:36.440> is
