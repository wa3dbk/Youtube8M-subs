00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.050
 bugatti introduced we have that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.670

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 Automobile designer and his masterpiece 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.270
 was undoubtedly the 57 atlantic that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.030
 You have vehicle in the intro movie 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 seen briefly in silhouette and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.440
 this vehicle was a role model for us 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 the design of the bugatti I give them 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.840
 now as world premiere here in frankfurt 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 would like to introduce 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.780
 the exterior impresses with its depth 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.899
 black exactly like his role model in this 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.739
 case, however, it is made of 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.590
 visible carbon in the front of the horseshoe 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:43.319

 beige leather modeled on the model 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.750
 but a bugatti would not be bugatti if 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.520
 he is not synonymous on the technology side 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.310
 unique would be the schauburg at 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.920
 based on the vitesse and that is with 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.580
