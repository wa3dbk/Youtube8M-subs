00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.480
We are at the Fespa Mexico, 2013 fair

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.400
welcome!

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.080
HP sign and display Mexico regularly
participates in this fair that is very important

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.120
since it's a great place for customers who
come here to learn about new technologies.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.200
Right now at the booth we have a very special
launching for Mexico - the HP Latex 3000

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.520
designed for high volume
productivity in Latex.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.600
It has many improvements. It has
the third generation new inks.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.960
Also the curing system has improved
- ideal for PSPs of high volume.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.040
Well I came to Fespa Mexico specially
to learn about the HP Latex 3000.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.280
To me it seems like
a fabulous printer

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.400
because it has some features that
the current latex printers donÂ´t have

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.280
such as the printing speed
-- this really interests me.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.520
Currently Latex technology is growing
very fast in the Mexican market.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.000
It has been widely accepted due to
its high resolution, speed for short runs,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.480
and is a technology that besides
being an eco-friendly technology,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.720
because of its&nbsp;unique design
helps the user save on cost.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.240
How is that?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.880
Well it doesn't require investment
in any special installation or exhaust pipes.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.720
This represents very important
savings in energy and infrastructure.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.240
I have the HP Latex 260

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.960
that bring me a
technology that is odorless

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.600
and great versatility of media.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.800
We're currently using it to design
shoes with Latex technology and vinyl.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.200
We have customers who want high
volume and have even higher expectations.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.560
HP Latex technology has allowed
us to reduce to two shifts

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.800
and at the same time grow our production
level optimizing our resources.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.320
HP Latex and UV technologies
are technologies that

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.920
when they are printing
are already curing

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.160
and automatically
ready for installation.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.560
I'm at the HP stand and what has mostly caught
my attention is the vinyl that they are using,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.360
the great detail of the prints
and the wall coverings.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.960
They are materials that
give you many options.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.680
We have in the HP booth
an HP FB 700 printing

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.600
and showing the different
applications that it can be used for.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.400
We also have an HP FB500 at
the booth of one of our distributers.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.000
One of the important characteristics
of the FB is that it is a hybrid printer.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.040
It can print on rigid material

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.520
but also, with the roll-to-roll accessory,
it can also print on flexible material

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.840
giving much more
versatility to our customers.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.440
We have the FB700
and the HP Latex 850.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.560
Thanks to the FB we have been able to print
on rigid material, in wood, acrylics, glass, etc.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.920
This is something that 
we couldn't do before.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.080
In regards to
HP FB technology

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.360
I would like to mention that
we are very surprised with the FB500.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.520
It was a printer that we started
with and it allowed us to grow.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.520
This printer we initially had
working 20 -30 days, day and night,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and we were surprised with the
reliability, quality and the inks.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.320
It is one of the best that I have
seen and extremely reliable.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.600
I really think it's a
printer to do business with.
