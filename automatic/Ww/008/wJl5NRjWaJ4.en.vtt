00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.150

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.519

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.960

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.070

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.689
 You really have to be ashamed of that 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.689
 you have such a coward for the son 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.459

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.800
 already have to ask yourself and if you 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.350

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.970

00:02:41.350 --> 00:03:05.310
