00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
 yes 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.330
 so toyota is worth 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.580
 down the straight course towards the curve of the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.770
 brewery so far in the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.120
 tc2000 trainings the same 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.610
 name that in the afternoon of today Augustine 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.230
 canapino if we consider one thing very 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.330
 important this is the previous of what 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.750
 it may be the morning the classification that 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.940
 will be three groups in three thirds 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.430
 and for the statistics and so 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.200
 has always happened here except the time of 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.840
 werner who was stopped at the start 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.390
 they remember that it was Paul always won the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.309
 pole 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.540
 and you will always earn a say 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.420
 someone who was in the first row 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.280
 so this essay thinking the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.559
 classification is fundamental because 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.850
 tomorrow something goes wrong and it 's almost 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.559
 sentenced to leave half for 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.570
 back in the middle and it's very difficult 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.300
 I overtake the advance as in all 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.280
 street circuits of the world me 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.850
 asked Andrew, the man won some of 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.740
 callejero no lópez no of the night no no 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.600
 no and from the avenue it seems to me of little 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.060
 less calm I remembered to have a se 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.440
 hit last year also when not 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.149
 I can make time for the second 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.780
 career falling in love with rossi 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.030
 It was always very fast but I do not remember 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.160
 if he won the ones that are clear that those of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.369
 the night are generally the same 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.920
 rossi birds to bojan or cattle 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.810
 altuna pernia that won the first with 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.610
 lopez as escort the three with or one 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.830
 career piece with fermín lopez and silva 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.590
 that is the most important place on the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.250
 step, I think if I like the discs of 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.500
 brake is not a place to pass for 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.800
 seize it and good skinny there are not many 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.590
 clear places that yes it is clear that yes 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.380
 but to be able to spend friends you have to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.479
 manufacture the maneuver millimeter before or 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.340
 be all the other variants the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.910
 techniques are faster to give you distance 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 and that right in the braking have that 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.280
 different experience 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.260
 altuna low time minute 17 0 is at 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.490
 point of breaking the 17th barrier 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.860
 Pegate forest has come down 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.870
 and half a second what was the day 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.260
 in the afternoon several threw a forward 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.290
 with the second fist 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.360
 lópez third the girolami fourth rossi 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.849
 fifth lost was created for seventh tarot 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.810
 know eighth is ninth Canaan 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.659
 ledesma tenth muñoz eleven return two already 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.180
 they have to see the good rock 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.040
 temperature already with the hand approaching 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.430
 this distance from the brake discs 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.870
 of this super tc2000 car number 11 of 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.190
 christian the rest is terrible the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.340
 temperature that's why the mechanics 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.560
 some work on cooling 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.930
 both the brake system and the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.010
 engine while the others are 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.720
 working in different 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.970
 inconveniences that are noticing cristian 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.250
 ledesma when it comes to tune this 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.930
 honda but the temperature is incredible 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.730
 of the brake discs this circuit 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.139
 street of santa fe taking helmet 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.389
 has the skinny agreed upon shock when 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.950
 put it and dry it to your chest that they put 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.950
 of everything he got 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:28.600
 and good 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.160
 but a race in December and well no 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.680
 there was way to cool it with nothing 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.160
 terrible that what did some miracle 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.960
 they got off the podium they did not know where it was 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.650
 and it's more like power I think it runs with 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.950
 a cadet and if memory does not fail me 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.950
 there were not several that steal oxygen 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.970
 is the anecdote when you turned in 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.280
 olavarría you half oxygen in blood 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.500
 Peter stoneware and he was but yes 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.220
 I was more scared I thought he gave us 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.370
 the gadget then proved he was 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.800
 but I say the bet you played the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.490
 cigar stopped him smoking because losing 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.300
 Tomás Romero takes almost five minutes of 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.300
 classifications 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:26.460
 height 9 laps and minutes 17 174 is to be 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.569
 leader I think he's better enlightened 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.569
 that last year the circuit looks 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.569
 same 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.900
 and another thing there is much more public than in 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.099
 past editions 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.099
 but there is a lot 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.190
 it was passed to Julian if it is full what 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 It happens leo is that it is one day less too 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.690
 of activity last year there was of xavi 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.250
 Sunday here is Friday and Saturday and what 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.229
 we had been proclaiming that a long time ago 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.060
 time that the main race was the 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.080
 of the night has finally materialized 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.729
 appear to the gentleness of channel 13 that 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.139
 will allow us tomorrow in a fact 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.900
 unpublished for argentine television 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.789
 again live the race 20 40 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.409
 clothes to channel 13 because we are with 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.750
 all the equipment that has lasted me 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.440
 without turning it around is a show 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.750
 magnificent are spectacular cars are 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.490
 race cars seriously is a circuit 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.190
 only 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.599
 the night is lent because it seems night 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.849
 of summer then as they do not go to the 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.099
 people are logical that people go 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.930
 crowd why maybe we 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.230
 we do sports things for people 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.940
 it comes because it's a race car 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.060
 and were this scenario is the edge of the 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.250
 pocket knife red hot discs in the 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.670
 squid car and see what happened to the 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.670
 duckling 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.260
 tremendous what the duckling to see 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.840
 very impressive as it passed by above 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.670
 The piano is a show 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.100
 who wants that for that people come 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.170
 but it's something you do not see you do not see 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.220
 usually like passion buenos aires 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.620
 with the amount of people who went to 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.230
 money is that is the magnet with being 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.210
 He authorized his time down there 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:15.250
 followed that we went down floors was finished on 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.050
 training marcelo altuna the great 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.510
 altuna favorite made the pole in good 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.980
 aires and here made the best time of 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.730
 training stays with the record of 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.890
 minutes circuit 17 0 74 and lopez is the 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.620
 second third our century to me 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.060
 fourth rossi fifth pernia and sixth the 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.700
 best of this group sant antoni that 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.340
 it was very good and that gave the great 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.690
 show with that final jump 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.690
 trying to lower your own time
