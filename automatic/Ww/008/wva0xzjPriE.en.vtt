00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.700
 the nissan gt-r in its latest version 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.740
 so v6 engine of 3 liters this bi 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.160
 turbo 550 horsepower all- wheel drive 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.160
 necessarily robotic box 6 this is it 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.599
 reputed to be one of the cars 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.109
 more efficient and better performing 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.939
 of the market 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.530
 externally it's fun this gt r 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.570
 we notice it there because it is 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.140
 red but you see it in gray or in 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.519
 black 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.809
 if a car almost go through 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.440
 the visual aspect actually is a 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.510
 balance between one notices it 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.520
 that's what it is and at once it's 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.090
 sneaks into the traffic without too much 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.090
 point out 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.900
 inside that's where nissan I 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.790
 think had to make compromises 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.410
 that is, to offer a car 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.500
 at that price they put a lot 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.690
 of money in technology in the 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.400
 transmission in the engine inside 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.740
 we find the nissan ecosystem which is 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.720
 friendly which is well finished well done 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.310
 but we may be a little bit 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.730
 below some car scenes of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.730
 competition 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.720
 which is great with the gt r 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.510
 it's his acceleration 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.510
 it was at headquarters 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 we 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 circuit today it was really not 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.490
 obvious because we were in condition 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 for the winter shot and there are a lot 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.820
 too many people under the right pedal 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.170
 it's even if electronics is there 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.960
 you really have to hold it 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.729
 really push hard on the brakes 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.409
 but not too much because we lose it enough 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.210
 quickly also you have to juggle a 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.680
 little bit between them there are a lot of 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.360
 power and it's very effective 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.470
 so there is a clever dosage to find 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.950
 in the wet in winter conditions 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.170
 who is back is not obvious provide in 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.570
 sixth at 50 km time in town on a 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.959
 gas net on you the slightest 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.690
 overtaking is a formality in two 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.700
 three little blows of palettes to be a 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.560
 little sensitive to deformation of 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.170
 the road the car really reads the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.750
 deformations the road so on the contrary 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790
 other modern cars need 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.000
 hold the steering wheel well are the other ca 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.000
 academies
