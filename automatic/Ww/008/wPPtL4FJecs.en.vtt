00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.490
 Hm next is the fourth role of the guitar I think is farming 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.729
 I want to exchange 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.380
 Mr. m is guitar only 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.929
 With your right hand 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.929
 I have to have the source exactly but 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.929
 For example, you want to kick your body with a kick 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.249
 On the other hand, Iyo Kandal fell below the plan 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.109
 Unknown sound Yukikoko old sound 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.029
 Izumo I always say that I want to say that 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 I think it will be nice music 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.170
 Then s- 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.780
 I would like to introduce some of the patterns 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.240
 First of all, let's make the noise that this peak is present into music 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 I would like to 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.170
 after 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 Now 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.570
 Eco 32 pico 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.499
 In fact, I can only finish it 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:01.500
 eh 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.880
 Pitch is added by moving the owner 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.880
 Furthermore it is running .8mb of the branch 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.730
 It sounds like arte music 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.940
 That's why 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.140
 I went outside 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.210
 Yeah guitar sound source 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 I hit it by hand 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.760
 But there 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.400
 People act 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.290
 In general 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.550
 Total 8 rebounds 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.550
 I just put out a date reverb so I feel like this 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.440
 Kate is 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.920
 I use this part and belt on the way 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.160
 Oh what 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.270
 It's so industrial like that factory visualization 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.620
 s can 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.370
 For example, with a break at a station 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.510
 With the rhythm 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.840
 Together with the rhythm pattern 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.950
 I understood 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.350
 It is somehow 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 I think it's important to be able to use it very musically 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.469
 Next is it 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.499
 Usually a guitar is something that draws from here to here 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:12.709
 It is normal 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.429
 British I 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.209
 Hattori this area 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.400
 With construction know-how 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.579
 I will try this 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.149
 What kind of sound does rice have? 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.629
 British 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:24.440
 It is to this 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.440
 I'll do it for a while with a brief escort and am 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:34.560
 Like 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.440
 What 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.249
 You're making a fierce sound 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.749
 Even past the US mozilla 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.759
 There is a beautiful sound like this 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.299
 This kind of feeling is interesting when trying to use it in eco two songs 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.719
 I think 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.719
 To San-in 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.219
 I'm sorry 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.679
 In the air conditioner doctor break or something 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.009
 But ask again and again 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:00.040
 Ema-weak 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.200
 Former fighter 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.259
 Various people 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.259
 Because this usage was not expected by anyone 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.740
 It is said that English sounds come out 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.549
 I also have a visual look 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.449
 Atari has come 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.799
 Yes I used to drink 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:15.709
 next 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.189
 I'm putting a reverse case on people who disqualified the former with a kick 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.799
 Turtle shell 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.139
 It's like saying lol 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.480
 If this is normal 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.480
 One light is Germany but 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.400
 I want to do sightseeing in the country by putting a reverse house on this 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.729
 I do not know 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.659
 Secrets for comparing low priced frosted glass and money so softened 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.509
 It can also be in sound effects 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.909
 I really like this way, for example 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.439
 But by over direct 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.820
 Until then 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.039
 Well hey 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.929
 People who can not use music but go to things 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.319
 For example, video camera and cane rocking 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.029
 By 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.329
 Seems to be incorporated into the song 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.859
 That means 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.859
 I think from now on it is a new idea 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.110
 Eh I bought the first elector something like Eco is like 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.559
 It was an effector of such a compact type 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:31.439
 Of course with the multi-type over the other side in the rack with the US side 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.620
 I think I can do it because I am saying 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.420
 Yeah 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.950
 There are difficult things that are expensive but 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.150
 I think where the station home in and this 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.050
 The fun of the compact type lid is pinched like a mouth 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.919
 You can play around in the schoolyard 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.229
 Yes for example this knob 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.099
 Anyway in the house 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.129
 Already in the wind 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.749
 Turn to the right 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.499
 It is a flanger This is a regen of Frangiah 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.499
 For example, let's make it old, and such a thing 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.909
 Sale 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.270
 The sound of the television makes it even more 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.129
 Speed ​​to travel 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.770
 This will change the speed of this oil field Spoutttenham 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.430
 Is it too big if this is too close to 10 people? 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.080
 And then 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.129
 Memorization 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.199
 Figure 1 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.030
 fast 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.330
 Well this is going to 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.240
 Adrian Brill also feels like a part 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.240
 You can create over effects 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.669
 Well once in a while this is also flexible 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.919
 I will try to zero this time 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.729
 What happens then 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.969
 I intend to eliminate this 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.249
 If so, the idea will be like this 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.830
 Like this 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.530
 It is said that it is gamelan super or no regrets in yen 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.259
 It makes me feel like a cheese ham-like man 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.650
 Thing 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.939
 This kind of compact first grader is good for eco wave 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:59.480
 Lol anyway bowling 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.020
 Make each knob free, not the Olympics 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.090
 Eleven 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.949
 It is very interesting to be able to use the song 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:07.280
 It is called 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.280
 Remember, compare this to one of your ideas 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.130
 With sl 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.020
 In the end 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.569
 It is an addition 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.569
 I would like to introduce you to the trick of breaking 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.990
 It is a toy machine gun as you see it 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.379
 Bring this close to the guitar 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.289
 when wow 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.289
 I'm doing this kind of roaring house 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:48.089
 Haigle Group 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:49.970
 I thought something was wrong 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.110
 As the questionnaire says, this is really something 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.499
 I'm trying to lift a well 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.889
 From usual 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.889
 I wonder what that funny would come out 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.909
 Just put it in and listen, not really listen 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:05.930
 Toka 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.800
 In the wind that what sound comes out as that day alternative 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.729
 I think it's important to think about noise and effects 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.139
 It would be very impressive if it could be incorporated into English music 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.319
 I think I can do it 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.089
 Well, everyone by all means 

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:21.839
 Try it
