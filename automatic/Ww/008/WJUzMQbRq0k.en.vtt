the<00:00:47.789> background<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.390> video<00:00:48.660> which<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the background of this video which is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.119 
the background of this video which is
because<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:49.289> realized<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.680> boring<00:00:50.100> my

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
because I've realized how boring my

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
because I've realized how boring my
voices<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.449> thought<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> could<00:00:51.840> use

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
voices and I thought I could use

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 
voices and I thought I could use
something<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> perk<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
something to perk it up so this is the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.560 
something to perk it up so this is the
finest<00:00:54.510> royalty-free<00:00:54.989> music<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.949> could<00:00:56.100> find

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
finest royalty-free music I could find

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.729 
finest royalty-free music I could find
but<00:00:57.570> yet<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> first<00:00:58.199> thing<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.530> about

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
but yet the first thing we think about

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.400 
but yet the first thing we think about
is<00:00:58.859> defensive<00:00:59.579> midfielders<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.260> know

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
is defensive midfielders and we all know

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
is defensive midfielders and we all know
how<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> set<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.100> our<00:01:02.250> teams<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.609> terms<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
how to set up our teams in terms of

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
how to set up our teams in terms of
center<00:01:03.300> backs<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> left<00:01:03.870> baton<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
center backs and left baton right that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.710 
center backs and left baton right that
but<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.700> don't<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.270> defensive

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
but I don't think the defensive

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
but I don't think the defensive
midfielder<00:01:07.170> positions<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.770> has<00:01:08.040> ever<00:01:08.250> been

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
midfielder positions one has ever been

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.570 
midfielder positions one has ever been
utilized<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.860> we've<00:01:11.010> been<00:01:11.159> forced<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
utilized or in that we've been forced to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.179 
utilized or in that we've been forced to
use<00:01:11.670> properly<00:01:12.240> until<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.900> FIFA<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
use properly until this FIFA and so

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
use properly until this FIFA and so
you're<00:01:14.340> gonna<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> put<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> player<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
thing about a defensive midfielder is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
thing about a defensive midfielder is
that<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.320> push<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.710> backline<00:01:35.280> back

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that if you push your backline back

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.100 
that if you push your backline back
which<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.240> show<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> how<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
which I'm gonna show you how to do in a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
which I'm gonna show you how to do in a
little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.400> defensive<00:01:38.850> midfielder

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
little bit and the defensive midfielder

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
little bit and the defensive midfielder
can<00:01:39.450> sort<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> mop<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.170> any<00:01:40.320> defensive

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
can sort of mop up any defensive

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.109 
can sort of mop up any defensive
spillages<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.600> our<00:01:42.720> midfield<00:01:43.020> spillages

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
spillages or just our midfield spillages

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
spillages or just our midfield spillages
and<00:01:45.119> sometimes<00:01:45.659> take<00:01:45.930> care<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.500> business

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and sometimes take care of business

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.370 
and sometimes take care of business
before<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.060> gets<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.450> center<00:01:48.810> backs<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
before it gets to your center backs and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.560 
before it gets to your center backs and
and<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:50.729> nice<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.270> means<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and it's also nice because it means that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.639 
and it's also nice because it means that
you'll<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> bring<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.140> Center<00:01:52.439> backs

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you'll have to bring your Center backs

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
you'll have to bring your Center backs
out<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.009> position<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> off<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.060> field

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
out of position and off the field

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
out of position and off the field
make<00:01:54.930> early<00:01:55.290> tackles<00:01:55.799> having<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> decent

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
make early tackles having a decent

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.249 
make early tackles having a decent
defensive<00:01:57.090> midfielders<00:01:57.570> means<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.140> they

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
defensive midfielders means that they

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.770 
defensive midfielders means that they
can<00:01:58.500> sort<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> make<00:01:59.640> tackles<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.390> keep<00:02:00.630> your

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
can sort of make tackles and keep your

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420 
can sort of make tackles and keep your
centre<00:02:01.049> backs<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.500> position<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.250> that's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
centre backs in position so that's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.859 
centre backs in position so that's
something<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.729> recommend<00:02:03.060> adding<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.810> your

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
something I recommend adding to your

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.410 
something I recommend adding to your
squad<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.500> then<00:02:05.100> try<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> build<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.149> squad

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
squad and then try to build your squad

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.160 
squad and then try to build your squad
around<00:02:06.659> really

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
around really

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
around really
so<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.710> these<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.039> some<00:02:08.190> old<00:02:08.310> Nike<00:02:08.550> mock-ups

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so I'm these are some old Nike mock-ups

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.669 
so I'm these are some old Nike mock-ups

that<00:03:10.000> I'm<00:03:10.150> better<00:03:10.540> at<00:03:10.660> passing<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.380> scoring

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
that I'm better at passing and scoring

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.650 
that I'm better at passing and scoring
and<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.550> running<00:03:12.820> up<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.060> wings<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:13.510> run

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
and just running up the wings and run

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.090 
and just running up the wings and run
that<00:03:13.840> people<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.260> whole<00:03:14.380> time<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.709> scoring

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
that people the whole time and scoring

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.340 
that people the whole time and scoring
so<00:03:15.700> these<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.330> custom<00:03:16.720> tactics<00:03:17.170> it's<00:03:17.320> a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
so these are the custom tactics it's a

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.509 
so these are the custom tactics it's a
bit<00:03:17.500> annoying<00:03:17.709> because<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.070> have<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.280> change

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
bit annoying because you have to change

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.090 
bit annoying because you have to change
this<00:03:18.730> before<00:03:18.910> every<00:03:19.360> single<00:03:19.510> game<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.950> can

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
this before every single game and it can

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.140 
this before every single game and it can
get<00:03:21.220> fun<00:03:21.550> where<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.700> can<00:03:21.850> do<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:21.970> really

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
get fun where you can do it really

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.940 
get fun where you can do it really
quickly<00:03:22.450> I'd<00:03:22.959> still<00:03:23.200> rather<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:23.590> have<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.739> way

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
quickly I'd still rather just have a way

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.920 
quickly I'd still rather just have a way
that<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.160> can<00:03:24.250> save<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.970> which<00:03:25.570> as<00:03:25.720> far<00:03:25.750> as

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
that you can save it and which as far as

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.050 
that you can save it and which as far as
I<00:03:26.080> know<00:03:26.140> there<00:03:26.739> isn't<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.160> if<00:03:27.580> someone<00:03:27.850> does

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
I know there isn't one if someone does

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.370 
I know there isn't one if someone does
know<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.269> way<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.630> can<00:03:28.780> save<00:03:29.019> your<00:03:29.230> custom

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
know a way that you can save your custom

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.680 
know a way that you can save your custom
path<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.130> online<00:03:30.430> games<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.910> if<00:03:31.570> you

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
path it's for online games and if you

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.690 
path it's for online games and if you
leave<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> comment<00:03:32.200> I'd<00:03:32.470> be<00:03:32.590> very<00:03:32.680> good<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.489> I'm

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
leave a comment I'd be very good so I'm

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.750 
leave a comment I'd be very good so I'm
yeah<00:03:34.360> I've<00:03:34.540> been<00:03:34.750> my<00:03:34.930> speak<00:03:35.350> time<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.340> seven

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
yeah I've been my speak time up to seven

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.060 
yeah I've been my speak time up to seven
ages<00:03:37.090> for<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.300> build-up<00:03:37.600> play<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.140> like<00:03:38.980> I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
ages for the build-up play and like I

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.710 
ages for the build-up play and like I
said<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.489> fund<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.820> passings<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.330> lot<00:03:40.480> better

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
said that fund of passings a lot better

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.210 
said that fund of passings a lot better
so<00:03:40.900> if<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.080> put<00:03:41.260> these<00:03:41.410> up<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.769> actually<00:03:42.040> try

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
so if you put these up and actually try

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.940 
so if you put these up and actually try
and<00:03:42.250> pass<00:03:42.610> more<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.350> use<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> lot<00:03:44.890> of

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
and pass more and and and use a lot of

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.470 
and pass more and and and use a lot of
passing<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.400> your<00:03:45.430> build-up<00:03:45.820> play<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.330> should

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
passing in your build-up play you should

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.460 
passing in your build-up play you should
actually<00:03:46.750> notice<00:03:46.930> all<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.080> difference<00:03:47.380> the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
actually notice all the difference the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.140 
actually notice all the difference the
amount<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.769> goals<00:03:47.980> you've<00:03:48.190> started<00:03:48.760> scoring

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
amount of goals you've started scoring

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.000 
amount of goals you've started scoring
because<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:50.290> certainly<00:03:50.470> have<00:03:50.769> I've

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
because and I certainly have I've

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.949 
because and I certainly have I've
started<00:03:51.250> conceding<00:03:51.880> less<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.360> scoring<00:03:52.810> more

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
started conceding less and scoring more

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.199 
started conceding less and scoring more
with<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.380> kind<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.650> South<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:55.090> these

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
with this kind of South and but these

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.490 
with this kind of South and but these
are<00:03:55.330> just<00:03:55.420> kind<00:03:55.510> of<00:03:55.600> all<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.840> things<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.170> change

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
are just kind of all the things I change

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.080 
are just kind of all the things I change
if<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.920> follow<00:03:57.130> these<00:03:57.310> if<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.670> want<00:03:57.910> you

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
if you follow these if you want you

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.210 
if you follow these if you want you
don't<00:03:58.269> have<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.709> important<00:04:00.070> one<00:04:00.190> that

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
don't have to but the important one that

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.100 
don't have to but the important one that
I've<00:04:00.430> definitely<00:04:00.940> recommend<00:04:01.420> changing<00:04:01.959> is

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
I've definitely recommend changing is

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.380 
I've definitely recommend changing is
the<00:04:02.260> defense<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.400> take<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.730> pressure<00:04:04.030> and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
the defense if you take the pressure and

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.780 
the defense if you take the pressure and
aggression<00:04:04.720> right<00:04:05.260> down<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.890> about<00:04:06.070> ten<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
aggression right down to about ten and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.850 
aggression right down to about ten and
this<00:04:07.510> means<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.870> your<00:04:07.989> backline<00:04:08.500> will<00:04:08.650> stay

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
this means that your backline will stay

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.039 
this means that your backline will stay
way<00:04:09.070> back<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.640> won't<00:04:10.000> be<00:04:10.239> like<00:04:10.450> up<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.780> field

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
way back and won't be like up the field

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.990 
way back and won't be like up the field
and<00:04:11.260> easy<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.920> beat<00:04:12.100> just<00:04:12.489> with<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.730> through

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
and easy to beat just with the through

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.690 
and easy to beat just with the through
ball<00:04:13.239> or<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.420> Loftus<00:04:13.900> revolt<00:04:14.350> and<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:15.580> yeah

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
ball or a Loftus revolt and so yeah

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.219 
ball or a Loftus revolt and so yeah
that's<00:04:15.880> why<00:04:15.970> I'd<00:04:16.060> recommend<00:04:16.419> doing<00:04:16.479> try<00:04:17.049> that

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
that's why I'd recommend doing try that

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.240 
that's why I'd recommend doing try that
out<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.440> see<00:04:17.680> how<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:17.890> works

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
out and see how it works

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.940 
out and see how it works
use<00:04:18.430> worked<00:04:18.790> very<00:04:19.269> well<00:04:19.330> for<00:04:19.479> me<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:19.989> I'd<00:04:20.769> also

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
use worked very well for me and I'd also

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.980 
use worked very well for me and I'd also
recommend<00:04:21.160> making<00:04:21.609> your<00:04:21.789> backline<00:04:22.510> narrower

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
recommend making your backline narrower

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.200 
recommend making your backline narrower
by<00:04:23.349> taking<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.710> width<00:04:23.890> them<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.490> pushing

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
by taking the width them and pushing

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.909 
by taking the width them and pushing
players<00:04:25.539> out<00:04:25.720> onto<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.990> wing<00:04:26.080> I've<00:04:26.349> found

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
players out onto the wing I've found

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.619 
players out onto the wing I've found
easier<00:04:27.249> to<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.520> fans<00:04:27.759> I<00:04:28.060> really<00:04:28.300> struggle

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:28.629 
easier to the fans I really struggle

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.059 
easier to the fans I really struggle
with<00:04:28.689> people<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.020> running<00:04:29.379> straight<00:04:29.530> at<00:04:29.830> my

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
with people just running straight at my

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.270 
with people just running straight at my
defense<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.759> dribble<00:04:31.719> and<00:04:31.810> pass<00:04:31.960> them<00:04:32.259> and<00:04:32.499> so

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
defense and dribble and pass them and so

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.980 
defense and dribble and pass them and so
making<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.669> making<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.180> narrower<00:04:34.419> means<00:04:34.870> that

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
making it making it narrower means that

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.149 
making it making it narrower means that
there's<00:04:35.139> not<00:04:35.259> as<00:04:35.349> many<00:04:35.409> gaps<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.949> they<00:04:36.039> can

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
there's not as many gaps that they can

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.230 
there's not as many gaps that they can
just<00:04:36.310> pass<00:04:36.490> through<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.759> middle<00:04:36.939> and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
just pass through the middle and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.469 
just pass through the middle and
therefore<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> force<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.800> onto<00:04:39.009> the<00:04:39.129> wing

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
therefore the force that onto the wing

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.809 
therefore the force that onto the wing
on<00:04:40.479> top<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:41.020> this<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.409> make<00:04:41.680> use<00:04:41.919> of<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.580> quick

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
on top of this I make use of the quick

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.149 
on top of this I make use of the quick
tactics<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.479> game<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:44.110> right<00:04:44.860> here<00:04:45.039> I've

tactics in game and right here I've

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.499 
tactics in game and right here I've
included<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.639> little<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:46.090> don't<00:04:46.180> know<00:04:46.389> if<00:04:46.449> I

included a little I don't know if I

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.119 
included a little I don't know if I
included<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.990> slow-motion<00:04:47.620> replay<00:04:48.039> of

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
everything you'll notice a big

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.709 
everything you'll notice a big
difference<00:05:06.610> in<00:05:07.029> your<00:05:07.060> gameplay<00:05:07.509> you<00:05:07.569> should

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
difference in your gameplay you should

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.420 
difference in your gameplay you should
score<00:05:07.960> more<00:05:08.229> goals<00:05:08.259> like<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:08.889> certainly

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
score more goals like that certainly

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.920 
score more goals like that certainly
he'd<00:05:09.610> try<00:05:09.909> it<00:05:09.969> out<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.360> try<00:05:10.509> and<00:05:10.689> sort<00:05:10.810> of

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
he'd try it out and try and sort of

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.499 
he'd try it out and try and sort of
switch<00:05:11.080> up<00:05:11.229> your<00:05:11.259> gameplay<00:05:11.650> a<00:05:11.740> bit<00:05:11.949> and<00:05:12.509> but

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
switch up your gameplay a bit and but

switch up your gameplay a bit and but
yeah<00:05:13.629> right<00:05:13.930> here<00:05:14.199> are<00:05:14.409> some<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.919> examples

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
yeah right here are some of the examples

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.240 
yeah right here are some of the examples
I<00:05:15.669> use<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.330> aside<00:05:17.110> from<00:05:17.139> things<00:05:17.590> I've<00:05:17.800> done<00:05:18.009> I

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
I use and aside from things I've done I

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.439 
I use and aside from things I've done I
haven't<00:05:18.370> really<00:05:18.580> changed<00:05:18.759> that<00:05:19.029> much<00:05:19.180> about

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
haven't really changed that much about

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.659 
haven't really changed that much about
my<00:05:19.599> actual<00:05:19.900> gameplay<00:05:20.139> style<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:21.009> I've<00:05:21.490> made

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
my actual gameplay style and I've made

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.820 
my actual gameplay style and I've made
use<00:05:21.879> of<00:05:21.909> some<00:05:22.180> of<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.330> things<00:05:22.539> that<00:05:22.900> have

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
use of some of the things that have

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.800 
use of some of the things that have
always<00:05:24.009> been<00:05:24.129> in<00:05:24.370> FIFA<00:05:24.669> like<00:05:25.029> the<00:05:25.330> teammate

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
always been in FIFA like the teammate

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.839 
always been in FIFA like the teammate
campaign<00:05:26.349> and<00:05:26.650> right<00:05:27.310> here<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.639> something

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
campaign and right here is something

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.489 
campaign and right here is something
I've<00:05:28.060> never<00:05:28.270> really<00:05:28.599> used<00:05:28.779> that<00:05:28.960> much<00:05:29.199> but

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:29.499 
I've never really used that much but

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:31.559 
I've never really used that much but
I've<00:05:29.589> found<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:30.099> be<00:05:30.219> quite<00:05:30.490> helpful<00:05:30.759> if<00:05:31.270> you

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
I've found to be quite helpful if you

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.450 
I've found to be quite helpful if you
hold<00:05:31.719> B<00:05:31.930> your<00:05:32.139> circle<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:32.770> kind<00:05:32.919> of<00:05:32.979> cools<00:05:33.219> back

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
hold B your circle it kind of cools back

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.420 
hold B your circle it kind of cools back
the<00:05:33.849> attacker<00:05:34.449> and<00:05:34.839> and<00:05:35.740> that's<00:05:35.889> quite<00:05:36.069> useful

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
the attacker and and that's quite useful

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.100 
the attacker and and that's quite useful
if<00:05:36.610> they're<00:05:36.909> sort<00:05:37.120> of<00:05:37.240> one-on-one<00:05:37.659> with<00:05:37.839> your

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
if they're sort of one-on-one with your

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.510 
if they're sort of one-on-one with your
keeper<00:05:38.289> if<00:05:38.529> you<00:05:38.620> can<00:05:38.770> get<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:38.889> defender<00:05:39.279> force

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
keeper if you can get a defender force

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.189 
keeper if you can get a defender force
enough<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.089> another<00:05:40.839> thing<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.050> I've

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
enough and another thing that I've

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.889 
enough and another thing that I've
noticed<00:05:41.349> is<00:05:41.710> like<00:05:42.460> them<00:05:42.789> all<00:05:43.240> over<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.599> or

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:43.899 
noticed is like them all over the or

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.450 
noticed is like them all over the or
happening<00:05:44.349> all<00:05:44.469> over<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.710> place<00:05:44.889> sorry<00:05:45.279> all

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
happening all over the place sorry all

right cut bats I don't really have any
good<00:05:47.409> examples<00:05:47.589> because<00:05:48.219> I<00:05:48.339> just<00:05:48.550> sort<00:05:48.669> of<00:05:48.699> two

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
good examples because I just sort of two

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
and it's easy just to forget a defender

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.860 
and the third one that I use is teammate
contain<00:06:04.629> and<00:06:05.339> pressing<00:06:06.339> a<00:06:06.490> or<00:06:06.789> X<00:06:07.300> if<00:06:07.599> you're<00:06:07.750> on

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
contain and pressing a or X if you're on

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.779 
contain and pressing a or X if you're on
the<00:06:07.930> PlayStation<00:06:08.439> the<00:06:08.529> same<00:06:08.740> thing<00:06:08.979> so<00:06:09.580> I'm

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
the PlayStation the same thing so I'm

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.219 
the PlayStation the same thing so I'm
that's<00:06:10.210> pretty<00:06:10.419> much<00:06:10.509> the<00:06:10.659> three<00:06:10.839> things<00:06:11.050> I<00:06:11.169> do

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
that's pretty much the three things I do

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.200 
that's pretty much the three things I do
pull<00:06:11.860> people<00:06:12.159> back<00:06:12.189> when<00:06:12.610> they're<00:06:12.729> one-on-one

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
pull people back when they're one-on-one

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.579 
pull people back when they're one-on-one
but<00:06:13.419> I<00:06:13.539> keep<00:06:13.750> her<00:06:13.870> and<00:06:13.990> I<00:06:14.050> get<00:06:14.169> a<00:06:14.199> defender

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:14.589 
but I keep her and I get a defender

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.309 
but I keep her and I get a defender
close<00:06:14.770> enough<00:06:15.039> and<00:06:15.279> I<00:06:16.120> watch<00:06:16.599> for<00:06:16.839> cutbacks

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
close enough and I watch for cutbacks

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.889 
close enough and I watch for cutbacks
because<00:06:17.740> also<00:06:18.099> got<00:06:18.250> an<00:06:18.339> arrow<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:19.000> backline

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:19.899 
because also got an arrow and backline

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:21.360 
because also got an arrow and backline
though<00:06:20.139> which<00:06:20.319> pushes<00:06:20.529> people<00:06:20.740> onto<00:06:21.099> the<00:06:21.189> wing

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
though which pushes people onto the wing

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.879 
though which pushes people onto the wing
and<00:06:21.580> they're<00:06:21.729> likely<00:06:21.969> to<00:06:22.270> cut<00:06:22.419> it<00:06:22.539> back<00:06:22.750> and<00:06:23.080> I

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
and they're likely to cut it back and I

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.519 
and they're likely to cut it back and I
also<00:06:24.279> use<00:06:24.939> the<00:06:25.120> teammate<00:06:25.569> contain<00:06:25.960> by<00:06:26.169> holding

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
also use the teammate contain by holding

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.019 
also use the teammate contain by holding
RB<00:06:26.919> and<00:06:27.189> r1<00:06:27.969> along<00:06:28.539> with<00:06:29.050> a<00:06:29.319> or<00:06:29.770> just<00:06:30.729> pressing

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:31.029 
RB and r1 along with a or just pressing

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:32.670 
RB and r1 along with a or just pressing
B<00:06:31.240> or<00:06:31.479> circle<00:06:31.839> if<00:06:31.930> you're<00:06:32.050> in<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.169> PlayStation

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
B or circle if you're in the PlayStation

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.709 
B or circle if you're in the PlayStation
4<00:06:32.710> back<00:06:33.009> of<00:06:33.159> them<00:06:33.279> so<00:06:33.879> I<00:06:33.909> don't<00:06:34.300> have<00:06:34.449> the<00:06:34.539> best

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
4 back of them so I don't have the best

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.570 
4 back of them so I don't have the best
examples<00:06:35.289> there<00:06:35.529> I'll<00:06:35.709> admit<00:06:35.889> that<00:06:36.219> but

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
examples there I'll admit that but

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.550 
examples there I'll admit that but
that's<00:06:36.969> pretty<00:06:37.029> much<00:06:37.209> all<00:06:37.449> I<00:06:37.479> do<00:06:37.599> and<00:06:38.019> the

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
that's pretty much all I do and the

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.020 
that's pretty much all I do and the
custom<00:06:38.949> tactics<00:06:39.370> and<00:06:39.519> that<00:06:39.610> has<00:06:39.699> worked

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
custom tactics and that has worked

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.400 
custom tactics and that has worked
a<00:06:40.060> lot<00:06:40.300> better<00:06:40.450> for<00:06:40.660> me<00:06:40.780> than<00:06:40.990> changing<00:06:41.350> my

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
a lot better for me than changing my

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.930 
a lot better for me than changing my
game<00:06:41.620> place<00:06:41.860> though<00:06:42.070> and<00:06:42.400> doing<00:06:42.760> all<00:06:42.850> these

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
game place though and doing all these

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.910 
game place though and doing all these
different<00:06:43.090> packet<00:06:43.570> picks<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:43.960> you<00:06:44.710> try<00:06:44.890> them

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
different packet picks and you try them

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.110 
different packet picks and you try them
out<00:06:45.160> you<00:06:45.310> don't<00:06:45.460> really<00:06:45.580> got<00:06:45.730> anything<00:06:45.940> to

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
out you don't really got anything to

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.220 
out you don't really got anything to
lose<00:06:46.330> because<00:06:46.480> if<00:06:46.600> you're<00:06:46.780> watching<00:06:46.900> this

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
lose because if you're watching this

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.320 
lose because if you're watching this
video<00:06:47.410> and<00:06:47.680> you're<00:06:48.400> obviously<00:06:48.880> in<00:06:49.030> a<00:06:49.090> position

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
video and you're obviously in a position

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.240 
video and you're obviously in a position
where<00:06:49.660> you're<00:06:49.810> losing<00:06:50.020> a<00:06:50.230> lot<00:06:50.350> of<00:06:50.410> goals<00:06:50.680> so

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
where you're losing a lot of goals so

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.500 
where you're losing a lot of goals so
it's<00:06:51.430> worth<00:06:51.610> trying<00:06:51.820> some<00:06:52.090> different<00:06:52.420> things

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
it's worth trying some different things

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.840 
it's worth trying some different things
out<00:06:52.750> and<00:06:53.050> if<00:06:53.830> you<00:06:53.980> like<00:06:54.130> this<00:06:54.220> video<00:06:54.370> leave<00:06:54.790> a

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
out and if you like this video leave a

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.730 
out and if you like this video leave a
like<00:06:54.940> and<00:06:55.300> save<00:06:55.960> from<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.230> thank<00:06:56.530> you<00:06:56.620> for
