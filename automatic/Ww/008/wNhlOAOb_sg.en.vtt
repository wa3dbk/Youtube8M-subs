 very low fuel consumption and 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.710
 electricity as an example 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.649
 We will talk about the start- up of the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.989
 model f 55 you can removable tank 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.579

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.290
 that is performing installation by 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.300
 trained installer we must do what 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.309
 next like this stove the pond 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.649
 removable let's see the internal load

 fill the pond make sure you clean 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.110
 the fuel splashes 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.570
 note that the fuel cap this 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.460
 right and properly tight pintal

 pond plug the stove into the socket 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.830
 electric current programs the clock 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.630
 important the clock in the stove 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.520
 be always fixed at the correct time 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.290
 it is only possible to program the work

 the stove is operated directly by 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.880
 the user however the production of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.680
 heat is controlled automatically in 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.260
 compliance with the ambient temperature 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.910
 Registered by the temperature sensor 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.800
 the on button resounds in the viewer 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.080
 information will be presented the temperature 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.360
 environment and the temperature set the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.250
 button will start to blink and it will 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.020
 the stove will rise if there is no more 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.300
 visible after the ignition period 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.820
 the stove will be deactivated and it will return to 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.590
 turn on the programming automatically 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.840
 of the temperature can only be adjusted 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.399
 when the stove is in combustion use 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.340
 the adjustment buttons to regulate the 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.410
 temperature the saving function allows 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.119
 limit the active temperature the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.730
 saving programming by pressing the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.650
 save button the timer allows you 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.580
 turn on the stove automatically to a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.710
 previous hour 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.660
 so that the timer is active 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.150
 must have set the correct time in the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.800
 stove having been turned off it can be 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.030
 use the childproof lock to 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.470
 prevent children from changing 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.630
 programming the stove so 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.430
 accidental when the stove is in 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.440
 combustion and blocking for child is 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.630
 activated the only thing that can be done with 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.160
 the stove is turning it off there are two ways to 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.560
 turn off the stove by pressing the button 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.960
 off the information viewer will show the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.070
 signal clock circulation fan 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.750
 Air and fan motor 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.550
 will continue to work 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.740
 approximately three minutes to 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.060
 cool the stove we can also turn off 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.520
 the stove with the timer button 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.110
 timer in this way will go back to 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.780
 turn on the next time with the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.040
 timer or the stove is protected 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.740
 against the damages caused by the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.260
 overheating turns off the stove leaves 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.050
 cool the stove will also unplug 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.910
 of the power grid is almost not needed 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.830
 give stove maintenance but yes it is 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.050
 important to clean the air filter with 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.880
 a vacuum cleaner and the grid with a cloth 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.980
 wet that this cleaning should be 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.810
 perform weekly in flex 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.459
 also regularly the filter 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.590
 fuel every time you load 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.910
 kerosene is also important that 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.730
 before consulting 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.500
 know that it is likely that there may be 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.170
 white smoke when the stove is turned on 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.240
 for the first time the stove emits sounds 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.520
 of this river printed when heated 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.590
 or cool the expansion and contraction 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.690
 of the metal parts can cause 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.670
 slight sounds of this noise the 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.320
 circulation of the air in the room 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.720
 It starts immediately when the 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.700
 stove during the first use when 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.800
 just the fuel can run away a 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.940
 strong sound of this river this indicates 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.520
 that there is air in the fuel pump 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.650
 which will disappear in approximately 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.080
 one minute during power on and off 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.510
 it is normal for the stove to emit some pain 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.190
 before turning on the regulator the socket 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.150
 air according to the height above the level of 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.350
 sea you are in, review your manual 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.300
 periodically check the filter 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.060
 fuel with clean kerosene and the 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.590
 fan grille with vacuum cleaner 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.300
 turn off correctly never 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.030
 unplug and disconnect the supply 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.340
 electric daily for one hour low 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.950
 the temperature of your stove to the minimum 6 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.080
 serious degrees for system cleaning 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.580
 I used that good quality teachers 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.280
 acquire or in establishments 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.260
 authorized never leave the stove 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.780
 lit without supervision or with children 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.760
 without the hope of an adult perform 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.920
 maintenance only in technical services 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.980
 authorized and at least once 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.990
 year I never know that the clothes on the stove do not 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.600
 Install the stove near furniture 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.230
