00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
just make a little triangle so when

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.830 
just make a little triangle so when
that's<00:02:57.170> dry<00:02:58.180> it'll<00:02:59.180> look<00:02:59.329> like<00:02:59.540> this<00:03:01.450> okay<00:03:02.450> so

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
that's dry it'll look like this okay so

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.990 
that's dry it'll look like this okay so

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
gonna do is take two halves and you're

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.559 
gonna do is take two halves and you're
going<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.459> difficult<00:03:11.000> part

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:15.950 
gonna put glue on here here and here and
then

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
then

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.030 
then
are<00:04:16.020> gonna<00:04:16.110> take<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:18.480> piece<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.320> you're

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
are gonna take this piece and you're

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.210 
are gonna take this piece and you're
gonna<00:04:20.190> like<00:04:20.930> lean<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.170> up<00:04:22.320> against<00:04:22.770> something

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
gonna like lean it up against something

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.880 
gonna like lean it up against something
and<00:04:26.600> then<00:04:27.600> you're<00:04:27.750> gonna<00:04:27.870> take<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.440> final

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
and then you're gonna take the final

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.810 
and then you're gonna take the final
piece<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:31.230> you're<00:04:31.440> gonna<00:04:31.530> like<00:04:31.800> balance<00:04:32.550> it

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
piece and you're gonna like balance it

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.910 
piece and you're gonna like balance it
on<00:04:33.000> there<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.720> mean<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.260> really<00:04:34.560> hard

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
on there and I mean it is really hard

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.140 
on there and I mean it is really hard
but<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.130> know<00:04:35.340> what<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.550> mean

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
but you know what I mean

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.900 
but you know what I mean
and<00:04:37.020> I'm<00:04:37.650> doing<00:04:37.890> this<00:04:38.130> with<00:04:38.310> one<00:04:38.490> hand<00:04:38.520> which

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
and I'm doing this with one hand which

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.740 
and I'm doing this with one hand which
is<00:04:39.090> practically<00:04:39.630> impossible<00:04:41.570> but<00:04:42.570> you're

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
is practically impossible but you're

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.070 
is practically impossible but you're
going<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.020> want<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.710> balance<00:04:44.700> it<00:04:45.240> against<00:04:45.840> this

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
going to want to balance it against this

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:55.670 
going to want to balance it against this
so<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.770> ends<00:04:47.130> up<00:04:48.410> like<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:55.530> it

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
so that it ends up like this so that it

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.650 
so that it ends up like this so that it
looks<00:04:55.950> like<00:04:56.040> this<00:04:59.150> so<00:05:00.150> you're<00:05:00.240> going<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.450> lean

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
looks like this so you're going to lean

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.570 
looks like this so you're going to lean
this<00:05:00.870> piece<00:05:01.170> up<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.620> balance<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.430> it's

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
this piece up and balance it and it's

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
this piece up and balance it and it's
going<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:02.790> glue<00:05:03.000> there<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.390> then<00:05:03.480> you're

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
going to glue there and then you're

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.960 
going to glue there and then you're
going<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.750> take<00:05:04.080> your<00:05:04.320> glue<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:05.010> pour<00:05:05.730> some

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
going to take your glue and pour some

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.650 
going to take your glue and pour some
glue<00:05:06.210> on<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.420> top<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.710> that<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:08.070> top<00:05:08.310> pieces

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
glue on the top so that the top pieces

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.730 
glue on the top so that the top pieces
stick<00:05:09.660> together<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.260> you're<00:05:10.350> going<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.530> end

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
stick together and you're going to end

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.760 
stick together and you're going to end
up<00:05:10.860> with<00:05:11.100> something<00:05:11.460> like<00:05:11.610> this<00:05:14.120> okay<00:05:15.200> so<00:05:16.200> then

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
up with something like this okay so then

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.380 
up with something like this okay so then
what<00:05:16.980> you<00:05:17.100> want<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.400> do<00:05:17.610> is<00:05:17.850> if<00:05:18.030> you're<00:05:18.210> going
