B have I don't know some sort of

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.690 
B have I don't know some sort of
hand-eye<00:02:59.230> coordination<00:02:59.440> because<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:00.580> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
hand-eye coordination because if you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.090 
hand-eye coordination because if you

miss a bag and then it this is all for

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.440 
miss a bag and then it this is all for
nothing<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.670> have<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.880> run<00:03:04.030> back<00:03:04.209> into<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
nothing so you have to run back into the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.820 
nothing so you have to run back into the
fire<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.810> case<00:03:04.989> up<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.290> took<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.410> couple<00:03:05.680> of

fire in case up it took a couple of

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.860 
fire in case up it took a couple of
attempts<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.160> get<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:06.819> hopefully<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.810> all

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
attempts to get this so hopefully it all

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.479

it's<00:03:57.049> doing<00:03:57.260> as<00:03:57.319> much<00:03:57.439> work<00:03:57.500> as<00:03:57.799> we<00:03:57.890> can

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
it's doing as much work as we can

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.979 
it's doing as much work as we can
animals<00:03:58.519> not<00:03:58.730> an<00:03:58.819> issue<00:03:58.939> because<00:03:59.209> between<00:03:59.540> our

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989
