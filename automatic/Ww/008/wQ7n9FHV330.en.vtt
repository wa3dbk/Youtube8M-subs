it does give really good volume for a
natural<00:01:18.299> mascara<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:19.409> better<00:01:19.590> than

physicians<00:01:20.549> formula<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.720> opinion<00:01:22.729> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
physicians formula in my opinion it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
physicians formula in my opinion it's
it's<00:01:24.570> still<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.020> big<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.530> touches<00:01:25.740> my

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's still really big so it touches my

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's still really big so it touches my
eyelid<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.640> leaves<00:01:27.000> marks<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.600> but

alright<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.210> there's<00:04:55.390> two<00:04:55.570> coats<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:57.280> love

alright so there's two coats and I love
it<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:59.050> pretty<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.770> it<00:05:00.670> really<00:05:00.850> does<00:05:01.090> open

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
it so pretty and it really does open

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.240 
it so pretty and it really does open
your<00:05:01.690> eyes<00:05:01.780> up<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.320> make<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.650> look<00:05:02.860> like

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
your eyes up and make you look like

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.550 
your eyes up and make you look like
you're<00:05:03.370> wearing<00:05:03.490> false<00:05:03.730> eyelashes<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:05.200> don't

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
you're wearing false eyelashes I don't

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.980 
you're wearing false eyelashes I don't
never<00:05:05.830> applied<00:05:06.220> three<00:05:06.490> coats<00:05:06.670> before<00:05:07.060> but<00:05:07.270> I

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
never applied three coats before but I

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.480 
never applied three coats before but I
think<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.500> might<00:05:08.590> be<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:08.890> draw<00:05:09.100> for<00:05:09.280> three

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
think it might be to draw for three

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.670 
think it might be to draw for three
coats<00:05:09.670> or<00:05:10.000> might<00:05:10.630> get<00:05:10.780> clumpy<00:05:11.110> after<00:05:11.350> that<00:05:11.500> but

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
coats or might get clumpy after that but

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.770 
coats or might get clumpy after that but
two<00:05:11.830> coats<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.220> definitely<00:05:12.550> good<00:05:12.730> I<00:05:12.970> think

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
two coats is definitely good I think

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.880 
two coats is definitely good I think
this<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:13.960> an<00:05:14.200> amazing<00:05:14.500> mascara<00:05:15.060> um<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:17.650> first

this is an amazing mascara um the first

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.350 
this is an amazing mascara um the first
time<00:05:18.040> I<00:05:18.280> tried<00:05:18.550> it<00:05:18.580> when<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:18.790> brought<00:05:18.970> it<00:05:19.030> home<00:05:19.180> I

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
time I tried it when I brought it home I

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.210 
time I tried it when I brought it home I
