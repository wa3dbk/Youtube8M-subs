 another cruze of 2013 12 and the wine 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:25.740
 13 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:30.509
 engine 18 engine capacity 1 and 8 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.340
 there is a block Siemens box automatic from 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.540
 Here the owner will tell you now 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.300
 actually his conclusions after 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.980
 how did we do that changed the car 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.680
 After the firmware, I will say that the machine 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.440
 became faster 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.160
 gas pedal field responsive became 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.130
 from the place of benefits with us. 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.040
 direct 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.690
 should be better 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.490
 already gave up and ask 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.740
 understandable if you take it was thoughtfulness 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.440
 such and such is hard to disperse 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.740
 here are called then firms that is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.229
 action pedal is not specified immediately 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:12.270
 reflected on the operation of the motor pressed there 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 were letting go gas this passes the clan and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 switching according to speeds 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.900
 departures and here are guys how do I appear without 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.060
 I do not know how to cheat 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.610
 why did the factory make such a car 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.950
 know this i know invasion slip away 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.890
 long story about ecology but then 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:42.700
 it's god but the point is that the plant 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:47.140
 the task is absolutely your 141 and sew 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.380
 listen there wear it work principle 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.509
 his work even if we maximize it 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.119
 hold if we put the car on 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.899
 stand press gas floor 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.880
 equipped slept there 6200 this is not so 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.670
 then it will be 141 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 and how many horses are turning 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.530
 moment on the speed at which we are with you 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.720
 there is yes well how much is two or three 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.370

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.099
 nowhere regulated in the passport 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.800
 It is written, and there it is just a kind of here 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.200
 firmware returns torque to 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.480
 mean revs I already have a lot to everyone here 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.140
 told us what we do 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.300
 unsporting tuning when we wring out 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.019
 from the engine is all the most recent of 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.180
 it's called a civil film when 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.200
 motor rises torque zone 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.690
 small and medium speed thanks just 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.049
 thank you good luck goodbye 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.049
