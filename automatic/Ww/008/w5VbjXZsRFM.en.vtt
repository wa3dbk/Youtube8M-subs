00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
buttons to hit with you have the top

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729 
buttons to hit with you have the top
spin<00:00:33.450> which<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> biggest<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> bottom

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
spin which is the biggest on the bottom

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920 
spin which is the biggest on the bottom
right<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.790> slice<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.510> next<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
right you have a slice which is next and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.930 
right you have a slice which is next and
then<00:00:37.050> lob<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.649> above<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> way<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
then lob is above that now the way it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.240 
then lob is above that now the way it
works<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.390> hold<00:00:39.809> down<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> button<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
works is you hold down on the button and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
works is you hold down on the button and
you<00:00:41.340> let<00:00:41.579> go<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.930> time<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you let go at just the right time and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.750 
you let go at just the right time and
that's<00:00:43.890> where<00:00:44.040> you're<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.489> good

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that's where you're going to see good

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510 
that's where you're going to see good
too<00:00:45.059> early<00:00:45.510> or<00:00:45.660> too<00:00:45.750> late<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.070> that's<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.399> way

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
too early or too late and that's the way

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
too early or too late and that's the way
this<00:00:47.670> plays<00:00:48.000> now<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.170> bit<00:00:49.289> tricky

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
this plays now it's a little bit tricky

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
this plays now it's a little bit tricky
to<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.950> into<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> joystick<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.059> get<00:00:51.210> your

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
to get into the joystick and get your

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
to get into the joystick and get your
aiming<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.960> right<00:00:52.230> away<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.039> also<00:00:53.190> pull

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
aiming down right away you can also pull

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
aiming down right away you can also pull
it<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.149> you've<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.989> net<00:00:55.289> play

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it back a bit you've got net play

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010 
it back a bit you've got net play
currently<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:57.059> set<00:00:57.300> where<00:00:57.510> my<00:00:57.750> guy<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
currently I have it set where my guy is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.200 
currently I have it set where my guy is
running<00:00:58.410> automatically<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.550> apparently<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
running automatically but apparently you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
running automatically but apparently you
can<00:01:00.390> change<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.020> you're<00:01:01.410> well<00:01:01.739> good<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
can change that if you're well good and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.340 
can change that if you're well good and
you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.850> actually<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> running<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.019> well

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you can actually do the running as well

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.780 
you can actually do the running as well
but<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:04.979> telling<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> be

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
but I'm telling you that's going to be

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.120 
but I'm telling you that's going to be
pretty<00:01:06.030> difficult<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.260> way<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.590> game<00:01:07.830> plays

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pretty difficult the way this game plays

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.910 
pretty difficult the way this game plays

difficulty<00:01:39.960> levels<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.470> game<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.100> may

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
difficulty levels for the game I may

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.130 
difficulty levels for the game I may
have<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.090> wrong<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.750> pretty<00:01:42.990> sure

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
