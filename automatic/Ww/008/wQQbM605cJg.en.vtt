 Who behind every great researcher was of course a strong woman 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:07.500
 maybe even behind some average researchers may be good 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.829
 That work is always intact for every researcher 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.169
 a prelude one who pays it 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.990
 The industry is capable of doing that and lets explore what their network is for 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:18.749
 example 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.149
 that asbestos fibers tolerate heat% great building material great 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.279
 Business but who would have spent money back then to explore 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.840
 What asbestos fibers in human bodies do not matter as little as 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.070
 for the study of antibiotics in drinking water glutamate in ready meals 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.930
 or plasticizer in plastic toys is always researched where money is earned 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.990
 and not soon where money was saved in the future if you can 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.390
 the consequential damage would not have been exemplified by the food it shows 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.110
 Documentary purchased truth that modern science does not 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.080
 researches almost as freely 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.080
 how the big one has come to gold for sure 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.360
 Things we do not understand scare us 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.379
 Dean Foods was an independent scientist leaving Postbank 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.830
 For us the renowned BÃ¼chi Biker was a bit too 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.550
 Record numbers Meanwhile, the riding Steinfurt raced was not sure 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.920
 are the ingredients in their diet that has been researched professor 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.390
 Post the lab is located according to institute in Scotland industry 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.899
 Science because we try to tease out if he has a long time 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.399
 He always wanted two children under it, it is a process of being in 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.210
 the cold 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.040
 he file over the clouds 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.160
 Lead places 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.960
 Price scientist truck area cooperates 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.260
 for safe browsing for our fellow citizens as Duke's rabbit too 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.820
 enjoy the freedom of dfb-elf 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.980
 what role does the role of IT, I would always eat it all a lot 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.470
 before I do a counter-proof against a comparable experiment 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.530
 Technically remember blood and silver when he finally assures certainty 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.510
 the ballot takes place on 10 too much 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.080
 a few days later will be left largely to do after over 30 years 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.339
 in the UK 1 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.919
 he has noticed during his studies try that so 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:12.909
 changes 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.150
 in the immune system get into organs' weight and so on everything 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.370
 Signs that mean for a scientist because we have to look more 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:27.730
 and that was not done but on the contrary he flew out of the institute all 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.689
 his documents were confiscated per 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.849
 and they were threatened when he did 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.760
 to lose any word about his activity 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.109
 then he would lose his pension 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.919
 Football is not completely rehabilitated until today but now it is real 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.119
 independently an internationally popular critic of genetic engineering 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:52.999
 Change of location Mexico 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:57.399
 another protagonist of purchased truth of microbiologist Tigers 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:01.379
 South Africa he discovered transgenic mine in investigations here 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.589
 while the Mexico is prohibited 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.889
 the manipulated mostly had apparently scattered 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.219
 as stable produces in the science magazine Nature Schleck the 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.919
 Industry She hires an agency on with the order Nature 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.919
 To put pressure and discredit more stable 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.549
 worried WS Sparber the Horde BW Neuss 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.969
 this company so the herring quota 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:33.299
 he created two fictional characters that was doubles goals and created 100 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.489
 percent 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.749
 I forgot Erfurt 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.819
 Semeta operation they invented 200 million there solves these two 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.870
 Doctoral students on the Internet and began to spread rumors about it 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.889
 Backbreaker that what we sat was wrong and the magazine 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.649
 ours would continue to increase 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:55.139
 Kirby Law is primarily active is hardly a scientist 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.559
 that's how it goes 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.409
 Viral marketing calls these visitors a lot more perfidious things 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.629
 Genetic Engineering 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.829
 Why 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.849
 So an example is made to a person like Chur Teller or to one 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.699
 Person as well as the breath 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.029
 and that's pretty clear now, it's just a message 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.799
 to the young scientists 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.930
 to say love people 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.849
 think about exactly what you want a branch which questions he wanted to investigate 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.460
 You have it example of castings for Taylor, you will see 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.349
 and because horror most young scientists are being persecuted 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.210
 This also shows the film the combination of industry and politics Boll plays 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.599
 the US government industry would be heavy rain 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.599
 the sentences against Costa Rica and Colombia has fallen 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.349
 he worries so that pressures water as well as numerous schools of this 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.199
 Scientific circles he was that the FBS Monsanto and the other side 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.740
 do not worry 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.789
 we want to be your scientific results of our soul we ask 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.720
 show you once again independent studies if you believe it is one 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.340
 Problem comes to us, of course, but Paul Cloe 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.800
 So that's incredible 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.040
 imagine we know that with roses they're the car we're showing 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.740
 Pretty I keep for sure except they say the patient is massive for example 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.569
 means voluntary regulation and is clearly a disaster also Bauer 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.580
 a government should not work 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.749
 next level directed research 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:26.089
 In Berkeley, California, BP has gone to college 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:28.629
 that means 500 million 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.110
 Both new product videos are much more important but that they also influence the 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.469
 Curriculum only Holub prefers 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:36.800
 to throw the wages 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.460
 Quality Berta now also gives access to the decision some scientists 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.039
 on the taxi and what not 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.379
 Because he was protesting against the bp deal, Jobkiller had to rely on his for years 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.969
 to wait for the upcoming professorship in Berkeley 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.019
 and still has problems financing its projects 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.470
 that has excited 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.300
 bought research manipulated food 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.219
 all very far away from us 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.740
 we are still dependent 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.809
 from the bees porten of soy and corn which go technically 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:11.779
 be changed and produced in Argentina or Brazil or something 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.569
 that means they are coming 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:15.860
 here over 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.189
 the animals eat there is always the closest net comes to it there is no 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.210
 exclusive examinations 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.240
 purchased truth, he is unrestrained to create parties 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.819
 and yet it makes terrifyingly clear we do not know how we can trust ourselves 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.629
 do not know what he is eating 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.629
 the experimental animals are 4 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:37.610
 who the good appetite
