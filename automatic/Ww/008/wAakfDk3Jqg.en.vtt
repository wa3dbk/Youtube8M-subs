00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
the system and that's because it was a

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.260 
the system and that's because it was a
16-bit<00:05:32.650> era<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:33.160> Terrence<00:05:33.789> like<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:34.000> talked

our favorite era video games of course

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.250 
our favorite era video games of course
games<00:05:38.200> now<00:05:38.410> but<00:05:39.220> more<00:05:39.400> realistic<00:05:39.580> than<00:05:39.850> ever

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
games now but more realistic than ever

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.860 
games now but more realistic than ever
it<00:05:41.260> sound<00:05:41.530> better<00:05:41.710> than<00:05:41.830> ever<00:05:42.330> but<00:05:43.330> they're

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
it sound better than ever but they're

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.279 
it sound better than ever but they're
not<00:05:43.990> timeless<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:45.419> believe<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.510> 16-bit<00:05:46.870> era<00:05:46.990> is

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
not timeless I believe the 16-bit era is

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.080 
not timeless I believe the 16-bit era is
timeless<00:05:47.650> for<00:05:47.860> me<00:05:47.950> it's<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.250> Renaissance<00:05:48.820> of

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
timeless for me it's the Renaissance of

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.360 
timeless for me it's the Renaissance of
the<00:05:49.210> video<00:05:49.419> game<00:05:49.479> era<00:05:49.900> but<00:05:50.860> I<00:05:50.950> mean<00:05:51.070> by<00:05:51.190> that<00:05:51.220> is

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
the video game era but I mean by that is

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.640 
the video game era but I mean by that is
like<00:05:51.760> well<00:05:52.450> everything<00:05:52.840> was<00:05:52.960> so<00:05:53.110> hand-drawn

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
like well everything was so hand-drawn
