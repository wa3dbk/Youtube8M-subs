glass I've found that here are some

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
glass I've found that here are some
better<00:01:39.270> cases<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:40.020> goes<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.740> higher<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
better cases that goes a bit higher and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760 
better cases that goes a bit higher and
it<00:01:41.909> goes<00:01:42.060> all<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> way<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> look<00:01:43.619> at

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it goes all the way up if you look at

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
it goes all the way up if you look at
the<00:01:43.920> at<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> edge<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.750> see<00:01:45.899> that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the at the edge you will see that
