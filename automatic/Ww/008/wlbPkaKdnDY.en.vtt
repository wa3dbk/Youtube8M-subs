area<00:00:18.950> of<00:00:19.189> our<00:00:19.340> studio<00:00:19.759> that<00:00:20.029> was<00:00:20.150> dedicated<00:00:20.390> to

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
area of our studio that was dedicated to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.900 
area of our studio that was dedicated to
recording<00:00:21.619> just<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:22.490> we<00:00:22.609> didn't<00:00:22.760> have<00:00:22.789> to

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
recording just so we didn't have to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.939 
recording just so we didn't have to
constantly<00:00:23.300> break<00:00:23.510> down<00:00:23.750> items<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.439> you<00:00:24.859> know

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
constantly break down items and you know

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.410 
constantly break down items and you know
all<00:00:25.099> of<00:00:25.130> our<00:00:25.279> gear<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:25.699> then<00:00:25.789> set<00:00:26.000> it<00:00:26.090> back<00:00:26.210> up

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
all of our gear and then set it back up

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.660 
all of our gear and then set it back up
again<00:00:26.590> now<00:00:27.590> that<00:00:27.740> means<00:00:27.890> that<00:00:27.980> pretty<00:00:28.490> much

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
again now that means that pretty much

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.519 
again now that means that pretty much
the<00:00:28.730> only<00:00:29.090> place<00:00:29.390> that<00:00:29.420> we<00:00:29.750> have<00:00:29.869> available<00:00:30.080> is

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
the only place that we have available is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.220 
the only place that we have available is
this<00:00:30.890> backside<00:00:31.580> warehouse<00:00:32.029> area<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:33.050> isn't

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
this backside warehouse area that isn't

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.479 
this backside warehouse area that isn't
currently<00:00:33.680> being<00:00:33.860> used

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
currently being used

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.829 
currently being used
so<00:00:34.820> I'm<00:00:34.910> actually<00:00:35.150> guys<00:00:35.300> had<00:00:35.449> a<00:00:35.480> set<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.780> a

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
so I'm actually guys had a set of a

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.240 
so I'm actually guys had a set of a
scene<00:00:36.050> when<00:00:36.350> we<00:00:36.410> don't<00:00:36.620> have<00:00:36.800> that<00:00:36.980> much<00:00:37.129> to

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
scene when we don't have that much to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.160 
scene when we don't have that much to
work<00:00:37.399> with<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.420> other<00:00:38.540> caveat<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.960> this<00:00:39.050> is

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
work with the other caveat to this is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.650 
work with the other caveat to this is
that<00:00:39.440> we're<00:00:39.559> going<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:39.739> use<00:00:39.980> only<00:00:40.329> fifteen<00:00:41.329> to

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
that we're going to use only fifteen to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.819 
that we're going to use only fifteen to
thirty<00:00:42.140> dollar

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
thirty dollar

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.190 
thirty dollar
I<00:00:43.370> think<00:00:43.640> fifty<00:00:43.879> dollar<00:00:44.059> cheap<00:00:44.600> home<00:00:44.870> depot

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
I think fifty dollar cheap home depot

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.720 
I think fifty dollar cheap home depot
lighting<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.160> we're<00:00:46.250> not<00:00:46.340> going<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.489> use<00:00:46.610> any

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
lighting so we're not going to use any

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.310 
lighting so we're not going to use any
professional<00:00:47.149> lighting<00:00:47.420> in<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:47.600> set<00:00:47.840> the

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
professional lighting in this set the

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.389 
professional lighting in this set the
first<00:00:48.559> thing<00:00:48.680> that<00:00:48.710> obviously<00:00:49.070> needs<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.370> be

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
first thing that obviously needs to be

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.010 
first thing that obviously needs to be
done<00:00:49.579> with<00:00:49.699> our<00:00:49.820> space<00:00:50.090> is<00:00:50.329> just<00:00:50.360> moving<00:00:50.899> the

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
shooting space is kind of more of an

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.819 
shooting space is kind of more of an
industrial<00:01:01.969> warehouse<00:01:02.420> feel<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.620> we're<00:01:03.739> gonna

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
wall so it doesn't move and then we're

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.540 
wall so it doesn't move and then we're
gonna<00:02:41.000> add<00:02:41.270> on<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.900> little<00:02:42.650> duct<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.400> let

using it to direct our light right
towards<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.520> subject<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.209> light<00:02:50.360> doesn't

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390
