 explosion in one of the largest sources of energy consumption 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.050
 of procession of pollution 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.460

 cites the private sector the government recently 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.460
 he participated very little 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.570

 build better 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.880
 so that it is generated - pollution ii - and with movement that will debate this 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.380
 can be done in two ways and better planned concessions 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.290
 the city where the constructions will be 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
