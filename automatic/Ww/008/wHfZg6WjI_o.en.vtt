00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.440
 Future line, 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.340
 Future ship, sea, 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.140
 Future ship, sea, dawn 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 tranquil 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.640
 Calm vision 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.140
 There is a fog in the calm view (HAZE) 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 Self, straight through 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.520
 today 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.020
 Unstable today 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.840
 Unstable future today. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.040
 tomorrow, 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.420
 Tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.120
 Tomorrow, and then, 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 which 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.680
 Any hope 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.880
 I have to hold on to some hope 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.500
 You can stay alive. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.280
 Can I hear you say 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420
 Because I know, 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.900
 Without this dream 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.660
 With this dreamless diagram 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.440
 With this unimaginable diagram, 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.800
 It is hard to break what is decided, 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.540
 It's hard to break what's fixed, but now 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.080
 Tomorrow 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.160
 Prompt for tomorrow 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.340
 I'll go ahead with tomorrow, 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.000
 Obviously, 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.680
 Clearly the future of the ideal 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.240
 To the future world that clearly expresses the ideals. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.740
 It does not stop when you start running, 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.420
 now 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.160
 Now the sky 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.040
 If the sky is singing now. 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.660
 no, 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.300
 This 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.080
 It's not like this. 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.980
 tomorrow, 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.880
 Tomorrow, tomorrow, 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.800
 Tomorrow, tomorrow, I will not stop 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.740
 I 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.340
 I painted 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.300
 The future I have drawn 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.420
 Now you can wait 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.420
 I can not wait. 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.060
 Most of them are ambiguous, 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 Most obscure index, ambiguous until now 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.280
 I can not just turn around. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.820
 I can not just cry now. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.160
 Play it, 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.760
 Play it out, Stand out 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.260
 The correct answer is 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.080
 There is no longer the right answer, 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.060
 The future is ours. 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.200
 Now, as time goes by, 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.080
 Summer 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.200
 I miss summer 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.300
 Do not miss summer 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.840
 I would rather hope 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.040
 To the future world which hoped for hope rather. 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.240
 It becomes the wind, 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.760
 destined 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.280
 Tomorrow's 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.920
 The sky of tomorrow 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.180
 If you do not sing. 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.540
 Because I know, 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.000
 I know, I hope so. 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.040
 "I am me." 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.420
 "I am me." 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.180
 It turns out to be a wind, 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.200
 I am a wind, my song is. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.560
 From the top of the drawing world 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.880
 Even if you take your breath away 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.020
 One endpoint 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.360
 Now that one endpoint has been found, 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.640
 I'm going to be a wind, 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.820
 We are going to be the wind, we are. 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.940
 Because I know, 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.580
 Without this dream 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.360
 With this dreamless diagram 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.580
 With this unimaginable diagram, 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.340
 I am tired of breaking things up, 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.700
 I am tired of breaking things up, but now 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.880
 Tomorrow 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.960
 Prompting tomorrow 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.080
 I'll go head to head for tomorrow, 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.660
 clearly 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.160
 Obviously more than 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.860
 Obviously, 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.500
 The future that clearly depicted the ideal 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.520
 To the future world that clearly expressed the ideal. 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.380
 When it starts running, it does not stop, 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.120
 now 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.920
 Now the sky 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.800
 If the sky is singing now
