concepts<00:01:03.119> just<00:01:03.360> like<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.690> try<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.880> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
concepts just like to try to get you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.490 
concepts just like to try to get you
know<00:01:05.970> rough<00:01:06.240> ideas<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.690> what<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:06.930> gonna<00:01:07.020> do

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
know rough ideas of what I'm gonna do

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
know rough ideas of what I'm gonna do
it<00:01:07.619> never<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:08.040> turns<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.450> like

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it never really turns out that way like

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.980 
it never really turns out that way like
I<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.530> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.510> play<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.540> different

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I I just kind of play with different

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
I I just kind of play with different
concepts<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> color<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.040> line<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.640> shape

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
concepts of color and line and shape

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.240 
concepts of color and line and shape
form<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.540> surface<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.260> location

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
form but I think the surface in location

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
form but I think the surface in location
art<00:01:20.759> surrounding<00:01:21.240> architecture<00:01:21.590> generally

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
art surrounding architecture generally

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.980 
art surrounding architecture generally
speaks<00:01:22.859> to<00:01:23.009> me<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.759> surface<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
speaks to me the surface like the this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
speaks to me the surface like the this
in<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.289> case<00:01:25.469> it's<00:01:25.679> brick<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
in this case it's brick and I like the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
in this case it's brick and I like the
way<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.359> paint<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.630> hitting<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:27.990> brick

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
way that the paint is hitting the brick

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:38.110 
way that the paint is hitting the brick
it's<00:01:28.380> got<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> an<00:01:28.920> interesting<00:01:29.310> texture

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.210 

I<00:01:38.210> saw<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:39.020> there<00:01:39.440> is<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.620> slight<00:01:40.010> chance

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
I saw that it's there is a slight chance

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.070 
I saw that it's there is a slight chance
of<00:01:40.640> rain<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.090> its<00:01:41.270> first<00:01:41.420> temperature<00:01:41.930> looks

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
of rain but its first temperature looks

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.780 
of rain but its first temperature looks
like<00:01:42.230> it's<00:01:42.380> supposed<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.590> be<00:01:42.710> pretty<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.730> do

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
like it's supposed to be pretty what do

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.280 
like it's supposed to be pretty what do
you<00:01:43.880> think<00:01:44.090> about<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.600> far<00:01:44.780> do<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:44.990> like<00:01:45.110> it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290

people don't if you don't understand
abstract<00:02:17.400> painting<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.030> sort<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.300> hard<00:02:19.020> to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
abstract painting it's sort of hard to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.290 
abstract painting it's sort of hard to
grasp<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.520> something<00:02:20.850> it's<00:02:21.000> hard<00:02:21.180> to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
grasp or something it's hard to

generally<00:02:26.250> speaking<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.300> think<00:02:27.860> once<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
generally speaking I I think once the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.680 
generally speaking I I think once the
works<00:02:29.220> done<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.550> usually<00:02:30.330> get<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> pretty

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
works done I usually get a pretty

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.110 
works done I usually get a pretty
positive<00:02:31.100> reaction<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.310> because<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.910> color

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
positive reaction just because the color

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.640 
positive reaction just because the color
people<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.720> at<00:02:33.810> least<00:02:33.900> respond<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.440> color

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
people can at least respond to the color

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.670 
people can at least respond to the color
though<00:02:35.100> vibrance<00:02:35.990> you<00:02:36.990> know<00:02:37.110> not<00:02:37.290> all<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> them

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
though vibrance you know not all of them

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.840

my work and I in the past and ever
really<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.040> always<00:03:17.370> thought<00:03:17.550> about<00:03:17.790> color<00:03:18.000> but

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
now I'm really thinking a lot more about

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.750 
now I'm really thinking a lot more about
it<00:03:22.140> when<00:03:22.260> I'm<00:03:22.350> working<00:03:22.530> I'm<00:03:22.860> really<00:03:23.430> putting<00:03:23.700> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
it when I'm working I'm really putting a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.250 
it when I'm working I'm really putting a
lot<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.940> emphasis<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> colors<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.170> think

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
lot of emphasis on the colors I think

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.009 
lot of emphasis on the colors I think
the<00:03:25.500> use<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.680> bright<00:03:26.670> colors<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.360> drips<00:03:27.780> and

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
the use of bright colors and drips and

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:28.720 
the use of bright colors and drips and
kind<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
kind of

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.960 
kind of
spontaneous<00:03:29.599> mark-making<00:03:30.019> can<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.950> know<00:03:31.069> can

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
spontaneous mark-making can you know can

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.670 
spontaneous mark-making can you know can
be<00:03:32.030> an<00:03:32.780> acquired<00:03:33.170> taste

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
be an acquired taste

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.520 
be an acquired taste
I<00:03:33.769> guess<00:03:33.950> yeah

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.880
