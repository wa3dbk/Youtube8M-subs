 moving the two beautiful to read and I 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.129
 I'm a little ahead of the law wheel 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 to be able to do their maneuvers to have 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.289
 cable access to the accounts of the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 Genuine she runs large bar and

 venom jaime there is already prohibited changing 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.870
 side too 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.960
 and this system of war reminds him 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.909
 gives us the pressure that we want the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.659
 it a bit lighter a little more 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.970
 heavy is a very light team and I can 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.610
 with little wind with more wind dosar one 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.869
 little that weight on that day sell 45 9 90 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.869
 to see the speed of the boat well 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.080
 preparing a change 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.010
 inside the spacejackers in space 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:48.270

 maiden gentle to this ready finish 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.500
 electing again 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.350
 letting go of theirs begin to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.460
 clean a little bar to start a 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.820
 new maneuver gives to note that it is 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:20.960
 enough makes it easy to maneuver the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:26.720
 boat alone, this approach does not 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:33.700
 working with lenny already in great big 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.700
 and already imagined very close to the mill 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:45.950
 the good rudder sp response manages to do 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.610
 maneuvers very close to boats and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.610
 other obstacles 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:07.070

 I let out the big beautiful breeze already in 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.370
 Roland imagined they are heading to the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.050
 Mast lowering not that great 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:31.820

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:34.180
 really make it very peaceful with everything 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.180
