00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the way sorry I've only got one hand and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.959 
the way sorry I've only got one hand and
a<00:00:58.590> foot<00:00:58.620> videos<00:00:59.100> almost<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> hard

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
a foot videos almost it's kind of hard

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.719 
a foot videos almost it's kind of hard
to<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:02.510> notice<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to do notice that we do this it's a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
to do notice that we do this it's a
little<00:01:05.970> tighter<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.869> exactly<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.439> loose

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
little tighter it's not exactly as loose

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
little tighter it's not exactly as loose
as<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.760> actually<00:01:08.909> helps<00:01:09.240> me

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
as it would be so this actually helps me

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
as it would be so this actually helps me
get<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:09.990> better<00:01:10.170> control<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:11.549> I'm

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
get a little bit better control when I'm

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
get a little bit better control when I'm
playing<00:01:11.760> call<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> duty<00:01:12.299> I've<00:01:12.750> noticed<00:01:13.080> some

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
playing call of duty I've noticed some

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
playing call of duty I've noticed some
of<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:13.380> aiming<00:01:14.360> especially<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> sniper

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of my aiming especially with the sniper

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.270 
of my aiming especially with the sniper
rifle<00:01:16.200> has<00:01:16.350> been<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.650> bit<00:01:16.860> better<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
rifle has been a little bit better and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950 
rifle has been a little bit better and
of<00:01:17.640> course<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.970> works<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.479> joysticks

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
of course this works for both joysticks

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320 
of course this works for both joysticks
now<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> dedicated<00:01:20.580> d-pad<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
now I do like the dedicated d-pad it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
now I do like the dedicated d-pad it
seems<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.229> pretty<00:01:22.380> accurate<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.100> know

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
seems like it's pretty accurate you know

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.670 
seems like it's pretty accurate you know
it's<00:01:23.430> dead-on<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.960> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.290> left

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's dead-on so if you want to get left

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.340 
it's dead-on so if you want to get left
or<00:01:25.979> right<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.330> you're<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.200> really

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
or right up and down you're not really

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.600 
or right up and down you're not really
going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> other<00:01:29.250> ones<00:01:29.460> by

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
going to get one of the other ones by

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.569 
going to get one of the other ones by
accident<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:31.079> light<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.979> buttons<00:01:32.280> here

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
accident the light up buttons here

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
accident the light up buttons here
they're<00:01:33.570> mechanical<00:01:33.810> buttons<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.560> are

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
they're mechanical buttons that they are

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.910 
they're mechanical buttons that they are
not<00:01:35.180> as<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:36.900> use<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> membrane<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
not as they don't use that membrane that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310 
not as they don't use that membrane that
the<00:01:38.220> regular<00:01:38.640> 360<00:01:39.060> controllers<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the regular 360 controllers do and I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.929 
the regular 360 controllers do and I
mean<00:01:40.470> they're<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.710> really<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.310> accurate

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
mean they're like really really accurate

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
mean they're like really really accurate
and<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.630> easy<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.079> use<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.280> thing

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and really easy to use that's one thing

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.620 
and really easy to use that's one thing
I<00:01:44.520> was<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:44.729> kind<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> surprised<00:01:45.420> about

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
I was actually kind of surprised about

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
I was actually kind of surprised about
like<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.500> barely<00:01:46.890> touch<00:01:47.040> them<00:01:47.220> almost

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
like you can barely touch them almost

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
like you can barely touch them almost
thought<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.700> could<00:01:47.939> cough<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.420> them<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> they

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
thought you could cough on them and they

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
thought you could cough on them and they
would<00:01:49.170> hit<00:01:49.350> automatically<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.759> you're

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
would hit automatically and you're

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
would hit automatically and you're
really<00:01:51.180> low<00:01:51.329> profile<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.439> right

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
really low profile if you can see right

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
really low profile if you can see right

I've<00:02:02.939> noticed<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.420> little<00:02:03.600> bit<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.049> uh<00:02:04.079> it

I've noticed a little bit that uh it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
I've noticed a little bit that uh it
seems<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.189> maybe<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.479> faster

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
seems like maybe it's a little faster

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.630 
seems like maybe it's a little faster
response<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.979> maybe<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.369> cause<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
response but maybe that's just cause a
