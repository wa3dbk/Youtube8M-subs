all<00:00:51.480> summer<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.140> much<00:00:52.289> Sun<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.739> can

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
all summer and as much Sun as you can

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.029

from<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.540> yard<00:03:39.690> now<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.140> kind<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.350> closer<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
from the yard now it's kind of closer to

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.979 
from the yard now it's kind of closer to
the<00:03:40.860> house<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.280> case<00:03:41.430> there<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:42.239> hard

this<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.670> filiform<00:03:48.540> astray<00:03:49.110> CI<00:03:49.400> there's<00:03:50.400> a

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
this is a filiform astray CI there's a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.040 
this is a filiform astray CI there's a
good<00:03:50.700> view<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:50.910> what<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.150> hibernacula<00:03:51.870> looks

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
good view of what a hibernacula looks

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.089 
good view of what a hibernacula looks
like<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.319> it's<00:03:52.440> getting<00:03:52.590> ready<00:03:52.800> for<00:03:52.950> winter

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
like so it's getting ready for winter

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.539 
like so it's getting ready for winter
it's<00:03:53.819> no<00:03:53.970> longer<00:03:54.150> producing<00:03:54.690> new<00:03:54.780> lead

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
it's no longer producing new lead

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.610 
it's no longer producing new lead
the<00:03:57.549> red<00:03:57.760> dragon<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:59.680> looking<00:03:59.980> quite<00:04:00.069> red

the red dragon is looking quite red

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.229 
the red dragon is looking quite red
so<00:04:02.620> for<00:04:02.830> Venus<00:04:03.069> flytrap<00:04:03.519> care<00:04:03.790> for<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.000> winter

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
so for Venus flytrap care for the winter

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.729 
so for Venus flytrap care for the winter
time<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:05.019> don't<00:04:05.140> want<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.409> leave<00:04:05.500> them<00:04:05.620> out

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
time you don't want to leave them out

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.710 
time you don't want to leave them out
just<00:04:05.980> like<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.549> rest<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.849> your<00:04:07.030> temperate

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
carnivorous plants the big mouth is

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:18.150 
carnivorous plants the big mouth is
looking<00:04:10.840> really<00:04:11.110> good<00:04:16.560> these<00:04:17.560> big<00:04:17.799> pictures

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
looking really good these big pictures

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.530 
looking really good these big pictures
on<00:04:18.310> them<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.669> big<00:04:21.820> mouth<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.150> going<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.419> be

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
on them so the big mouth is going to be

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.810 
on them so the big mouth is going to be
somewhat<00:04:22.930> stereotypical<00:04:23.490> winter<00:04:24.490> pictures

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
somewhat stereotypical winter pictures

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.480

they're going to be closer to the ground
not<00:04:30.820> quite<00:04:31.060> up<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:31.449> high<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.169> a

start with they stick way up so it's
going<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.310> start<00:04:39.430> forming<00:04:39.820> traps<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.240> are

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
going to start forming traps that are

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.180 
going to start forming traps that are
closer<00:04:40.539> to<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:42.130> feet

they're<00:05:27.220> not<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.400> house<00:05:27.639> plant<00:05:27.820> they'll<00:05:28.720> only

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
they're not a house plant they'll only

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.550 
they're not a house plant they'll only
grow<00:05:29.199> inside<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:30.599> miss<00:05:31.599> one<00:05:31.870> winter<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.470> then

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
grow inside and miss one winter and then

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.170 
grow inside and miss one winter and then
they'll<00:05:32.800> be<00:05:32.919> dead<00:05:33.310> by<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.550> following<00:05:34.030> winter

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
they'll be dead by the following winter

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.279 
they'll be dead by the following winter
they<00:05:34.930> really<00:05:35.349> need<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:36.780> winter<00:05:37.780> rest<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.139> go

that winter rest so they always come
back<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:46.449> the<00:05:46.539> spring<00:05:46.630> they<00:05:47.440> always<00:05:47.590> come<00:05:47.770> back

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
back in the spring they always come back

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.730 
back in the spring they always come back
better<00:05:48.190> and<00:05:48.430> bigger

but yeah these are just the ordinary
venus<00:05:53.040> flytraps<00:05:53.520> they're<00:05:54.180> really<00:05:54.600> slow

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
venus flytraps they're really slow

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.210 
venus flytraps they're really slow
because<00:05:54.990> it's<00:05:55.230> cold<00:05:55.470> the<00:05:55.620> trap<00:05:55.830> does<00:05:55.980> newer

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
because it's cold the trap does newer

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.000 
because it's cold the trap does newer
work<00:05:56.430> there<00:05:56.700> goes<00:05:58.880> takes<00:05:59.880> a<00:06:00.000> lot<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.240> UM
