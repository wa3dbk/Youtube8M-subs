the<00:02:21.430> detail<00:02:21.819> on<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.420> very<00:02:23.050> sparse<00:02:23.680> really

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
the detail on this is very sparse really

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.490 
the detail on this is very sparse really
there's<00:02:24.640> not<00:02:24.790> much<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.299> well<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.260> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
there's not much on it well it is a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.030 
there's not much on it well it is a
always<00:02:26.860> planet<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.120> how<00:02:28.840> much<00:02:29.019> detail<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.860> you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
always planet so how much detail can you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.710 
always planet so how much detail can you
put<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.519> a<00:02:30.580> nice<00:02:31.209> planet

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
put on a nice planet

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.710 
put on a nice planet
other<00:02:31.959> than<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.500> few<00:02:32.920> blue<00:02:33.190> pieces<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.480> lots

other than a few blue pieces and a lots
of<00:02:34.900> whites<00:02:35.379> now<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:36.159> do<00:02:36.280> get<00:02:36.430> some<00:02:36.640> silver<00:02:37.180> trim

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
of whites now we do get some silver trim

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.600 
of whites now we do get some silver trim
on<00:02:37.599> this<00:02:37.780> just<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.500> give<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.739> detail<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.430> bit

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
on this just to give that detail a bit

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.589 
on this just to give that detail a bit
more<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.900> standout<00:02:41.799> appeal<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:43.150> it's

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
more of a standout appeal but it's

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.520 
more of a standout appeal but it's
definitely<00:02:44.500> not<00:02:44.920> one<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:46.360> nicest<00:02:47.079> planets

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530

front piece there

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.879 
front piece there
this<00:03:31.660> sloping<00:03:32.590> piece<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.489> printed<00:03:34.150> brick<00:03:35.049> so

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
this sloping piece is I printed brick so

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.740 
this sloping piece is I printed brick so
that<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.160> nice<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.549> have<00:03:36.639> in<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:36.940> cheap<00:03:37.150> set<00:03:37.540> as

well

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.309 
well
now<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.590> cockpit<00:03:39.099> section<00:03:39.340> there<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:40.109> not<00:03:41.109> too

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
now the cockpit section there is not too

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.229 
now the cockpit section there is not too
good<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.709> think<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.730> one<00:03:42.849> part<00:03:43.120> that

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
good I think this is the one part that

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.680 
good I think this is the one part that
lets<00:03:43.599> this<00:03:43.989> set<00:03:44.829> down<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:46.209> cockpit

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
lets this set down the the cockpit

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.400 
lets this set down the the cockpit
section<00:03:47.109> going<00:03:48.099> across<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.730> top<00:03:48.760> it's<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:50.200> at

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
section going across the top it's not at

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.589 
section going across the top it's not at
the<00:03:50.530> base<00:03:50.739> but<00:03:51.069> let's<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.940> look<00:03:52.000> around<00:03:52.269> we

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
the base but let's have a look around we

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.720 
the base but let's have a look around we
have<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.900> grill<00:03:53.139> at<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.440> back<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:54.579> the
