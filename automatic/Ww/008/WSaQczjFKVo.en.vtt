00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
sights seem to be fucking retarded to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780 
sights seem to be fucking retarded to
think<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.270> sights<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.659> shit<00:01:13.729> when<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
think these sights are shit when you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
think these sights are shit when you
pack<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> punch<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> Python<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
pack a punch the Python you get the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.179 
pack a punch the Python you get the
Cobra<00:01:16.530> yeah<00:01:16.970> it's<00:01:17.970> good<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:19.049> really<00:01:19.979> good

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
Cobra yeah it's good like really good

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.070 
Cobra yeah it's good like really good
but<00:01:20.610> let's<00:01:20.759> elaborate<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> Cobra<00:01:21.810> gets

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
but let's elaborate a bit the Cobra gets

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.719 
but let's elaborate a bit the Cobra gets
twice<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.500> ammo<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> speed<00:01:23.220> reloader

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
twice the ammo and a speed reloader

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
twice the ammo and a speed reloader
I<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.689> Deaf<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.960> need<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.439> if

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I don't know how in Deaf I need to go if

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440 
I don't know how in Deaf I need to go if
you<00:01:25.830> can't<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> awesome<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.270> one

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.719 
obese for perks
I'd<00:01:31.799> recommend<00:01:32.040> playing<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> Python

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I'd recommend playing to the Python

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
I'd recommend playing to the Python
strikes<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.540> fast<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.110> powerful<00:01:34.229> using

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
strikes it's fast and powerful using

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
strikes it's fast and powerful using

Juggernog double tap and stand-up is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.060 
Juggernog double tap and stand-up is
