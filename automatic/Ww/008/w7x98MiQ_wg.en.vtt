so-called<00:00:54.989> scientific<00:00:55.590> revolution<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.309> was

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
so-called scientific revolution I was

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.290 
so-called scientific revolution I was
inspired<00:00:57.510> by<00:00:57.629> his<00:00:58.140> book<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.920> try<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> study

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
inspired by his book then try to study

history<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.350> mathematics<00:01:02.270> some<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.420> my

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
history of mathematics some of my

pod<00:01:07.380> tell<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> different<00:01:09.060> number<00:01:09.960> systems

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
pod tell the different number systems

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.410 
pod tell the different number systems
but<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.340> find<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.820> part<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.049> most<00:01:13.650> interesting

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
but I find that part is most interesting

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
but I find that part is most interesting
give<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.630> example<00:01:15.659> say<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.979> decimal

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
give you one example say the decimal

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.359 
give you one example say the decimal
place<00:01:17.909> value<00:01:17.939> system<00:01:18.689> now<00:01:19.409> students<00:01:20.040> take

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
place value system now students take

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.179 
place value system now students take
that<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.939> granted<00:01:20.970> say<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.890> ten

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that for granted say we know use ten

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.149 
that for granted say we know use ten
digits<00:01:23.640> 0<00:01:24.270> 1<00:01:24.630> 2<00:01:25.049> 3<00:01:25.080> 4<00:01:25.740> 5<00:01:26.070> 6<00:01:26.100> 7<00:01:26.880> &amp;<00:01:27.240> 9<00:01:27.680> then<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:28.920> then

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &amp; 9 then put then

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.359 
digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &amp; 9 then put then
I<00:01:29.400> put<00:01:29.790> these<00:01:30.030> ten<00:01:30.829> digits<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.950> different

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I put these ten digits in different

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.149 
I put these ten digits in different
places<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.360> write<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.920> numbers<00:01:34.920> big

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
places then we can write a numbers big

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.539 
places then we can write a numbers big
as<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.670> wish<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.200> number<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.770> small<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.340> you

actually the human being took more than

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.200 
actually the human being took more than
a<00:01:44.810> thousand<00:01:45.810> years<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.290> develop<00:01:46.500> these

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
a thousand years to develop these

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
astronomy for 20 basis now we do not use

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.839 
astronomy for 20 basis now we do not use
them<00:02:24.540> much<00:02:25.550> but<00:02:26.550> now<00:02:27.590> now<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.980> use<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.819> most

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
them much but now now we use the most

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.210 
them much but now now we use the most
often<00:02:30.660> as<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.440> decimal<00:02:32.099> place<00:02:32.250> value<00:02:32.280> system

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220

when<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.840> lecture<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.230> part<00:02:37.560> actually<00:02:37.799> tell

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
when I lecture this part actually tell

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.589 
when I lecture this part actually tell
the<00:02:38.640> students<00:02:39.230> how<00:02:40.580> each<00:02:41.580> Ipsen<00:02:41.940> developed

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
the students how each Ipsen developed

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.729 
the students how each Ipsen developed
the<00:02:42.690> own<00:02:43.260> systems<00:02:43.830> then<00:02:45.110> Romans<00:02:46.110> has<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the own systems then Romans has the

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.839 
the own systems then Romans has the
Roman<00:02:47.730> numerals<00:02:48.060> nan<00:02:48.450> Chinese<00:02:48.930> had<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.319> Chinese
