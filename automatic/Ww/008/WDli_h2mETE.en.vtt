00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.240 
big and I mean I did it over here first
that's<00:02:45.970> why<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.650> ground<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.799> like<00:02:47.889> that<00:02:48.099> but

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
that's why the ground is like that but

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.470 
that's why the ground is like that but
then<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.459> realized<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.849> I<00:02:48.970> had<00:02:49.090> more<00:02:49.239> space

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
then I realized that I had more space

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.970 
then I realized that I had more space
than<00:02:49.629> I<00:02:49.720> thought<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.170> moved<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.530> over<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.769> bit

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
than I thought so I moved it over a bit

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.309 
than I thought so I moved it over a bit
so<00:02:51.609> I<00:02:51.639> have<00:02:51.760> liner<00:02:52.120> -<00:02:52.299> I've<00:02:52.900> lined<00:02:53.139> it<00:02:53.260> with

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
so I have liner - I've lined it with

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.849 
so I have liner - I've lined it with
admit<00:02:53.829> iam<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.639> that<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:54.849> could<00:02:55.500> blow<00:02:56.500> up<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
admit iam so that I could blow up the

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.319 
admit iam so that I could blow up the
center<00:02:57.159> of<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.459> without<00:02:57.639> having<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.150> worry

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
center of it without having to worry

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.330 
center of it without having to worry
about<00:02:59.340> admit<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> am<00:03:00.519> going<00:03:01.060> everywhere<00:03:01.680> or<00:03:02.680> not

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
about admit I am going everywhere or not

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.050 
about admit I am going everywhere or not
at<00:03:03.459> me<00:03:03.609> I'm<00:03:03.760> worried<00:03:04.569> about<00:03:04.629> my<00:03:05.139> blocks<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.950> top

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
at me I'm worried about my blocks on top

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.530 
at me I'm worried about my blocks on top

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.800 
to the very bottom of the mat which
takes<00:03:27.699> a<00:03:27.849> hell<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.269> long<00:03:28.419> time<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:31.150> into

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
TNT in the middle the TNT won't blow up

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.420 
TNT in the middle the TNT won't blow up
the<00:03:46.750> sides<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.500> I'll<00:03:47.620> have<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.829> perfect<00:03:48.280> hole

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the sides and I'll have a perfect hole

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.500

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
okay so it's just getting light out and

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.670 
okay so it's just getting light out and
I<00:03:54.220> finally<00:03:54.639> finished<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.419> huge<00:03:55.750> obsidian

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
I finally finished the huge obsidian

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.819 
I finally finished the huge obsidian
ring<00:03:57.489> wall<00:03:58.090> thingy<00:03:58.599> on<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.319> outside<00:03:59.680> of<00:03:59.769> my

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
ring wall thingy on the outside of my

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.890 
ring wall thingy on the outside of my
circle<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:01.150> feel<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.449> for<00:04:01.629> those<00:04:01.720> two

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
circle and I feel that for those two

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.089 
circle and I feel that for those two
cows<00:04:02.109> they're<00:04:02.560> probably<00:04:02.739> going<00:04:02.919> to<00:04:03.010> get

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
cows they're probably going to get

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.580 
cows they're probably going to get

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
one of those right now and it's probably

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.659

really<00:05:47.690> dark<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:48.260> video<00:05:48.500> so<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.770> figured<00:05:49.099> I

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
really dark in the video so I figured I

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.480 
really dark in the video so I figured I
would<00:05:49.190> actually<00:05:49.430> just<00:05:50.020> show<00:05:51.020> you<00:05:51.080> in<00:05:51.650> the

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490

would actually just show you in the
daylight<00:05:52.880> it<00:05:53.690> just<00:05:53.900> goes<00:05:54.080> all<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.320> way<00:05:54.770> down

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
daylight it just goes all the way down

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.800 
daylight it just goes all the way down
and<00:05:55.930> ends<00:05:59.470> like<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.919> I<00:06:01.340> put<00:06:01.810> smooth

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810
