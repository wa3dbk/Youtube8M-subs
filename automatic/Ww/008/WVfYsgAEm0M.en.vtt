00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 Apple returns today I introduce you to that 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.389
 brand new games cruz ago 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.380
 that's from the makers of angry birds 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.849
 rubio and is based on the animated film 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.599
 by dreamworks you soon to theaters 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.570
 will come 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.270
 The game is completely free there 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.949
 However, in app purchases and the story 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.189
 is very briefly explained it is about one 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.960
 stone age family in the modern 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 Age slips through the development 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.380
 the idea and now just have a look 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.380
 let's see how the whole thing looks like 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.970
 from where 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 apa 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
 As a general rule 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.169
 so and that should be synonymous first 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.699

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.259
 even out to see it for you 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.080
 I really like the graphics 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.969
 very nice and kept very funny and 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.069
 I think for all like building games 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.330
 might like that here quite 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.699
 be worth a look 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.719
 That's it for today, too 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.580
