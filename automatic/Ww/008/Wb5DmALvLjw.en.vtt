one of the paper ties that Hasbro's was
using<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:20.910> their<00:02:21.690> transformer<00:02:22.350> figures<00:02:22.680> now<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
using on their transformer figures now I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.650 
using on their transformer figures now I
just<00:02:23.520> happened<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.360> laying<00:02:24.570> around

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
just happened to have one laying around

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.660 
just happened to have one laying around
and<00:02:25.140> tied<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.620> around<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.010> loop<00:02:26.310> at<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.550> end

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and tied it around the loop at the end

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.320 
and tied it around the loop at the end
of<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:30.350> kind<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.410> Arrowhead<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.850> thought

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
of the kind of Arrowhead here I thought

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.700 
of the kind of Arrowhead here I thought
it'd<00:02:33.450> look<00:02:33.480> kind<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.780> nice<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.500> really

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
it'd look kind of nice and I really

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.830 
it'd look kind of nice and I really
didn't<00:02:34.950> feel<00:02:35.040> like<00:02:35.100> untying<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.850> for<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
didn't feel like untying it for the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.720 
didn't feel like untying it for the
review<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.320> then<00:02:37.410> tying<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.740> back<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
review and then tying it back on as you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.720 
review and then tying it back on as you
can<00:02:38.850> see<00:02:38.940> he<00:02:39.030> does<00:02:39.210> hold<00:02:40.160> yes<00:02:41.160> spike<00:02:41.430> rather

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
can see he does hold yes spike rather

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.620 
can see he does hold yes spike rather
nicely<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.350> kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.650> paper

to<00:05:00.700> be<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.820> bit<00:05:01.030> better<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:05.020> as<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:05.980> say<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.430> the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
to be a bit better and as I say that the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.730 
to be a bit better and as I say that the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
figure falls apart in my hand this does

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.560 
figure falls apart in my hand this does
pop<00:05:09.010> right<00:05:09.190> back<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:09.580> not<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.540> big<00:05:10.810> deal<00:05:12.570> final

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.630 
kombat much past the mortal kombat
trilogy<00:05:22.330> game<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.590> I'm<00:05:23.710> not<00:05:23.860> as<00:05:24.040> familiar<00:05:24.310> with

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
trilogy game so I'm not as familiar with

trilogy game so I'm not as familiar with
the<00:05:24.970> character<00:05:25.600> aesthetic<00:05:25.990> from<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.230> later

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
the character aesthetic from the later

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.710 
the character aesthetic from the later
games<00:05:26.710> but<00:05:27.640> it<00:05:27.760> does<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:27.910> nice<00:05:28.150> take<00:05:28.450> on<00:05:28.630> a

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
games but it does a nice take on a

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.320 
games but it does a nice take on a
classic<00:05:29.460> character<00:05:30.460> from<00:05:30.610> The<00:05:30.730> Mortal<00:05:30.880> Kombat

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
classic character from The Mortal Kombat

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.080

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
universe the molded detail is a huge

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.990 
universe the molded detail is a huge
plus<00:05:34.420> I<00:05:34.870> like<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.680> idea<00:05:35.980> of<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.670> ninjas

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
plus I like the idea of the ninjas

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.700 
plus I like the idea of the ninjas
having<00:05:37.300> more<00:05:37.450> of<00:05:37.570> a<00:05:37.630> personality<00:05:38.290> rather<00:05:38.440> than

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
having more of a personality rather than

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.770 
having more of a personality rather than
just<00:05:38.920> being<00:05:39.160> simple<00:05:39.670> recolors<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:40.600> same

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780
