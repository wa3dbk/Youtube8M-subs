00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.580
 to the channel I am andra csu and the day of 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.580
 today as I had promised before 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.800
 brought a video about a pair of a2 that 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.010
 they are very interesting especially if it is 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.170
 transmitted in all this of the battles 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.540
 of pets or the movies 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.190
 the addons can present we are going to 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.190
 put them now they are 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.880
 here is battle pokemon more if they go 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.130
 shrinking what I'm going and walking man 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.040
 let's put it nerve click 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.800
 so let's go in and to 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.750
 show them more or less what it is about 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.120
 these addons and what is their function inside 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.860
 of the game well we're inside the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.860
 game so let's look for a variety 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.860
 I'm going to give you a moment to be 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.799
 change your pants and realize 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.790
 that this is really happening 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.950
 effectively this pair of a2 what 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.200
 they do is convert us the whole interface 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 of the pet battle in what you are seeing 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.869
 in a real pokemon battle we have 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.720
 everything what we can see in a 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.610
 pokÃ©mon game we have fight the bag at 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.490
 change pokemon and the running of the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.000
 battle and we can even see nothing the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.550
 rarity of the pet 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.450
 ninth and simple because ninth are the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.790
 cloud round lake attacks of my cute 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.909
 synder remove and I bought in thinking by 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.119
 take this to Carlos Bum 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.740
 he dropped her arm and pulled out a deer so 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.899
 tranquilito and stop to go around but not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.819
 will be able to and you feel that it is going to 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.350
 finish at this time with your short and 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:59.119
 miserable political existence 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.610
 and ready've definitely won everything 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.729
 an orgasm like I said, you 're not always 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.229
 to 2 or are pokemon and pet battle mod 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.270
 but they saw it at the beginning of the video 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.280
 definitely an orgasm for the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.750
 people who have played pokemon and now 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.030
 plays a group of artists involved in 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.950
 all these aspects in short people already 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.870
