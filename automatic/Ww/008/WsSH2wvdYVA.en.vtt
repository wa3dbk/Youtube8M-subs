 ae 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.140
 You can do workshops nowadays. 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.000
 to cheer for no actors 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.230
 everyone you want gets you from 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.419
 open arms 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.149
 this is what is tried to go through these 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.300
 people who are not going to use these 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.579
 techniques and yes but in practice sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.230
 because the group returns to performance in the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.879
 work in search of high performance 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.960
 there comes a time when you're already a good actor 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.519
 there comes a time that you do not have to do more 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.769
 the workshop has parachute jumping 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.470
 Yes, it's going to dig inside of you. 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.879
 who will broaden their experience has a 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.610
 It's time we get well. 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.180
 The delay has to go further then we 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.699
 with much less the car is good to have a 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.260
 son is good, it 's good to live things that you 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.960
 confronts other comrades 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.840
 his sensitivity of fear of overcoming a 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.960
 nephew I created a formula that is the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.740
 high n equal to p 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.000
 equal to love app high to nth 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.380
 power equal high performance 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 if you have a problem and give and take 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.030
 love here is damaged in love here 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.590
 you will never get into your power 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 which is never going to get high 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.730
 because the single data can 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.650
 train and go beyond the love that goes 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.870
 contact the property with 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.150
 freedom with forgiveness welcome to 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.640
 compassion for the delivery make a 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.530
 the opposite question for you to reverse the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.330
 question and you as an actor 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.930
 When are you going to make a 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.310
 parachute that works for you 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.110
 bring knowledge to feed 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.180
 inspiration same thing if you think 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.650
 that an administrator was doing a 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.870
 actor work the same as the lazaro 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.180
 Branches do the same workshop with Lazaro 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.549
 Branches made him lose had experience 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.020
 You can go down on a barbecue 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.670
 you jump on the tram of anp is equal to 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.409
 you do something else that acted 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 because it is not in your profession that you will 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.009
 make you experienced an experience 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.260
 enriching process in which you 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.360
 confront yourself and you lazaro 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.250
 branches will seek with high performance in the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.200
 Work, you go little further. 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.209
 there it goes a little beyond his function 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.140
 is to bring had the privilege of 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.930
 experience and through a 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.700
 actor experience in the world my 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.129
 work is exactly the same dish 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.799
 thing the same thing same thing 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:34.080
 a group of 50 people in the collective 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:37.350
 which artist leaves in two 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.760
 one every five years is going 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.790
 that crazy man can not be happy 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.650
 to perform breathe sleep 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.260
 if not in contact with that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.170
 deep concern that connects you to 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.730
 all humanity against the ancestors 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.440
 with your future and that crazy alice 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.240
 it was not that expression channel 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.400
 that crazy man is not there, this guy is tall 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.350
 performance I have no elements there that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.020
 you are not taught at most you 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.200
 produce a right crop worker 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.330
 It's just fair that the state just pays 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.950
 which has 16 thousand culture professionals 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.480
 working doing a theater at a minimum 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.280
 a song of at least 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.050
 associated with the development of 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.080
 of education 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.010
 show conquers this the conquest of 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.820
 citizenship 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.170
 but there is no art discussion of 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.850
 other questions 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.790
 that's why it started in the theater of 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.020
 The street was I think I spent many a 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.240
 years denying spoke with much ownership 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.450
 that I'm talking about because I went through 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.030
 least 15 or 25 years of career I 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.340
 I spent at least leaked 15 years not me 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.360
 telling artist telling me worker 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.950
 culture 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.900
 I did not like to say that it was that 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.560
 my art friends no longer lived in 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.390
 art 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.220
 I could never make up for a 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.100
 show and do not start a van 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.600
 So this makes a deal, I thought. 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.730
 This is one where you can take a wave with the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.239
 friends so talk 'you're not an artist 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.630
 I'm a worker, I'd like to take this 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.340
 hour but I got this place and 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.900
 there comes a time in life that if you 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.790
 keep the tone I'm listening to 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.410
 conservative because you want to keep 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.630
 what you have achieved so far has to 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.650
 to have his own foot this year because people 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.640
 You're an artist. 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.640
 this is a gift is indomitable
