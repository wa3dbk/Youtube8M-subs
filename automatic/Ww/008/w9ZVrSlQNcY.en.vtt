map<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.049> mess<00:01:37.500> around<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
map and just mess around on this this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
map and just mess around on this this
land<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.360> whatever<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.900> there's<00:01:40.079> no

basically I'm going to be creating a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.639 
basically I'm going to be creating a
video<00:01:46.799> after<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.399> where<00:01:48.380> it'll<00:01:49.380> include

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.620 
within the trees and you'll be fine but
in<00:03:47.500> my<00:03:47.680> next<00:03:48.040> adventure<00:03:48.610> map<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.420> can

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
in my next adventure map you can

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.420 
in my next adventure map you can
actually<00:03:49.750> leave<00:03:50.170> your<00:03:50.500> objective<00:03:51.130> will<00:03:51.220> be<00:03:51.280> to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
actually leave your objective will be to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.530 
actually leave your objective will be to
leave<00:03:51.940> Herschel's<00:03:52.840> land<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:54.120> try<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.180> find

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
leave Herschel's land and try to find

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.290 
leave Herschel's land and try to find
you<00:03:56.080> know<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.230> next<00:03:56.500> place<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.860> go<00:03:57.250> set<00:03:58.209> up

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
you know the next place to go set up

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.210 
you know the next place to go set up
camp<00:03:58.540> somewhere<00:03:58.870> else<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.170> stuff<00:03:59.380> but<00:03:59.950> yeah

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
camp somewhere else and stuff but yeah

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.990 
camp somewhere else and stuff but yeah
so<00:04:00.430> for<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.730> map<00:04:01.140> then<00:04:02.140> i've<00:04:02.230> got<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
so for this map then i've got the the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.380 
so for this map then i've got the the
barn

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
barn

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.000 
barn
Herschel's<00:04:04.930> barn<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.680> where<00:04:05.830> he

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
Herschel's barn and this is where he

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.990 
Herschel's barn and this is where he
kept<00:04:06.280> all<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:07.440> zombies<00:04:08.440> from<00:04:08.800> his<00:04:09.040> family<00:04:09.519> and

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
kept all the zombies from his family and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.820 
kept all the zombies from his family and
he<00:04:10.420> kept<00:04:10.660> them<00:04:10.780> on<00:04:10.930> here<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.560> i'm<00:04:11.620> not<00:04:11.650> gonna

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
he kept them on here and i'm not gonna

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.960 
he kept them on here and i'm not gonna
go<00:04:12.010> into<00:04:12.130> too<00:04:12.310> much<00:04:12.340> detail<00:04:12.580> with<00:04:12.850> this

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
go into too much detail with this

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.070 
go into too much detail with this
because<00:04:13.239> you'll<00:04:13.360> be<00:04:13.420> able<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.690> check<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:13.900> out

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
because you'll be able to check it out

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.390 
because you'll be able to check it out
yourself<00:04:14.680> this<00:04:15.550> is<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:16.560> Herschel's<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:18.160> barn

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
yourself this is a Herschel's the barn

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.610 
yourself this is a Herschel's the barn
and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.299> don't<00:04:19.720> really<00:04:19.900> remember<00:04:20.080> where

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
and then I don't really remember where

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.110 
and then I don't really remember where
he<00:04:20.769> planted<00:04:21.039> his<00:04:21.250> crops<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.820> went<00:04:22.000> ahead

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
he planted his crops but I went ahead

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.300 
he planted his crops but I went ahead
and<00:04:22.240> did<00:04:22.720> did<00:04:23.260> some<00:04:23.410> crops<00:04:23.710> over<00:04:23.890> here<00:04:24.130> cuz

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and did did some crops over here cuz

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.950 
and did did some crops over here cuz
obviously<00:04:24.430> it's<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.060> farm<00:04:25.360> he<00:04:25.539> has<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.870> have

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
obviously it's a farm he has to have

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.460 
obviously it's a farm he has to have
crops

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
crops

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.140 
crops
growing<00:04:26.740> on<00:04:26.830> his<00:04:26.950> land<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.610> here's<00:04:27.910> where<00:04:28.090> I

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
growing on his land so here's where I

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.020 
growing on his land so here's where I
just<00:04:28.630> assumed<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.740> was<00:04:29.770> at<00:04:30.100> even<00:04:30.820> though<00:04:30.910> I'm

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
just assumed it was at even though I'm

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.430 
just assumed it was at even though I'm
pretty<00:04:31.270> sure<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.540> wasn't<00:04:31.810> right<00:04:31.990> next<00:04:32.290> to<00:04:32.350> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
pretty sure it wasn't right next to the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.530 
pretty sure it wasn't right next to the
bar<00:04:32.620> but<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:32.950> is<00:04:33.100> for<00:04:33.310> this<00:04:33.400> adventure<00:04:33.940> map<00:04:34.120> and

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
bar but it is for this adventure map and

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.210 
bar but it is for this adventure map and
then<00:04:35.280> over<00:04:36.280> here<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:36.670> have<00:04:36.910> Dale's<00:04:37.480> RV<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:38.470> I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
then over here we have Dale's RV and I

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.980 
then over here we have Dale's RV and I
made<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.910> can<00:04:40.120> actually<00:04:40.540> go

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
made it so that you can actually go

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.890 
made it so that you can actually go
inside<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.470> RV<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:43.150> basically<00:04:43.780> a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
inside the RV and it's basically a

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.780 
inside the RV and it's basically a
life-sized<00:04:44.320> RV<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:44.830> actually<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.670> can

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
life-sized RV it actually you can

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.550 
life-sized RV it actually you can
actually<00:04:45.880> go<00:04:46.090> inside<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.750> it's<00:04:46.930> exactly<00:04:47.290> how

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
actually go inside and it's exactly how

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.400 
actually go inside and it's exactly how
it<00:04:47.680> was<00:04:47.830> from<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:49.240> series<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.810> then<00:04:50.200> I<00:04:50.260> just

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
it was from the series and then I just

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.530 
it was from the series and then I just
put<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.620> little<00:04:50.740> little<00:04:51.610> campground<00:04:52.180> out<00:04:52.360> here

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
put a little little campground out here

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.630 
put a little little campground out here
because<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.990> where<00:04:53.140> everybody<00:04:53.410> stayed<00:04:53.650> and

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
because is where everybody stayed and

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.770 
because is where everybody stayed and
then<00:04:54.760> yeah<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.150> mean<00:04:55.330> that's<00:04:55.480> pretty<00:04:55.660> much

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
then yeah so I mean that's pretty much

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.170 
then yeah so I mean that's pretty much
it<00:04:56.080> and<00:04:56.410> there's<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.680> tree<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.370> oh<00:04:57.580> I'm

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
it and there's the tree that the oh I'm

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.810 
it and there's the tree that the oh I'm
lagging<00:04:58.360> again<00:04:58.920> sorry<00:04:59.920> about<00:05:00.010> that

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
lagging again sorry about that

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.550 
lagging again sorry about that
and<00:05:01.120> then<00:05:01.270> yeah<00:05:01.420> so<00:05:01.450> here's<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.930> tree<00:05:02.230> that

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
and then yeah so here's the tree that

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.560 
and then yeah so here's the tree that
was<00:05:02.710> right<00:05:03.160> next<00:05:03.190> to<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.670> RV<00:05:03.820> cuz<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.300> remember

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
was right next to the RV cuz I remember

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.420 
was right next to the RV cuz I remember
there<00:05:04.690> was<00:05:04.750> a<00:05:04.810> huge<00:05:05.080> tree<00:05:05.410> right<00:05:06.010> next<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.310> the

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
there was a huge tree right next to the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.430 
there was a huge tree right next to the
RV<00:05:06.580> nor<00:05:07.240> some<00:05:07.420> random<00:05:07.810> other<00:05:07.960> trees<00:05:08.230> along

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
RV nor some random other trees along

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.020 
RV nor some random other trees along
along<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.800> put<00:05:08.980> it<00:05:09.370> was<00:05:09.490> like<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.640> tree<00:05:09.820> over

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
along and I put it was like a tree over

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.940 
along and I put it was like a tree over
there<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.420> tree<00:05:10.870> behind<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.260> barb<00:05:11.440> not<00:05:11.710> not

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
there and tree behind the barb not not

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.190 
there and tree behind the barb not not
really<00:05:12.040> much<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.610> was<00:05:12.700> mostly<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.300> very<00:05:13.780> flat

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
really much it was mostly a very flat

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.080 
really much it was mostly a very flat
land<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.860> that's<00:05:14.980> what<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.700> TV<00:05:15.970> show

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
land and that's what in the TV show

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.090 
land and that's what in the TV show
that's<00:05:16.270> what<00:05:16.420> made<00:05:16.630> them<00:05:16.840> feel<00:05:17.020> so

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
that's what made them feel so

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.680 
that's what made them feel so
comfortable<00:05:18.100> because<00:05:18.280> I<00:05:18.490> could<00:05:18.640> see<00:05:18.820> a<00:05:19.150> zombie

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
comfortable because I could see a zombie

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.270 
comfortable because I could see a zombie
coming<00:05:20.050> from<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.470> mile<00:05:20.650> away<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:20.980> they've

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
coming from a mile away so they've

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.360 
coming from a mile away so they've

that I will be creating but yeah this is
this<00:05:37.870> is<00:05:37.930> basically<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.680> all<00:05:39.460> there<00:05:39.640> was<00:05:39.790> is

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
this is basically it all there was is

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.760 
this is basically it all there was is
the<00:05:40.120> farm<00:05:40.390> the<00:05:40.540> house<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:40.990> RV<00:05:41.320> that<00:05:41.590> were

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
the farm the house and the RV that were

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.860 
the farm the house and the RV that were
big<00:05:42.280> to<00:05:42.760> build<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.150> then<00:05:43.240> basically<00:05:43.630> all<00:05:43.720> the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
big to build and then basically all the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.810 
big to build and then basically all the
fences<00:05:44.200> and<00:05:44.350> I<00:05:44.770> really<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.100> surrounded<00:05:45.729> the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
fences and I really I surrounded the

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.750 
fences and I really I surrounded the
whole<00:05:46.030> place<00:05:46.330> with<00:05:46.660> trees<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:47.460> I'm<00:05:48.460> probably

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
whole place with trees and I'm probably

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.540 
whole place with trees and I'm probably
gonna<00:05:49.229> extend<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.320> trees<00:05:50.560> even<00:05:50.890> farther<00:05:51.130> just

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
gonna extend the trees even farther just

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.490 
gonna extend the trees even farther just
so<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:51.790> can<00:05:51.970> if<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:52.360> wanted<00:05:52.720> to<00:05:52.960> I<00:05:53.229> don't<00:05:53.320> know

why you would but if you wanted to you
could<00:05:55.270> go<00:05:55.419> out<00:05:55.540> into<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.810> trees<00:05:56.050> like<00:05:56.290> they

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
could go out into the trees like they

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.469 
could go out into the trees like they
did<00:05:56.680> in<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:56.950> show<00:05:57.130> cuz<00:05:57.760> right<00:05:57.880> now<00:05:57.940> it<00:05:58.210> doesn't

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
did in the show cuz right now it doesn't

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.330 
did in the show cuz right now it doesn't
the<00:05:58.690> trees<00:05:58.960> don't<00:05:59.110> actually<00:05:59.440> go<00:05:59.590> for<00:05:59.890> that<00:06:00.100> far

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
the trees don't actually go for that far

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.880 
the trees don't actually go for that far
back<00:06:00.520> it's<00:06:00.790> just<00:06:00.880> a<00:06:01.750> very<00:06:02.320> thin<00:06:02.620> layer<00:06:02.830> of

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
back it's just a very thin layer of

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.380 
back it's just a very thin layer of
trees<00:06:03.310> surrounding<00:06:03.729> the<00:06:03.790> whole<00:06:03.910> place<00:06:04.120> and

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
trees surrounding the whole place and

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.050 
trees surrounding the whole place and
then<00:06:04.870> over<00:06:05.200> here<00:06:05.290> this<00:06:05.890> will<00:06:06.280> be<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.550> exit

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
then over here this will be the exit

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.469 
then over here this will be the exit
where<00:06:07.570> you<00:06:07.720> can<00:06:07.900> follow<00:06:08.110> this<00:06:08.350> path<00:06:08.620> and<00:06:09.479> in

I<00:07:06.770> think<00:07:06.950> if<00:07:07.130> you<00:07:07.280> have<00:07:07.370> a<00:07:07.400> huge<00:07:07.670> group<00:07:07.850> it'd<00:07:08.030> be

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
I think if you have a huge group it'd be

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.910 
I think if you have a huge group it'd be
a<00:07:08.210> lot<00:07:08.480> more<00:07:08.540> fun<00:07:08.900> because<00:07:09.140> it<00:07:09.410> actually<00:07:09.740> be

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
a lot more fun because it actually be

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.030 
a lot more fun because it actually be
more<00:07:10.520> like<00:07:10.700> the<00:07:11.090> series<00:07:11.990> the<00:07:12.350> TV<00:07:12.620> show<00:07:12.800> where

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
more like the series the TV show where

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.890 
more like the series the TV show where
you<00:07:13.160> actually<00:07:13.400> have<00:07:13.760> to<00:07:13.790> survive<00:07:14.180> I<00:07:14.480> think

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
you actually have to survive I think

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.570 
you actually have to survive I think
that's<00:07:15.200> what<00:07:15.350> everybody<00:07:15.650> loves<00:07:16.010> to<00:07:16.220> do<00:07:16.340> so

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
that's what everybody loves to do so

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.180 
that's what everybody loves to do so
much<00:07:16.790> of<00:07:17.090> they<00:07:17.540> love<00:07:17.810> to<00:07:18.230> just<00:07:18.590> survive<00:07:19.160> and

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
much of they love to just survive and

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.860 
much of they love to just survive and
play<00:07:19.700> the<00:07:19.850> game<00:07:20.000> rather<00:07:20.330> than<00:07:20.510> just<00:07:20.720> adventure

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
play the game rather than just adventure

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.050 
play the game rather than just adventure
and<00:07:21.440> just<00:07:22.040> look<00:07:22.220> at<00:07:22.340> stuff<00:07:22.550> that's<00:07:22.730> been<00:07:22.850> built

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
and just look at stuff that's been built
