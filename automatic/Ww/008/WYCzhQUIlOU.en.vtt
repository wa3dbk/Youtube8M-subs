self-esteem we were trying to exercise a
lot<00:02:59.790> with<00:03:00.209> those<00:03:00.420> votes<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
lot with those votes I think the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.210 
lot with those votes I think the
interaction<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.110> exercise<00:03:04.110> looking<00:03:05.100> at

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
interaction on the exercise looking at

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.130 
interaction on the exercise looking at
the<00:03:05.310> bill<00:03:05.459> for<00:03:05.610> colors<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.180> think<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.750> really

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the bill for colors I think it's really

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.259 
the bill for colors I think it's really
important<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.100> should<00:03:08.280> value<00:03:08.459> every

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
important that we should value every

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.150 
important that we should value every
individual<00:03:09.810> child<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.380> what<00:03:10.530> they<00:03:10.739> can<00:03:10.800> do

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
individual child for what they can do

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.830 
individual child for what they can do
and<00:03:11.400> that's<00:03:11.610> what<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.000> look<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.690> do

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
and that's what we look what I can do

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.540 
and that's what we look what I can do
second<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.160> real<00:03:14.310> shame

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
second to that it's a real shame

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.759 
second to that it's a real shame
sometimes<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.269> think<00:03:15.510> when<00:03:15.750> you've<00:03:16.290> tried<00:03:16.500> to

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
sometimes I think when you've tried to

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.350 
sometimes I think when you've tried to
make<00:03:16.920> all<00:03:17.130> children<00:03:17.519> measure<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.150> one

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
make all children measure up to one

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.660 
make all children measure up to one
perfect<00:03:18.959> model<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.470> think<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.220> joins<00:03:20.489> us

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
perfect model I think that joins us

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.820 
perfect model I think that joins us
together<00:03:20.790> miss<00:03:21.180> Roth<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:22.050> risk<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.410> Sally's

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
together miss Roth the risk of Sally's

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.900 
together miss Roth the risk of Sally's
sake<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.660> laughter<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:26.040> best<00:03:26.580> it

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
sake is laughter and it is the best it

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.460 
sake is laughter and it is the best it
makes<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.959> feel<00:03:28.290> better<00:03:28.590> whatever<00:03:30.230> blue<00:03:31.230> bar

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
makes you feel better whatever blue bar

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.130 
makes you feel better whatever blue bar
