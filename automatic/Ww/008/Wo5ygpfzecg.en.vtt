probably<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.710> hmm<00:01:41.369> well<00:01:41.939> doesn't<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.299> look

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
probably like hmm well doesn't this look

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.109 
probably like hmm well doesn't this look
familiar<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.590> actually<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.640> guess<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
familiar this is actually I guess a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.139 
familiar this is actually I guess a
replica<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> ac-130<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.790> mono<00:01:48.000> Y

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
replica of the ac-130 that was in mono Y

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.510 
replica of the ac-130 that was in mono Y
42<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:49.200> only<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.770> bring<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.340> mana

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
42 so not only they bring back the mana

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880 
42 so not only they bring back the mana
wear<00:01:50.729> fur<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.180> Matt<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.290> also<00:01:52.439> brought

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
wear fur to Matt but they also brought

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.440 
wear fur to Matt but they also brought
back<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> kill<00:01:53.490> streak<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.060> game<00:01:54.270> which

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
back a kill streak from that game which

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.209 
back a kill streak from that game which
I<00:01:54.600> thought<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.930> super<00:01:55.079> sick<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.649> don't<00:01:56.159> know

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I thought was super sick I don't know

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
I thought was super sick I don't know
about<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.399> guys<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.299> ac-130<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.079> mano

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
about you guys but the ac-130 a mano

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.649 
about you guys but the ac-130 a mano
where<00:01:58.409> 42<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.040> its<00:01:59.549> godly<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.240> mean<00:02:00.479> especially

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
where 42 is its godly I mean especially

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
where 42 is its godly I mean especially
compared<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> some<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> killstreaks<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
compared to some of the killstreaks that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399 
compared to some of the killstreaks that
they<00:02:02.399> having<00:02:02.790> us<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.780> thing<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.380> just

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
they having us this thing is just

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
they having us this thing is just
amazing<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> lot<00:02:06.960> of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
amazing so as in there's a lot of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
amazing so as in there's a lot of
buildings<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.619> stuff<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.190> only<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.610> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
buildings and stuff you do only get to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.430 
buildings and stuff you do only get to
be<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.060> fried

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
be in it fried

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.290 
be in it fried
leave<00:02:09.590> it's<00:02:09.770> either<00:02:09.979> 30<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.430> 45<00:02:10.820> seconds<00:02:11.180> i'm

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
leave it's either 30 to 45 seconds i'm

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.700 
leave it's either 30 to 45 seconds i'm
pretty<00:02:11.450> sure<00:02:11.600> it's<00:02:11.750> 30<00:02:11.990> i'd<00:02:12.200> probably<00:02:12.590> just

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
pretty sure it's 30 i'd probably just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.800 
pretty sure it's 30 i'd probably just
could<00:02:12.980> look<00:02:13.580> at<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.820> video<00:02:14.090> time<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.630> see

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
could look at the video time and see

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.530 
could look at the video time and see
that<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.080> 30<00:02:15.320> but<00:02:15.590> um<00:02:16.220> really<00:02:16.850> cool<00:02:17.060> addition

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
that it's 30 but um really cool addition

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.270 
that it's 30 but um really cool addition
though<00:02:17.660> either<00:02:17.930> way<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.230> mean<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:18.860> deadly

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
though either way I mean it is so deadly

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.740 
though either way I mean it is so deadly
so<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.580> understand<00:02:19.970> why<00:02:20.030> they<00:02:20.150> only<00:02:20.270> have<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.660> up

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so I understand why they only have it up

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.440 
so I understand why they only have it up
there<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:21.080> 30<00:02:21.260> seconds<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.450> really

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
there for 30 seconds but I really

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.520 
there for 30 seconds but I really
enjoyed<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:23.990> thought<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.320> was<00:02:24.410> really

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
enjoyed that I thought that was really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.170 
enjoyed that I thought that was really
smart<00:02:24.650> instead<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.580> letting<00:02:25.730> us<00:02:26.000> run

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
smart instead of just letting us run

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.170 
smart instead of just letting us run
around<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.750> some<00:02:26.990> crazy<00:02:27.320> ass<00:02:27.820> yeah<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.850> don't

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.850 
around is some crazy ass yeah I don't
know<00:02:29.240> what<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.570> would<00:02:29.690> be<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.990> favela<00:02:30.290> they

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
know what we would be on favela they

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.350 
know what we would be on favela they

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
actually brought back a little bit of a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.000 
actually brought back a little bit of a
throwback<00:02:32.660> kill<00:02:33.170> streak<00:02:33.470> which<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.800> really

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
throwback kill streak which I really

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.040 
throwback kill streak which I really

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
myself i guess i guess if that's a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.610 
myself i guess i guess if that's a
reason<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.210> feel<00:02:44.420> cool<00:02:44.630> about<00:02:44.660> yourself<00:02:44.960> for
