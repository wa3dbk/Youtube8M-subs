00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.430 

what<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.330> learned<00:03:12.570> from<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.870> challenge<00:03:13.290> is

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
what I learned from this challenge is

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.140 
what I learned from this challenge is
that<00:03:13.560> by<00:03:13.920> having<00:03:14.100> budget<00:03:14.490> eyes<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> rear

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
that by having budget eyes on the rear

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420 
that by having budget eyes on the rear
the<00:03:16.080> car<00:03:16.260> does<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.530> go<00:03:16.860> where<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.160> wanted<00:03:17.370> to

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
the car does not go where you wanted to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:26.790 
the car does not go where you wanted to
go<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:17.940> that's<00:03:18.180> been<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> real<00:03:18.750> real<00:03:19.110> experience

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.590 

which<00:03:27.520> read<00:03:27.700> carefully<00:03:27.940> what<00:03:28.300> we're<00:03:28.450> trying

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
which read carefully what we're trying

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.340 
which read carefully what we're trying
to<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:29.050> is<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.620> give<00:03:29.890> people<00:03:29.920> an<00:03:30.910> insight<00:03:31.390> into

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
to do is to give people an insight into

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.220 
to do is to give people an insight into
the<00:03:32.800> effect<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.550> diminishing<00:03:34.180> tread<00:03:34.420> debt<00:03:34.660> not

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the effect of diminishing tread debt not

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.650 
the effect of diminishing tread debt not
only<00:03:35.710> on<00:03:35.800> wit<00:03:36.010> breaking<00:03:36.490> straight<00:03:36.790> line<00:03:37.030> but

only on wit breaking straight line but

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.360 
only on wit breaking straight line but
also<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.380> effect<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.860> dimension

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
also the effect that the dimension

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.880 
also the effect that the dimension

other activities on the tile for example
as<00:03:44.470> we<00:03:44.680> have<00:03:44.830> here<00:03:45.040> with<00:03:45.190> laps<00:03:45.370> left<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.670> play
