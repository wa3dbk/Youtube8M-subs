00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.070 
anyway so I'm sticking with you know I
guess<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.440> Isagenix<00:02:49.220> thing<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:50.599> know<00:02:50.750> or

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
guess this Isagenix thing you know or

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.890 
guess this Isagenix thing you know or
just<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.500> effort<00:02:51.920> or

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
just the effort or

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.309 
just the effort or
maybe<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.980> working<00:02:54.879> out<00:02:55.030> or<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.689> am<00:02:56.019> building

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
maybe the working out or I am building

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.559 
maybe the working out or I am building
muscle<00:02:56.920> because<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.280> can<00:02:57.459> see<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:57.909> my<00:02:57.939> legs<00:02:58.360> I

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
muscle because I can see in my legs I

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.240 
muscle because I can see in my legs I
can<00:02:58.750> see<00:02:59.250> muscle<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.930> maybe<00:03:02.170> having<00:03:03.129> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
can see muscle and so maybe having the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.100 
can see muscle and so maybe having the
muscle<00:03:03.670> burns<00:03:03.909> the<00:03:04.209> fat<00:03:04.420> that's<00:03:04.810> what<00:03:04.989> they

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
muscle burns the fat that's what they

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.289 
muscle burns the fat that's what they
say<00:03:05.379> all<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.890> stuff<00:03:06.129> that<00:03:06.159> I<00:03:06.370> read<00:03:06.640> says<00:03:07.030> when

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
say all the stuff that I read says when

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.660 
say all the stuff that I read says when
you<00:03:07.329> have<00:03:07.599> more<00:03:07.810> muscle<00:03:08.189> even<00:03:09.189> when<00:03:09.370> you're

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
you have more muscle even when you're

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.940 
you have more muscle even when you're
sitting<00:03:10.180> you're<00:03:11.049> burning<00:03:11.560> more<00:03:11.709> calories

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
sitting you're burning more calories

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.369 
sitting you're burning more calories
because<00:03:12.730> muscle<00:03:13.000> burns<00:03:13.390> more<00:03:13.659> calories<00:03:13.720> so

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
because muscle burns more calories so

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.130 
because muscle burns more calories so
whatever<00:03:15.159> i<00:03:15.280> don't<00:03:15.430> care<00:03:15.670> i'm<00:03:16.150> keepin<00:03:16.989> on

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
whatever i don't care i'm keepin on

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.259 
whatever i don't care i'm keepin on
keepin<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.739> keepin<00:03:18.220> on<00:03:18.310> because<00:03:19.060> my<00:03:19.239> birthday

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269
