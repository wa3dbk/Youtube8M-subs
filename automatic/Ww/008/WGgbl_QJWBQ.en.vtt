00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.000
 another brick in the wall the pennata 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:18.350
 alternate must be thought of in 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 sixteenth movement and sixteenth 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.210
 beat and raise no and you can for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 make this song at the ring pump for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.150
 three here 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:43.320
 first between 10 and 20 seconds 3 second 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:45.510
 moody's and pine protected second seconds 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.600
 sabena you can concentrate on this 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.890
 so now read why in the first one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.340
 small group of sixteenths made with 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 we have to use practically a lesser king 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.739
 not in bahrain with bad fifth fret 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.189
 it is better on the second string at the sixth 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.710
 ring-shaped cord holder at the seventh of a 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 third goal but Serbs but you have to make in 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.990
 this way first group of 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:23.100
 sixteenth round and on the empty movement 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:29.700
 face up down the second that pact of 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 xvi instead up with a single block of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.090
 life on johnson the third group of gods 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.190
 sixteenths and played and crushes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 agree to say minor facts 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.110
 the complete picture of sixteenths is 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.810
 then stopped with finnair raises them 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.900
 slightly of life as well as the ropes 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.960
 done 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:57.820
 then there is another group of sixteenths 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.350
 and then immediately there is no more 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:12.220
 empty movement then stopped everything 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:19.630
 becomes a repetition of a very high movement 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:26.350
 jesus compact done right and the sound 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:41.970
 soon and this need to repeat it for 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:43.800
 the whole sum then goes to a sol 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:03:05.070
 so to found that is, only one hub is 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:03:09.180
 normal so many years ago in this 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:12.170
 In case he is right you should not suffer 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.170
 doing 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:23.750
 long time ballad was paid throat 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.750
 face of success 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.680
 port 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:42.140
 then put down the renon and vi 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.390
 positioned to do that tenth riff 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.269
 button making a barreto 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.299
 I know so much about the first three things 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.870
 no contact with the hand by moving 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:57.319
 back to the ballet mount button first 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:02.420
 second string and third string ninth doing 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:10.879
 still only after you go back to the bar 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:11.810
 good tenth that you do those of age and 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:18.049
 eto'o 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:21.109
 no one willing to the right place 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.900
 let's finish the refrain's drift is that 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:34.220
 which also made third party famous 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:37.970
 do suzuki position 8 and no but no ninth 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:43.880
 place in the door or put them in one 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.960
 position say seventh and then come back 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.539
 back to the fifth always so all this 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.470
 are therefore and starts from the tenth key e 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:58.120
 bars in the health rows I come back 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.710
 back what position or less 8 and 9 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:06.340
 then I go back to 10 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.740
 I go back to fight the ninth 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:15.389
 position comes to seven bills 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:27.509
 and so if it still does fa in fa 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:32.000
 the finer we did not finish 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.000
 snom did not understand
