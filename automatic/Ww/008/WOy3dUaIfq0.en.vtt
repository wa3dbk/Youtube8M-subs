00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
to fit in this plane a little bit better

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.229 
to fit in this plane a little bit better
than<00:03:35.069> Mickey<00:03:35.340> there<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.730> little<00:03:35.940> cloud

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
than Mickey there is that little cloud

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.890 
than Mickey there is that little cloud
arm<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.470> plane<00:03:37.769> does<00:03:38.209> 360s<00:03:39.209> around<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
arm and the plane does 360s around the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.250 
arm and the plane does 360s around the
entirety<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.400> clubhouse<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:43.109> can

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
entirety of the clubhouse and you can

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.289 
entirety of the clubhouse and you can
almost<00:03:43.560> get<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.700> slide<00:03:45.000> down

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
almost get it to kind of slide down

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.460 
almost get it to kind of slide down
because<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.600> goes<00:03:45.720> up<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.019> down<00:03:46.109> on<00:03:46.260> an<00:03:46.350> angle

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
because it goes up and down on an angle

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.039 
because it goes up and down on an angle
it's<00:03:47.370> very<00:03:47.489> similar<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.239> Tomorrowland
