I've got a lot of great attackin and I

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.339 
I've got a lot of great attackin and I
think<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:26.090> felt<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.750> Friday

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
think we felt a little bit like Friday

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.540 
think we felt a little bit like Friday
night<00:00:28.650> when<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.980> were<00:00:29.039> knocking<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> knocking

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
night when we were knocking and knocking

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370 
night when we were knocking and knocking
but<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> gold<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.570> wasn't<00:00:30.810> coming<00:00:31.320> until

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
but the gold just wasn't coming until

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.520 
but the gold just wasn't coming until
your<00:00:32.000> header<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.300> before<00:00:33.540> half-time<00:00:33.780> talk

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
your header just before half-time talk

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.330 
your header just before half-time talk
us<00:00:34.680> through<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.950> one

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
us through that one

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090 
us through that one
yeah<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.230> 220<00:00:37.950> many

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
yeah I think there was about 220 many

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.709 
yeah I think there was about 220 many
periods<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:39.030> half<00:00:39.270> where<00:00:39.540> we

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
periods in the first half where we

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.260 
periods in the first half where we
really<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:40.710> wanted<00:00:40.950> him<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> bouquet<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
really really wanted him and bouquet to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.090 
really really wanted him and bouquet to
them<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.960> lot<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.170> chances<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:43.739> keep<00:00:43.920> heard

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
them a lot of chances they keep heard

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.430 
them a lot of chances they keep heard
made<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.430> great<00:00:44.610> saves<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:46.110> knew<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
made some great saves and we knew if you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.110 
made some great saves and we knew if you
think<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.829> goal<00:00:46.980> line<00:00:47.190> cuz<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.879> put<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
think that the goal line cuz we we put a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450 
think that the goal line cuz we we put a
lot<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.329> energy<00:00:48.420> into<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.219> then<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.370> would

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
lot of energy into that then it would

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.279 
lot of energy into that then it would
have<00:00:50.579> been<00:00:50.700> disappointing<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.420> thankfully

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
have been disappointing but thankfully

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.799 
have been disappointing but thankfully
we<00:00:52.320> managed<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> call<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.760> come<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we managed to get the call and come in a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
we managed to get the call and come in a
half<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> lead<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.550> we

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
half time and with that lead and we

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.459 
half time and with that lead and we
started<00:00:57.090> setting<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.899> sloppy<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.379> be

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
started setting out really sloppy to be

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.889 
started setting out really sloppy to be
honest<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.910> we've<00:01:00.510> got<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.870> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
honest then and then we've got a bit of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
honest then and then we've got a bit of
a<00:01:01.020> foothold<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> game<00:01:01.890> again<00:01:02.190> towards<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a foothold in the game again towards the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
a foothold in the game again towards the
end<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.539> thankfully<00:01:04.019> Stevie<00:01:04.739> caught

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
end of it and thankfully Stevie caught

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760 
end of it and thankfully Stevie caught
the<00:01:05.010> ball<00:01:05.240> towards<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> end<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.080> think<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the ball towards the end so I think it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.600 
the ball towards the end so I think it
was<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> good<00:01:08.700> entertain<00:01:09.150> imagine<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:11.490> had

well cooked through matter where it is

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.010 
well cooked through matter where it is
it<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.399> anywhere<00:01:53.399> no<00:01:53.579> else<00:01:53.759> that's<00:01:54.509> you
