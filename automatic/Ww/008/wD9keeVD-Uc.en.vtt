00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.340 

the<00:00:03.969> whole<00:00:04.149> philosophy<00:00:04.420> for<00:00:04.930> the<00:00:04.960> movie<00:00:05.230> was

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
the whole philosophy for the movie was

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.200 
the whole philosophy for the movie was
to<00:00:05.470> try<00:00:05.650> to<00:00:05.710> shoot<00:00:05.950> everything<00:00:06.190> in<00:00:06.430> camera<00:00:06.910> so

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
to try to shoot everything in camera so

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.119 
to try to shoot everything in camera so
we<00:00:07.569> decided<00:00:08.020> that<00:00:08.170> made<00:00:08.440> sense<00:00:08.709> to<00:00:08.860> build<00:00:09.070> a

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
we decided that made sense to build a

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.920 
we decided that made sense to build a
full-scale<00:00:09.670> version<00:00:09.940> of<00:00:10.449> the<00:00:10.510> bubble<00:00:10.750> ship

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
full-scale version of the bubble ship

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.689 
full-scale version of the bubble ship
once<00:00:11.320> you<00:00:11.410> get<00:00:11.559> the<00:00:11.650> fuselage<00:00:12.100> on<00:00:12.340> you<00:00:12.459> can<00:00:12.580> go

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:12.699 
once you get the fuselage on you can go

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.430 
once you get the fuselage on you can go
anywhere<00:00:13.000> but<00:00:13.240> the<00:00:13.449> tail<00:00:13.600> boom<00:00:13.779> um<00:00:13.959> or<00:00:14.199> you<00:00:14.289> can

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
anywhere but the tail boom um or you can

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.370 
anywhere but the tail boom um or you can
do<00:00:14.529> the<00:00:15.420> we're<00:00:16.420> finally<00:00:16.810> getting<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.140> bubble

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
do the we're finally getting the bubble

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.720 
do the we're finally getting the bubble
sugar<00:00:17.560> stuff<00:00:17.800> oh<00:00:17.980> this<00:00:18.160> is<00:00:18.280> the<00:00:18.370> first<00:00:18.520> time

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
sugar stuff oh this is the first time

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.240 
sugar stuff oh this is the first time
it's<00:00:18.850> ever<00:00:18.970> been<00:00:19.270> pieced<00:00:19.570> together<00:00:19.720> ever

couple different incarnations of the
bubble<00:01:39.070> ship<00:01:39.190> we<00:01:39.460> have<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.670> complete<00:01:39.970> bubble

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
bubble ship we have the complete bubble

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.670 
bubble ship we have the complete bubble
ship<00:01:40.480> and<00:01:40.720> we<00:01:40.840> have<00:01:40.990> basically<00:01:41.320> just<00:01:41.560> a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
ship and we have basically just a

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.160 
ship and we have basically just a
cockpit<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.400> full<00:01:42.910> motion-based<00:01:43.390> gimbal<00:01:43.900> so

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
cockpit on a full motion-based gimbal so

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.300 
cockpit on a full motion-based gimbal so
we'll<00:01:44.380> get<00:01:44.470> all<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.740> flying<00:01:44.980> footers<00:01:45.280> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
we'll get all the flying footers and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.860 
we'll get all the flying footers and
then<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.790> visual<00:01:46.030> effects<00:01:46.270> we<00:01:46.390> will<00:01:46.510> put<00:01:46.690> the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
then in visual effects we will put the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.540 
then in visual effects we will put the
rest<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.470> ship<00:01:47.650> on<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> backside<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.340> that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
rest of the ship on the backside of that

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.920

tom<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.620> the<00:01:55.040> pilot<00:01:55.460> himself<00:01:55.940> so<00:01:56.600> he's<00:01:56.780> very

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
tom is the pilot himself so he's very

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.960 
tom is the pilot himself so he's very
comfortable<00:01:57.290> with<00:01:57.620> all<00:01:57.980> this<00:01:58.130> movement<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:58.850> go

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
comfortable with all this movement we go

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.670 
comfortable with all this movement we go
a<00:01:59.000> little<00:01:59.150> faster<00:01:59.390> but<00:01:59.840> he's<00:02:00.110> never<00:02:00.290> been<00:02:00.440> on

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
a little faster but he's never been on

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.499 
a little faster but he's never been on
any<00:02:00.980> kind<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.430> gimbal<00:02:01.850> like<00:02:02.480> this<00:02:02.690> before
