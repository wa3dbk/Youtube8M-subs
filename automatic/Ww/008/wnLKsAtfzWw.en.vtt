00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200 
to shoot down any my air support because
I<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.340> jumped<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> game<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.030> him

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
I think if I jumped in a game with him
and<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> saw<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.110> trying<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and I saw that he was trying to go for a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.530 
and I saw that he was trying to go for a
nuke<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.159> don't<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.700> I'd<00:01:53.850> shoot<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.329> my<00:01:54.509> own

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.499 
nuke I don't think I'd shoot down my own
friends<00:01:54.930> stuff<00:01:55.110> either

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
friends stuff either

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.539 
friends stuff either
that<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.750> pretty<00:01:57.960> annoying<00:01:58.259> and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.419 

I<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:04.310> recently<00:02:04.520> watched<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.899> new

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429

gameplay<00:02:07.429> of<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.880> multiplayer<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.810> black<00:02:09.110> ops

gameplay of the multiplayer of black ops

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.059 
gameplay of the multiplayer of black ops
which<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.940> pretty<00:02:11.209> cool<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.810> mean<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.800> can't

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
which was pretty cool I mean you can't

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.290 
which was pretty cool I mean you can't
really<00:02:13.930> decipher<00:02:14.930> too<00:02:15.319> much<00:02:15.530> from<00:02:15.830> it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
really decipher too much from it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.410 
really decipher too much from it
but<00:02:17.300> um<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:18.670> don't<00:02:19.670> know<00:02:19.730> my<00:02:19.910> first<00:02:20.090> thoughts

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
but um I don't know my first thoughts

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.440 
but um I don't know my first thoughts
right<00:02:20.690> now<00:02:20.720> are<00:02:20.989> kind<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.260> iffy<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:22.209> mean<00:02:23.209> it's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
right now are kind of iffy I mean it's

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180 
right now are kind of iffy I mean it's
it's<00:02:24.140> gonna<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:24.440> exciting<00:02:24.830> either<00:02:24.950> way

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
it's gonna be exciting either way

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.559 
it's gonna be exciting either way
because<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.760> new<00:02:25.879> game<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.360> everything

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
because it's a new game and everything

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.390 
because it's a new game and everything
but<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.230> don't<00:02:27.530> really<00:02:27.799> know<00:02:27.890> how<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.040> feel<00:02:28.190> about

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
but I don't really know how I feel about

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.089 
but I don't really know how I feel about
that<00:02:28.730> whole<00:02:28.970> RC<00:02:29.750> car<00:02:30.019> thing<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:33.099> camera

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
that whole RC car thing and the camera

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.350 
that whole RC car thing and the camera
or<00:02:34.250> whatever<00:02:34.519> they<00:02:34.670> have<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.209> can

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
or whatever they have that you can

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.319 
or whatever they have that you can
surveillance<00:02:35.959> areas<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.620> stuff<00:02:36.799> like<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
surveillance areas and stuff like that

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.610 
surveillance areas and stuff like that
I'm<00:02:38.329> really<00:02:38.540> confused<00:02:38.959> by<00:02:39.170> watching<00:02:39.380> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
I'm really confused by watching the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.819 
I'm really confused by watching the
video<00:02:39.860> because<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.310> see<00:02:40.519> right<00:02:40.730> off<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.000> bat<00:02:41.209> so

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
video because I see right off the bat so

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.890 
video because I see right off the bat so
first<00:02:42.829> blood<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.540> surveillance

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
first blood and that the surveillance

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.650 
first blood and that the surveillance
camera<00:02:45.319> has<00:02:45.410> already<00:02:45.799> been<00:02:45.980> set<00:02:46.310> up<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.790> don't

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
camera has already been set up I don't

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.780 
camera has already been set up I don't
really<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:48.079> how<00:02:48.290> you'd<00:02:48.530> have<00:02:48.709> time<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.610> put

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
really see how you'd have time to put

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.250 
really see how you'd have time to put
that<00:02:49.910> up<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.360> still<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:50.780> first<00:02:51.019> blood<00:02:51.170> I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that up and still get first blood I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.479 
that up and still get first blood I
don't<00:02:51.560> know<00:02:51.650> we'll<00:02:51.799> have<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.010> figure<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.400> when

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
don't know we'll have to figure out when

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.949 
don't know we'll have to figure out when
it<00:02:52.579> comes<00:02:52.760> out<00:02:55.360> what<00:02:56.360> they<00:02:56.540> were<00:02:56.599> hiding<00:02:56.900> in

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
it comes out what they were hiding in

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.660 
it comes out what they were hiding in
the<00:02:57.019> back<00:02:57.200> house<00:02:57.440> there<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.709> there<00:02:57.860> see<00:02:58.099> one

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the back house there and there see one

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.940 
the back house there and there see one
of<00:02:58.790> my<00:02:58.880> teammates<00:02:59.470> it's<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.590> nice<00:03:00.769> little

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
of my teammates it's a nice little

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.800 
of my teammates it's a nice little
triple<00:03:01.280> kill<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:01.700> shoots<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:01.970> RPG<00:03:02.540> up<00:03:02.690> in

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
triple kill and shoots the RPG up in

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.030 
triple kill and shoots the RPG up in
there<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:02.989> clears<00:03:03.200> them<00:03:03.379> all<00:03:03.470> for<00:03:03.709> me<00:03:03.860> I

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
there and clears them all for me I

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.009 
there and clears them all for me I
started<00:03:05.000> spawning<00:03:05.269> at<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.750> they<00:03:08.870> should

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
started spawning at a and they should

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.840 
started spawning at a and they should
shoot<00:03:09.530> me<00:03:09.650> down<00:03:09.799> pretty<00:03:09.950> fast<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:12.519> don't<00:03:13.519> really

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
shoot me down pretty fast I don't really

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.240 
shoot me down pretty fast I don't really
know<00:03:14.000> how<00:03:14.239> many<00:03:14.299> I'm<00:03:14.900> away<00:03:15.230> right<00:03:15.470> now<00:03:15.500> but<00:03:16.010> I

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
know how many I'm away right now but I

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.160 
know how many I'm away right now but I
figured<00:03:16.819> this<00:03:16.850> is<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.150> pretty<00:03:17.389> high<00:03:17.690> traffic

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
figured this is a pretty high traffic

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.259 
figured this is a pretty high traffic
area<00:03:18.709> so<00:03:19.400> I'm<00:03:19.519> just<00:03:19.670> going<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.880> keep<00:03:20.030> picking

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
area so I'm just going to keep picking

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.370 
area so I'm just going to keep picking
them<00:03:20.510> off<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:20.810> they<00:03:20.930> come<00:03:21.079> through<00:03:21.109> this

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
them off as they come through this

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:31.650 
them off as they come through this
doorway<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:23.889> hopefully<00:03:24.889> not<00:03:25.040> get<00:03:25.190> killed

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.570 

so<00:03:32.660> as<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.319> can<00:03:33.470> see<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.950> switch<00:03:34.190> up<00:03:34.220> my

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
so as you can see I like to switch up my

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.080 
so as you can see I like to switch up my
spots<00:03:35.269> alive<00:03:35.569> if<00:03:36.040> I'm<00:03:37.040> pretty<00:03:37.610> much<00:03:37.700> camping

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
spots alive if I'm pretty much camping

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.309 
spots alive if I'm pretty much camping
as<00:03:38.180> what<00:03:38.300> I'm<00:03:38.390> doing<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.750> as<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:38.989> can<00:03:39.110> see<00:03:39.200> it

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
as what I'm doing it as you can see it

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.540 
as what I'm doing it as you can see it
was<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.440> pretty<00:03:39.620> good<00:03:39.830> idea<00:03:40.069> because<00:03:40.250> right

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
was a pretty good idea because right

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.369 
was a pretty good idea because right
there<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:41.090> would<00:03:41.300> have<00:03:41.390> died<00:03:41.569> by<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.080> semtex

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
there I would have died by that semtex

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.660 
there I would have died by that semtex
or<00:03:42.830> frag<00:03:43.099> or<00:03:43.280> whatever<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.700> was<00:03:43.879> there<00:03:44.150> I

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
or frag or whatever that was there I

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.280 
or frag or whatever that was there I
imagine<00:03:46.670> get<00:03:46.790> away<00:03:46.940> from<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.569> get<00:03:48.170> the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
imagine get away from it and I get the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.250 
imagine get away from it and I get the
nuke<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.980> I'm<00:03:51.980> still<00:03:52.840> posted<00:03:53.840> here<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.230> a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
nuke and I'm still posted here like a

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.770 
nuke and I'm still posted here like a
vulture<00:03:54.950> or<00:03:55.160> something<00:03:55.610> just<00:03:56.000> staring<00:03:56.630> at<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
vulture or something just staring at the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.880 
vulture or something just staring at the
doorway<00:03:58.000> if<00:03:59.000> you're<00:03:59.330> guarding<00:03:59.750> see<00:04:00.019> just

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
doorway if you're guarding see just

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.050 
doorway if you're guarding see just
watching<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.340> doorway<00:04:01.580> there<00:04:01.849> you're

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
watching that doorway there you're

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.030 
watching that doorway there you're
you're<00:04:02.390> guaranteed<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.080> at<00:04:03.470> least<00:04:03.650> count<00:04:03.980> on

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
you're guaranteed to at least count on

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.559 
you're guaranteed to at least count on
the<00:04:04.130> little<00:04:04.370> kill<00:04:04.610> streak<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:10.569> after

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
the little kill streak and after

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.850 
the little kill streak and after
watching<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:11.930> over<00:04:12.170> again<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.349> completely

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
watching this over again I completely

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.319 
watching this over again I completely
missed<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.310> guy<00:04:13.459> standing<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.030> Box

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
missed that guy standing on the Box

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:23.260 
missed that guy standing on the Box
there<00:04:14.660> looking<00:04:15.079> over<00:04:15.260> looking<00:04:15.799> see<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:23.120> this

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
there looking over looking see so this

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.830 
there looking over looking see so this
isn't<00:04:23.600> exactly<00:04:23.660> my<00:04:24.400> most<00:04:25.400> impressive
