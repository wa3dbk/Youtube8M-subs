00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
brush size make sure the hardness is

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.040 
brush size make sure the hardness is
down<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:42.260> basically<00:02:42.890> minimal<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.489> just<00:02:44.450> rub

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
down like basically minimal and just rub

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.510 
down like basically minimal and just rub
away<00:02:46.900> now<00:02:47.900> as<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.350> can<00:02:48.470> see<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.010> can<00:02:49.160> start

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
away now as you can see so you can start

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.970 
away now as you can see so you can start
so<00:02:50.300> already<00:02:50.630> seeing<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.500> effect<00:02:51.830> is

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
so already seeing that the effect is

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.010 
so already seeing that the effect is
occur<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.520> can<00:02:52.670> see<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.420> foreground

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
occur and you can see this foreground

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.840 
occur and you can see this foreground
area<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.350> already<00:02:54.739> starting<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.220> stand<00:02:55.580> out

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
area is already starting to stand out

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.560 
area is already starting to stand out
there<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.959> background<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:59.480> it's

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
there to the background I think it's

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.260 
there to the background I think it's
just<00:02:59.600> so<00:03:00.200> beautiful<00:03:00.440> it's<00:03:00.920> beautiful<00:03:01.270> so

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
just so beautiful it's beautiful so

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.000 
just so beautiful it's beautiful so
great<00:03:02.540> effect<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:02.989> can<00:03:03.020> do<00:03:03.350> just<00:03:03.620> make<00:03:03.739> your

really beautiful now we can also do
another<00:03:53.690> little<00:03:54.320> tip<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.620> mines<00:03:54.799> which<00:03:55.070> I've

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
another little tip of mines which I've

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.009 
another little tip of mines which I've
mentioned<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.760> my<00:03:55.790> other<00:03:56.000> one<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.420> overlay

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
mentioned in my other one is to overlay

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.850 
mentioned in my other one is to overlay
the<00:03:57.049> first<00:03:57.440> layer<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.519> just<00:03:58.930> well<00:03:59.930> just<00:04:00.560> makes

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the first layer and just well just makes

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.979 
the first layer and just well just makes
it<00:04:00.950> look<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.190> little<00:04:01.310> bit<00:04:01.489> better<00:04:01.690> but<00:04:02.690> i<00:04:02.750> think

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
it look a little bit better but i think

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.330 
it look a little bit better but i think

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.980 
so bit too much i think i had this quite
high<00:04:56.100> when<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.790> Gaussian<00:04:57.390> blur<00:04:57.510> think<00:04:57.930> I

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
high when on the Gaussian blur think I

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.410 
high when on the Gaussian blur think I
had<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.140> quite<00:04:58.530> high<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.150> this<00:05:00.150> one's<00:05:00.360> just

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.890 
had a quite high and this one's just
pretty<00:05:01.050> much<00:05:01.790> right<00:05:02.790> in<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.940> middle<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:03.570> just

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
pretty much right in the middle so just

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.500
