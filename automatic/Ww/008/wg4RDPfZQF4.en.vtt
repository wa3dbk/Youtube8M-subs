low you can get a really nice you know
mid-range<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> low<00:00:57.690> Rumble<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> these

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
mid-range and low Rumble out of these

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
mid-range and low Rumble out of these
nice<00:00:59.370> little<00:00:59.550> low<00:00:59.789> punch<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
like I said they have the divided weight

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.200 
like I said they have the divided weight
setup<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> they<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.860> 8<00:01:14.100> ohms<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.970> they<00:01:15.119> have

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
setup and they are 8 ohms so they have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.380 
setup and they are 8 ohms so they have
an<00:01:15.330> 8<00:01:15.479> ohm<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> convenience<00:01:16.110> rating<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.390> very

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
ins or not Ross speaker wire so you can

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
ins or not Ross speaker wire so you can
use<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.920> either<00:01:37.950> type<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.939> app<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.600> has

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
use it with either type of app that has

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.350 
use it with either type of app that has
those<00:01:39.930> type<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> connections<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
those type of connections and I think it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
those type of connections and I think it
calls<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> questions<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> lot<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.439> people<00:01:43.860> when

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
calls you questions a lot of people when

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.710 
calls you questions a lot of people when
they<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.130> these<00:01:44.399> two<00:01:44.610> input<00:01:45.090> jacks<00:01:45.420> thinking

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
they see these two input jacks thinking

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
they see these two input jacks thinking

need to plug into one or the other if

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
need to plug into one or the other if
you<00:01:51.570> plug<00:01:51.780> into<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.710> becomes<00:01:53.100> an<00:01:53.250> input

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
you plug into one it becomes an input

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.500 
you plug into one it becomes an input
jacks<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> only<00:01:54.240> need<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> plug<00:01:54.630> into<00:01:54.780> one

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
jacks the only need to plug into one

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.120 
jacks the only need to plug into one
you<00:01:55.570> plug<00:01:55.810> into<00:01:55.990> either<00:01:56.230> one<00:01:56.530> left<00:01:56.770> or<00:01:56.920> right

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
you plug into either one left or right

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.100 
you plug into either one left or right
and<00:01:57.640> what<00:01:57.970> that's<00:01:58.180> gonna<00:01:58.300> do<00:01:58.570> then<00:01:58.750> it's<00:01:58.930> gonna

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
and what that's gonna do then it's gonna

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.590 
and what that's gonna do then it's gonna
send<00:01:59.650> that<00:01:59.860> audio<00:02:00.190> signal<00:02:00.580> how<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:01.150> other<00:02:01.390> one

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
send that audio signal how the other one

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.240 
send that audio signal how the other one
so<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.870> can<00:02:02.050> daisy-chain<00:02:02.440> another<00:02:02.860> speaker

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
so you can daisy-chain another speaker

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.710 
so you can daisy-chain another speaker
off<00:02:03.400> of<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.730> so<00:02:03.880> that's<00:02:04.000> basically<00:02:04.420> why<00:02:04.660> you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
off of it so that's basically why you

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.020 
off of it so that's basically why you
have<00:02:04.930> two<00:02:05.140> of<00:02:05.290> those<00:02:05.440> with<00:02:06.430> Roth<00:02:06.670> speaker

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
have two of those with Roth speaker

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.600 
have two of those with Roth speaker

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you're in red black into that and then

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.450 
you're in red black into that and then
you<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:13.930> use<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> quarter<00:02:14.620> inches<00:02:14.890> cables<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
you can use the quarter inches cables to

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.790 
you can use the quarter inches cables to
jump<00:02:15.730> off<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.120> another<00:02:16.320> daisy<00:02:17.320> chain<00:02:17.620> another

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
jump off of another daisy chain another

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.110 
jump off of another daisy chain another
