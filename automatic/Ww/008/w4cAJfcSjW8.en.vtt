00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
experiment is a balloon some baking soda

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.000 
experiment is a balloon some baking soda
baking<00:00:37.260> soda<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.989> little<00:00:39.989> funnel<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> spoon

baking soda a little funnel and a spoon

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.410 
baking soda a little funnel and a spoon
because<00:00:41.280> we're<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.610> put<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> baking<00:00:42.180> soda

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because we're gonna put the baking soda

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.590 
because we're gonna put the baking soda
into<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.110> balloon<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.970> then<00:00:44.970> we<00:00:45.239> need<00:00:45.390> some

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
into the balloon and then we need some

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.450 
into the balloon and then we need some
white<00:00:45.750> vinegar<00:00:46.040> do<00:00:47.040> do<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:48.739> bigger<00:00:49.739> funnel<00:00:50.220> or<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.120 
white vinegar do do a bigger funnel or a
different<00:00:50.910> funnel<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:52.079> my<00:00:52.290> other<00:00:52.649> funnel

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
different funnel I just my other funnel

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.660 
different funnel I just my other funnel
is<00:00:53.280> larger<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:55.200> water<00:00:55.530> bottle<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> pop

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is larger and a water bottle or a pop

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.579 
bottle and a 1/2 cup measuring cup so
basically<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.760> idea<00:01:02.790> is<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.050> put<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
basically what the idea is is to put the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.290 
basically what the idea is is to put the
baking<00:01:04.860> soda<00:01:05.009> in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> balloon<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
baking soda in the balloon put the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.779 
baking soda in the balloon put the
vinegar<00:01:06.660> in<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:07.170> bottle<00:01:07.560> flip<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> balloon

vinegar in the bottle flip the balloon

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.779 
vinegar in the bottle flip the balloon
over<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.440> science<00:01:10.440> happens<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.399> blows<00:01:11.580> up

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
over and science happens and it blows up

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.200 
over and science happens and it blows up
the<00:01:11.910> balloon<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.619> am<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> do

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
aside you know here's the tricky part

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.680 
aside you know here's the tricky part
you<00:02:19.340> want<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.640> make<00:02:19.760> sure<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.090> baking<00:02:20.480> soda

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
you want to make sure the baking soda

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.590 
you want to make sure the baking soda
stays<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> bottom<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.340> balloon<00:02:22.730> so

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
stays in the bottom of your balloon so

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.950 
stays in the bottom of your balloon so

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
squeeze the arrow okay now you're gonna

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.650 
squeeze the arrow okay now you're gonna
put<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> top<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.340> your<00:02:28.460> balloon<00:02:28.760> over<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.420> top

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
put the top of your balloon over the top

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.110 
put the top of your balloon over the top
of<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.380> leave<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.280> balloon<00:02:31.550> hanging

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
of this and leave the balloon hanging

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.710 
of this and leave the balloon hanging
sideways<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:34.370> kind<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.700> tricky<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.360> start

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
sideways it's kind of tricky but start

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.830 
sideways it's kind of tricky but start
it<00:02:35.810> out<00:02:35.960> in<00:02:36.050> your<00:02:36.170> fingers<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:41.450> over<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.810> top

air<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.080> that's<00:03:29.200> because<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.800> gas<00:03:29.980> that's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
air but that's because of the gas that's

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.070

said<00:03:35.290> another<00:03:35.530> one<00:03:35.740> up<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.280> can<00:03:36.400> look<00:03:36.550> at<00:03:36.670> it

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
said another one up so we can look at it

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.020 
said another one up so we can look at it
from<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.030> different<00:03:37.180> angle<00:03:38.520> all<00:03:39.520> right<00:03:39.790> let's

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
from a different angle all right let's

00:03:40.030 --> 00:04:04.780 
from a different angle all right let's
have<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.239> look<00:03:40.450> at<00:03:40.569> this<00:03:40.720> another<00:03:41.290> time<00:03:47.670> hole

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:33.640 

very<00:04:05.790> very<00:04:06.060> cool

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.170 

so<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.680> think<00:04:34.800> this<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.550> one-time<00:04:35.910> use

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
so I think this is just a one-time use

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.790 
so I think this is just a one-time use
type<00:04:36.389> thing<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:41.130> balloons<00:04:41.460> do<00:04:41.820> not<00:04:42.000> float

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
type thing and the balloons do not float

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.560 
type thing and the balloons do not float
but<00:04:43.800> they<00:04:43.919> do<00:04:43.979> fill<00:04:44.310> up<00:04:44.460> with<00:04:44.639> gas<00:04:47.060> it's<00:04:48.060> pretty

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
but they do fill up with gas it's pretty

00:04:48.570 --> 00:05:01.960 
but they do fill up with gas it's pretty

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
so it's been about half an hour maybe 45

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.420 
so it's been about half an hour maybe 45
minutes<00:05:59.410> since<00:06:00.190> I<00:06:00.370> recorded<00:06:00.940> and<00:06:02.130> this<00:06:03.130> thing

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
is still full of error so I think I'm

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.190 
is still full of error so I think I'm
gonna<00:06:05.740> hold<00:06:05.890> off<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.070> little<00:06:06.310> bit<00:06:06.490> longer<00:06:06.760> and

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
gonna hold off a little bit longer and

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.320 
gonna hold off a little bit longer and
see<00:06:08.200> how<00:06:08.320> this<00:06:08.470> ends<00:06:08.710> up<00:06:08.880> been<00:06:09.880> about<00:06:10.090> an<00:06:10.210> hour
