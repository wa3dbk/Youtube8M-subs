00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello today we will see together 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.400
 how to open a bottle of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.500
 Champagne 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 you have a little muzzle so around 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.780
 of the bottle what wanted to do 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 it's not actually you did not want 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.190
 destroy all this whole because 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 that a bottle of champagne is a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.910
 beautiful object so from the moment where 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.519
 you're going to touch saint you go 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.590
 always keep your thumb above the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.000
 plug because in fact a pressure 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 which is pretty amazing in this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.710
 bottle actually there are so many 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.350
 pressure that in a bus tire invokes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.170
 be careful you have exactly six laps 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.950
 we will do them 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 so 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 that's it's open you go 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 gently follow in fact the rim of the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.260
 bottle you catch the bottle 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.079
 you will try to turn the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.789
 bottle makes the plug itself 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.260
 it's better than the bottle and you 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.030
 do not want to have a pop they are 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 too noisy but you want a little 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.989
 pop anyway because otherwise people 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.729
 will think that champagne and place 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.229
 so here we go here and you have 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.790
 always a glass that owes a flute that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.909
 must be close enough you started 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.180
 to pour your champagne you want 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.860
 go 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.869
 what is needed is not to fill everything 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 the verb is a little aesthetic and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.920
 then the wine will warm up 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.180
 faster so it's better to serve 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.470
 in fact you're your guests then a few 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.020
 additional tips 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.950
 the first thing one thing to never 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 to do is put your flute in the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.280
 freezer 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.560
 it never makes you when green in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 is going to heat up the ice is going to get 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.189
 turn into water and the water will get 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 mix with champagne and you do not want to 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.630
 have this the second tip you have 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.220
 twelve guests you have a single 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.079
 bottle you do not have magnum 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.070
 so how do you make a lil con 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.409
 what you do is that you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.060
 go around with the bottle of your 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.110
 guests up the bottle empties 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.149
 like that it allows everyone 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.350
 to have champagne 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.550
 then there is also a trick to hold 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.320
 the bottle do it yourself 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.210
 did not want that actually when you go 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.860
 serve the label be on the other side 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.810
 so you want it to be like that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.610
 so either you can serve the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 bottle directly that way there 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.320
 where you can even put the shoot to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.780
 inside the bottle so the 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.150
 flute is served just a tiny 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.180
 advice you can actually it's better 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.910
 to hold your flute by the foot like 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.710
 that to you to avoid heating the glass 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.450
 is to also put fingerprints 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.320
 on it's still more aesthetic 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.320
 health
