00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 ah 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.960
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.330
 of teacher of and well let's do 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.610
 this exercise good to remember that 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.730
 you have here the little button of I like 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.640
 first advertising 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.050
 and there the link yes to the blog where we are 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.690
 developing all this agenda of 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.580
 physical the doppler effect and all 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.289
 issues of good physics that I 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.869
 have given time to develop up 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.490
 now good come let's freeze a 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.850
 Little says the siren of a truck 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.159
 firefighters at rest the truck the source and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.469
 is at rest voucher issues a frequency 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.659
 of 406 which is to calculate the frequency that 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.550
 perceives a cyclist with a speed of 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.769
 10 meters matches second is worth when 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.569
 the cyclist approaches the truck is worth and 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.729
 when the cyclist walks away we assume 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:51.129
 so then 20 then let's go 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.260
 we have the speed of sound we are going to 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.909
 go we see that the frequency that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.129
 listen the observer is equal to 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.479
 original frequency per vee which is the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.519
 speed of sound minus speed 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.760
 of party observer 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.680
 v - the speed of the force is worth and 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.960
 this formula is the trick formula that 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.500
 will teach me to learn alone 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.540
 the mind a form is worth well there that 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.549
 we have to see the speed of the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.909
 sound and the trick is to take the 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.310
 sense of the speed of sound 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.740
 always the positive and the negative rest 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.990
 ok if the opposite direction would be 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.360
 negative 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.070
 then let's go set apart ah yes good 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 first let's take that the frequency 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.470
 it's 400 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.730
 is the speed of sound 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.770
 are 340 meters second match and that the 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.620
 Source speed of the source is 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.410
 the fire truck is still quiet 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.190
 then the section we have 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.620
 here the fire truck right there 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.960
 pretty drawn that pretty drawing worth 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.710
 with a mermaid it's worth and we have a 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.510
 lovely cyclist also drawing yes that 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.220
 is close to the source, you see it as 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.890
 the road is stopped with speed of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.310
 the source equal to zero and the sound 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.430
 arrives at the cyclist if with this sense 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.030
 would be a voucher then the speed of the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.490
 observer how would it be like it makes sense 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.290
 contrary to the v domino lower beautiful there 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.049
 everything that goes to another side 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.750
 okay then let's go to the formula and 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:35.900
 would be in this first air that is 400 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.150
 because they are 340 minus the speed of the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.349
 observer that is the one we have to put 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.549
 negative then to be minus 10 worth 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.170
 and then less for less plus 340 minus the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.459
 font speed that we made it be 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.079
 well then we would be 400 by 340 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:01.220
 minus minus that is plus 340 plus 10 are 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:05.310
 350 match between 340 we take the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:10.480
 calculator and he gave me 411 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:14.140
 76 this is worth and that would be the section 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.269
 I put it well come let's see it 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.860
 he sees what happens now 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.310
 now the truck is still here 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.310
 stopped 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.800
 there we have the z truck but the cyclist 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.820
 I suppose it will have surpassed it and 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.980
 towards there it moves away you see it not then 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.990
 we have the same font speed 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.340
 to zero again meters match second 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.020
 for the idea sound towards there true 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.910
 so you can hear the 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.320
 observer is the speed of sound 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.590
 is the speed of the observer as it is 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.080
 as you have the same you see it does not have 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.530
 more flechita has the same meaning 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.660
 then it's positive when they have the same 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.330
 positive sense and when you have 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.410
 different negative sense we're going to the 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:09.750
 formula f premium equal to 400 for 300 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:14.980
 I could go 3 go past 340 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:19.570
 less plus 10 is worth more to emphasize 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:23.950
 that I have to put it positive minus 0 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:30.730
 ok then it would be 400 for 300 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:33.630
 40 minus 10 330 matches 340 is worth it and that 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.260
 he gave me 388 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.650
 like 24 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.050
 Okay, an important thing when 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.780
 we start with the doppler effect or fold 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.540
 I told them that I was going to teach you this 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.090
 trick formula to see if you liked me 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.620
 I think this formula is better than 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.530
 several formulas that usually appear in 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.870
 books June 8, 10 depends on the book and the 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.730
 true that is the then come to 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.070
 I want since everyone that I 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.260
 comment if you prefer this method or 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.750
 I prefer the method of pulling shapes myself 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.820
 I think this is much easier and see 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.040
 all your comments there down there 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.780
 remember that you also have the link 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.790
 where are we developing all this 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.410
 agenda all this agenda on the blog 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.390
 here if I remember 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.120
 I will try to leave it this reproduction and 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.680
 subscribe to my channel to receive 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.680
 all all all these videos 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.630
 freckles see you at the next
