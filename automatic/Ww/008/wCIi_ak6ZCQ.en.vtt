00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.670

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.110
 once all the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.110
 steps already mentioned give you the option 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 to extract them will begin to extract the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.580
 game 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.800

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.860
 be removed but be patient 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.810

 I stop the extraction since I already 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.110

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.110
 xd memory 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.410

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.410
