00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
we can go to a great big rubber and

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.630 
we can go to a great big rubber and
channel<00:01:05.500> little<00:01:06.500> windows<00:01:06.860> if<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:07.190> have<00:01:07.310> little

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
even if your windows are big the reason

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.290 
even if your windows are big the reason
being<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.950> takes<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.340> little<00:01:22.490> practice<00:01:22.820> to

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
being it takes a little practice to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.240 
being it takes a little practice to
maintain<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.380> right<00:01:24.590> amount<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:24.980> pressure

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
maintain the right amount of pressure

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.940 
maintain the right amount of pressure
when<00:01:25.610> your<00:01:25.760> squeegee<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.600> also<00:01:27.410> pays<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:27.890> have

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
when your squeegee it also pays to have

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.950 
when your squeegee it also pays to have
an<00:01:28.130> absorbent<00:01:28.700> rag<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.330> this<00:01:29.450> case<00:01:29.690> I'm

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
an absorbent rag and in this case I'm

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.050 
an absorbent rag and in this case I'm
using<00:01:29.990> one<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.740> microfiber<00:01:31.370> rags<00:01:31.790> that<00:01:32.030> I

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
using one of the microfiber rags that I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.380 
using one of the microfiber rags that I
use<00:01:32.300> all<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.570> time<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.080> clean

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
use all the time you clean

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780 
use all the time you clean
and<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.930> keep<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.260> in<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.650> pocket<00:01:34.790> started

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and I keep it in my back pocket started

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
and I keep it in my back pocket started

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to wipe the squeegee down in between so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.200 
to wipe the squeegee down in between so
we<00:01:37.830> don't<00:01:38.010> leave<00:01:38.100> any<00:01:38.250> streaks<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> window
