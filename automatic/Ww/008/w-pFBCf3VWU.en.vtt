00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.230
 zen palm grove nurseries exist 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.969
 for ten years and we are 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.590
 specialized in the production of 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.750
 palm 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 we leave seeds not at our feet 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.670
 mothers have by seed to have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.050
 plans of a climate t and unlike 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.210
 what could we believe our palms 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 are very resistant to cold 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.830
 -18 minus 20 degrees there are three 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.560
 one thousand eight hundred varieties of palms 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.850
 only a dozen can live in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 outside in our regions 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 we have mainly in that the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.460
 trachycarpus fortunei the most resistant 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.350
 cold and best known by magnifying 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.730
 that makes all his little sons around 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.280
 trunk that's why it's called 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.680
 as the palm room 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 the trachycarpus fortunei palm holds 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 his name robert fortune who brought back 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.170
 this palm of china 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.020
 in 1842 and since then it is the palm tree 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.449
 more product in France 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 the kama rops militia who has the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.180
 particularity of making rejections around 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.520
 the main trunk is the only pamiers 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.729
 European eee more in the natural state while 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.549
 around the Mediterranean 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.520
 but we hardly find France 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.189
 cause of real estate 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.939
 we have his minor ball that grows very 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 very slowly 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.890
 the palm tree champion of resistance to 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.470
 cold 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.110
 the particularity of making his trunk to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.420
 inside the earth there you have the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.540
 welsh tonia finished ferrat that comes from 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.409
 california the tron becomes very big at 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 the base and base of petioles splits into 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.799
 two to make a very wise good on the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.409
 trunk the Washingtonian finished ferrat 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.420
 pushes one place in the world to the state 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.860
 wild is in the crack of san 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.659
 andreas in california 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.119
 we think that a palm tree is the country 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.619
 hot we say good luck there's no need 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.960
 to water but not who to have a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.729
 beautiful pamiers well seen 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.760
 well resistant winter it is necessary that he 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.250
 be well watered in summer in winter it is 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.980
 not pink but as soon as it goes up to 15 16 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.450
 degrees we can start at the rose and if 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.980
 we are wrong when we put a lot of water 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.350
 if he has his feet in the water it's not 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.150
 serious it will not bother him one size that 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.080
 the bottom palms when it starts to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.940
 yellow or if it makes us feel bad 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.830
 on a terrace in an alley one can 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.709
 cut the palm it will not hurt the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.440
 growth of the palm tree but in general 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.330
 size only when the leaves 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.700
 start to turn yellow and it's not 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.580
 beautiful we can plants and as well 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.390
 in tanks in the ground is in full 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.530
 ground it grows in all soils 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.310
 always still importance and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.590
 watering 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.910
 it's not the only one it's watering the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.360
 trekkie carp resist cold 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.790
 up to -18 minus 20 degrees the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.380
 resistance temperature it depends 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.130
 also of the moisture wind of if the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.160
 cold lasts a long time 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.959
 but in general it's less 18 - 20 Â° and 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.299
 for q your pamiers resists well 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.940
 they must already be acclimated 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.579
 so that's why we're talking about 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.230
 our seeds which we make our plans 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.640
 leave them to the hard way we do not heat 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.040
 the small plants went tight but 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.319
 we do not heat 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.230
 our greenhouses and in the fields the 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.859
 not protect and we've already had 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.079
 less 18 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.079
 there is not one that has been damaged
