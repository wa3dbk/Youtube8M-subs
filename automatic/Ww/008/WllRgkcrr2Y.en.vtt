00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.470
 easy and beautiful nail designs step to 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.370
 step today is a day of some ideas that 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.370
 I think you're going to like it 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.150
 in the first option we will use these 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.150
 two enamels and a brush we paint the nail 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.550
 white or a light color and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 with a brush we will take the other 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.890
 color and we draw two diagonal lines 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.820
 first one and above we do another 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 of the same size 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.630
 let's do a cross line and the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.550
 fill in one side and then another 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.550
 on the other side below 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.920
 and ready and have this design as 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.629
 original 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.989
 in the next option we will use 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.489
 these four enamels and the brush 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
 we paint the nail white 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.080
 and with this enamel and the brush we are going to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.500
 make a triangle of half of the nail 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.510
 to one side we fill it well with 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.610
 patience 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.130
 and with the other is more we 're going to do 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.890
 another triangle stuck to the other side 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.280
 we mark the guide and fill it in a little 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.280
 little bit 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 let's take the black enamel 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 and we will make a triangle right in the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.930
 center over the two smaller and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.930
 cortito 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.490
 we painted the edge well and ready me 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.430
 love this design is very modern and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.250
 It is beautiful 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.530
 in this option we will use two enamels 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.470
 the color black the white and the brush 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.250
 we paint the nail white 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.490
 we take the dark red enamel and 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.579
 we make a square 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.840
 on one side we do the guide and then the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.840
 fill with the brush 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.740
 we take the red clarito and we do 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.380
 another square a little smaller in 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.010
 the other side and fill it in if we 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.900
 we passed it cleaned with a stick 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.850
 and with the black enamel we will continue 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.850
 the edges only of a square 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.860
 and we make a few passes 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.810
 and ready are very easy designs with 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.630
