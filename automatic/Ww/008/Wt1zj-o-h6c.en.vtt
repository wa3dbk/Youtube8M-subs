don't have time to do or have already
done<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.470> dig<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.880> completely

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420

excavated<00:00:18.960> site<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.490> will

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
excavated site and it's one that will

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.060 
excavated site and it's one that will
continue<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.539> excavated<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.830> two

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
continue to be excavated we have two

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.070 
continue to be excavated we have two
maps<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.699> i'll<00:00:23.880> give<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.539> each<00:00:24.689> one

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
maps and i'll give you one of each one

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.170 
maps and i'll give you one of each one
is<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.529> site<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.099> currently<00:00:26.279> exists<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
is the site as it currently exists and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.589 
is the site as it currently exists and
one<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.230> site<00:00:28.439> after<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.160> has<00:00:29.400> been

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
one is the site after it has been

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
one is the site after it has been
expanded<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> more<00:00:31.740> burials<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.550> been

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
expanded and more burials have been

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.100 
expanded and more burials have been
uncovered<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.450> students<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.899> actually

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
uncovered so that students can actually

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
uncovered so that students can actually
come<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.770> with<00:00:34.950> their<00:00:35.190> conclusions<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> then

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
come up with their conclusions and then

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.740 
come up with their conclusions and then
check<00:00:36.870> them<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:38.340> continue<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> dig<00:00:39.180> there

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
check them as they continue to dig there

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.180 
check them as they continue to dig there
are<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.140> different<00:00:40.260> ways<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.070> do

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
are a lot of different ways you can do

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
are a lot of different ways you can do
this<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:42.000> 3d<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.680> find<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
this you can do 3d or not I find it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250 
this you can do 3d or not I find it
really<00:00:44.430> useful<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> 3d<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
really useful to have the 3d for the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.080 
really useful to have the 3d for the
students<00:00:46.739> who<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:47.910> at

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
students who really like to look at

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.250 
students who really like to look at
things<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.360> three<00:00:48.539> dimensions<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.110> walk

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
things in three dimensions and walk

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
things in three dimensions and walk
around<00:00:49.440> them<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.760> map<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.090> great<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
around them the map is great for the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
around them the map is great for the
flat<00:00:52.710> visual<00:00:53.280> learners<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
flat visual learners but you have to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
flat visual learners but you have to
prod<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> heard<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.920> over<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
prod and heard them over to look at the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.900 
prod and heard them over to look at the
real<00:00:56.879> 3d<00:00:57.360> experience<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> goal<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.340> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
real 3d experience so the goal here is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
real 3d experience so the goal here is
for<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.660> walk<00:01:00.870> around<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> figure<00:01:01.620> out

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
for them to walk around and figure out

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.549 
for them to walk around and figure out
one<00:01:02.609> piece<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.000> hard<00:01:03.210> evidence<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:04.080> figure<00:01:04.409> out

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
one piece of hard evidence to figure out

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.950 
one piece of hard evidence to figure out
the<00:01:04.589> gender<00:01:05.010> agent<00:01:05.430> status<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:06.000> everybody<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the gender agent status of everybody in

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.679 
the gender agent status of everybody in
this<00:01:07.500> cemetery<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> then<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> figure<00:01:09.540> out

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
this cemetery and then to figure out

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.660 
this cemetery and then to figure out
what<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.140> exactly<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:11.250> wrong<00:01:11.640> with

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
what it is exactly that's wrong with

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.179 
what it is exactly that's wrong with
these<00:01:12.119> people<00:01:12.570> over<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> behind<00:01:13.920> this

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
these people over here and behind this

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.770 
these people over here and behind this
wall<00:01:14.430> which<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> pennies<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.509> because

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
wall which is pennies just because

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
wall which is pennies just because
they're<00:01:15.960> convenient<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.729> they're<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
they're convenient and they're going to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
they're convenient and they're going to
write<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.450> their<00:01:18.600> conclusions<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.290> any<00:01:19.470> form

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
write up their conclusions in any form

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.039 
write up their conclusions in any form
they<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.460> their<00:01:21.270> main<00:01:21.479> job<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.780> to

they like and their main job is to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.710 
they like and their main job is to
correlate<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.159> attributes<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> burials

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
correlate the attributes of the burials

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.320 
correlate the attributes of the burials
until<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.830> discrete<00:01:26.430> groups<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
until they have discrete groups of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
until they have discrete groups of
people<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.439> seem<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.070> work<00:01:29.250> together

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
people that seem to work together

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090 
people that seem to work together
because<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.479> their<00:01:30.689> burial<00:01:31.079> goods<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.619> their
