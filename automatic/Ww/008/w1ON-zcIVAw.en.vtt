as you can see here looking at the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.080 
as you can see here looking at the
bottom<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> base<00:01:38.369> looking<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
bottom of the base looking at the top of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.510 
bottom of the base looking at the top of
the<00:01:39.299> base<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> definite<00:01:41.040> three<00:01:41.280> star

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the base it is a definite three star

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
the base it is a definite three star
kings<00:01:41.880> almost<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.329> full<00:01:42.540> health<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
kings almost at full health at the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.990 
kings almost at full health at the
bottom<00:01:43.860> there<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.220> plenty<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.610> wizards

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
bottom there you see plenty of wizards

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
bottom there you see plenty of wizards
and<00:01:45.180> golems<00:01:45.659> pushing<00:01:46.110> through<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.560> bottom

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and golems pushing through that bottom

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.560 
and golems pushing through that bottom
portion<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.680> definite<00:01:49.680> three<00:01:50.189> star

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
portion so it's a definite three star

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.690 
portion so it's a definite three star
which<00:01:51.570> was<00:01:51.750> unfortunate<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.470> us<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.579> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
which was unfortunate for us and as you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.980 
which was unfortunate for us and as you
see<00:01:53.880> there<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> Queen<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.540> finished<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
see there the Queen just finished up the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
see there the Queen just finished up the
clan<00:01:55.290> castle<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.009> she's<00:01:56.250> moving<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
clan castle and now she's moving up to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
clan castle and now she's moving up to
go<00:01:56.909> help<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.240> her<00:01:57.360> husband<00:01:57.719> also<00:01:58.229> known<00:01:58.740> as

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
go help out her husband also known as

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.639 
go help out her husband also known as
the<00:01:58.890> barbarian<00:01:59.369> king<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> essentially<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the barbarian king so essentially this

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.990 
the barbarian king so essentially this
gave<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.219> other<00:02:02.430> clan<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.299> free<00:02:03.810> 3<00:02:04.140> star

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
gave the other clan a free 3 star

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.100 
gave the other clan a free 3 star
normally<00:02:06.000> mystic<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.719> probably<00:02:06.930> made

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
normally mystic would have probably made

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
normally mystic would have probably made
a<00:02:07.170> base<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.439> would<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.920> either<00:02:08.039> been<00:02:08.190> one

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
a base that would have either been one

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.960 
a base that would have either been one
starred<00:02:09.030> maybe<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.660> start<00:02:10.520> but<00:02:11.520> since<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.849> only

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
starred maybe to start but since we only

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.520 
starred maybe to start but since we only
lost<00:02:12.270> by<00:02:12.420> two<00:02:12.569> trophies<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.290> mean

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
lost by two trophies I mean

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.390 
lost by two trophies I mean
this<00:02:13.740> could<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.010> been<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.130> game-changer

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
this could have been a game-changer

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.880 
this could have been a game-changer
let's<00:02:14.970> say<00:02:15.150> he<00:02:15.300> got<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.780> start<00:02:16.110> let's<00:02:16.530> say<00:02:16.680> got

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
let's say he got one start let's say got

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.620 
let's say he got one start let's say got
to<00:02:17.100> start<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.850> know<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.060> only<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> Inferno

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
