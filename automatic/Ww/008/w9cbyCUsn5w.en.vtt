so right you know the specifications of

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.509 
so right you know the specifications of
the<00:02:22.130> computer<00:02:22.610> have<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.850> be<00:02:23.709> very<00:02:24.709> very<00:02:24.890> high

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
the computer have to be very very high

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.640 
the computer have to be very very high
because<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.209> know<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.870> consumes<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.440> lot<00:02:27.470> of

because you know it it consumes a lot of
resources<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.700> computer<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:30.560> example

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
resources of the computer for example

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.040 
resources of the computer for example
that<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.519> CPU<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.820> graphics<00:02:35.330> card<00:02:35.810> I've

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
that the CPU and the graphics card I've

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.949 
that the CPU and the graphics card I've
f2b<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.459> know<00:02:38.350> very<00:02:39.350> good<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.600> it's<00:02:41.810> in

f2b you to know very good and it's in

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.630 
f2b you to know very good and it's in
this<00:02:42.080> computer<00:02:42.440> for<00:02:42.500> example<00:02:43.010> i'm<00:02:43.250> just<00:02:43.430> using

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640
