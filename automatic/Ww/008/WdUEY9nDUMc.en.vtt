but<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.429> mean<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.119> look<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.479> into<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
but I mean if you look back into the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.490 
but I mean if you look back into the
early<00:02:10.259> 90s<00:02:11.180> vessel<00:02:12.180> fest<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:12.690> arcade<00:02:13.140> style

all<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.700> marquee<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.210> goes<00:02:15.450> back<00:02:15.630> then<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
all the marquee so goes back then you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.220 
all the marquee so goes back then you
can<00:02:16.260> really<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> proper<00:02:16.920> simulation

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230

they don't have the groundwork all

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.760 
they don't have the groundwork all
that's<00:02:53.400> been<00:02:53.700> asked<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.110> say<00:02:55.110> no<00:02:55.320> mercy

on<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.190> there's<00:03:11.850> not<00:03:11.970> many<00:03:12.060> games<00:03:12.360> that

have that timing on stayin down was

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.360 
have that timing on stayin down was
right<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.320> was<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.530> right<00:03:16.739> length<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.070> time

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
right it was the right length for time

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.860 
right it was the right length for time
it<00:03:17.610> wasn't<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:17.970> five<00:03:18.420> seconds<00:03:18.930> unit<00:03:19.260> well

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
it wasn't just five seconds unit well

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.320 
it wasn't just five seconds unit well
but<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.860> white<00:03:23.160> light<00:03:23.610> for<00:03:23.910> them<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.180> go

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
but is it white light for them to go

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.289 
but is it white light for them to go
back<00:03:24.600> now<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> simulation<00:03:26.040> game<00:03:26.580> just

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
back now to do a simulation game just

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.400 
back now to do a simulation game just
like<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.750> video<00:03:27.930> 13<00:03:28.380> mate<00:03:28.650> 2k14<00:03:29.310> or<00:03:29.610> 2k15<00:03:30.410> it's

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
like the video 13 mate 2k14 or 2k15 it's

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.630 
like the video 13 mate 2k14 or 2k15 it's

questions there and leslie mod use the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.890 
questions there and leslie mod use the
nukes<00:03:40.200> engine<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.709> let<00:03:40.829> nukes<00:03:41.190> complete<00:03:41.519> it

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
nukes engine and let nukes complete it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.449 
nukes engine and let nukes complete it
which<00:03:42.900> again<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.590> still<00:03:43.739> possible<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.310> it's

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
which again it's still possible but it's

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.590 
which again it's still possible but it's
still<00:03:44.610> up<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.120> air<00:03:47.090> but<00:03:48.090> will<00:03:48.239> they<00:03:48.329> go<00:03:48.450> out

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
still up in the air but will they go out

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.539 
still up in the air but will they go out
k<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.140> good<00:03:49.290> simulation<00:03:49.680> group<00:03:49.950> i<00:03:50.130> think

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
k with a good simulation group i think

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.370 
k with a good simulation group i think
people<00:03:50.700> would<00:03:50.970> be<00:03:51.150> enough<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.630> all<00:03:51.720> nowadays

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
people would be enough of all nowadays
