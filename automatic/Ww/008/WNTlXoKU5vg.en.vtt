back to Orion well one thing to notice
was<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> comment<00:03:31.819> let's<00:03:32.819> turn<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.060> off<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.480> turn

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
was a comment let's turn it off and turn

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.229 
was a comment let's turn it off and turn
it<00:03:33.870> back<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:39.450> starts<00:03:39.900> over<00:03:39.989> if<00:03:40.620> there's<00:03:41.010> no

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
it back on it starts over if there's no

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.550 
it back on it starts over if there's no
memory<00:03:42.239> kind<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.629> thing<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.019> let's<00:03:43.230> turn<00:03:43.409> at

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
memory kind of thing so let's turn at

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.930 
memory kind of thing so let's turn at
the<00:03:43.680> last<00:03:43.920> one<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:49.110> we<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.409> see<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:50.430> glows<00:03:50.760> red

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
the last one so we can see it glows red

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.350 
the last one so we can see it glows red
this<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.019> last<00:03:52.349> one<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.069> evil<00:03:53.549> voice<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:56.360> it

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
this is last one and I evil voice and it

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.369 
this is last one and I evil voice and it
makes<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.659> sound<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.019> push<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.319> ooh<00:04:00.379> and

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
makes that sound you push it ooh and

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:09.160 
makes that sound you push it ooh and
made<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> click<00:04:02.459> off<00:04:02.640> noise

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.140 

oh<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:11.180> it's<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.599> says<00:04:12.840> OD<00:04:13.170> arts<00:04:13.530> uh<00:04:14.150> zukin

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
oh it's it's so it says OD arts uh zukin

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.849 
oh it's it's so it says OD arts uh zukin
mode<00:04:15.450> that's<00:04:15.930> cool<00:04:16.229> i<00:04:16.259> know<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.709> did<00:04:16.829> that

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
mode that's cool i know it did that

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.340 
mode that's cool i know it did that
actually<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.280> now<00:04:17.989> normally<00:04:18.989> i<00:04:19.019> turned<00:04:19.259> it

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
actually just now normally i turned it

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.439 
actually just now normally i turned it
off<00:04:19.470> instead<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.859> switching<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.250> back<00:04:23.449> so

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
off instead of switching it back so

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.480 
off instead of switching it back so
that's<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> transformation<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.800> last<00:04:26.070> one<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
that's the transformation to last one I

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.540 
that's the transformation to last one I
think<00:04:29.490> that's<00:04:29.639> pushing<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.180> button<00:04:31.280> I'm<00:04:32.280> not

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
think that's pushing the button I'm not

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.240 
think that's pushing the button I'm not
sure<00:04:32.610> exactly<00:04:33.030> what<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:34.009> unless<00:04:35.009> that's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
sure exactly what that is unless that's

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.830 
sure exactly what that is unless that's
turning<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.759> off<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:36.090> think<00:04:36.330> that's<00:04:36.449> turning<00:04:36.630> it

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
turning it off I think that's turning it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.260 
turning it off I think that's turning it
off<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.259> then<00:04:37.289> this<00:04:37.500> is<00:04:37.710> like<00:04:38.150> doesn't<00:04:39.150> work

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
off and then this is like doesn't work

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.070 
off and then this is like doesn't work
anymore<00:04:39.509> so<00:04:44.120> that's<00:04:45.120> actually<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.750> for<00:04:45.990> the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
anymore so that's actually it for the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.560 
anymore so that's actually it for the
Saudi<00:04:46.289> arts<00:04:46.560> which<00:04:46.860> oh<00:04:47.099> no<00:04:48.000> as<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.270> can<00:04:48.419> see

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
Saudi arts which oh no as you can see

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.210 
Saudi arts which oh no as you can see
there's<00:04:48.750> no<00:04:48.810> way<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.110> use<00:04:49.349> it<00:04:49.500> in<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.800> fours<00:04:50.070> a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
there's no way to use it in the fours a

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.770 
there's no way to use it in the fours a
driver<00:04:50.520> obviously<00:04:51.030> wouldn't<00:04:51.240> really<00:04:51.389> do

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
driver obviously wouldn't really do

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.610 
driver obviously wouldn't really do
anything<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.710> would<00:04:52.830> just<00:04:52.860> be<00:04:53.160> silly<00:04:54.620> but

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
anything and it would just be silly but

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.920 
anything and it would just be silly but
it's<00:04:55.770> fairly<00:04:55.979> big<00:04:56.400> in<00:04:56.550> size<00:04:56.759> for<00:04:57.120> comparison

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
it's fairly big in size for comparison

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.029 
it's fairly big in size for comparison
let<00:04:58.199> me<00:04:58.259> get<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.440> standard<00:04:58.979> switch<00:04:59.820> out<00:05:00.090> here

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
let me get a standard switch out here

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.839 
let me get a standard switch out here
this<00:05:02.039> is<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.759> rockets<00:05:03.210> which<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:04.490> then<00:05:05.490> this

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
this is the rockets which and then this

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.240 
this is the rockets which and then this
actual<00:05:06.509> script<00:05:06.660> soup<00:05:06.990> this<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.650> super<00:05:08.039> one

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
actual script soup this is the super one

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.480 
actual script soup this is the super one
switch<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.750> can<00:05:10.020> see<00:05:10.259> it's<00:05:11.009> a<00:05:11.160> fairly

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
switch so you can see it's a fairly

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.279 
switch so you can see it's a fairly
good-sized<00:05:12.090> switch<00:05:12.539> when<00:05:12.810> you<00:05:12.870> saw<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.020> big<00:05:13.199> it

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
good-sized switch when you saw a big it

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.600 
good-sized switch when you saw a big it
was<00:05:13.440> in<00:05:13.560> my<00:05:13.650> hand<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:15.710> um<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:17.250> know<00:05:17.340> it's<00:05:17.460> not

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
was in my hand so um you know it's not

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.029 
was in my hand so um you know it's not
tiny<00:05:18.030> by<00:05:18.900> any<00:05:19.080> means<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.500> probably<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:19.979> know

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
tiny by any means it's probably you know

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.680 
tiny by any means it's probably you know
smaller<00:05:20.460> than<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.759> one<00:05:20.880> on<00:05:20.909> the<00:05:21.030> show<00:05:21.270> but

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
smaller than the one on the show but

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.010 
smaller than the one on the show but
it's<00:05:21.960> also<00:05:22.169> not<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:23.220> know<00:05:23.340> overly<00:05:24.180> scaled

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
it's also not you know overly scaled

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.279 
it's also not you know overly scaled
down<00:05:25.259> as<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:27.090> know<00:05:27.180> some<00:05:27.479> things<00:05:27.690> are<00:05:28.070> um<00:05:29.070> I

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289
