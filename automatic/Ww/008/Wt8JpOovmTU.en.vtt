00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 welcome to this short video in which you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.560
 monster 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:13.740
 where and how to find many weapons and objects 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.099
 armor to level or grind a lot 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.099
 quickly 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.550
 the mission is on the moon 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.990
 the darkness beyond and once arrived 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 at the door where there is a dead guardian 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.170
 you simply have to wait for it to come out 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.570
 we enemies and kill only the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.969
 slaves and trying to kill the less 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.040
 You can look at the captains and so on 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.200
 etcetera etc. killing only the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.010
 slaves after a while you will be killed by 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 captains 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.950
 here's the there and then many will be reloaded 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 times depending on how many times you will die 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.730
 and yet the pieces of armor or weapons for 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.859
 in g what you will find will remain 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.590
 on the map then repeating this 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.760
 process for a while 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.119
 you will be able to find or better find 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.470
 per will be released to many pieces 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.960
 armo armor pieces then also in g also 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.720
 the ricoh also in blue and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 legendary purple colors 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.570
 personally i have used this 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.790
 method for an hour already roughly though 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.799
 I couldn't find anyone in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.920
 unfortunately, no legendary granules 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.890
 piece from the major 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.060
 but legendary only many many do not 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.950
 common greens and some rare blue ones 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.979
 Also conferred lights my 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.500
 current level is 20 I wanted to find a 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.920
 fast method to switch to 21 22 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.850
 etc 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.280
 but from what I understand by reading 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.649
 article and high government also video 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:01.030
 similar this method works very well 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.880
 if you are already above the level the level 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.970
 20 so you will find there is much more 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.530
 likely to find with legendary g 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.010
 pieces for the legendary matera and the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.830
 advice is not to do this method in 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.150
 easy mode but like coins 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.799
 difficult at the moment i am at 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.269
 level 9 as difficulty or even beyond 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.610
 for example if you are in the company of one 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.440
 two friends you should turn up a little 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.459
 level is obviously always separated i 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.470
 always slaves to the slaves and the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.420
 convenience of doing it in more people 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.890
 here once you have gained so much 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.790
 lots of stuff 1 circle hoop 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.090
 you can go on the tower decrypt the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.230
 in go simply equip 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.989
 armor and see what you have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:59.799
 found while the other continues to a 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:02.829
 level and what else is there to say seems 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.950
 some have hypothesized that the higher it is 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.750
 the level of 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:14.300
 the tarca clip and more are also rare 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.430
 objects that he could find so if 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.230
 you are very level 21 and you want 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.220
 find so many pieces of armor in the treasury 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.950
 even legendary this is a medium 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.190
 fast more or less because type 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.209
 in my case I have already passed about 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.340
 an hour of time and as I said I have not 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.440
 but found two pieces of 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.220
 rare blue armor they gave me 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.230
 some light points therefore not 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.450
 enough to get me up to 21 for 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.459
 example then the video in the article 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.590
 original 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.630
 the guy who made this video has 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.760
 said that more or less leveled for 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.760
 one hour or one hour and a half two hours e 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.069
 he had so much stuff in the nel 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.480
 description I leave the link to the article 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.430
 original so you can check it up 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.209
 cona which 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:25.650
 and now here I am just at the beginning therefore 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.650
 eight dead and soon skipper or al 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.850
 next step what else is there from 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.550
 say and if you feel like decree later 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.660
 an hour frankly I got tired and 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.580
 this method 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.350
 after an hour he starts giving his 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.530
 fruits I will tell you yes I started a 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.460
 pick up some stuff though later 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.840
 an hour so that maybe he can 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.370
 come to us and kill the 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.139
 Slaves, you can use yours 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.699
 grenade special bomber skills all 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.740
 whatever you like 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.180
 and it is also a good way to make money 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.970
 experience points actually believe 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.030
 your weapons and armor and skills 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.610
 Special 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:10.360
 here is that we are a little further on 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.870
 time and as you see there is a little more there is a 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.699
 a lot of stuff in many objects 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:22.260
 greenish not common and few rare as already 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.580
 having said this it changes according to 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.590
 it would seem that it changes according to the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.630
 level of the crypt arca and also al 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.639
 your level and above all to the 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.419
 difficulties you choose then if you are 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.690
 together 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:37.630
 you can choose my father level 12 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.360
 of this mission and you are fine 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.509
 in case you had to kill all the 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.020
 knights and the mission should 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.120
 continue 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.530
 enough that she returned to the orbit of 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.539
 select the mission and you will leave 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.270
 shortly before this door 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.940
 so no problem is even when 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.410
 kill everyone collect the objects 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.220
 returned to orbit and when to recharge 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.340
 network the mission you will find yourself today 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.270
 you will find in the shortly before this 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.070
 mission 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.070
 here is where I finished more or less 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:20.930
 as we can see that unfortunately we are so 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:24.650
 green stuff and then another I saw a 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.300
 another video of another boy who me 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.740
 they gave this method and he too has 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.920
 said of abuse bad luck I have not found 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.080
 no one legendary ingram 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.090
 no legendary objects while others 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.180
 her friends after about half an hour pussy and 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.650
 have begun to appear in objects 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.930
 legendary then legendary engravings 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.080
 depends a little on your luck and da 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.740
 overall level of yours 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.430
 characters and the crypt than to what 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.740
 apparently 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.220
 let me know if this method works 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:59.420
 for you if I have not been clear in 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:02.530
 ask for something in the comments and thanks 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.530
 to the next
