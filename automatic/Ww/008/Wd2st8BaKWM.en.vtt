00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.629
 In today's video I introduce you two 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.760
 exercises 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.880
 which helped me a lot 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.099
 mobility of the squat of the lowest 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 point of the squat is the absolute 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.119
 hardest point and there tend the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 people to collapse 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.519
 in which the knees come inside and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 the hip has too little space or that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.920
 heels take off due to a 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 shortening for example from the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.329
 Achilles tendon 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.579
 that could give more reasons and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 with these two exercises we simulate 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.399
 simply the lowest point after the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 Exercise number one sought the stand one 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.750
 normal chooses in the squat 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 hip width to shoulder width represents the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.379
 feet hinwil the normal makes about 30 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.539
 degrees outward then goes down and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.149
 Now press your elbows to yours 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.090
 kneel inside so that the knee is behind 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.510
 be pushed outside at exercise number 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.100
 two equals the same 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 wide as in the normal squat 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.659
 the feet push her again 30 degrees 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.030
 outside like normal citizens do 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.729
 just now we have a weight 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 on the front of the thigh 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.729
 Normally , animal would not go down like this 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.040
 come with one to one too 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.509
 upright position since we, however 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.700
 a counterweight on ours 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.490
 thighs we have one 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.520
 counterbalance that it balances us 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.250
 so are able to be extremely upright in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.840
 the lowest position of the squat 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.200
 come down 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 this position represents the lowest 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.320
 point as the lowest caste as I said 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.390
 the hardest part 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.970
 you will strat an extreme strat 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.670
 feel and I think that a lot 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.230
 people benefit from this mobility 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.300
 become 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.490
 I had an extremist at the beginning 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.500
 You are already watching for it here 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.660
 outside as usual also push upwards 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.350
 would weight on the thighs 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.880
 and this position over tests it 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.870
 Give me feedback and then it works out 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.870
 also with your kneebug
