00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.860
 welcome to the tutorial this time we will see 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.379
 how to flip two systems on a usb 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.480
 we will occupy the johnny program and the two 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.210
 or more systems that we will install in the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.619
 description I will leave the program we accept 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.050
 the condition terms and 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.180
 we select the usb now we look for the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.810
 system that we are going to install in my case 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.810
 difficult acz 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.730
 now we are looking for the first one made this 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.340
 process takes between 10 to 15 minutes like this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.890
 that you have to be patient in the video 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.960
 will be in fast camera because if not the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.960
 video would be very long 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 two 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 ok press next and we give you that if 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 now we look for the usb that previously 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.250
 we turn we select the system 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.250
 operative in my case cali 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.520
 ok now we look for the iso and what 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.679
 we select 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.179
 we press next and let the 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.549
 program do your job 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.049
 this time it will take a little longer but 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.049
 I'll leave it in quick camera 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.659
 yes 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.710
 ok we press next and if 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.840
 we would like another system we go back to 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.820
 repeat the process but in this case already 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.320
 I'm going to close the program and check that 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.320
 I can start with the two systems 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.780
 now we move to the pc from the gods in 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.420
 my case the pc puts the boot menu 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.700
 with efe 12 depending on your pc is like 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.650
 will start this menu select the usb and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.600
 this menu will appear 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.910
 system tools and the system with which 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.160
 we want to start in my difficult case acz 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.380
 and as it looks it starts correctly 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.570
 to show that it works restart the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.970
 pc and start with cali which works 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.070
 equal to good perfection I do not have left 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.140

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.540
