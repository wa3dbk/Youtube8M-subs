00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 the limited edition of destiny first 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.180
 away in the basket 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.160
 and then we see that too 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 packaging in all its splendor 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.330
 wonderfully tall, too, I have 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.869
 16 all this on the side just that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.520
 destiny logo back we see one 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.010
 nice survey what us all the same 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750
 expect the right content and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.689

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.509

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.040
 times arrive, the film has all gone 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.200
 beautifully packed no delle in it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 nothing at all so thanks to Amazon 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.530
 for this beautiful packaging must 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.390
 You also say that because there is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.520
 but some suppliers are degenerating 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.070
 package somehow as if they had it 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.720
 played football so that always help 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.640
 otherwise I could not go down there 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.369
 with the thing and there we have already 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.009
 the packaging finally good in front of us 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.270
 this cardboard slip out times the need 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.200
 I'm not here to see you here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.000

 bit shiny off with it 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.189
 Exactly and now we finally have this 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 beautiful packaging in front of us above 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.869
 test the logo is not marked that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.670
 is up raised sublime how do you say 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.920
 In any case , a bit stings 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.149
 out here around us we're cluttering 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.849
 see these little ones here 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.099
 world maps or these lines that 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.620
 Things are a little bit worse than we feel 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.330
 please have magnetic behind here so 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.220
 the small saying the whole 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.599
 English so not translated 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 into German there is one 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.569
 Packaging for the whole EU not easy 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.010
 Of course the dealbook is included 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.000
 simple but elegant is just 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.599
 and here is the indian jones book 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.610
 just times 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.739
 otherwise there is nothing great in there 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.180
 In any case, very thick cardboard so 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.500
 nothing at first 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.239
 windfall already coincides 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.340
 I would say we look at each other as 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.310
 the first time we put the book on 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.900
 Script was on the side and gave birth to Maria 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.730
 sks please hand something to do 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.290
 the pact is now there because the thing 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.760
 out and meanwhile we look at each other now 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.040
 just read the little book 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.170
 what is there in there everything on it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.330
 In general, the feel is very high 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.190
 very high quality we have weapons here 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.670
 and equipment that is really one 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.129
 manual there I would many many 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.720
 more games would be so difficult 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.879
 give oneself or the developers or the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.620
 publisher and then it's just this 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.500
 detailed instructions make you 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.709
 really every weapon explains that in the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.690
 Game in it is magazine capacity weight 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.940
 fire rate everything is beautiful 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.129
 but not only deposited the weapons 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.930
 have been taken exactly without the magnifying glass 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.760
 but also the different races 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930
 which you will meet then you will see here 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.879
 we also have a bit of what in the bunch and 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.230
 the faber hammer also in there so from 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.120
 sniper rifle or are really 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.379
 high resolution pictures it is not a war 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.879
 here we are the different ones 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.629
 equipment different clothes what 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.760
 you can do it 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.590
 the different ways how to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 can shape his character is 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.489
 everything wonderful explains little place 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.890
 you also have to take notes for that 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.349
 but not everything with it 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.000
 Included in the limited edition is the 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.970
 extension pass I have looked 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.470
 at the Playstation 3 the thing costs 35 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.290
 euro if you should buy yourself 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.939
 then there are four postcards that are included 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.620
 are real postcards too 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.689
 stable from the venus for example though 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.569
 You say I was on vacation because I was 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.010
 was on the venus vacation 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.110
 I'll show you the same 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.269
 one from the back side of the shows 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.799
 times why the thing is there around 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.350
 that's what you can do in the back 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.060
 we see up here postcard above can 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.160
 there is a stamp and something reinheim 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.989
 So you 're not just 15 boxes 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.610
 but really nicely detailed 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.330
 designed so we have one more 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.680
 personal 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.930
 so that you know what we are on 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.970
 in the future may be happy here namely 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.340
 soldier it goes into the war so what 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.750
 we still that is a poster at the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.240
 posters the paper is what all 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.189
 special is so wax paper summarizes 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.169
 very strange 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.580
 but makes a really total 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.840
 high quality impression 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.819
 So you see that's nothing 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.680
 This is a bit dull and shiny 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.330
 You only achieve that through growth 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.490
 Paper is hard to describe 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.490
 you really have time in the fingerboard but 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.349
 Altogether really high quality 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.969
 high-quality extremely exactly there is still missing 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.289
 what is the dealbook if I have it 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.389
 almost folded the team 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.500
 without us that the castle rooms to watch 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.300
 It's over there very quickly 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.440
 have space here and then 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.840
 Let's have a look together 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.069
 Steelbook to the castle that's easy 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.110
 tinplate because completely just commerzbank 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.330
 just fine in gray again 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.590
 with the destiny logo and this strip 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.770
 which we also see on the world map 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.719
 now the spindle destiny at the 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.889
 side on this ugly that is 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.430
 really the ugliest can 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.740
 pack 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.960
 it has been good this xbox sticker 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.949
 we have a code for a bit 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.419
 bonus content 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.789
 because we have that through 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.669
 Consider the bonus content thing is 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.879
 a spaceship spaceship is in there 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.430
 a special child then we have for 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:43.680
 our spirit in particular skin and a 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.180
 special badge 3 short in there 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.430
 I still had a fourth code 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.120
 namely for an Amazon because I 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.770
 preorder 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.779
 I am relatively early 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.900
 so let's have a look at the 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.759
 inside always so evil galaxy very much 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.930
 simple but not so 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.759
 that I would say that works 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.379
 was boring or so del was god thank you 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.009
 no in it that was right 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.690
 annoying 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.669
 We put everything together first 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.360
 to get a complete overview of the whole 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.009
 get packet 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.009
 So we have in the limited edition 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.270
 we have the dealbook in it of course 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.370
 with the blu-ray we have the 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.289
 expansion pack in there with the two 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.949
 Enhancements packages coming soon 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.830

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:23.789
 we have download content inside for 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.980
 a spaceship and a badge and a 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:30.040
 skin for our spirit there is still something missing 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.330
 Yes, good personal is hard to find 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.160
 So the puck they have really good 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.420
 attacked because everything looks beautiful does he 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.070
 namely have again killed the 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.570
 book but in there with the poster 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.770
 there's still something missing 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.390
 equipment list may not be missing 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.070
 I have to say for the manual alone 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.240
 clearly up for bungie you have 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.440

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.000
 I am very happy with it 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.440
 kukksi is also happy with that 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.390
 I am also satisfied and I am 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.710
 hope you just stop this unboxing cheap 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.690
 made fun if it should be so 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.100
 realize that very clearly upwards
