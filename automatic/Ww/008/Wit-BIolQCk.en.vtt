of<00:00:46.469> using<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> electricity<00:00:47.340> moving<00:00:47.670> we'll

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
of using the electricity moving we'll

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.940 
of using the electricity moving we'll
have<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.390> we're<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> put<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.710> tray

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
bit of debris from outside rather than

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.199 
bit of debris from outside rather than
turn<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.170> my<00:02:29.410> stove<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.890> using<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:31.120> know

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the energy that I pay for so I look at

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.090 
the energy that I pay for so I look at
it<00:02:35.770> as<00:02:35.950> if<00:02:36.490> if<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.209> thing<00:02:37.420> saves<00:02:37.720> me<00:02:38.100> five

dollars a day from cooking outside on it
a<00:02:42.820> couple<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.060> times<00:02:43.300> instead<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.050> having<00:02:44.170> to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
a couple of times instead of having to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.720 
a couple of times instead of having to
turn<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.530> stove<00:02:44.739> on<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.160> saves<00:02:45.340> me<00:02:45.550> five

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
bucks a day then after 30 days of using

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.090 
bucks a day then after 30 days of using
it<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.300> paid<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:49.510> itself<00:02:49.959> that's<00:02:50.950> how<00:02:51.070> I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
it it's paid for itself that's how I

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.000 
it it's paid for itself that's how I
like<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.430> look<00:02:51.550> at<00:02:51.700> things<00:02:52.680> because<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:53.860> not

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
like to look at things because I'm not

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.470

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
doing anything except building a fire

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.150 
doing anything except building a fire
and<00:02:55.810> using<00:02:56.170> what's<00:02:56.380> laying<00:02:56.680> around<00:02:56.800> on<00:02:57.070> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
ground leaves and twigs and sticks and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.110 
ground leaves and twigs and sticks and
and<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.980> know<00:03:00.070> dried<00:03:00.340> goat<00:03:00.580> poop<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.060> stuff

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
and you know dried goat poop and stuff

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360 
and you know dried goat poop and stuff
like<00:03:01.330> that<00:03:01.510> anything<00:03:01.810> that's<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.260> biomass<00:03:02.800> will

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
like that anything that's a biomass will

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.370 
like that anything that's a biomass will
burn<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:04.030> that's<00:03:04.480> how<00:03:04.630> I'm<00:03:04.720> that's<00:03:05.019> how<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.170> use

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
burn so that's how I'm that's how I use

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.860 
burn so that's how I'm that's how I use
it<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.620> that's<00:03:05.709> why<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:05.950> use<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.370> often

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it and that's why I use it so often

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.840 
it and that's why I use it so often
because<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.920> more<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.190> use<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.610> more<00:03:09.640> it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
because the more you use it the more it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.000 
because the more you use it the more it
saves<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:11.350> sooner<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.860> pays

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
saves you and the sooner that it pays

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.920 
saves you and the sooner that it pays
for<00:03:12.040> itself<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:13.420> can<00:03:13.540> see<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.780> going

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
for itself so you can see it's going

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.650 
for itself so you can see it's going
right<00:03:14.140> there<00:03:14.320> right<00:03:14.500> now<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:15.510> we're<00:03:16.510> going<00:03:16.630> to

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
right there right now and we're going to

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.150 
right there right now and we're going to
get<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.840> walk<00:03:16.989> out<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.380> some<00:03:17.560> oil<00:03:17.709> going

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
get to walk out and get some oil going

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.789 
get to walk out and get some oil going
and<00:03:18.340> once<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> oil<00:03:18.760> gets<00:03:19.090> hot<00:03:19.239> then<00:03:19.540> we'll<00:03:19.799> see

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
and once the oil gets hot then we'll see

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.550 
and once the oil gets hot then we'll see
if<00:03:20.860> we<00:03:20.890> can't<00:03:21.130> get<00:03:21.280> some<00:03:21.690> rice<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.930> puff<00:03:23.140> up<00:03:23.320> for

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
quite sure what the temperature is

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.420 
quite sure what the temperature is
supposed<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.650> on<00:03:44.770> this<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.099> mean<00:03:45.220> there's

every video that I've seen all the
research<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:46.959> everybody<00:03:47.410> had<00:03:47.530> different

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
research that everybody had different

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.860 
research that everybody had different
temperatures<00:03:48.190> but<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:48.970> want<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.300> hot<00:03:49.599> oil

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
temperatures but you want really hot oil

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.620 
temperatures but you want really hot oil
so<00:03:50.410> get<00:03:50.830> your<00:03:50.950> oil<00:03:51.069> about<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.550> don't<00:03:51.640> know<00:03:51.819> 4,000

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
so get your oil about I don't know 4,000

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.449
