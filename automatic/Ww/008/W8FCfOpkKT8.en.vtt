00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.960
 not running away just need to find the nearest 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.150
 settlement 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.040

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.470
 all the inhabitants only maybe they were not 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.750
 ready true even a little in on 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.379

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.330
 my house has obviously been looted and you 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.960
 you may not even think that I will hide 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.449
 in a cave like some child 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.580
 agree hope we can urinate 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:00.220
 many city everything you do 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.760
 the ripper sound should be warned for 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.190

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.740

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.500

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.820

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.670
 we are doing it now and I remember 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.420

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.350
 you know yourself it is very difficult to go through 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.020
 the jungle even the golem will have problems 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.470
 Why am I saying that you can not take 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.009
 pig must be left here with what it 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.250
 you took 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.590

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.619
 traps and heaps of monsters yes you 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:11.790
 exaggerating the jungle is not the same 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.900

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.900
 well goodbye 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.580
 there is no stand that is not our problem to 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:49.430
 better go go Galin 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.780
 so you mean never been joe black 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.319
 olives and villages were jungle well how 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.370
 jungle 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:02.720
 rather, it was a forest I used to catch chicken there 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.420
 collected apples well then everything is clear to me 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.160
 because the jungle is completely different 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.870
 a place 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.970
 terrible things can happen here i 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.760
 already experienced something so and that somehow 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.459
 long lived in the city, our team performed 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.430
 various tasks all you got we 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.790
 divided among themselves once we were sent 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.090
 catch that fucking ocelot cat yeah 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.060
 we ran through the jungle all dense already 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.069
 three days we tried to find at least one 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.690
 but then we found the temple 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.880
 one of our ran first all wanted 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.370
 find treasure 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:50.080
 and how do you think the arrow is straight in the face 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.780
 dead place is not a pity 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.570
 I would nâ€™t want to be careful 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.570
 putting an arrow between the eyes is for sure 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.079
 Steve 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:24.300
