00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
it i like it looks different but looks

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.740 
it i like it looks different but looks
quite<00:01:53.310> cheap<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.149> makes<00:01:54.270> any<00:01:54.329> sense<00:01:54.450> i

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
quite cheap if that makes any sense i

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
quite cheap if that makes any sense i
don't<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.369> approach

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
don't know if that's the right approach

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
don't know if that's the right approach
but<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.479> feels<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.140> bit

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
but it just feels like it's a little bit

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.690 
but it just feels like it's a little bit
cheap<00:01:58.560> oh<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.159> might<00:01:59.310> notice<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> little

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
cheap oh so you might notice a little
