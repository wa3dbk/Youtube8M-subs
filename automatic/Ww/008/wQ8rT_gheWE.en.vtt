00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
out when I started to get pretty big

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.660 
out when I started to get pretty big
thing<00:00:51.019> goes<00:00:51.289> over<00:00:51.499> 2,000<00:00:51.920> subscribers<00:00:52.039> I<00:00:52.489> put

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
thing goes over 2,000 subscribers I put

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.739 
thing goes over 2,000 subscribers I put
this<00:00:52.760> out<00:00:52.940> for<00:00:54.159> but<00:00:55.159> ok<00:00:55.190> this<00:00:55.909> has<00:00:56.089> over<00:00:56.329> 900

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
this out for but ok this has over 900

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:57.849 
this out for but ok this has over 900
horsepower<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.289> there's<00:00:57.440> a<00:00:57.499> reason<00:00:57.589> for<00:00:57.769> that

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
horsepower and there's a reason for that

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.919 
horsepower and there's a reason for that
it's<00:00:58.129> because<00:00:58.519> i'm<00:00:58.969> driving<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.449> truck<00:00:59.659> that's

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
it's because i'm driving a truck that's

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.560 
it's because i'm driving a truck that's
why<00:01:01.569> so<00:01:02.569> I<00:01:02.600> broke<00:01:02.870> my<00:01:03.129> 650<00:01:04.129> horsepower<00:01:04.550> rule<00:01:04.940> I

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
why so I broke my 650 horsepower rule I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.540 
why so I broke my 650 horsepower rule I
still<00:01:06.140> running<00:01:06.440> I<00:01:06.500> think<00:01:06.710> stock<00:01:06.950> tires<00:01:07.220> i

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
still running I think stock tires i

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.770 
still running I think stock tires i
don't<00:01:07.729> know<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.030> tire<00:01:08.210> width<00:01:08.420> or<00:01:08.570> whatever

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
don't know the tire width or whatever

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.440 
don't know the tire width or whatever
small<00:01:09.710> tires<00:01:09.979> because<00:01:10.250> i<00:01:10.430> don't<00:01:10.820> like<00:01:10.909> trucks

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
small tires because i don't like trucks

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.170 
small tires because i don't like trucks
with<00:01:11.630> huge<00:01:11.930> wheels<00:01:12.229> especially<00:01:12.909> when<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:13.939> see

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
with huge wheels especially when I see

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.910 
with huge wheels especially when I see
people<00:01:14.210> running<00:01:14.479> this<00:01:15.049> Raptor<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:15.560> online

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
people running this Raptor and online

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.440 
people running this Raptor and online
lobbies<00:01:16.310> do<00:01:16.399> usually<00:01:16.520> running<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.270> wheels

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
lobbies do usually running it the wheels

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.580

as big as it can go and it looks

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.270 
as big as it can go and it looks
ridiculous<00:01:18.729> so<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.759> kept<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.299> stock<00:01:20.659> wheel<00:01:21.280> size

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
ridiculous so I kept it stock wheel size

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.749 
ridiculous so I kept it stock wheel size
but<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.149> gonna<00:01:23.450> hinder<00:01:23.750> me<00:01:24.310> because<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.549> don't

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
tire wall there we go I'm retarded um so

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.590 
tire wall there we go I'm retarded um so
it's<00:01:55.100> it's<00:01:55.399> definitely<00:01:55.969> hindering<00:01:56.420> the

is<00:01:59.719> this<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.380> actually<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> lot<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.130> fun<00:02:01.369> and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
is this is actually a lot of fun and

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.139 
is this is actually a lot of fun and
really<00:02:02.090> really<00:02:02.719> good<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:04.219> Raptor<00:02:04.579> is<00:02:04.609> super

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
cars have lots and lots of grip and then

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.370 
cars have lots and lots of grip and then
the<00:02:31.750> power<00:02:32.580> overcomes<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.760> grip<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the power overcomes that grip and you

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.410 
the power overcomes that grip and you
know<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.560> you're<00:02:36.310> always<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.790> kind<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.210> in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
just feels out of control but it's fun I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.680 
just feels out of control but it's fun I
do<00:02:41.380> enjoy<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.650> little<00:02:44.920> floppy<00:02:45.690> you

know<00:02:46.780> that's<00:02:46.960> a<00:02:47.050> con<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.590> does<00:02:47.710> add<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.100> its

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
know that's a con but it does add to its

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.510 
know that's a con but it does add to its
stability<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:50.590> car<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:50.920> super<00:02:51.250> fun<00:02:51.430> to

guys some sort of thing where like you
can<00:03:08.890> see<00:03:09.040> how<00:03:09.160> I'm<00:03:09.310> comparing<00:03:09.670> against<00:03:10.000> other

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
can see how I'm comparing against other

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.230 
can see how I'm comparing against other
other<00:03:10.420> people<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:12.730> not<00:03:12.940> just<00:03:13.090> me

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
other people and it's not just me

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.850 
other people and it's not just me
drifting<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.720> same<00:03:13.870> track<00:03:14.170> every<00:03:15.010> day<00:03:15.490> so

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
drifting on the same track every day so

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.910 
drifting on the same track every day so
yeah<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:19.780> not<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.080> pretty<00:03:20.260> decent<00:03:20.709> points

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
yeah so it's not a pretty decent points

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.650 
yeah so it's not a pretty decent points
car<00:03:21.100> it's<00:03:21.310> not<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.910> best<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.510> world

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
car it's not like the best in the world

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.640 
car it's not like the best in the world
because<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.020> doesn't<00:03:23.200> have<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.410> much<00:03:23.590> power

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
because it doesn't have that much power

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.100 
because it doesn't have that much power
when<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.670> put<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:25.000> power-to-weight<00:03:25.360> but

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
when you put like power-to-weight but

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.390 
when you put like power-to-weight but
it's<00:03:26.230> definitely<00:03:26.350> fun<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.740> drive<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.160> its

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
it's definitely fun to drive and its

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.310 
it's definitely fun to drive and its
speed<00:03:27.730> won't<00:03:27.910> matter<00:03:28.209> if<00:03:28.450> you're<00:03:28.600> not<00:03:28.690> tan

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
speed won't matter if you're not tan

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.440 
speed won't matter if you're not tan

around here and I really just I lost

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.520 
around here and I really just I lost
myself<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.450> just<00:03:34.480> driving<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.020> was<00:03:35.260> really

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
myself and just driving it was really

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.310 
myself and just driving it was really
fun<00:03:35.940> very<00:03:36.940> very<00:03:37.240> smooth<00:03:37.630> actually<00:03:38.080> really

easy<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.650> handle<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.459> only<00:03:39.550> issues<00:03:39.850> I<00:03:40.000> think<00:03:40.030> I

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
easy to handle the only issues I think I

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.390 
easy to handle the only issues I think I
have<00:03:40.420> with<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.630> it's<00:03:41.230> slow<00:03:41.620> but<00:03:41.890> it's<00:03:41.950> that's
