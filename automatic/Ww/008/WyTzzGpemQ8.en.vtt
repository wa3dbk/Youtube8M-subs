and since then it's been growing like
gangbusters<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.310> we're<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.000> getting<00:01:33.329> more

some point in the next couple of months
it<00:01:45.119> will<00:01:45.509> presumably<00:01:46.229> start<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> bloom<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

inches across with pretty yellow stamen
and<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.479> might<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.350> few<00:01:58.560> months

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
and that might go on for a few months

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
and that might go on for a few months
then<00:02:00.149> it'll<00:02:00.420> hopefully<00:02:00.659> set<00:02:01.350> seed<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:02.100> will

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
then it'll hopefully set seed which will

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.410 
then it'll hopefully set seed which will
have<00:02:02.820> available<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.479> people<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.369> sadly

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
have available for people and sadly

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
these plants only bloom once by next

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
these plants only bloom once by next
