because he has a low salary for the
trade<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> work<00:00:30.869> we'd<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> blow<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.769> out

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
trade to work we'd have to blow it out

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
trade to work we'd have to blow it out
of<00:00:31.890> proportion<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> point<00:00:33.120> where<00:00:33.270> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
of proportion to the point where it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.670 
of proportion to the point where it
wouldn't<00:00:33.570> even<00:00:33.630> make<00:00:33.930> any<00:00:34.110> sense

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
wouldn't even make any sense

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.130 
wouldn't even make any sense
