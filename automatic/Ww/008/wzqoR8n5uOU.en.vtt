00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.850
 ah 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.160
 where are we at a care strap that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.630
 they work and it's good to collect their 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 impressions what has seemed 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.169
 the heart tournament and what is what 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.749
 you think these days already on the straight 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.970
 end of acapulco is always sad how 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.260
 this day arrives on the last day although all 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.510
 we are very excited to see the final 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 but to know that we ran out of the week and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.510
 you have to wait another year for 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 to have the Mexican open again 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.529
 tennis in acapulco is sad but good 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.689
 We have been very happy working 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 this week and the truth educates that at 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.140
 final the most important thing is the reaction 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.710
 of the public that is badly behaved 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 wonder this year because decided the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 pleasant when what you consider the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.750
 pleasant surprise and disappointment not this 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.520
 tournament good the exception is that we are 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.200
 has gone maria sharapova we do not know that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.410
 it was a matter of discomfort 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.210
 stomach but a lot of people stayed with 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.130
 want to see her and see her reach the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.690
 final that was the big favorite that I 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.900
 I think it would be like the sad part and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.900
 lamentable and the ones and what is the other the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.190
 surprise 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.780
 but not so surprise kei nishikori that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.910
 it's surprise because I had not had 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.350
 participation in acapulco and that is 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.060
 reaching up to those instances is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.620
 wonderful but also not so 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.260
 surprise because we know he is a young 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.210
 that is pushing hard that is 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.800
 inside the 'top ten' that he parked 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.200
 wonder so I think it's one of the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.330
 talents to follow for the next years 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 that says something that would look for you is to improve 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.240
 in this tournament that day for the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 next year in terms of organization 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.170
 security there is something we take for 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.720
 hundred is that you need to improve not 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.550
 I think that just like the kitchen 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.680
 good dishes are made to fire 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.229
 slow and this tournament has been growing year 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.630
 year and it has been reflected in the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.970
 audience and in from now around 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.280
 how many numbers of sponsors do we have 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 I think they have managed to handle it very 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 well and surely for next year 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.190
 will bring us more surprises with names 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.450
 new talents all players of 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.490
 talented tennis players who will come the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.350
 next year so I think it's going well not 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.250
 I would change anything very well many 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.250
 Thanks, thanks to you
