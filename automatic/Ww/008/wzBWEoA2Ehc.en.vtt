 tweets still serve us with the 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.809
 jailbreak of ios 7 but with the passage of 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.460
 and while these are going to be pouring a 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.320
 little by little but good let's start 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.330
 first of all regulations that what 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.920
 we are going to need number one we need 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.049
 that our ipad or iphone or ipad not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.850
 have a lock code if you have a 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.440
 lock code is now when what 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.089
 they must remove number 2 from 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.820
 preference to our ai device have the 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.769
 battery charged to 100% and number 3 we go 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.260
 to need the jailbreak tool 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.479
 is and you see jones 7 that right now I'm going to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 show how to download it and how to install it 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.260
 for this we are going to go to there version 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 dotcom plan or with a 0 the link is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.590
 that under the description here we are going to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.689
 choose which operating system we have 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.780
 or if we have a frame we have windows in 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.390
 this case is a mac we click 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.220
 will show us a mega link if it is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.020
 they are stuck in this part so 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.880
 not start anything mega move all 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.770
 What we are going to do is go to the little arrow 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.810
 update or free and on the keyboard 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.690
 let's leave the control key 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.369
 tight and we click on the little arrow 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.670
 so that we open another tab 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.619
 in another tab and will load if you do not 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.810
 serves the control key try queue 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.700
 of alt if it does not work with the alt 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.659
 try with the chip any of 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 the three will serve 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.960
 then we download we hope that 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960
 get off 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.980
 we tell you where we want the file 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.600
 I want on the desk because what 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.280
 we have just in case the doubts we are going to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.230
 make a backup of our ai device and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.510
 for this we go to itunes to make sure 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.920
 have the latest version on this side go 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.410
 to find your there device in this case 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.820
 it's an iphone you click on this part 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.830
 in backups in Spanish they will find it 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.360
 as backups to choose if they want a 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 backup in icloud or on this computer 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.600
 I recommend them to be this 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.950
 computer to make it faster 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.510
 then we are going to click here on 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.850
 backup and now spanish are going to find it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.680
 how to support now it is possible that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.780
 they find this message where they 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.459
 says they have not transferred the apps in 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.220
 your backup then we click on 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.450
 backup we hope to be backed up and 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.770
 that the endorsement of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 our former vice 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.310
 we are going to open the file that we downloaded 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.170

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.410

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.239
 Open or open in Spanish where we put 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.250

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.989
 of jailbreak at this moment we should 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.209
 make sure that our air is low 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.640
 ipod iphone or ipad is connected to 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.860
