here<00:01:03.579> is<00:01:03.789> your<00:01:04.000> actual<00:01:04.269> piano<00:01:04.509> passcode<00:01:05.049> the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
here is your actual piano passcode the

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.710 
here is your actual piano passcode the
numbers<00:01:06.039> correspond<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.119> keys<00:01:07.360> on<00:01:07.690> the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
numbers correspond to the keys on the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.859 
numbers correspond to the keys on the
keyboard<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.440> this<00:01:08.830> one<00:01:09.009> is<00:01:09.100> 1<00:01:09.250> 2<00:01:09.399> 3<00:01:09.430> 4<00:01:09.610> 5<00:01:09.880> 6<00:01:10.240> 7<00:01:10.570> by

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
keyboard so this one is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 by

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.749 
keyboard so this one is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 by
default<00:01:11.289> so<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:11.979> kind<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.280> have<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.490> if

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
default so you kind of have to if

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.370 
default so you kind of have to if
there's<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.180> specific<00:01:13.420> tune<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.110> want<00:01:14.320> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.620 
there's a specific tune that you want to
play<00:01:14.590> obviously<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.490> need<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.789> know<00:01:16.060> which

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
play obviously you need to know which

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.910 
play obviously you need to know which
number<00:01:17.020> corresponds<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.770> which<00:01:17.979> key<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.470> you

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
number corresponds to which key so you

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.440 
number corresponds to which key so you
can<00:01:21.100> set<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.819> up<00:01:21.880> however<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.360> want
