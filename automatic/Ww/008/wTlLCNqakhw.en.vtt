00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.290 
away from my face for you
one<00:00:05.690> look<00:00:06.290> out<00:00:09.370> the<00:00:10.370> gun<00:00:10.580> tank<00:00:10.790> can<00:00:10.970> break<00:00:11.150> up

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
one look out the gun tank can break up

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.850 
one look out the gun tank can break up
the<00:00:11.450> enemy's<00:00:11.750> offensive<00:00:12.200> line<00:00:12.410> which<00:00:12.710> will

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
the enemy's offensive line which will

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.650 
the enemy's offensive line which will
make<00:00:12.980> it<00:00:13.010> easier<00:00:13.490> for<00:00:13.549> white<00:00:13.850> base<00:00:14.059> to<00:00:14.270> defend

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
make it easier for white base to defend

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.630 
make it easier for white base to defend
itself<00:00:15.020> you<00:00:15.440> just<00:00:15.680> worry<00:00:15.920> about<00:00:15.980> shooting<00:00:16.400> as

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
itself you just worry about shooting as

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.490 
itself you just worry about shooting as
many<00:00:16.789> planes<00:00:17.090> as<00:00:17.240> possible<00:00:20.170> I<00:00:22.930> only<00:00:23.930> hit<00:00:24.230> one

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
many planes as possible I only hit one

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.410 
many planes as possible I only hit one
plane<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.220> impossible<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.030> shoot<00:00:26.240> down

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
plane it's impossible to shoot down

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.520 
plane it's impossible to shoot down
these<00:00:26.630> planes<00:00:26.930> without<00:00:27.110> the<00:00:27.380> use<00:00:27.500> of

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
these planes without the use of

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:36.189 
these planes without the use of
anti-aircraft<00:00:28.100> gun

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.980 

Gela<00:00:37.199> techniques

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.340 

maybe<00:00:42.830> he'll<00:00:43.190> be<00:00:43.340> easier<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:43.910> fight<00:00:44.120> alone<00:00:44.420> all

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
maybe he'll be easier to fight alone all

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.670 
maybe he'll be easier to fight alone all
right

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
right

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.680 
right
he<00:00:45.830> let<00:00:45.980> Kai<00:00:46.220> or<00:00:46.430> Sayla<00:00:46.700> operate<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.270> gun<00:00:47.420> tank

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
he let Kai or Sayla operate the gun tank

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.670 
he let Kai or Sayla operate the gun tank
and<00:00:47.810> give<00:00:47.930> us<00:00:48.050> some<00:00:48.200> cover

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
and give us some cover

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.640 
and give us some cover
I<00:00:48.710> think<00:00:49.280> Sayla<00:00:49.610> can<00:00:49.880> handle<00:00:50.239> it

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.520 

hold<00:00:55.580> on<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.850> moment<00:00:56.090> standby<00:00:56.840> until<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.320> gun

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
hold on a moment standby until the gun

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.090 
hold on a moment standby until the gun
tanks<00:00:57.980> been<00:00:58.160> launched<00:00:58.780> huh<00:00:59.780> they<00:01:00.560> hurry<00:01:00.920> you
