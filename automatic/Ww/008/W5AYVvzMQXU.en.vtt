close<00:02:20.420> urban<00:02:20.870> combat<00:02:21.140> Susan<00:02:21.740> be<00:02:21.800> kind<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.040> like

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
close urban combat Susan be kind of like

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.880 
close urban combat Susan be kind of like
how<00:02:22.370> close<00:02:22.550> quarters<00:02:22.970> was<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.300> battlefield<00:02:23.750> 3

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
how close quarters was in battlefield 3

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
how close quarters was in battlefield 3
so<00:02:24.890> these<00:02:25.310> these<00:02:25.700> map<00:02:25.940> names<00:02:26.240> make<00:02:26.510> me<00:02:26.630> think

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
so these these map names make me think

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.720 
so these these map names make me think
they're<00:02:27.020> going<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> be<00:02:27.350> very<00:02:27.650> tight<00:02:28.250> quarter

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
they're going to be very tight quarter

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.930 
they're going to be very tight quarter
style<00:02:29.630> maps<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:31.220> going<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.460> a<00:02:31.490> shotgun

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
style maps it's going to be a shotgun

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.720 
style maps it's going to be a shotgun
frenzy<00:02:32.360> I'm<00:02:32.540> sure<00:02:33.070> but<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.160> probably<00:02:34.190> more

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
frenzy I'm sure but it's probably more

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.290 
frenzy I'm sure but it's probably more
so<00:02:35.060> based<00:02:35.330> around<00:02:35.890> how<00:02:36.890> China<00:02:37.220> city<00:02:37.520> the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
so based around how China city the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.750 
so based around how China city the
Chinese<00:02:38.780> cities<00:02:39.140> are<00:02:39.350> kind<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.710> mapped<00:02:40.550> out

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
Chinese cities are kind of mapped out

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.970 
Chinese cities are kind of mapped out
there<00:02:41.060> very<00:02:41.090> tight<00:02:41.690> they're<00:02:42.440> all<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.740> top<00:02:42.950> of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
there very tight they're all on top of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.890 
there very tight they're all on top of
each<00:02:43.160> other<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:44.180> very<00:02:44.300> interesting<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.810> see

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
each other so be very interesting to see

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.190 
each other so be very interesting to see
how<00:02:45.080> these<00:02:45.290> go<00:02:45.700> now<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.760> premium<00:02:47.690> release

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
how these go now the premium release

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.400 
sky now Arctic research and sub base are
a<00:03:38.270> little<00:03:38.390> different<00:03:38.570> but<00:03:38.870> Arctic<00:03:39.230> research

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
a little different but Arctic research

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.010 
a little different but Arctic research
also<00:03:39.800> makes<00:03:40.100> me<00:03:40.160> think<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.460> 2142<00:03:41.000> just<00:03:41.750> because

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
also makes me think of 2142 just because

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.220 
also makes me think of 2142 just because
of<00:03:42.260> how<00:03:42.680> 2142<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.850> storyline<00:03:44.420> was<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:44.840> was<00:03:44.960> a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
of how 2142 the storyline was it was a

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.680 
of how 2142 the storyline was it was a
futuristic<00:03:46.220> ice<00:03:46.370> age<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.060> with<00:03:47.300> Arctic

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
futuristic ice age so with Arctic

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.380 
futuristic ice age so with Arctic
research<00:03:48.160> could<00:03:49.160> we<00:03:49.280> have<00:03:49.310> mad<00:03:49.700> scientists

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
research could we have mad scientists

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.760 
research could we have mad scientists
that<00:03:50.510> had<00:03:50.660> done<00:03:50.840> something<00:03:51.110> wrong<00:03:51.350> over<00:03:51.680> in

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
that had done something wrong over in

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.430 
that had done something wrong over in
the<00:03:51.860> Arctic's<00:03:52.220> which<00:03:52.400> caused<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:53.360> this<00:03:54.140> ice

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
the Arctic's which caused this this ice

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.100 
the Arctic's which caused this this ice
age<00:03:54.770> so<00:03:55.670> sub<00:03:55.940> base<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.450> only<00:03:56.600> one<00:03:56.930> that

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
age so sub base is the only one that

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.780 
age so sub base is the only one that
doesn't<00:03:57.650> really<00:03:57.890> fit<00:03:58.100> in<00:03:58.220> with<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.430> storyline

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
doesn't really fit in with a storyline

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.180 
doesn't really fit in with a storyline
of<00:03:58.940> 2142<00:03:59.540> but<00:04:00.440> it'll<00:04:00.590> be<00:04:00.650> interesting<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.100> see

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
of 2142 but it'll be interesting to see

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.160 
of 2142 but it'll be interesting to see
what<00:04:01.340> they<00:04:01.640> do<00:04:01.700> with<00:04:01.850> that<00:04:02.150> now<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.900> release

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.220 
we've had all the DLCs so what do you

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
guys think of that do you feel like they

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.470 
guys think of that do you feel like they
rushed<00:04:18.620> all<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.920> DLCs<00:04:19.340> out<00:04:19.520> so<00:04:19.760> we're<00:04:20.239> kind<00:04:20.420> of

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
rushed all the DLCs out so we're kind of

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480 
rushed all the DLCs out so we're kind of
expecting<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.049> have<00:04:21.170> all<00:04:21.350> these<00:04:21.440> DLCs<00:04:22.010> by<00:04:22.430> the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
expecting to have all these DLCs by the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.120 
expecting to have all these DLCs by the
beginning<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.600> September<00:04:24.170> so<00:04:24.710> it's<00:04:24.830> not<00:04:24.920> even

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
beginning of September so it's not even

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.190 
beginning of September so it's not even
a<00:04:25.190> full<00:04:25.460> year<00:04:25.820> we're<00:04:25.970> looking<00:04:26.240> at<00:04:26.450> almost<00:04:27.020> a

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
a full year we're looking at almost a

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.950 
a full year we're looking at almost a
year<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.880> I'm<00:04:29.060> kind<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.360> disappointed<00:04:29.660> with

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
year and I'm kind of disappointed with

that I was really hoping to have a

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.800 
that I was really hoping to have a
longer<00:04:32.360> lifespan<00:04:32.840> for<00:04:33.440> battle

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810
