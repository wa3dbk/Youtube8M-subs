00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
know if it works on there though the
reason<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> might<00:01:22.110> why<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> might<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:22.890> be

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
reason it might why it might not be

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.590 
reason it might why it might not be
working<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.880> g2<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.390> new

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
working here is because the g2 is a new

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380 
working here is because the g2 is a new
device<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.229> not<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.590> popular<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:26.520> Galaxy

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
device and it's not as popular as Galaxy

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
device and it's not as popular as Galaxy
devices<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.950> maybe<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:29.250> just

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
devices as we all know so maybe he just

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.469 
devices as we all know so maybe he just
needs<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> release<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:29.970> update<00:01:30.240> nevertheless

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479

the reason why he made it so these
aren't<00:02:00.689> editable<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.590> specifically
