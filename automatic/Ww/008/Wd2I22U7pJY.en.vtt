00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.449
 weeks a little more movement 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 I actually said that was it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.140
 but a weekly update will be 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.880
 somehow I tried but that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.310
 I even got bored 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.269

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.070
 I now each prepare me 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.520
 setting the mistake as the week was 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.079
 I think that's so boring 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.250
 yes no pig and was interested 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.070
 four weeks ago I thought so 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.629
 do it update it is ask me 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.809
 facebook what it looks like and yes you are 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.770
 So the interest seems chest like that 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.510
 I like that too, that's how I feel 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.969
 not polish off have to move 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.899
 could also be 45 minutes of sports and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.200
 am quite ready I try 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.689
 to weigh once a week make three 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.880
 until four times a week, so sport tomorrow 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.880
 or on youtube there is this blog 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.610
 I'll try that too 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.750
 make and work quite well 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.460
 So the condition is I have only 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 this one of these work outs made on 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.680
 youtube and I have noticed conditions 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.750
 got better and last week 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 Got me a dog from my parents 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 paula and big dog so german shepherd 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.200
 Collie mix that needed a lot of movement 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.729
 I tried to lure her with her 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 has also worked quite well so me 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.549
 Of course, you can not do it now 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.680
 long stretch to look so two 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.689
 minutes later I was packing close 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.189
 announced but it is a start for the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.049
 tatserie advantage to me why our guests here sometimes 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.979
 in and out maybe it can do it 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.320
 sometime 30 minutes in a row 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.930
 but I have to do this slowly so 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.149
 two minutes jog two minutes tomorrow 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.090
 My lungs are used to it 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:19.810
 and wanted to do but work otherwise 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.450
 not so that always arises that me 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 weighed me the first time on the 25th 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.870
 there is the first entries here and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.660
 the next entry was at 31 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:38.590
 and I had already lost 1.1 kilos 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.540
 and at the moment I have 35 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.050
 kilo decreased so last week was 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.270
 paula here and there we do not have it 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.640
 made 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.920
 to eat before our time so theirs 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.470
 It's about our time of eating out 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.670
 and when we first eat and then 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.070
 After that, going out is always hungry 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.390
 That's why we had to go out first 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.950
 then eat and then it was already 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.050
 four and we do not eat carbohydrates 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.370
 So we have more to four 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.200
 our time was eaten and so on 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.360
 equal to the week 12 kilos increased 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.790
 I now have 800 grams again 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.110
 So it's a decrease in the four 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.360
 So it's okay 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.799
 I'm not in the right place 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.170
 so fast, it is also not too slow 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.180
 is a good decrease and if that is now 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.799
 until september goes on then creates 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.780
 maybe even ten kilos or more 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:34.750
 who's alright i told you i 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.640
 make such a food diary I have 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.019
 also tried but that was through 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.010
 terrible then I have two in part 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.660
 forget to film or always have that 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.430
 eaten the same so in the morning I eat 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.840
 always the same as me 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.989
 always rye bread with arma or and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.680
 cheese and salami will drink coffee 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.230
 juice and magnesium tablet 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.930
 that's standard every now and then 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.370
 sometimes oatmeal but without water 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.720
 cooked or just with milk because with 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.480
 water that's me early and 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.480
 in the afternoon I mostly at the time 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.390
 zucchini in all variations as a buffer 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.180
 as zucchini noodles or as zucchini 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:24.400
 these were zucchinis as a highlight 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.930
 yes that's what I eat somehow 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.160
 So I do not try too little too 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.140
 eat because I try consciously 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.690
 to feed healthy and not so many 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.310
 eating carbohydrates is now on the ball 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.320
 some worked as sometimes is the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.190
 balance eaten so calorie bomb 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.190
 Carbohydrate through the noodles 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:50.290
 There are some recipes that I have 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.960
 I chose the low carbohydrate 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.420
 are and because I am now fully on to 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.830
 so above all things trikini and 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.950
 so on candy i have the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.570
 completely waived the first three weeks 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.980
 So I have nothing and sweets 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.110
 chocolate can not eat 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.060
 small chips no cake can cook 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.450
 nothing and then started as 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.450
 paula jever a duplo to eat and to 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.130
 sweet with almost the teeth are folded up 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.010
 So the body gets used to it 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.400
 take care of it so much anyway 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.050
 to demand sugar is not 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.310
 cravings or something that works 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.680
 actually quite good although I end of 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:37.930
 cycle bin and pms full hit 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:43.230
 I have my gerhard and mine the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:47.919
 hat and Paul brought in the river 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.090
 my two visitors and there you are 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.419
 So you have that in my mind 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.310
 Handle 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.500
 but I try not to give 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.320
 So if I'm hungry I'll eat then 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.690
 but I'm not in masses in masses 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.090
 that's fine 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.510
 as I said sport and then we hope 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.340
 until september the kilos tumbled 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.730
 Markus is very diligent with has too 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.540
 already good for two 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.540
 Of course, it's easier 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:20.180
 yes that's it, that's me 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.710
 Powder stuff I suppose there broke synonymous 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.080
 that's also the reason for that 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.000
 I did not know well I wanted 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.000
 now the next time an appointment 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.710
 energy where make and let's see what 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.990
 Woman doctor says he has to say if he 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.880
 that want to have it public now or if 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.160
 I once a month is enough for the update 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.720
 or what he still wanted to know what I am 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.000
 I'll try it for now 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.800
 this lining just like that I just exactly 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.640
 luckily I had so eat if so 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.440
 the sheep 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.000
 It's not that easy to be hungry 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.640
 has only then with the camera out too 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.370
 get there I think in milan but I 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.060
 trying to do a nutshell kurzinfo 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.040
 Video 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.970
 I'm not into it now 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.290
 I have prepared myself now 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.630
 I already painted in front of the camera 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.630
 sits without thinking about it 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.110
 So good love so if you have questions 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.110
