we'll<00:00:00.659> be<00:00:00.750> throwing<00:00:00.989> out<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.230> small<00:00:01.589> watermelon

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
we'll be throwing out a small watermelon

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.760 
we'll be throwing out a small watermelon
the<00:00:02.490> watermelon<00:00:02.750> is<00:00:03.750> set<00:00:04.080> up<00:00:04.170> at<00:00:04.290> exactly<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
the watermelon is set up at exactly the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.800 
the watermelon is set up at exactly the
same<00:00:04.950> height<00:00:05.009> as<00:00:05.220> me<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:06.150> it<00:00:06.240> represents<00:00:06.720> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
same height as me so it represents the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.900 
same height as me so it represents the
opponent's<00:00:07.200> face<00:00:07.379> throwing<00:00:08.280> from<00:00:08.519> 30<00:00:08.849> feet

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
opponent's face throwing from 30 feet

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.049 
opponent's face throwing from 30 feet
using<00:00:09.750> traditional<00:00:09.929> slide<00:00:10.500> release<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.099> no

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
using traditional slide release and no

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.180 
using traditional slide release and no
spin<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:13.200> shuriken<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> five<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> half

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
spin the shuriken is five and a half

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:37.740 
spin the shuriken is five and a half
inches<00:00:14.549> long

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.900 

how<00:00:38.750> was<00:00:38.899> it

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
how was it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.810 
how was it
I<00:00:41.000> went<00:00:41.630> hit<00:00:41.750> right<00:00:42.739> in<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.920> eye<00:00:42.950> socket<00:00:43.579> we'll

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
I went hit right in the eye socket we'll

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.080 
I went hit right in the eye socket we'll
try<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.150> couple<00:00:44.360> more<00:00:44.480> here

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.950 

so<00:00:52.090> that<00:00:52.660> third<00:00:52.930> one<00:00:53.760> hit<00:00:54.760> right<00:00:55.570> about<00:00:55.780> what

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
so that third one hit right about what

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.310 
so that third one hit right about what
would<00:00:56.079> be<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.200> eye<00:00:56.350> socket<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:58.720> can<00:00:58.750> see<00:00:59.079> that

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
would be the eye socket you can see that

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.000 
would be the eye socket you can see that
right<00:01:00.070> there

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
right there

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.899 
right there
find<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.100> streak<00:01:03.340> in<00:01:03.489> here

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:23.010 

so<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:08.440> have<00:01:16.500> okay<00:01:17.910> what<00:01:18.910> you<00:01:19.060> have<00:01:19.300> is<00:01:22.020> if

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
so you have okay what you have is if

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:35.670 
so you have okay what you have is if
entry<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:25.450> here<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.729> way<00:01:30.970> or<00:01:34.680> probably

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
entry right here this way or probably

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.190 
entry right here this way or probably
like<00:01:35.830> this<00:01:36.070> or<00:01:36.340> something<00:01:36.610> oh<00:01:36.789> that<00:01:37.690> seems<00:01:37.990> to

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
like this or something oh that seems to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.400 
like this or something oh that seems to
be<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.380> hole<00:01:38.560> right<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:39.100> there<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:41.140> right<00:01:41.289> so

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
be the hole right of there all right so

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.779 
be the hole right of there all right so
basically<00:01:44.410> I<00:01:44.920> mean<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.220> was<00:01:45.310> let<00:01:45.520> me<00:01:45.580> turn<00:01:45.700> it

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
basically I mean it was let me turn it

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.980 
basically I mean it was let me turn it
back<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.090> eighth<00:01:46.240> position

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 

okay<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.259> that's<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.619> way<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.860> was<00:01:50.950> facing

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
okay so that's the way it was facing

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.889 
okay so that's the way it was facing
when<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.600> started<00:01:53.039> this<00:01:54.039> is<00:01:54.280> straight<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
when we started this is straight and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.180 
when we started this is straight and
this<00:01:56.649> would<00:01:56.860> be<00:01:57.179> middle<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.959> nose<00:01:59.200> eye<00:01:59.560> socket

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
this would be middle the nose eye socket

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:09.370 
this would be middle the nose eye socket
eye<00:02:00.310> socket

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:23.280 

you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.350 

as<00:02:23.860> far<00:02:24.189> as<00:02:24.340> what<00:02:24.519> I<00:02:24.549> wanted<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.879> do<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.150> just

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
as far as what I wanted to do is just

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.020 
as far as what I wanted to do is just
show<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.540> at<00:02:25.810> 30<00:02:26.049> feet<00:02:26.409> and<00:02:27.310> here's<00:02:27.519> proof<00:02:27.790> of

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
show that at 30 feet and here's proof of

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:37.920 
show that at 30 feet and here's proof of
30<00:02:28.239> feet<00:02:28.859> here<00:02:29.859> is<00:02:31.620> 25<00:02:32.620> feet<00:02:34.319> 25<00:02:35.319> feet<00:02:36.930> that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
30 feet here is 25 feet 25 feet that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.059 
30 feet here is 25 feet 25 feet that
goes<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:39.879> where<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.030> was<00:02:40.239> standing<00:02:40.920> which<00:02:41.920> is

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
goes to where I was standing which is

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.940 
goes to where I was standing which is
that<00:02:42.250> line<00:02:42.489> right<00:02:42.790> there<00:02:43.230> I'll<00:02:44.230> pull<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.650> out

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.199 

and<00:02:47.950> then<00:02:48.220> we'll<00:02:48.430> go<00:02:48.819> back<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.359> here<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.579> 25

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
and then we'll go back to here so 25

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.490 
and then we'll go back to here so 25
feet<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.980> another<00:02:57.220> 5<00:02:57.609> feet<00:02:57.909> of<00:02:58.500> that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
feet and then another 5 feet of that

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.229 
feet and then another 5 feet of that
rock<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:04.919> well<00:03:05.919> back<00:03:06.250> at<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> 25<00:03:06.909> mark

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
rock so here is well back at the 25 mark

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.909 
rock so here is well back at the 25 mark
and<00:03:08.109> this<00:03:08.290> will<00:03:08.409> be<00:03:08.500> at<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.680> 20<00:03:08.950> mark<00:03:10.079> 20<00:03:11.079> so<00:03:11.620> 20

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
and this will be at the 20 mark 20 so 20

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:17.759 
and this will be at the 20 mark 20 so 20
25<00:03:12.870> 25<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.049> here<00:03:14.169> 30<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.750> under<00:03:16.750> 20<00:03:17.019> feet<00:03:17.049> it

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
25 25 to here 30 so under 20 feet it

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.170 
25 25 to here 30 so under 20 feet it
seems<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.069> be<00:03:18.159> the<00:03:18.250> perceived<00:03:18.639> limit<00:03:19.030> of

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
seems to be the perceived limit of

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.780 
seems to be the perceived limit of
traditional<00:03:19.780> shuriken<00:03:20.169> throwing<00:03:20.439> so<00:03:21.189> maybe

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
traditional shuriken throwing so maybe

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.240 
traditional shuriken throwing so maybe
when<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.239> find<00:03:22.629> if<00:03:23.349> I<00:03:23.500> have<00:03:23.620> some<00:03:23.769> time<00:03:24.010> I'll<00:03:24.159> do

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
when I find if I have some time I'll do

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.020 
when I find if I have some time I'll do
a<00:03:24.280> 20<00:03:24.639> foot<00:03:24.790> or<00:03:24.939> two<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.560> see<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.970> results<00:03:27.970> of

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
a 20 foot or two to see the results of

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.390 
a 20 foot or two to see the results of
that<00:03:28.090> one<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.620> what<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.799> wanted<00:03:29.979> to<00:03:30.040> show<00:03:30.250> is

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
that one so what I wanted to show is

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.369 
that one so what I wanted to show is
that<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.720> perception<00:03:32.560> seems<00:03:32.859> to<00:03:33.040> be<00:03:33.159> that<00:03:33.370> uh

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
that the perception seems to be that uh

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.780 
that the perception seems to be that uh
traditional<00:03:35.379> shrieking<00:03:35.859> are<00:03:36.250> only<00:03:36.400> effective

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
traditional shrieking are only effective

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.640 
traditional shrieking are only effective
under<00:03:37.209> 20<00:03:37.569> feet<00:03:37.599> and<00:03:39.690> as<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.870> can<00:03:40.959> see<00:03:41.019> that's

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
under 20 feet and as you can see that's

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.879 
under 20 feet and as you can see that's
not<00:03:41.889> the<00:03:42.010> case

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
not the case

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.740 
not the case
