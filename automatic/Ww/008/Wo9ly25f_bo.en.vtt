00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.210
 firstly i didn't install red 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.580
 hell did the world community 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.499
 however, threats against Syria turned out to be 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.419
 empty sound when the whole world came out 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.879
 against the damask bombing and this 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.159
 worried israel binyamin netanyahu and 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.540
 he himself has repeatedly said the red line and even 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.100
 presented a chart of which 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.050
 followed that iran's nuclear program 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.510
 fast approaching this critical 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.100
 marks there is a fear that if 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.470
 US President can be forced 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.830
 abandon plans for a series then 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.140
 he will also deal with iran one of the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.960
 mines when the head of the largest power 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.390
 sets the red line and then 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.370
 publicly reject their words or 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.140
 forced to abandon them at will 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 his people or the senate 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.899
 this is a very disturbing sign and it is 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.269
 a serious blow to the reputation of the United States that 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:55.690
 play a restraining role as in the near 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:57.519
 East and around the world and although Obama 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.799
 trying to convince Israel that he has 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.629
 is serious about Iran it 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.690
 it will be difficult to prove to the locals 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.130
 that his words are not just rhetoric 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.790
 pester line they talk about red 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.810
 dash 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.580
 but every time they talk about different things 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.710
 we have to do something to show 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.540
 that the red line is not just figurative 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.250
 expression is a statement for which 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.410
 the action will follow especially the Israelites 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.020
 see how washington teheran fix 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.970
 communication mike legs from the side can 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.160
 seem that obama doubt or 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 changes position depending on development 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.060
 situations in the world 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.590
 unfulfilled ultimatums put 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.000
 politicians in the awkward position we 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.580
 seen as some politicians 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.310
 used the term red line dangerous 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.230
 do it you frame yourself like 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.360
 only politician use it right there 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.350
 undertakes to hold this 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.630
 red line 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 it is clear that the policy applied 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.210
 various kinds of manipulations red 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.640
 trait is an integral part of today 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.530
 political vocabulary but maybe 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.000
 leaders use this expression 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.890
 must be on my guard 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.940
 this phrase can only add them 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.940
