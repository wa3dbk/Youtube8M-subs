00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
today i'm going to show you how to build

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.259 
today i'm going to show you how to build
this<00:00:06.930> tree<00:00:07.529> by<00:00:07.710> tree<00:00:07.950> flush<00:00:08.910> with<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.150> wall

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
this tree by tree flush with the wall

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:23.210 
this tree by tree flush with the wall
door<00:00:17.029> so<00:00:19.850> dig<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:21.660> dick<00:00:21.840> tree<00:00:22.170> down<00:00:22.380> from

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
door so dig at first dick tree down from

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460 
door so dig at first dick tree down from
now<00:00:23.340> I'm<00:00:23.580> gonna<00:00:24.029> build<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.900> above<00:00:25.170> ground

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
now I'm gonna build it above ground

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.029 
now I'm gonna build it above ground
because<00:00:26.099> that's<00:00:26.310> easier<00:00:27.410> but<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> your

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
because that's easier but this is your

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.820 
because that's easier but this is your
floor<00:00:29.250> level<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.090> lowest<00:00:30.510> blocks<00:00:30.810> art<00:00:31.109> will

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
floor level the lowest blocks art will

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.370 
floor level the lowest blocks art will
not<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.600> this<00:00:33.600> level<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> place<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.140> place

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
not be here this level so place to place

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.520 
not be here this level so place to place
it<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.059> then<00:00:41.210> there's<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.329> piston<00:00:42.780> right

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it like this then there's a piston right

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.060 
it like this then there's a piston right
here<00:00:45.620> then<00:00:46.620> also<00:00:48.649> if<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.829> start<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.489> then

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
here then also if you start here then

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.180 
here then also if you start here then
looking<00:00:53.070> from<00:00:53.270> look<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> your

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
looking from look here this is your

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:06.170 
looking from look here this is your
input<00:00:58.280> touch<00:00:59.359> here<00:01:01.579> then<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.910> side<00:01:05.180> torch

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
input touch here then on this side torch

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.840 
input touch here then on this side torch
and<00:01:06.890> one<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.100> towards<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:10.170> goes<00:01:10.470> into

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
and one more towards that goes into

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.670 
and one more towards that goes into
redstone<00:01:11.850> leave<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.790> goes<00:01:14.790> into<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> block

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
redstone leave it down goes into a block

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
redstone leave it down goes into a block
into<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> torch<00:01:17.299> into<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> block<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.540> Red's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
into the torch into the block and Red's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.070 
into the torch into the block and Red's
down<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.520> will<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.930> need

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
down and it will go like this you need

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.819 
down and it will go like this you need
this<00:01:25.290> block<00:01:27.710> then<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:29.509> go<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:30.829> like

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
this block then it will also go up like

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.990 
this block then it will also go up like
this<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:36.210> torch<00:01:36.720> tower<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:40.549> listen<00:01:41.549> up

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this the torch tower there listen up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
this the torch tower there listen up
words<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> block<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.240> on<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.450> block

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
words for the block and on that block

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.940 
words for the block and on that block
place<00:01:46.280> send<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:52.009> place<00:01:53.009> redstone<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
place send then place redstone here and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.069 
place send then place redstone here and
you<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.490> sure<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.509> redstone

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you have to make sure that this redstone

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.190 
you have to make sure that this redstone
is<00:01:58.200> always<00:01:58.619> powered<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.020> with

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
is always powered so I can do that with

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.809 
is always powered so I can do that with
a<00:02:01.229> torch<00:02:03.680> then<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.520> goes<00:02:06.000> into<00:02:07.399> this<00:02:08.399> repeater

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
a torch then it goes into this repeater

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.200 
a torch then it goes into this repeater
when<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.629> extended

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
when it's extended

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:23.250 
when it's extended
and<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.620> one<00:02:16.000> will<00:02:17.000> go<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.970> Reds<00:02:20.210> down

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.420 

into<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.980> repeater<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:30.070> put<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.160> rest

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
into this repeater and put this rest

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:41.490 
into this repeater and put this rest
down<00:02:34.630> right<00:02:35.630> here<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.260> also<00:02:39.560> goes

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
down right here then this also goes

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.630 
down right here then this also goes
around<00:02:42.500> here<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.960> repeater<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.680> for<00:02:48.640> which

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
around here with a repeater on for which

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.720 
around here with a repeater on for which
goes<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:53.260> you're<00:02:54.260> both<00:02:54.980> patients<00:02:55.490> are

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
goes like this you're both patients are

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.970 
goes like this you're both patients are
gonna<00:02:56.120> be<00:02:56.300> here<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:59.110> let's<00:03:00.110> do<00:03:00.460> power<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
gonna be here so let's do power the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.140 
gonna be here so let's do power the
distance<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:06.500> keep<00:03:06.740> them<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.970> two

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
distance and to keep them the two

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.650 
distance and to keep them the two
patients<00:03:08.540> longer<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.260> than<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.940> one<00:03:11.210> so<00:03:11.420> that

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
patients longer on than this one so that

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:26.220 
patients longer on than this one so that
it<00:03:11.810> pulls<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.710> back<00:03:20.410> then<00:03:24.010> from<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.190> repeater

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
it pulls it back then from this repeater

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.760 
it pulls it back then from this repeater
also<00:03:27.230> get<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:27.920> down<00:03:28.960> like<00:03:29.960> this<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:32.770> a

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
also get it down like this and a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.020 
also get it down like this and a
repeater<00:03:34.490> on<00:03:34.760> three<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:36.260> direction<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:37.700> gets

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
repeater on three this direction it gets

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.920 
repeater on three this direction it gets
power<00:03:38.480> from<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:39.500> dog<00:03:44.380> let's<00:03:45.380> down<00:03:45.620> here<00:03:46.930> that

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
power from this dog let's down here that

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.440 
power from this dog let's down here that
little<00:03:48.200> power<00:03:48.740> side<00:03:49.610> Pistons<00:03:52.030> which<00:03:53.030> are

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
little power side Pistons which are

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.550 
little power side Pistons which are
gonna<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:55.090> right<00:03:56.090> here<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:59.540> six<00:03:59.870> patients<00:04:00.110> like

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
gonna be right here so six patients like

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.210 
gonna be right here so six patients like
that<00:04:00.770> and<00:04:01.040> then<00:04:01.550> in<00:04:01.700> front<00:04:02.830> trip<00:04:03.830> distance

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
that and then in front trip distance

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.850 
that and then in front trip distance
with<00:04:04.640> three<00:04:05.210> blocks<00:04:07.510> then<00:04:08.510> leave<00:04:09.380> this<00:04:09.590> rest

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
with three blocks then leave this rest

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.220 
with three blocks then leave this rest
down<00:04:10.070> one<00:04:10.730> down<00:04:10.940> like<00:04:11.270> this<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:13.930> next<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.110> the

piston torch and look next to it with

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:41.939 
piston torch and look next to it with
redstone<00:04:36.039> and<00:04:36.370> block<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.360> off<00:04:40.469> with<00:04:41.469> a<00:04:41.499> solid

redstone and block it off with a solid
book<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.300> important<00:04:43.900> um<00:04:47.249> now<00:04:48.249> this<00:04:48.819> signal

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
book so important um now this signal

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.659 
book so important um now this signal
also<00:04:49.919> goes<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:51.189> other<00:04:51.460> side<00:04:53.460> with<00:04:54.460> a

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
also goes to the other side with a

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:01.320 
also goes to the other side with a
repeater<00:04:55.060> on<00:04:55.210> one<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.740> let's<00:05:00.729> go<00:05:01.000> confront

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
repeater on one and let's go confront

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:12.600 
repeater on one and let's go confront
and<00:05:04.080> rest<00:05:05.080> on<00:05:05.289> that<00:05:07.169> red<00:05:08.169> stone<00:05:08.439> will<00:05:11.039> go<00:05:12.039> down

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
and rest on that red stone will go down

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.709 
and rest on that red stone will go down
like<00:05:12.939> this<00:05:14.819> will<00:05:15.819> go<00:05:16.000> into<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.300> repeater<00:05:16.719> on

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
like this will go into a repeater on

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:25.350 
like this will go into a repeater on
three<00:05:20.159> and<00:05:22.169> we'll<00:05:23.169> go<00:05:23.860> like<00:05:24.099> this<00:05:24.339> and<00:05:24.550> look<00:05:25.240> it

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
three and we'll go like this and look it

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.879 
three and we'll go like this and look it
off<00:05:25.479> here<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:30.930> business<00:05:31.930> on<00:05:32.050> this<00:05:32.169> this<00:05:32.620> side

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
off here the business on this this side

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:41.010 
off here the business on this this side
I'm<00:05:33.550> going<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.939> be<00:05:34.060> here<00:05:38.490> just<00:05:39.490> like<00:05:39.879> the<00:05:40.870> other

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
I'm going to be here just like the other

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:48.679 
I'm going to be here just like the other
side<00:05:42.689> and<00:05:45.330> leave<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.509> one<00:05:46.839> down<00:05:47.139> again<00:05:47.469> and

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:48.689 
side and leave it one down again and

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:56.550 
side and leave it one down again and
place<00:05:49.949> piston<00:05:50.949> here<00:05:53.099> and<00:05:55.289> don't<00:05:56.289> really

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
place piston here and don't really

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.159 
place piston here and don't really
matter<00:05:56.710> if<00:05:56.919> you<00:05:58.080> do<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.199> on<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.439> side<00:05:59.770> or<00:06:01.169> right

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
matter if you do it on the side or right

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.800 
matter if you do it on the side or right

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
here but for the other side it doesn't

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.519 
here but for the other side it doesn't
matter<00:06:06.569> so<00:06:07.569> do<00:06:08.020> like<00:06:08.169> this<00:06:10.050> so<00:06:11.050> this<00:06:11.080> should<00:06:11.500> be

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
matter so do like this so this should be

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:20.999 
matter so do like this so this should be
the<00:06:12.449> hole<00:06:13.449> extending<00:06:16.740> let's<00:06:17.740> test<00:06:18.039> it

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.629 

yeah<00:06:22.009> i<00:06:22.039> forgot<00:06:22.369> the<00:06:22.579> power<00:06:23.029> this<00:06:23.360> box<00:06:24.129> you<00:06:25.129> do

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
yeah i forgot the power this box you do

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.249 
yeah i forgot the power this box you do
that<00:06:25.789> by<00:06:27.009> the<00:06:28.009> repeater<00:06:28.369> here<00:06:28.869> goes<00:06:29.869> into<00:06:30.199> the

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
that by the repeater here goes into the

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.359 
that by the repeater here goes into the
block<00:06:31.239> with<00:06:32.239> a<00:06:32.509> torch<00:06:32.989> and<00:06:33.349> a<00:06:33.949> block<00:06:34.189> right

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:34.369 
block with a torch and a block right

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:39.519 
block with a torch and a block right
here<00:06:34.399> this<00:06:34.789> is<00:06:34.849> your<00:06:35.329> floor<00:06:36.229> level<00:06:37.809> then<00:06:38.809> rest

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
here this is your floor level then rest

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:45.429 
here this is your floor level then rest
down<00:06:39.739> and<00:06:41.199> into<00:06:42.199> another<00:06:43.099> torch<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:44.439> that's

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:45.439 
down and into another torch and that's

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:52.389 
down and into another torch and that's
the<00:06:45.679> whole<00:06:46.099> extending<00:06:49.479> so<00:06:50.499> only<00:06:51.499> thing<00:06:51.860> we

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:52.399 
the whole extending so only thing we

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.919 
the whole extending so only thing we
still<00:06:52.729> have<00:06:52.849> to<00:06:52.939> do<00:06:53.059> is<00:06:53.239> the<00:06:53.479> double<00:06:53.779> extender

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:53.929 
still have to do is the double extender

00:06:53.929 --> 00:07:01.889 
still have to do is the double extender
so<00:06:55.659> why<00:06:56.659> we<00:06:56.869> do<00:06:57.079> that<00:06:57.349> is<00:06:57.999> repeated<00:06:58.999> here

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:01.899 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:06.609 

listen<00:07:02.899> here<00:07:03.169> it's<00:07:03.559> an<00:07:03.739> unstable<00:07:05.349> red<00:07:06.349> stunt

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:06.619 
listen here it's an unstable red stunt

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:13.869 
listen here it's an unstable red stunt
like<00:07:06.769> this<00:07:06.829> and<00:07:08.229> like<00:07:10.089> this<00:07:12.159> then<00:07:13.159> it<00:07:13.279> goes<00:07:13.519> up

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 
like this and like this then it goes up

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:38.269 
place a block on this piston and place

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:43.679 
place a block on this piston and place
of<00:07:38.419> eternal<00:07:38.599> for<00:07:39.169> ticks<00:07:39.439> and<00:07:41.139> 13<00:07:42.139> ticks<00:07:42.439> and
