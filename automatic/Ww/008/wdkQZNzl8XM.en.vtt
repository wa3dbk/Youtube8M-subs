00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
is having a better display that seems to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.500 
is having a better display that seems to
be<00:00:15.960> one<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> key<00:00:16.949> things<00:00:17.400> about<00:00:18.300> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
be one of the key things about this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.820 
be one of the key things about this
phone<00:00:18.810> update<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.130> has<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.930> 4.5<00:00:21.930> inch<00:00:22.080> qHD

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
phone update that it has a 4.5 inch qHD

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.400

display instead of a forward seven inch
WVGA<00:00:25.410> display<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.910> should<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.689> little

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
WVGA display so it should get a little

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.519 
WVGA display so it should get a little
bit<00:00:28.349> better<00:00:29.179> screen<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.380> can

bumping up 100 more mini amps and then
if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.080> dual<00:01:16.409> sim<00:01:17.030> capability<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.299> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
if you have dual sim capability in this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.730 
if you have dual sim capability in this
galaxy<00:01:19.110> windfall<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.060> able<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
storage so you see the first generation

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
storage so you see the first generation
galaxy<00:01:37.619> win<00:01:37.920> phone<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:41.210> then<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
galaxy win phone and then we do have the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.370 
galaxy win phone and then we do have the
new<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:45.090> really<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:46.110> pretty
