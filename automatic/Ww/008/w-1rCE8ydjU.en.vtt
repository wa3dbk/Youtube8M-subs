the<00:01:06.350> same<00:01:06.560> drawing<00:01:06.800> I<00:01:06.920> didn't<00:01:07.130> have<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.400> rely

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
the same drawing I didn't have to rely

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.250 
the same drawing I didn't have to rely
nardin<00:01:08.090> or<00:01:08.180> anything<00:01:08.540> I<00:01:08.630> just<00:01:08.660> took<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.080> water

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
nardin or anything I just took the water

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.130 
nardin or anything I just took the water
off<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.800> put<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.550> book<00:01:10.940> on<00:01:11.120> top<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:11.660> so<00:01:11.900> it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
off and put a book on top of this so it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.450 
off and put a book on top of this so it
would<00:01:12.260> like<00:01:12.410> flatten<00:01:12.800> out<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:12.920> paper<00:01:13.250> again

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
would like flatten out the paper again

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.550 
would like flatten out the paper again
it's<00:01:13.760> it's<00:01:14.210> mostly<00:01:14.600> flat<00:01:14.840> now<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:15.410> still

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
it's it's mostly flat now but it still

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.800 
it's it's mostly flat now but it still
has<00:01:15.650> like<00:01:15.830> little<00:01:15.980> wrinkle<00:01:16.760> stuff<00:01:17.090> in<00:01:17.360> it<00:01:17.480> so

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
has like little wrinkle stuff in it so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.080 
has like little wrinkle stuff in it so
and<00:01:18.220> that's<00:01:19.220> actually<00:01:19.370> what<00:01:19.640> gave<00:01:19.880> me<00:01:19.910> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
and that's actually what gave me the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.060 
and that's actually what gave me the
idea<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.600> do<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.960> in<00:01:21.080> watercolor<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.680> was<00:01:21.860> kind

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
idea to do it in watercolor I was kind

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.770 
idea to do it in watercolor I was kind
of<00:01:22.130> mocking<00:01:22.610> my<00:01:22.790> water<00:01:23.030> bottles<00:01:23.390> like<00:01:23.570> what

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
of mocking my water bottles like what

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.270 
of mocking my water bottles like what
you<00:01:24.050> think<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.470> take<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.770> strong<00:01:24.980> for<00:01:25.190> me

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
you think you can take the strong for me

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.040 
you think you can take the strong for me
with<00:01:25.400> water<00:01:25.610> I'm<00:01:26.030> gonna<00:01:26.150> prove<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.510> wrong<00:01:26.720> man

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
with water I'm gonna prove you wrong man

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.850 
with water I'm gonna prove you wrong man
this<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.590> going<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.800> be<00:01:27.860> watercolor<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.060> then

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
this is going to be watercolor so then

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.560 
this is going to be watercolor so then
it's<00:01:30.860> like<00:01:31.040> if<00:01:31.220> water<00:01:31.880> didn't<00:01:32.180> kill<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.480> before

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
it's like if water didn't kill it before

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.950 
it's like if water didn't kill it before

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
minutes at a time you know but then I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.819 
minutes at a time you know but then I

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
forget mental killer in a huge area and

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.399 
forget mental killer in a huge area and
I'm<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:19.980> oh<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:21.360> wasn't<00:02:21.629> recording<00:02:22.019> so

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
I'm like oh that wasn't recording so

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.979 
I'm like oh that wasn't recording so
basically<00:02:22.829> anyway<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> tried<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.569> use<00:02:24.750> my

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
basically anyway I tried to use my

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.430 
basically anyway I tried to use my
webcam<00:02:25.430> for<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.239> could<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.599> it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
webcam for this because it could like it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.229 
webcam for this because it could like it
can<00:02:28.709> keep<00:02:28.829> recording<00:02:29.250> without<00:02:29.370> stopping<00:02:30.090> but

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
can keep recording without stopping but

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.850 
can keep recording without stopping but
now<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.569> look<00:02:30.720> at<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.019> now<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:31.739> that

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
now that I look at it now I think that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.350 
now that I look at it now I think that
the<00:02:31.950> quality<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.400> my<00:02:32.670> camera<00:02:32.909> might<00:02:33.180> actually

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the quality on my camera might actually

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.750 
the quality on my camera might actually
be<00:02:33.690> better<00:02:34.290> than<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> webcam<00:02:36.409> it's<00:02:37.409> weird<00:02:37.760> why

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
be better than the webcam it's weird why

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.819 
be better than the webcam it's weird why
do<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:38.939> have<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.209> webcam<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.900> records<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.349> 1080

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
do I have a webcam the records in 1080

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.160 
do I have a webcam the records in 1080
but<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.189> looks<00:02:41.340> worse<00:02:41.579> than<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.879> camera<00:02:42.239> at<00:02:42.420> 720

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
but it looks worse than a camera at 720

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.130 
but it looks worse than a camera at 720
ok<00:02:43.909> I'm<00:02:44.909> just<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.390> try<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.629> ignore<00:02:45.959> that
