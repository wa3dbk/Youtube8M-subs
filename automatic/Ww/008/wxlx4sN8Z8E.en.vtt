00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
that we could possibly do it but this is

running regular size servos the tail

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.820 
running regular size servos the tail
circles<00:01:46.730> are<00:01:46.790> actually<00:01:47.120> cut<00:01:47.570> out<00:01:47.690> for<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.800> a

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
circles are actually cut out for like a

225<00:01:51.360> sighs<00:01:51.690> servile<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.860> bit

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
225 sighs servile so a little bit

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.440 
225 sighs servile so a little bit
smaller<00:01:53.400> but<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.910> definitely<00:01:54.060> cut<00:01:54.330> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
smaller but you can definitely cut it

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330 
smaller but you can definitely cut it
out<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> regular<00:01:55.140> size<00:01:55.350> circles<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.310> I
