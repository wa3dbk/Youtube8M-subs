modular<00:00:30.090> course<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.980> about<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.130> first

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
modular course was about the first

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.610 
modular course was about the first
university<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.090> united<00:00:33.510> kingdom<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:34.469> have

university in the united kingdom to have

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.760 
university in the united kingdom to have
a<00:00:34.649> modular<00:00:35.100> course<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> means<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
a modular course what it means is that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.130 
a modular course what it means is that
students<00:00:37.790> get<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> choose<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.480> modules<00:00:39.899> they

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
students get to choose the modules they

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.010 
students get to choose the modules they
won't<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:41.180> not<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> complete<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> free

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
won't want to do not a complete and free

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
won't want to do not a complete and free
choice<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.500> course<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
choice of course because you have to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.180 
choice of course because you have to
take<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.690> compulsory<00:00:46.320> modules<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
take the compulsory modules or the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.130 
take the compulsory modules or the
essential<00:00:47.640> modules<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> field<00:00:48.930> you're

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
essential modules for the field you're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.850 
essential modules for the field you're
studying<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.480> another<00:00:51.480> advantage<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
studying but another advantage is that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.369 
studying but another advantage is that
instead<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> having<00:00:54.030> lots<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> big<00:00:54.719> exams<00:00:55.140> at

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
instead of having lots of big exams at

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799 
instead of having lots of big exams at
the<00:00:55.410> end<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> course<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.390> exams

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the end of the course there are exams

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.560 
the end of the course there are exams
and<00:00:58.109> course<00:00:58.350> works<00:00:58.620> every<00:00:59.070> semester<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and course works every semester and so

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.990 
and course works every semester and so
student<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.469> see<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.609> they're<00:01:02.820> progressing

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
student can see how they're progressing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
student can see how they're progressing

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and have a regular tension rather than a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
and have a regular tension rather than a

reason is called the sandwich is because

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.960 
reason is called the sandwich is because
you<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.140> two<00:01:46.740> years<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.810> study<00:01:48.810> than<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> year<00:01:49.680> of

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
you do two years of study than a year of

you do two years of study than a year of
the<00:01:50.970> placements<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:52.290> usually<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> fourth

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the placements and then usually a fourth

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.760

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
year back in the University so they're

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.330 
year back in the University so they're
different<00:01:56.130> layers<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> idea

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
different layers that's the idea

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.179 
different layers that's the idea
students<00:01:59.340> who<00:02:00.200> go<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.470> sandwich

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
students who go on the sandwich

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.969 
students who go on the sandwich
placements<00:02:02.990> almost<00:02:03.990> always<00:02:04.320> really<00:02:04.619> enjoy<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
placements almost always really enjoy it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.090 
placements almost always really enjoy it
and<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.720> learn<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:06.990> from<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.920> when

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
and they learn a lot from it and when

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.919 
and they learn a lot from it and when
they<00:02:08.220> come<00:02:08.429> back<00:02:08.640> they're<00:02:08.940> better<00:02:09.300> students

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
they come back they're better students

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.050 
they come back they're better students
because<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> experience<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.880> work

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
