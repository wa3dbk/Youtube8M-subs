00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.059
 the secret was a transformation for 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.850
 me because I grew up in a family where my 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.619
 father was very negative he believed that the 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.199
 rich were people who scammed the 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.390
 other than that the one who had money should 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.100
 have cheated on someone and I grew up 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.900
 convinced that the money gave back to 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.330
 a bad person because only the bad ones 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.430
 they had a lot of money that money did not 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.110
 It grows in trees I repeated often you think 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.750
 that I'm rockefeller was one of his 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.640
 favorite phrases and I grew up 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.340
 Believing in truth that life was 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.079
 difficult was hard it was a struggle and it was 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.239
 until I met double a clement 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.989
 stones that I literally started to 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.989
 change my life 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 when I worked with stone said I want you to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.390
 you set a goal so great that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.129
 reach it you would go crazy and you would know 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.610
 that it was only because of what I taught you 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.489
 that you fulfilled your good goal in that 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.280
 then he earned about eight thousand dollars a 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.500
 year and for some reason I wanted something 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.930
 quantifiable and I said I want to win 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.450
 one hundred thousand dollars this year I had no idea 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.030
 how to do it did not have a strategy 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.700
 no possibility but I said I will decree 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.660
 I'll believe it, I'll act as if 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.610
 it was true and I'll release it this says a 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.550
 of the things that he taught me was that a 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.640
 diary will close your eyes and visualize 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.869
 everything as if I had already achieved it 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.429
 I even made a 100-thousand-dollar bill 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.020
 dollars that I put on the roof so that 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.789
 were the first thing I saw upon waking 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.890
 I looked up and the ticket 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.979
 I remembered my intention 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.550
 then they closed their eyes and visualized 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.440
 have the hundred thousand dollars 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.080
 and an ideal life 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.630
 and the most interesting thing was that it did not happen 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.930
 nothing important in 30 days had no ideas 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.700
 revealing nobody offered me more money 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.560
 one day I was in the shower about 4 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 weeks and I had an idea of â€‹â€‹100,000 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.970
 Dollars 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.490
 it came to my mind I had written a 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.409
 book and I said yes managed to sell 400 thousand 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.320
 copies of my book at 25 cents 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.510
 I'll get 100 thousand dollars the book now 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.820
 I was there but I never had 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.890
 happened and I think one of the secrets 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.930
 is that when you have an inspired idea 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.130
 you must trust her and act on 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.770
 consequence 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.860
 I did not know how to do it as I would sell 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.290
 400,000 copies had never done it 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.660
 and the national enquire in a supermarket 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.610
 I had seen it thousands of times but 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.920
 always as background suddenly happened to 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.830
 close- up and I said if your readers 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.080
 knew of my book I think 400 thousand 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.210
 people would buy it six weeks 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.280
 after a talk in new york 'and 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.230
 in the end a woman approached me saying 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.150
 what a nice conference I want 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.040
 interview him I will give him my card 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.900
 I asked for who wrote I am 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.540
 independent but I work a lot with the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.250
 national enquire 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.000
 I started listening to the topic of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.000
 unknown dimension 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.670
 wow this really works the article 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.670
 it was published and the book began to be sold 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.400
 but what I want to say is that a suit 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.239
 to my life all those events including 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.980
 to the person to cut the story not 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.780
 I was able to earn $ 100,000 that year 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.569
 just 92 1,327 but he thinks I got depressed 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.000
 and I said it does not work I did not say wow what 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.180
 wonder and my wife said if it works 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.939
 with 400,000 will serve with a million and I said 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.709
 I do not know, I think we do try 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.569
 my editor gave me a check for the 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.370
 book royalties chicken soup for the 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.349
 soul and put a happy face next to the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.940
 signature because it was the first check for a 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.520
 million that he had signed 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.740
 so I know from my own experience 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.290
 because I wanted to find out if the secret in 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.450
 reality works and I put it to the test that 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.070
 of course it serves and now I live my 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.070
 life based on the every day
