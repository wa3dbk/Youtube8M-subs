00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
decided to go with that and started

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520 
decided to go with that and started

more portability with my methodology
ironically<00:02:41.790> when<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.090> started<00:02:42.389> to<00:02:42.480> use<00:02:42.599> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
ironically when I started to use the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.259 
ironically when I started to use the
newer<00:02:43.049> usb-powered<00:02:43.739> scanners<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:45.000> tended

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
newer usb-powered scanners they tended

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.520 
newer usb-powered scanners they tended
to<00:02:45.359> be<00:02:45.450> too<00:02:45.599> sensitive<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.139> would<00:02:46.260> take<00:02:46.409> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
to be too sensitive I would take the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.720 
to be too sensitive I would take the
cover<00:02:46.739> off<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.099> everything<00:02:47.370> would<00:02:47.609> go

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
cover off and everything would go

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.640 
cover off and everything would go
completely<00:02:48.090> wide<00:02:48.419> so<00:02:48.659> I<00:02:48.689> had<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.019> use<00:02:49.200> this

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
completely wide so I had to use this

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.710 
completely wide so I had to use this
older<00:02:50.069> scanner<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.909> I<00:02:50.939> knew<00:02:51.180> worked

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
older scanner that I knew worked

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.330 
older scanner that I knew worked
I<00:02:51.750> wanted<00:02:52.109> running<00:02:52.379> into<00:02:52.650> problems<00:02:52.829> with

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
I wanted running into problems with

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.940 
I wanted running into problems with
power<00:02:53.939> and<00:02:54.530> size<00:02:57.349> eventually<00:02:58.349> Simon<00:02:58.650> Kesh<00:02:58.769> and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
power and size eventually Simon Kesh and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.759 
power and size eventually Simon Kesh and
I<00:02:58.980> decided<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.790> needed<00:02:59.939> to<00:03:00.030> design<00:03:00.239> an

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
I decided we needed to design an

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.170 
I decided we needed to design an
extension<00:03:01.769> tool<00:03:02.040> an<00:03:02.280> appendage<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:02.879> you<00:03:03.000> will

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
extension tool an appendage if you will

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.610 
extension tool an appendage if you will
I<00:03:03.329> was<00:03:03.480> already<00:03:03.689> calling<00:03:03.840> my<00:03:03.989> scanner<00:03:04.230> Jackson

I was already calling my scanner Jackson

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.369 
I was already calling my scanner Jackson
so<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:04.919> became<00:03:05.189> action<00:03:06.030> Jackson<00:03:06.629> action

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
so this became action Jackson action

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.349 
so this became action Jackson action
permanently<00:03:08.280> houses<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.819> scanner<00:03:09.120> and

a manifesto I thought was a bit much but
I<00:05:03.000> wanted<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.360> invite<00:05:03.690> other<00:05:03.930> artists<00:05:04.440> into

I wanted to invite other artists into
the<00:05:04.740> exploratory<00:05:05.400> space<00:05:05.700> even<00:05:06.330> if<00:05:06.419> they

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
the exploratory space even if they

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.870

wanted to work with text or video or

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.400 
wanted to work with text or video or
sculpture<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:09.900> decided<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.320> a

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
sculpture so I decided that a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.280 
sculpture so I decided that a
compression<00:05:10.770> erst<00:05:11.040> would<00:05:11.220> first<00:05:12.080> capture<00:05:13.080> or

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
compression erst would first capture or

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.750 
compression erst would first capture or

that performance within a virtual space

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.130 
that performance within a virtual space
and<00:05:19.640> then<00:05:20.640> they<00:05:20.790> would<00:05:20.910> reconstitute<00:05:21.750> in<00:05:21.930> some
