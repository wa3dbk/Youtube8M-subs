00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:08.469 
most damage in that area we don't know a

lot<00:02:08.560> about<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.889> monster<00:02:09.189> yet<00:02:09.399> but<00:02:09.579> we<00:02:09.670> can

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
lot about the monster yet but we can

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.099 
lot about the monster yet but we can
assume<00:02:09.939> that<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.329> monster<00:02:10.689> would<00:02:10.929> have<00:02:11.079> a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.109 
assume that the monster would have a

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.869 
assume that the monster would have a
timer<00:02:11.439> so<00:02:11.739> we<00:02:11.859> couldn't<00:02:12.010> go<00:02:12.159> underground<00:02:12.459> over

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
timer so we couldn't go underground over

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.910 
timer so we couldn't go underground over
and<00:02:13.030> over<00:02:13.180> again<00:02:13.420> why

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and over again why

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.350 
and over again why
like<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> timer<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> Krakens<00:02:15.090> flight

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
like the timer on the Krakens flight

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.540 
like the timer on the Krakens flight
