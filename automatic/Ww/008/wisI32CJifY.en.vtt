00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
subscribers the reason being you have

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.380 
subscribers the reason being you have
that<00:00:44.250> means<00:00:44.430> basically<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.940> videos<00:00:45.270> have

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that means basically your videos have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
that means basically your videos have
been<00:00:45.480> seen<00:00:45.809> by<00:00:46.020> loads<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.379> people<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.920> even<00:00:47.670> if

been seen by loads of people and even if
you<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.510> guess<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> difference<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> whether

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you I guess is the difference of whether

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.889 
you I guess is the difference of whether
the<00:00:50.039> subscribers<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.820> way<00:00:51.180> way<00:00:51.420> less<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

going to get more subscribers from those
viewers<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> my<00:01:40.380> answer<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
viewers so that's kind of my answer to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.020 
viewers so that's kind of my answer to
that<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> probably<00:01:41.400> would<00:01:41.610> prefer<00:01:41.670> more

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that is I probably would prefer more

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
that is I probably would prefer more
views<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.600> less<00:01:42.840> subscribers<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.920> mean

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
views and less subscribers but I mean

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
views and less subscribers but I mean
you<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> best<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> both<00:01:44.880> worlds<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.509> think

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
you want the best of both worlds I think

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
you want the best of both worlds I think

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
tube statistic of it is you should have

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.000 
tube statistic of it is you should have
ten<00:01:50.280> percent<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.150> your<00:01:51.390> subscribers<00:01:52.200> watching

and<00:02:37.140> personally<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> game<00:02:38.220> for<00:02:38.459> me<00:02:38.489> that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
and personally the game for me that

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.759 
and personally the game for me that
seemed<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.390> most<00:02:39.510> intriguing<00:02:39.959> was<00:02:40.260> evolved

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
seemed the most intriguing was evolved

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.560 
seemed the most intriguing was evolved
if<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.370> haven't<00:02:41.550> seen<00:02:41.640> evolved<00:02:42.120> basically

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
if you haven't seen evolved basically

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.140 
if you haven't seen evolved basically
for<00:02:43.140> people<00:02:43.560> are<00:02:43.769> hunting<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.250> monster<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.910> one

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
for people are hunting a monster and one

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.960 
for people are hunting a monster and one
person<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.200> monster<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.980> as<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.790> can

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
person is the monster and as you can

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.400 
person is the monster and as you can
guess<00:02:48.000> from<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.390> name<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.840> monster<00:02:49.170> has<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
guess from the name the monster has to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.530 
guess from the name the monster has to
evolve<00:02:49.709> as<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.459> goes<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.910> eats<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.330> gets

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
evolve as it goes and eats and gets

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.780 
evolve as it goes and eats and gets
bigger<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.989> better<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
bigger and better it can then be the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.150 
bigger and better it can then be the
attacker<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.780> attack<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.440> people<00:02:55.799> otherwise

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
attacker and attack the people otherwise

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.130 
attacker and attack the people otherwise
it's<00:02:56.400> almost<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> prey<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.510> other

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
it's almost like the prey and other

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.390 
it's almost like the prey and other
people<00:02:58.500> are<00:02:58.530> attacking<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.920> price<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.250> that's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
people are attacking the price so that's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.380 
people are attacking the price so that's
probably<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.700> best<00:02:59.760> game<00:02:59.850> for<00:03:00.060> me<00:03:00.150> if<00:03:00.299> you

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
probably the best game for me if you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.490 
probably the best game for me if you
haven't<00:03:00.660> seen<00:03:00.810> involved<00:03:01.140> make<00:03:01.260> sure<00:03:01.380> you

devices<00:03:13.650> i<00:03:14.190> play<00:03:14.519> them<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.760> ipads<00:03:15.620> actually<00:03:16.620> my

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
devices i play them on ipads actually my

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.020 
devices i play them on ipads actually my
girlfriend's<00:03:17.130> ipad<00:03:17.400> i<00:03:17.430> haven't<00:03:17.700> even<00:03:17.760> got<00:03:17.940> my

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
girlfriend's ipad i haven't even got my

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.479 
girlfriend's ipad i haven't even got my
own<00:03:18.060> ipad<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:18.660> yeah<00:03:19.110> i<00:03:19.260> play<00:03:19.890> them<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.100> ipads

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
own ipad but yeah i play them on ipads

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.330 
own ipad but yeah i play them on ipads
the<00:03:21.329> reason<00:03:21.690> being<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:22.200> there's<00:03:22.530> less<00:03:22.860> issues

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the reason being is there's less issues

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.610 
the reason being is there's less issues
with<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.000> ipad<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.540> also<00:03:24.989> i<00:03:25.019> can<00:03:25.290> record

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
with the ipad and also i can record

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.440 
with the ipad and also i can record
straight<00:03:26.010> off<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.340> ipad<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:26.790> i<00:03:26.850> guess<00:03:27.030> that's<00:03:27.239> a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
straight off my ipad so i guess that's a

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.390 
straight off my ipad so i guess that's a
big<00:03:27.630> bones<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.170> personally<00:03:28.980> i<00:03:29.040> prefer<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
big bones but personally i prefer the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.670 
big bones but personally i prefer the
ipads<00:03:29.910> i<00:03:30.090> prefer<00:03:30.359> apple<00:03:30.600> because<00:03:31.410> there's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
ipads i prefer apple because there's

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.740 
ipads i prefer apple because there's
less<00:03:32.040> chance<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.670> hiccups<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.329> always<00:03:33.480> find

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
less chance of hiccups I always find

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750 
less chance of hiccups I always find
problems<00:03:34.200> with<00:03:34.380> androids<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:35.250> think<00:03:35.700> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
problems with androids I think the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.300 
problems with androids I think the
problem<00:03:35.910> being<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.540> iOS<00:03:37.079> is<00:03:37.380> designed<00:03:38.010> only

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
problem being is iOS is designed only

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.240 
problem being is iOS is designed only
for<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.209> ipad<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.019> iphone<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.920> ipod<00:03:41.190> touch

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
for the ipad and iphone and ipod touch

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.970 
for the ipad and iphone and ipod touch
whereas<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> android<00:03:42.630> operating<00:03:43.049> system<00:03:43.470> is

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
whereas the android operating system is

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.180 
whereas the android operating system is
you<00:03:44.820> know<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.090> used<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.660> literally<00:03:46.650> probably

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
you know is used in literally probably

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.340 
you know is used in literally probably
thousands<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.120> different<00:03:48.420> designs<00:03:49.049> of

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
thousands of different designs of

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.039 
thousands of different designs of
tablets<00:03:49.950> which<00:03:50.459> aren't<00:03:50.730> optimized<00:03:51.390> fully<00:03:51.660> for

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
tablets which aren't optimized fully for

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.110 
tablets which aren't optimized fully for
the<00:03:52.620> for<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.010> android<00:03:53.370> platform<00:03:53.400> or<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the for the android platform or the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.909 
the for the android platform or the
android<00:03:54.450> platform<00:03:54.480> isn't<00:03:55.079> optimized<00:03:55.709> hoodie

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
android platform isn't optimized hoodie

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.530 
android platform isn't optimized hoodie
for<00:03:56.100> them<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.489> that's<00:03:56.940> sometimes<00:03:57.150> when<00:03:57.449> you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
for them and that's sometimes when you

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.340 
for them and that's sometimes when you
can<00:03:57.630> get<00:03:57.750> little<00:03:58.019> hiccups<00:03:58.380> but<00:03:58.590> i<00:03:58.799> do

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
can get little hiccups but i do

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.500 
can get little hiccups but i do
my<00:03:59.500> phones<00:03:59.740> and<00:03:59.920> Android<00:04:00.190> it's<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.520> Samsung

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
my phones and Android it's a Samsung

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.440 
my phones and Android it's a Samsung
Note<00:04:01.750> 3<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.290> I'd<00:04:02.980> prefer<00:04:03.550> it<00:04:03.820> over<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.090> iphone

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
Note 3 and I'd prefer it over the iphone

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.560 
Note 3 and I'd prefer it over the iphone
but<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.660> put<00:04:04.960> my<00:04:05.080> ipad<00:04:05.530> tablet<00:04:06.040> over<00:04:06.580> my<00:04:06.760> android

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
but I put my ipad tablet over my android

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.870 
but I put my ipad tablet over my android
tablets<00:04:08.200> like<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.680> had<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.950> Asus<00:04:09.640> Transformer

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
tablets like I had the Asus Transformer

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.320 
tablets like I had the Asus Transformer
book<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.570> stuff<00:04:10.750> like<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:10.960> so<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:12.550> very<00:04:12.880> does

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
book and stuff like that so it very does

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.199 
book and stuff like that so it very does
depend<00:04:13.570> but<00:04:14.050> i<00:04:14.290> think<00:04:15.040> i<00:04:15.130> prefer<00:04:15.280> iOS<00:04:15.940> on

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
depend but i think i prefer iOS on

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.290 
depend but i think i prefer iOS on
tablets<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.959> androids<00:04:17.800> on<00:04:18.070> phones<00:04:18.489> if<00:04:18.940> that

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300 
tablets and androids on phones if that

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.600 
tablets and androids on phones if that
hopefully<00:04:19.780> makes<00:04:19.959> sense<00:04:20.200> for<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.610> next

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.490 
week so I'm pre-recording like nothing
else<00:05:00.760> so<00:05:01.000> that<00:05:01.030> there's<00:05:01.390> still<00:05:01.600> a<00:05:01.780> nice<00:05:02.170> steady

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
else so that there's still a nice steady

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.040 
else so that there's still a nice steady
flow<00:05:02.770> of<00:05:02.800> content<00:05:03.100> for<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.490> guys<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:04.300> if<00:05:04.540> I

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
didn't have to pre-record I think it'd

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.580 
didn't have to pre-record I think it'd
be<00:05:06.580> so<00:05:07.090> much<00:05:07.150> more<00:05:07.270> relaxing<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.110> I'd<00:05:08.290> be<00:05:08.470> able

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
be so much more relaxing and I'd be able

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.170 
be so much more relaxing and I'd be able
