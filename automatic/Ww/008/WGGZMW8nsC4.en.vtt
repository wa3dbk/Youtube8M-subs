because<00:02:31.960> what<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.800> did<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.630> want<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.050> put

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
because what we did we we want to put

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.910 
because what we did we we want to put
some<00:02:35.650> on<00:02:35.800> cycling<00:02:36.310> inside<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.270> MRI<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.590> but

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
some on cycling inside of the MRI so but

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.060 
some on cycling inside of the MRI so but
instead<00:02:39.400> we<00:02:39.760> cannot<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.360> any<00:02:40.570> magnetic

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
material inside of the MRI room so what

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.280 
material inside of the MRI room so what
we<00:02:44.590> came<00:02:44.830> up<00:02:44.890> with<00:02:45.310> like<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.760> aluminium<00:02:46.660> and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
we came up with like a aluminium and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.240 
we came up with like a aluminium and
plastic<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.310> rubber<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.960> stained<00:02:50.920> still

materials<00:02:51.820> with<00:02:51.970> non-magnetic<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.890> then

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
materials with non-magnetic so and then

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.910 
materials with non-magnetic so and then
this<00:02:54.430> cycling<00:02:55.270> device<00:02:55.600> which<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.410> attached<00:02:56.770> to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the to the to the bed of MRI it's

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.460 
the to the to the bed of MRI it's
transferred<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.700> torque<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.570> outside<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.110> the

transferred the torque to outside of the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.410 
transferred the torque to outside of the
room<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.890> then<00:03:03.280> we<00:03:03.460> have<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> proper<00:03:04.180> bike

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
room and then we have a proper bike

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.470 
room and then we have a proper bike
outside<00:03:05.070> which<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.280> attach<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.820> our<00:03:06.970> gum

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
outside which is attach it to our gum

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.280 
outside which is attach it to our gum
tear<00:03:07.780> which<00:03:09.360> transferred<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.570> load<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
tear which transferred the load to the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.670 
tear which transferred the load to the
wheels<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.220> when<00:03:12.490> you<00:03:12.640> cycling<00:03:13.390> inside<00:03:13.990> of<00:03:14.170> MRI

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
wheels so when you cycling inside of MRI

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.590 
wheels so when you cycling inside of MRI
you<00:03:15.340> have<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.940> torque<00:03:16.420> from<00:03:17.820> with<00:03:18.820> according

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
you have the torque from with according

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.640 
you have the torque from with according
to<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.840> load<00:03:20.320> from<00:03:20.590> outside<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.910> when<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
to the load from outside so when and the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.220 
to the load from outside so when and the
Cyclades<00:03:24.430> inside<00:03:24.850> they<00:03:25.210> have<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.690> ice<00:03:25.900> cream

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
Cyclades inside they have the ice cream

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.140 
Cyclades inside they have the ice cream
which<00:03:26.860> they<00:03:27.070> have<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> feedback<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:28.060> how

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
which they have the feedback of how

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.640 
which they have the feedback of how
they're<00:03:28.810> doing<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.670> very<00:03:30.910> for<00:03:31.690> them<00:03:31.870> it's

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
they're doing so it's very for them it's

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.490 
they're doing so it's very for them it's
very<00:03:33.190> new<00:03:33.970> thing<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.300> typical<00:03:34.750> position<00:03:35.260> and

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
very new thing a typical position and

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.800 
very new thing a typical position and
everything<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.220> that's<00:03:36.700> what<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.210> built<00:03:37.450> here

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
everything but that's what we built here

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.960 
everything but that's what we built here
at<00:03:37.900> sports<00:03:38.230> science<00:03:38.500> institute<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:39.640> built<00:03:39.850> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
at sports science institute we built a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.660 
at sports science institute we built a
simulator<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.110> they<00:03:41.320> can<00:03:41.620> be<00:03:42.010> trained<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.550> they

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
simulator so they can be trained so they

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.820 
simulator so they can be trained so they
were<00:03:42.850> trained<00:03:43.330> here<00:03:43.690> then<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:44.350> could<00:03:44.590> measure

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
were trained here then we could measure

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.370 
were trained here then we could measure
all<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.340> physiological<00:03:45.970> variables<00:03:46.380> most

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
rate all the the measurements that

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.620 
rate all the the measurements that
normally<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.280> cannot<00:03:54.670> come<00:03:55.270> with<00:03:55.300> our

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
normally you cannot come with our

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.590 
normally you cannot come with our

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
equipment inside of MRI room so we first

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.410 
equipment inside of MRI room so we first
did<00:03:58.780> exactly<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.680> same<00:03:59.710> test<00:04:00.160> outside<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.390> we

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
did exactly the same test outside so we

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.060 
did exactly the same test outside so we
did<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> very<00:04:02.680> traditional<00:04:03.180> vo2<00:04:04.180> max<00:04:04.480> test

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
did a very traditional vo2 max test

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.530 
did a very traditional vo2 max test
outside<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:07.240> also<00:04:07.840> inside<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.710> then<00:04:08.890> we

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
outside and and also inside and then we

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.560 
outside and and also inside and then we
put<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.690> data<00:04:10.870> over<00:04:11.590> an<00:04:11.800> MC<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.670> then<00:04:13.150> we<00:04:13.330> can

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
put the data over an MC and then we can

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.470 
put the data over an MC and then we can
see<00:04:13.780> how<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.310> physiological<00:04:15.310> responses<00:04:15.910> the

here<00:04:53.650> especially<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.820> add<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:56.140> major

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
here especially the add the the major

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.030 
here especially the add the the major
concern<00:04:57.040> with<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:58.450> subjects<00:04:59.080> is<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.440> they

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
concern with the subjects is that they

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.630 
concern with the subjects is that they
are<00:05:00.540> we<00:05:01.540> must<00:05:02.020> ensure<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:03.160> they<00:05:03.340> are<00:05:03.370> not

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
are we must ensure that they are not

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.970 
are we must ensure that they are not
claustrophobic<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:05.400> another<00:05:07.290> aspect<00:05:08.290> is<00:05:08.530> the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
claustrophobic and another aspect is the

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.460 
claustrophobic and another aspect is the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
that we have in the sports science

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.240 
that we have in the sports science
institute<00:05:50.970> to<00:05:51.970> see<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:52.750> like<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.350> try<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.830> find

institute to see the like to try to find

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.870 
institute to see the like to try to find
a<00:05:54.400> lactate<00:05:54.790> lactate<00:05:55.360> threshold<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:56.230> the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
a lactate lactate threshold and the

a lactate lactate threshold and the
increment<00:05:57.880> and<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.750> lack<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.320> blood

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
increment and the lack in the blood

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.750 
increment and the lack in the blood
lactate<00:05:59.800> so<00:06:00.700> we<00:06:01.210> can<00:06:01.480> find<00:06:01.990> some<00:06:02.950> relationship

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
lactate so we can find some relationship

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.650 
lactate so we can find some relationship
between<00:06:04.140> aerobic<00:06:05.140> anaerobic<00:06:06.210> exercise<00:06:07.210> and

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.350 

it's<00:06:20.349> actually<00:06:20.500> easier<00:06:21.069> in<00:06:21.250> there<00:06:21.610> folks<00:06:22.090> I

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
it's actually easier in there folks I

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.999 
it's actually easier in there folks I
mean<00:06:22.599> the<00:06:22.659> similarity<00:06:23.080> of<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.229> mask<00:06:23.590> on<00:06:23.830> was

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
mean the similarity of the mask on was

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.520 
mean the similarity of the mask on was
right<00:06:24.250> after<00:06:24.580> but<00:06:24.759> just<00:06:25.090> being<00:06:25.240> in<00:06:25.389> there's<00:06:25.569> no

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
right after but just being in there's no

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.379 
right after but just being in there's no
issues<00:06:26.889> at<00:06:26.919> all<00:06:27.099> not<00:06:27.460> a<00:06:27.490> good<00:06:27.759> tired<00:06:28.060> quicker

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
issues at all not a good tired quicker

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.850 
issues at all not a good tired quicker
but<00:06:28.599> I<00:06:28.689> was<00:06:28.840> trying<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.110> compete<00:06:29.409> with<00:06:29.469> the<00:06:29.710> guy

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
but I was trying to compete with the guy

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.480 
but I was trying to compete with the guy
before<00:06:30.389> that's<00:06:31.389> rather<00:06:31.539> use<00:06:31.840> guys<00:06:32.080> I<00:06:32.949> felt<00:06:33.430> a

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
before that's rather use guys I felt a

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.580 
before that's rather use guys I felt a
retired<00:06:33.849> much<00:06:34.030> quicker<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:34.629> my<00:06:35.319> legs<00:06:35.530> were

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
retired much quicker and my legs were

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.879 
retired much quicker and my legs were
burning<00:06:35.800> wall<00:06:36.810> this<00:06:37.810> is<00:06:38.050> just<00:06:38.409> the<00:06:38.530> tip<00:06:38.710> of<00:06:38.830> the

grain<00:06:43.870> and<00:06:44.139> sports<00:06:44.409> performance<00:06:45.009> this<00:06:45.310> is

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
grain and sports performance this is

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.339 
grain and sports performance this is
like<00:06:45.789> you're<00:06:45.969> really<00:06:46.150> first<00:06:46.659> step<00:06:46.960> just

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
like you're really first step just

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.529 
like you're really first step just
really<00:06:47.680> to<00:06:47.830> describe<00:06:48.340> how<00:06:49.029> the<00:06:49.090> brain<00:06:49.360> is

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
really to describe how the brain is

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.899 
really to describe how the brain is
active<00:06:49.900> so<00:06:50.409> we<00:06:50.620> will<00:06:50.710> have<00:06:50.770> like<00:06:51.189> a<00:06:51.219> model<00:06:51.759> and

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909 
active so we will have like a model and

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.559 
active so we will have like a model and
then<00:06:52.090> after<00:06:52.599> this<00:06:52.779> we<00:06:53.139> can<00:06:53.349> create<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.400> new<00:06:54.729> new

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
then after this we can create a new new

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.290 
then after this we can create a new new
studies<00:06:56.020> for<00:06:56.409> example<00:06:56.439> to<00:06:56.860> see<00:06:57.069> if<00:06:57.159> you<00:06:57.340> if<00:06:58.120> you

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
studies for example to see if you if you

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.839 
studies for example to see if you if you
have<00:06:58.479> a<00:06:58.509> depletion<00:06:58.930> of<00:06:59.199> glycogen<00:06:59.770> and<00:07:00.069> then

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:00.849 
have a depletion of glycogen and then

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.689 
have a depletion of glycogen and then
what<00:07:01.659> will<00:07:02.110> be<00:07:02.349> lighting<00:07:02.979> up<00:07:03.099> in<00:07:03.340> your<00:07:03.520> brain

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:03.699 
what will be lighting up in your brain

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:07.050 
what will be lighting up in your brain
so<00:07:04.060> we<00:07:04.210> can<00:07:04.389> compare<00:07:04.599> to<00:07:04.870> the<00:07:05.139> actual<00:07:05.610> study<00:07:06.610> if

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
so we can compare to the actual study if

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.050 
so we can compare to the actual study if
you<00:07:07.409> become<00:07:08.409> dehydrated<00:07:08.650> for<00:07:09.400> example<00:07:09.819> what

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
you become dehydrated for example what

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.140 
you become dehydrated for example what
area<00:07:10.779> in<00:07:10.960> the<00:07:11.139> brain<00:07:11.259> so<00:07:11.889> it's<00:07:12.340> really<00:07:12.789> once

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
area in the brain so it's really once

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.809 
area in the brain so it's really once
you<00:07:13.240> understand<00:07:13.719> the<00:07:13.930> mechanisms<00:07:14.680> that<00:07:14.889> some

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:15.819 
you understand the mechanisms that some

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:18.600 
you understand the mechanisms that some
something<00:07:16.330> we<00:07:16.900> kind<00:07:17.379> of<00:07:17.500> know<00:07:17.860> already<00:07:18.129> some

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
something we kind of know already some

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.890 
something we kind of know already some
for<00:07:19.300> most<00:07:19.569> of<00:07:19.750> the<00:07:20.099> peripheral<00:07:21.690> responses<00:07:22.690> but

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
for most of the peripheral responses but

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.379 
for most of the peripheral responses but
we<00:07:23.080> don't<00:07:23.259> know<00:07:23.379> how<00:07:23.409> the<00:07:23.620> brain<00:07:23.979> is<00:07:24.389> receiving

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
we don't know how the brain is receiving

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:28.559 
we don't know how the brain is receiving
out<00:07:25.569> that<00:07:25.779> and<00:07:25.990> then<00:07:26.440> also<00:07:26.830> maybe<00:07:27.419> some<00:07:28.419> people

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:28.569 
out that and then also maybe some people

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:30.329 
out that and then also maybe some people
that<00:07:28.930> because<00:07:29.379> there's<00:07:29.589> some<00:07:29.860> studies

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:30.339 
that because there's some studies

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.490 
that because there's some studies
showing<00:07:30.639> that<00:07:30.789> when<00:07:31.569> you<00:07:31.690> do<00:07:31.930> physical

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
showing that when you do physical

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.040 
showing that when you do physical
activity<00:07:32.529> you<00:07:33.279> have<00:07:33.490> a<00:07:33.539> you<00:07:34.539> can<00:07:34.810> increase

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
activity you have a you can increase

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.519 
activity you have a you can increase
your<00:07:35.169> memory<00:07:35.680> you<00:07:36.460> have<00:07:36.759> a<00:07:36.930> decrease<00:07:37.930> the

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:38.529 
your memory you have a decrease the

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:43.019 
your memory you have a decrease the
stroke<00:07:39.370> possibilities<00:07:40.240> so<00:07:41.020> but<00:07:41.500> y<00:07:41.830> know<00:07:42.189> so<00:07:42.819> we

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:43.029 
stroke possibilities so but y know so we

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:47.999 
stroke possibilities so but y know so we
want<00:07:43.240> to<00:07:43.300> see<00:07:43.719> how<00:07:43.960> the<00:07:45.240> exercise<00:07:46.240> can<00:07:47.169> deal

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:48.009 
want to see how the exercise can deal

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.950 
want to see how the exercise can deal
with<00:07:48.250> this<00:07:48.430> what's<00:07:48.759> the<00:07:49.240> whole<00:07:49.569> of<00:07:49.599> the

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 
with this what's the whole of the

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.589 
with this what's the whole of the
exercise<00:07:50.409> on<00:07:50.650> this<00:07:50.860> so<00:07:51.339> we'll<00:07:51.580> have<00:07:51.939> a<00:07:52.180> closer

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 
exercise on this so we'll have a closer

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:56.119 
exercise on this so we'll have a closer
mechanisms<00:07:53.469> to<00:07:53.650> that<00:07:54.279> specific<00:07:54.969> explanation

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:56.129 
mechanisms to that specific explanation

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:59.339 
mechanisms to that specific explanation
the<00:07:57.129> data<00:07:57.400> has<00:07:57.669> been<00:07:57.699> collected<00:07:58.060> and<00:07:58.569> now<00:07:59.080> back

00:07:59.339 --> 00:07:59.349 
the data has been collected and now back

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:02.519 
the data has been collected and now back
in<00:07:59.560> Brazil<00:07:59.979> fontes<00:08:00.879> will<00:08:01.180> study<00:08:01.479> it<00:08:01.719> and<00:08:01.960> draw

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:02.529 
in Brazil fontes will study it and draw

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:04.589 
in Brazil fontes will study it and draw
conclusions<00:08:02.560> and<00:08:03.460> findings<00:08:03.729> that<00:08:04.240> will<00:08:04.419> be

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 
conclusions and findings that will be

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:08.069 
conclusions and findings that will be
released<00:08:04.779> later<00:08:05.229> in<00:08:05.589> the<00:08:05.830> year
