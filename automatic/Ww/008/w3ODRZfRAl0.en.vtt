 I do not know if the search bar was originally there. It looks like it has a search bar. 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.549
 This can be seen by a set 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.020
 For unneeded cards, the ability to extract is the same 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.710

 Once in Daejeon, 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.709
 There are two types of general pre-grades like this : 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.709
 If you need it, it's the same. The music is the same. 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.330

 Hold the card down and you'll get the information. 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.650
 There's information on the card and anyone who's been summoned can come back . 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:13.250
 If there's one thing that's not good enough, just touch it and it will not come out. 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:19.639
 I had to keep it, but I hated it. 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:23.509

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:27.979
 Pressing the icon the character came out the macro you while chatting over 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:30.580
