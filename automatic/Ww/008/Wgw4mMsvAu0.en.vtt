00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.350
 this video we will learn to elaborate a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.900
 paper basket like this well let's 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.650
 see how the materials are made 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.320
 use are a letter size sheet 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.960
 scissors and glue first 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.350
 we will take our letter size sheet and the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.350
 we will double 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.500
 in this way with the help of 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:31.300
 scissors we will cut this strip once 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.259
 cut we will keep this strip 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.259
 and we will double them 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.000
 obtaining a square with a diagonal 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.579
 then we will double over that 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.170
 diagonal 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.170
 to mark the other 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.600
 we unfold 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.410
 and turn around we have our square 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 bending by the halves 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.840
 we unfold and we will fold in half in 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.840
 the other way 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.499
 well we will pull this way and 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.140
 we will take the two ends of the part 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.990
 lower and we'll put them together 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.740
 and we will get this figure below 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.190
 We take a corner to the right side 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.190
 and the other one in the opposite direction and 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.380
 we will obtain a small square with the 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.770
 tips on the bottom 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.400
 then we will take a tip and the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.550
 we will take to the top and 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.650
 we will mark and again we will take the 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.200
 tip wearing it 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.549
 to the center 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.840
 in this way and we will fold carrying this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.840
 shore to the center 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.869
 until you get this figure well flipped 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.800
 We have and we will do the same procedure 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.569
 with this tip you have finished this 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.290
 What we will do is take our 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.290
 figure and open it by inserting these folds 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.090
 in this way and we will get two more 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.590
 tips we will take the tip we will take 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.590
 to the top 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.600
 and again to the center part 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.760
 and we'll leave it for a moment 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.920
 we will take the strip that we had cut 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.440
 and what we will do with it will be to fold it 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.580
 in half 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.190
 we unfold 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.270
 and we will take the lower and upper side 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.270
 to the center 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.230
 in this way and again we will double 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.650
 until you get a small strip 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.650
 we fold the strip in this way 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.659
 well and we will take our 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.660
 figure and what we will do is put the strip 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:26.210
 behind this triangle that is observed 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.170
 and now we will fold carrying this 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.170
 shore to the center 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.950
 in this way we turn and do what 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.550
 same leading the shore 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.660
 in the upper part 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.040
 then to the center 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.569
 we put our strip 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.569
 and again we will double 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.450
 thus 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.629
 well the next thing is to turn our 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.610
 figure in this way and what we will do 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.260
 is to unfold 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:11.010
 once 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.010
 and we will take these two points to the center 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.629
 in this way we will carry the other 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.639
 already having the two tips in the center 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.639
 what we will do is to fold again 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.919
 in this way we have turned and we will do 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.860
 same on this side when we have already 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.050
 doubled the two points we will observe that 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.380
 we stick out some eyelashes 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.520
 part of bottom for it we will return to 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.300
 unfold and we will fold them 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.300
 into 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.620
 thus 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.620
 well we double the other 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.919
 and we will bend down again 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.080
 we turn around and do the same thing about this 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.659
 side 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.659
 inward folding tabs 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.970
 and we will also observe that they excel 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.169
 these tips what we have to do is 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.169
 open and fold them 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.240
 inward 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.230
 in this way we will do the same thing 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.180
 other side 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.180
 we will bend these points inwards 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.150
 until you get this figure here is where 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.379
 we can use if you want a bit of 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:01.520
 glue so you have more grip you 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:03.669
 we put and we think we put of the other 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.669
 side 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.280
 and we will fold this point up 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.300
 for the brands that give us these 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.300
 small triangles 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.939
 thus 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:28.650
 well we press and unfold and 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.650
 finally we will open 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.939
 in this way we have already finished our 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:42.680
 paper basket I hope you have them 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.749
 liked and if you liked it do not forget 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.370
