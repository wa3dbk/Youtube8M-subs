hundred percent throttle

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.020 
hundred percent throttle
and<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.050> real<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.500> won't<00:02:25.710> spin<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.550> engine

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and the real just won't spin this engine

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.420 
and the real just won't spin this engine
was<00:02:27.330> built<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:28.050> move<00:02:28.260> heavy<00:02:28.530> trains<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.340> get

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
was built to move heavy trains and get

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.760 
was built to move heavy trains and get
them<00:02:29.610> started<00:02:29.880> quick<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.540> keep<00:02:31.170> moving<00:02:31.380> quick

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
them started quick and keep moving quick

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.170 
them started quick and keep moving quick
and<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.310> around<00:02:32.700> where<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.970> get

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and I think this is around where I get

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
and I think this is around where I get
to<00:02:33.360> there's<00:02:33.540> really<00:02:33.900> high<00:02:34.170> speeds<00:02:34.560> um<00:02:36.140> and

cool<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.360> looks<00:04:03.420> but<00:04:04.200> i'm<00:04:04.350> still<00:04:04.650> doing<00:04:04.860> all

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
cool it looks but i'm still doing all

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.280 
cool it looks but i'm still doing all
the<00:04:05.340> work<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:06.240> is<00:04:06.420> what<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.750> really<00:04:06.990> get

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
the work and this is what you really get

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.010 
the work and this is what you really get
to<00:04:07.320> watch<00:04:07.610> so<00:04:08.610> that's<00:04:09.090> why<00:04:09.270> i<00:04:09.300> leave<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.870> up

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
to watch so that's why i leave that up

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.720 
to watch so that's why i leave that up
now<00:04:10.800> we're<00:04:11.459> going<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.790> get<00:04:12.080> about<00:04:13.970> 40<00:04:14.970> minutes

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
now we're going to get about 40 minutes

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.849 
now we're going to get about 40 minutes
distance<00:04:17.730> at<00:04:18.330> about<00:04:18.690> 50<00:04:18.959> miles<00:04:19.140> an<00:04:19.380> hour<00:04:19.470> i

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
distance at about 50 miles an hour i

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.410 
distance at about 50 miles an hour i
guess<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.190> could<00:04:20.280> say<00:04:20.640> averaging<00:04:21.120> because<00:04:21.390> i

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
guess you could say averaging because i

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.220 
guess you could say averaging because i
was<00:04:21.600> running<00:04:21.780> at<00:04:21.989> 35<00:04:22.410> i<00:04:22.440> was<00:04:22.800> running<00:04:22.920> at<00:04:23.070> 75<00:04:23.730> i

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230
