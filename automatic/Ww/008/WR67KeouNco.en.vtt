00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:26.530
 I have been in heat for days 

00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:31.251
 So I'll hunt me a bald wild 

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:35.816
 And by the morning I'm sitting 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.240
 So I can give shots 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.596
 In the country, on the sea, 

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.973
 Death is waiting 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.281
 The creature must die! 

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:01.594
 To die! 

00:01:09.373 --> 00:01:11.955
 A Schmaltier comes on the runs 

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:14.546
 Has sunbathed in the high thatch 

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:20.981
 Good track, deep in the Tann 

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.606
 The mirror shines, I'm baking 

00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:30.155
 The fronds twitch like Fingeraal 

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.732
 The shotgun jumps from the sheath 

00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:35.628
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.374
 I sweep the bast from the horn 

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:41.934
 And give her a dashed grain 

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:44.888
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:48.667
 In the country, on the sea, 

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.104
 Death is waiting 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.299
 The creature must die! 

00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.638
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:05.401
 To die! 

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:10.136
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:50.904
 She feels the muzzle energy 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.560
 Fine sweat drips on the knee 

00:02:56.981 --> 00:03:04.139
 In the country, on the sea lurks spoiling 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.969
 The creature must die! 

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:14.045
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:18.795
 To die! 

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:23.002
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:27.940
 In the countryside, on the sea ... 

00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:32.204
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:40.888
 In the country, on the sea lurks spoiling 

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:44.546
 The creature must die!
