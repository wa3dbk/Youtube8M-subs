00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 Look, we'll just do a little bit of work. 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.080
 dulce de leche with strawberry and let's go 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.509
 start with the dough when you call it dough 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.300
 of loaf of bread they observe eight eggs 8 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:21.060
 flour soup looks 8 tablespoons 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.730
 sugar soup and a tablespoon 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.820
 different then you will separate the eggs 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.269
 of the clear will hit first is clear 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:39.450
 the screen turn a screen see the snow after 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:41.250
 I managed to run the snow in the clear snow 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.070
 is ready 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.720
 You see she 's fine, she does not. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 either from the pot with the aim but take 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.490
 careful not to turn and she will fall 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.500
 here is her point 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.500
 and now we're going to hit the gem 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.870
 This is the point of clear with sugar 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.140
 you see that it has doubled in size and 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.450
 was not clear or will put all your 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 work that only has clear and juice 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.300
 and now you are slowly putting the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.550
 flour and finally the yeast after 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.340
 you turn a dough you go 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.110
 mix everything that you're going to put 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.180
 the snow white 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.320
 now you will not use the mixer anymore 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.100
 all this you will mixed with the hand 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.970
 now all mixed here has the flour 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.560
 yeast eggs and sugar 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.289
 So you have to do that step to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.860
 step mixed everything now you go 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.000
 add the snow white gradually 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 until everything is even 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.289
 hence the whole mixture 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.240
 consistency that will stay 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.390
 so you get better with patience 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 the flour until it reaches that point in a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.800
 smeared 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.929
 this one has set by 25 if not me 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.020
 but you can put it in another 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.069
 so it can get the highest 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.989
 larger 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:24.030
 you'll dump the whole dough into shape 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.709
 the whole nation is shaken by the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.270
 uniform fiction 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.930
 you can also generate 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.960
 She and you are now going to put an end in the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.040
 180 degree plane around 40 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.890
 minutes can be 180 to 200 degrees oven 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.610
 preheated but only you feel the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.890
 smell is to see that the tackles will start to 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.100
 ask us if you can put a fork 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.850
 inside to see if your 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.230
 cake 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.020
 the cake then you know you see that he 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.730
 loose a little on the side you 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.720
 put it close in to see if it's 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.620
 cecchim 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.880
 now just fill now for the filling 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.620
 I cut the cake in three parts 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.330
 by my somewhat higher training 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.160
 gave me three pieces to cut 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.720
 this reason it is a good way more 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.440
 altinha then we're going to need both 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.660
 Alexei buys the whipped cream 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.390
 cream sweet forgiveness milk 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.400
 what have we done now that I'm going to show 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.660
 in another video for you is also a 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.890
 dulce de leche made with condensed milk 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.900
 strawberry or may be any other type 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.330
 of fruit you want 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.299
 if you do not like fruit, I do not want 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.290
 put black can put the candy of 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.470
 milk 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.590
 to manuel bordachov very wet me 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.690
 I put milk, you can now 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.180
 You can also put some of me 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.570
 some alcoholic drink to stay too 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.080
 with a good taste so we will look 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.459
 the cake and pass the filling and 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.620
 complete with coverage 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.680
 remembering that I cut the side that the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.080
 that the drier part of the cake 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.049
 here you can eat then you do not need 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.340
 play phone because she'll be much better 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.709
 a look will not get any 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.930
 dry cake 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.790
 I just passed dulce de leche 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.680
 now we are going to the second part that I 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.260
 I'm going to look at this part too and put 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.990
 whipped cream and strawberries 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.880
 the other part of the continent strawberry and 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.610
 to finish I'll put the lid 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.889
 cake and put the rest of the whipped cream and 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.550
 also booking 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.800
 the strawberry to put on top to give 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.520
 an end point 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.900
 then the finished cake and whipped cream with 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.900
