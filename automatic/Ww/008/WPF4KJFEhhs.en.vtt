00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.779
 hello today we are going to change the brushes 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.180
 wipers of a golf tdi 1900 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.420
 for this you do not need tools just 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.540
 the new brush and a cardboard 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.100
 what will cause the cardboard to protect 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.460
 the windshield of the arm of 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.460
 wiper washer 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.270
 this way you will prevent the arm from hitting the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.629
 windshield and can damage it places the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.629
 paperboard 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.380
 raise the first arm 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.570
 and the second 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.129
 Once the cardboard is placed you can 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.429
 proceed to change the brushes 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.429
 wiper washer 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.180
 raise the first arm 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:11.700
 I with the brush at 48 degrees 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.450
 and now pushes loop down to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.450
 unhook the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.090
 returns to lower the arm of 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.090
 wiper washer 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.450
 and now I'm with the rule that brings 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.450
 the box where you will see a white mark 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.940
 put it from scratch 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.390
 the brush has to reach the mark 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.700
 white that indicates a total of 480 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.439
 millimeters 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.619
 the new one measures 48 centimeters 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.619
 take it out and compare the hooks 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.619
