00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.080
 So you need the clearing needed 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.560
 man a and the knee joints f series 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.680
 or wide jumps to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.250
 on the other hand, spare for the pain 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.900
 alleviate 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.609
 through sub-parts sub-roll in three 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.760
 steps once the landing then the 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.379
 roll yourself and get up so 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.210
 once the landing on 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.789
 so it plays two different 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.740
 landings once by hand and with 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.520
 the elbow 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.930
 the beginner or the most use 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.440
 win and are actually the hand 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.640
 the least of the hands 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.640
 so now 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.830
 Once done, the form asks the whole 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.830
 in the 19th 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.350
 turn around 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.810
 So the role leads from the shoulder 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.840
 down to the left hip and he is seated 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.110
 then with the associated two 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.110
 on 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.420
 and then will belong 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.460
 and if and when
