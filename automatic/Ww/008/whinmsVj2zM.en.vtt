to tell you all about this exciting new
graphics<00:00:40.290> card<00:00:40.350> cover<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.579> of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
graphics card cover a little bit of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.369 
graphics card cover a little bit of
performance<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.420> well<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.660> tell<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.200> about

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
performance as well as tell you about

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.170 
performance as well as tell you about
the<00:00:43.860> features<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.789> set<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> apart

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the features that really set it apart

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.250 
the features that really set it apart
from<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> competition<00:00:50.629> now<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:52.079> thing

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
from the competition now the first thing

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
from the competition now the first thing
that<00:00:52.410> stands<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.430> GeForce<00:00:53.820> GTX

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that stands out about the GeForce GTX

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
that stands out about the GeForce GTX
670<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> fact<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.309> said<00:00:56.340> before

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
670 is the fact that like I said before

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.170 
670 is the fact that like I said before
its<00:00:57.510> specs<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.620> similar<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> GTX<00:00:59.789> 680

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
its specs are so similar to the GTX 680

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
its specs are so similar to the GTX 680
so<00:01:00.570> you've<00:01:01.140> cut<00:01:01.440> down<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> few<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> cuda

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so you've cut down a few of the cuda

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
so you've cut down a few of the cuda
cores<00:01:02.460> you've<00:01:03.210> also<00:01:03.420> knocked<00:01:04.019> down<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> clock

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
cores you've also knocked down the clock

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.140 
cores you've also knocked down the clock
speed<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.129> although<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.060> be

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
speed a little bit although that can be

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
speed a little bit although that can be
addressed<00:01:06.360> more<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.960> later<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.729> finally

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
addressed more on that later and finally

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.200 
addressed more on that later and finally
you<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.260> no<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.580> instead<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
you have no that's it so instead of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240 
you have no that's it so instead of
knocking<00:01:12.869> down<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.200> memory<00:01:13.380> speed<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
knocking down the memory speed or the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.429 
knocking down the memory speed or the
memory<00:01:14.460> interface<00:01:15.030> NVIDIA<00:01:15.570> has<00:01:15.630> opted<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.170> to

memory interface NVIDIA has opted not to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.830 
memory interface NVIDIA has opted not to
do<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.850> few<00:01:18.180> fewer<00:01:18.450> CUDA

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
do that so that's it a few fewer CUDA

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
do that so that's it a few fewer CUDA
cores<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.680> slightly<00:01:19.920> lower<00:01:20.159> clock<00:01:20.490> speed

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
cores and a slightly lower clock speed

and I mentioned three divisions surround
but<00:03:08.750> what<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.900> didn't<00:03:09.230> mention<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:10.280> just

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
but what I didn't mention is that just

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.119 
but what I didn't mention is that just
like<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.150> 680<00:03:11.719> it<00:03:12.079> can<00:03:12.379> do<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.620> off<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.769> single

performance in 3-way SLI with invidious
around<00:05:44.479> so<00:05:44.780> you<00:05:44.840> can<00:05:45.110> see<00:05:45.140> here<00:05:45.710> that<00:05:46.250> this

violent oh yeah okay anyway I think you

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.890 
violent oh yeah okay anyway I think you
guys<00:06:34.789> pretty<00:06:35.060> much<00:06:35.150> get<00:06:35.419> the<00:06:35.539> point

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
guys pretty much get the point

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.620 
guys pretty much get the point
does<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.590> GTX<00:06:37.039> 670<00:06:37.460> absolutely<00:06:38.300> destroy

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
does the GTX 670 absolutely destroy

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.420 
does the GTX 670 absolutely destroy
Skyrim<00:06:39.200> in<00:06:39.320> terms<00:06:39.530> of<00:06:39.650> performance

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
Skyrim in terms of performance

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.590 
Skyrim in terms of performance
the<00:06:40.610> answer<00:06:40.940> is<00:06:41.120> a<00:06:41.389> resounding<00:06:41.900> yes<00:06:42.560> and<00:06:43.600> of

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
the answer is a resounding yes and of

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.930 
the answer is a resounding yes and of
course<00:06:44.870> there's<00:06:45.169> the<00:06:45.350> classic<00:06:45.590> but<00:06:46.490> can<00:06:46.790> it

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
course there's the classic but can it

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.090 
course there's the classic but can it
run<00:06:47.150> crisis<00:06:47.870> and<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.110> answer<00:06:48.410> is<00:06:48.530> yes<00:06:48.830> we

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
run crisis and the answer is yes we

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.980 
run crisis and the answer is yes we
aren't<00:06:49.610> at<00:06:49.729> Ultra<00:06:50.150> we<00:06:50.300> are<00:06:50.419> at<00:06:50.570> very<00:06:50.900> high

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
aren't at Ultra we are at very high

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.260 
aren't at Ultra we are at very high
however<00:06:51.620> I<00:06:51.710> am<00:06:51.949> using<00:06:52.250> the<00:06:52.460> high<00:06:52.610> res<00:06:52.820> texture

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
however I am using the high res texture

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.610 
however I am using the high res texture
pack<00:06:53.419> which<00:06:53.630> is<00:06:53.780> pretty<00:06:53.960> good<00:06:54.199> considering

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
pack which is pretty good considering

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.219 
pack which is pretty good considering
that<00:06:54.949> we<00:06:55.460> only<00:06:55.610> have<00:06:55.940> two<00:06:56.210> gig<00:06:56.449> cards<00:06:56.810> here<00:06:56.990> so

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:57.229 
that we only have two gig cards here so

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.379 
that we only have two gig cards here so
if<00:06:57.289> we<00:06:57.350> had<00:06:57.560> four<00:06:57.830> gig<00:06:58.039> cards<00:06:58.370> I<00:06:58.580> would<00:06:59.060> expect

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
if we had four gig cards I would expect

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:00.840 
if we had four gig cards I would expect
to<00:06:59.479> see<00:06:59.570> slightly<00:06:59.990> better<00:07:00.259> performance

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
to see slightly better performance

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.710 
to see slightly better performance
remember<00:07:01.850> guys<00:07:02.030> when<00:07:02.270> you're<00:07:02.419> running<00:07:02.539> a

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
remember guys when you're running a

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.330 
remember guys when you're running a
multi<00:07:03.020> card<00:07:03.229> configuration<00:07:04.009> you<00:07:04.190> only

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
multi card configuration you only

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.909 
multi card configuration you only
effectively<00:07:05.270> have<00:07:05.810> as<00:07:05.990> much<00:07:06.199> memory<00:07:06.470> as<00:07:06.740> you

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
effectively have as much memory as you

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.430 
effectively have as much memory as you
have<00:07:07.520> on<00:07:07.820> a<00:07:07.850> single<00:07:08.300> card<00:07:08.570> so<00:07:08.930> if<00:07:09.139> you<00:07:09.259> have

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
have on a single card so if you have

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.710 
have on a single card so if you have
three<00:07:09.800> two<00:07:09.979> gig<00:07:10.220> cards<00:07:10.580> you're<00:07:11.030> still<00:07:11.300> at<00:07:11.479> two

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
three two gig cards you're still at two

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.570 
three two gig cards you're still at two
gigs<00:07:11.990> effective<00:07:12.500> memory<00:07:12.830> because<00:07:13.160> it<00:07:13.250> has<00:07:13.370> to

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
gigs effective memory because it has to

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.250 
gigs effective memory because it has to
store<00:07:13.760> all<00:07:13.940> of<00:07:13.970> the<00:07:14.210> texture<00:07:14.539> information<00:07:15.080> in

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
store all of the texture information in

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.920 
store all of the texture information in
all<00:07:15.979> of<00:07:16.220> the<00:07:16.370> cards<00:07:16.760> all<00:07:17.030> at<00:07:17.210> the<00:07:17.300> same<00:07:17.449> time<00:07:17.510> so

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
all of the cards all at the same time so

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.260 
all of the cards all at the same time so
we're<00:07:18.080> not<00:07:18.169> dipping<00:07:18.440> below<00:07:18.650> 30<00:07:19.070> FPS<00:07:19.520> which<00:07:20.090> in

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
we're not dipping below 30 FPS which in

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.879 
we're not dipping below 30 FPS which in
Crysis<00:07:20.690> 2<00:07:20.720> actually<00:07:21.080> delivers<00:07:21.650> a<00:07:21.680> very

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:21.889 
Crysis 2 actually delivers a very

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:23.890 
Crysis 2 actually delivers a very
satisfactory<00:07:22.699> gaming<00:07:23.060> experience<00:07:23.539> because

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
satisfactory gaming experience because

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.659 
satisfactory gaming experience because
of<00:07:23.930> the<00:07:24.080> motion<00:07:24.320> blur<00:07:24.680> and<00:07:24.860> just<00:07:25.490> the

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669 
of the motion blur and just the

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:27.939 
of the motion blur and just the
tolerance<00:07:26.150> that<00:07:26.300> the<00:07:26.449> engine<00:07:26.720> has<00:07:26.900> for<00:07:27.350> lower

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949 
tolerance that the engine has for lower

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.370 
tolerance that the engine has for lower
frame<00:07:28.340> rates<00:07:28.639> I<00:07:28.910> think<00:07:29.479> this<00:07:29.960> pretty<00:07:30.229> much

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.380 
frame rates I think this pretty much

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.219 
frame rates I think this pretty much
wraps<00:07:30.860> it<00:07:31.070> up<00:07:31.190> if<00:07:31.490> you<00:07:32.120> want<00:07:32.330> to<00:07:32.449> see<00:07:32.630> single

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:33.229 
wraps it up if you want to see single

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:35.230
