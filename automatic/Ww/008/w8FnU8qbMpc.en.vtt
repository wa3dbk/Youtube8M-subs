 consecutive in the start the tournament of 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.600
 Mexican opening 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.239
 once 4 to 0 before jaguars of chiapas and

 the other 2 to 1 against atlante the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.600
 last saturday the tuca ferretti was very 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.479
 respectful when referring to the real team 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.509
 Here is the conversation with the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.119
 tuca is a professional team a team 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.280
 that deserves all my respect and so they go 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.729
 to take my players 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.450
 we do not put anyone up or 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.759
 nobody down are professionals like 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.400
 we think it's going to be a 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.400
 difficult match and that we should 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.580
 to be attentive and humble in this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.580
 appearance 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.460
 but this tournament we intend to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.570
 combine that make a combination 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.390
 because the tournament lends itself to power now 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.909
 opportunity towards your elements that yes 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.820
 they deserve to give rest to these 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.060
 elements that they must have but with the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.729
 same seriousness as always has the fact 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.799
 that I put these players in the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.970
 court does not mean that it is 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.929
 disparaging neither the tournament nor the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:09.560
 rivals this never the seriousness of 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:13.069
 always but I have a group of 28 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.700
 players that I had to count on 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.819
 20 from the list and from the list of 20 go to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.960
 custom of speaking individually I 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.360
 I only talk about collective things and you 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.180
 I explain why because whenever I try 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.430
 to explain some individual thing they 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.310

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.710
