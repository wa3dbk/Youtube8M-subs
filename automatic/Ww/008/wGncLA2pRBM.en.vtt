leaving the outer pocket to be on the
outside<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:18.330> easy<00:00:18.449> access<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:19.859> there's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
outside for easy access and there's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.480 
outside for easy access and there's
magnets<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
magnets here in here so that when you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.109 
magnets here in here so that when you
close<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.840> its<00:00:25.400> closes<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.789> actually

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
close it its closes and it's actually

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.009 
close it its closes and it's actually
pretty<00:00:27.269> firm

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
pretty firm

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
pretty firm
I<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.470> barely<00:00:28.710> actually<00:00:29.340> open<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.179> with

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
I can barely actually open this up with

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.749 
I can barely actually open this up with
one<00:00:30.599> hand<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.679> annoying<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
one hand and it's really annoying so I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.120 
one hand and it's really annoying so I
bet<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.120> you're<00:00:33.270> running<00:00:33.500> doesn't<00:00:34.500> open<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
bet when you're running doesn't open and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.880 
bet when you're running doesn't open and
since<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> magnets<00:00:36.390> are<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:37.079> here

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
since the magnets are going to be here

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.610 
since the magnets are going to be here
and<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.079> shouldn't<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and here you shouldn't really have to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.440 
and here you shouldn't really have to
worry<00:00:40.829> about<00:00:41.570> magnets<00:00:42.570> being<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.050> your<00:00:43.230> phone

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
worry about magnets being in your phone

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.200 
worry about magnets being in your phone

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
through here by the looks looks

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.170 
through here by the looks looks
water-resistant<00:01:10.100> because<00:01:11.100> there's<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
water-resistant because there's like a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.969 
water-resistant because there's like a
webbing<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.430> layers<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> webbing<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you have and um see if magnets would

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.039 
you have and um see if magnets would
affect<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.979> iPhone<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.360> other<00:01:42.630> than<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.899> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
