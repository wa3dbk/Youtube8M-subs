00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
thing kind of started off earlier in the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
thing kind of started off earlier in the
week<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.570> he<00:00:27.689> he<00:00:28.380> used<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.859> minor<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.460> his

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
week when he he used a minor in his

avatar<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.210> Paul<00:00:30.420> Joe<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.669> was<00:00:32.669> like

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
avatar on Paul Joe and I was like

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.299 
avatar on Paul Joe and I was like
rolling<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> saying<00:00:34.470> that<00:00:34.710> blue<00:00:34.920> cyl<00:00:35.159> was

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
rolling on it saying that blue cyl was

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.229 
rolling on it saying that blue cyl was
better<00:00:36.019> so<00:00:37.019> we<00:00:37.140> decided<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:38.059> get<00:00:39.059> our

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
better so we decided to get our

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.960 
better so we decided to get our
metronome<00:00:39.839> on<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.440> decide<00:00:41.280> which<00:00:41.519> one<00:00:41.760> was

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
metronome on and decide which one was

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.689 
metronome on and decide which one was
better<00:00:42.260> for<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.409> you'll<00:00:43.620> soon<00:00:43.830> see<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.430> does

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
better for as you'll soon see this does

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.729 
better for as you'll soon see this does
not<00:00:45.000> decide<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:45.629> one's<00:00:45.809> better<00:00:46.019> this<00:00:46.379> just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
not decide which one's better this just

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.149 
not decide which one's better this just
decides<00:00:47.159> which<00:00:47.729> one<00:00:48.059> has<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.750> most<00:00:49.470> insane

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
decides which one has the most insane

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.570 
decides which one has the most insane
look<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:52.290> it's<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:53.040> now<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
look because I think it's right now is

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.460 
look because I think it's right now is
the<00:00:54.119> move<00:00:54.299> that<00:00:54.330> pretty<00:00:54.750> much<00:00:54.930> seals<00:00:55.290> the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
the move that pretty much seals the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.060 
the move that pretty much seals the
March<00:00:56.000> yep<00:00:57.000> there<00:00:57.269> we<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.720> prison<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.470> when

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
March yep there we go in prison and when

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.380 
March yep there we go in prison and when
you<00:00:59.159> get<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.549> the<00:00:59.640> metronome<00:01:00.030> bottle<00:01:00.360> I

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you get that in the metronome bottle I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.759 
you get that in the metronome bottle I
don't<00:01:00.689> know<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:00.839> anybody<00:01:01.140> else<00:01:01.290> ever<00:01:01.589> has

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
don't know if anybody else ever has

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.000 
don't know if anybody else ever has
before<00:01:02.119> but<00:01:03.119> you<00:01:03.689> basically<00:01:04.049> win<00:01:04.320> because

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.960 

that<00:01:08.010> move<00:01:08.250> stops<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.180> opponent<00:01:09.660> using<00:01:10.970> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that move stops your opponent using the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.840 
that move stops your opponent using the
move<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.600> used<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.610> for<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> rest

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
move they just used I think for the rest

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.250 
move they just used I think for the rest
of<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.030> match<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.480> the<00:01:15.600> rest<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> team

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
of the match and the rest of the team

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.580 
of the match and the rest of the team
can't<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:16.800> it<00:01:16.920> either<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> basically<00:01:18.480> cuz<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
can't use it either so basically cuz the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
can't use it either so basically cuz the
only<00:01:19.830> movie<00:01:20.100> has<00:01:20.250> his<00:01:20.400> metronome<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.180> his

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
only movie has his metronome that his

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.060 
only movie has his metronome that his
whole<00:01:21.480> team<00:01:21.630> can't<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.830> he<00:01:22.920> basically

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
whole team can't use it so he basically

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.620 
whole team can't use it so he basically
has<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> struggle<00:01:23.880> his<00:01:24.120> way<00:01:24.270> through<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
has to struggle his way through the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.130 
has to struggle his way through the
whole<00:01:24.810> match<00:01:26.000> which<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.240> me<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.540> an<00:01:27.690> ironic

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
whole match which to me was an ironic

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
whole match which to me was an ironic
sum<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.620> nylons<00:01:28.860> life<00:01:31.220> yeah<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> probably
