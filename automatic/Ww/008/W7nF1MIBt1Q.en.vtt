your<00:01:53.240> transporter<00:01:54.020> was<00:01:54.170> invented<00:01:54.679> and<00:01:55.130> simply

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
your transporter was invented and simply

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.130 
your transporter was invented and simply
watched<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.149> from<00:01:56.329> inception<00:01:56.869> to

watched it from inception to

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.080 
watched it from inception to
construction<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:58.340> he<00:01:58.429> couldn't<00:01:58.700> build<00:01:58.880> one

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
construction but he couldn't build one

construction but he couldn't build one
no<00:01:59.810> he<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.649> more<00:02:00.890> than<00:02:01.039> capable<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.609> designing

one but so non-prime does not have the
