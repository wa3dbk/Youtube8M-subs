with the chemistry of it and you won't
get<00:00:47.409> your<00:00:47.679> you'll<00:00:48.489> go<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:48.909> this<00:00:49.600> whole<00:00:49.809> process

yeast proof in your quarter cup of water

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.829 
yeast proof in your quarter cup of water
make<00:01:00.609> sure<00:01:00.639> your<00:01:00.909> waters<00:01:01.239> are<00:01:01.359> between<00:01:01.569> a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
make sure your waters are between a

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.100 
make sure your waters are between a
hundred<00:01:02.139> seven<00:01:02.649> ten<00:01:02.920> degrees<00:01:03.540> so<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.690> get<00:01:04.900> a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
hundred seven ten degrees so you get a

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.960 
hundred seven ten degrees so you get a
good<00:01:10.380> after<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.500> activate<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:12.190> yeast<00:01:12.490> let

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
good after you activate your yeast let

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.940 
good after you activate your yeast let
it<00:01:13.060> sit<00:01:13.300> for<00:01:13.330> ten<00:01:13.720> minutes<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:14.110> can<00:01:14.380> see<00:01:14.680> that

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
it sit for ten minutes you can see that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.300 
it sit for ten minutes you can see that
mine<00:01:15.190> is<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.430> little<00:01:15.640> bit<00:01:15.820> foamy<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:18.130> been

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
mine is a little bit foamy it's been

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.710 
mine is a little bit foamy it's been
sitting<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:18.670> about<00:01:18.850> ten<00:01:19.270> minutes

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
sitting for about ten minutes

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.180 
sitting for about ten minutes
