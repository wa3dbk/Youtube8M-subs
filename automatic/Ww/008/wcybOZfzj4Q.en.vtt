to mention for the parents is because I

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.600

mushrooms growing every day I hear about

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.440 
mushrooms growing every day I hear about
a<00:03:04.380> new<00:03:04.470> site<00:03:04.860> asked<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.580> him<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.940> really<00:03:06.330> don't

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
a new site asked if him I really don't

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.449 
a new site asked if him I really don't
like<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.620> we<00:03:07.770> brought<00:03:08.280> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
like it but I think if we brought it

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.030 
like it but I think if we brought it
down<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.270> know<00:03:09.360> if<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.660> asked<00:03:10.020> people<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.739> stop

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
down you know if we asked people to stop

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.520 
down you know if we asked people to stop
the<00:03:11.190> side<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:12.030> would<00:03:12.180> only<00:03:12.330> find<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.810> new<00:03:12.959> one<00:03:13.140> so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
the side we would only find a new one so

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.690 
the side we would only find a new one so
I'm<00:03:13.709> not<00:03:13.860> sure<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.340> would<00:03:14.670> be

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
I'm not sure that that would be

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.670 
I'm not sure that that would be
disillusioned<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.140> parents<00:03:16.560> out

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
disillusioned but for the parents out

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.100 
disillusioned but for the parents out
there<00:03:16.709> honest<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.580> vehm<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.269> terrible

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.630 
there honest as the vehm it's terrible
it<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:20.010> terrible<00:03:20.489> because<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.880> gives<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.239> the
