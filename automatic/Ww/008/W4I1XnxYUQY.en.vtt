00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to shouldn't be too hard just like a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.039 
to shouldn't be too hard just like a
charm

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
charm

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
charm
next<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.409> Gatling<00:01:35.070> death<00:01:35.369> shell<00:01:35.729> with

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
next up it's Gatling death shell with

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.899 
next up it's Gatling death shell with
the<00:01:36.689> direct<00:01:37.079> loader<00:01:37.350> wide<00:01:37.710> magazine<00:01:38.369> combo

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
now it's time for jet lyosha another

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.090 
now it's time for jet lyosha another
very<00:02:12.360> tricky<00:02:12.900> b-daman<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.800> haven't

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
very tricky b-daman that I haven't

very tricky b-daman that I haven't
played<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> while<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.430> should<00:02:17.640> be

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
played with in a while so this should be

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.380 
played with in a while so this should be
interesting

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.210 

yeah<00:02:21.390> we'll<00:02:22.230> probably<00:02:22.410> need<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> emblem

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220

playing with this b-daman is like it's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.610 
playing with this b-daman is like it's
like<00:02:47.520> petting<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.970> lion<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:49.170> got<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.410> do<00:02:49.500> it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
like petting a lion you got to do it

just right

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.699 
just right
or<00:02:50.820> it'll<00:02:51.000> claw<00:02:51.240> your<00:02:51.450> face<00:02:51.510> off<00:02:54.320> yeah<00:02:55.320> it

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.870 
would probably have to load the beat him
on<00:02:57.090> first<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.560> forget<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.980> step<00:02:59.190> yeah

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
on first I just forget that step yeah

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.580 
on first I just forget that step yeah

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.120 
there we go if it wasn't tricky it
wouldn't<00:03:27.440> be<00:03:27.530> fun

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
wouldn't be fun

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.790 
wouldn't be fun

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
gave death shell just to see what

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.020 
gave death shell just to see what
happens

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
happens

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.720 
happens
oh<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:14.480> actually<00:04:14.570> works<00:04:14.900> pretty<00:04:14.990> well

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
oh that actually works pretty well

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.870 
oh that actually works pretty well
anyway<00:04:17.080> let's<00:04:18.080> do<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.470> bad<00:04:18.710> way<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.430> hate

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
anyway let's do it the bad way I hate

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:29.250 
anyway let's do it the bad way I hate
this<00:04:20.060> kind<00:04:20.270> of<00:04:20.420> grip

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.390 

stop<00:04:31.360> stop<00:04:32.360> roll<00:04:32.630> around<00:04:32.810> be<00:04:33.410> gone<00:04:33.560> with<00:04:33.800> you

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.250 

so<00:04:37.400> we<00:04:37.520> got<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:37.700> little<00:04:38.060> taste<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.750> with<00:04:38.960> less

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
so we got a little taste of it with less

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.160 
so we got a little taste of it with less
Starion<00:04:40.010> but<00:04:40.490> instead<00:04:41.150> of<00:04:41.210> having<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.930> deal

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
Starion but instead of having to deal

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.220 
Starion but instead of having to deal
with<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.650> one-handed<00:04:43.370> grip<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.540> dislike

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
with the one-handed grip that I dislike

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.640 
with the one-handed grip that I dislike
so<00:04:45.530> much<00:04:45.770> a<00:04:46.190> second<00:04:47.090> time<00:04:47.420> I<00:04:47.810> thought<00:04:48.590> that

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
so much a second time I thought that

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.340 
so much a second time I thought that
with<00:04:49.280> right<00:04:49.550> Drake<00:04:49.940> we'd<00:04:50.330> follow<00:04:50.630> through<00:04:51.050> and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
with right Drake we'd follow through and

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.120 
with right Drake we'd follow through and
do<00:04:52.010> nothing<00:04:52.580> but<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.390> emblem<00:04:53.840> charge<00:04:54.200> because

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
do nothing but the emblem charge because

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.440 
do nothing but the emblem charge because
that<00:04:55.340> was<00:04:55.580> interesting

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
that was interesting

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.290 
that was interesting
it<00:04:57.020> also<00:04:57.200> means<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:58.040> get<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.460> hold<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:59.030> with<00:04:59.270> two

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
it also means I get to hold it with two

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.700 
it also means I get to hold it with two
hands<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.920> much<00:05:01.100> prefer<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:05.710> emblem

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
hands and I much prefer that emblem

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:17.500 
hands and I much prefer that emblem
charge<00:05:15.010> actually<00:05:16.010> puts<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.430> spin<00:05:16.940> on<00:05:17.000> the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
charge actually puts a spin on the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.230 
charge actually puts a spin on the
marble<00:05:17.990> because<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:19.130> emblems<00:05:19.520> only<00:05:19.850> on<00:05:19.970> one

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
marble because the emblems only on one

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.390 
marble because the emblems only on one
side<00:05:22.510> it's<00:05:23.510> actually<00:05:23.720> working<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.830> lot<00:05:25.070> better

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
side it's actually working a lot better

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.750 
side it's actually working a lot better
than<00:05:25.820> even<00:05:26.060> spin<00:05:26.510> lyosha<00:05:26.900> did<00:05:27.290> so<00:05:27.760> there's

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
than even spin lyosha did so there's

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.860 
than even spin lyosha did so there's
that<00:05:30.880> does<00:05:31.880> make<00:05:32.060> him<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.390> little<00:05:32.630> bit

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
that does make him a little bit

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:41.860 
that does make him a little bit
inaccurate<00:05:33.260> though<00:05:37.570> come<00:05:38.570> on<00:05:40.540> you've<00:05:41.540> got<00:05:41.570> to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
inaccurate though come on you've got to

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
inaccurate though come on you've got to
be<00:05:42.230> kidding<00:05:42.530> me

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
be kidding me

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
this thing really gets in the way there
