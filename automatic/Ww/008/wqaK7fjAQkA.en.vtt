 Study up the turn to show and compressed why not 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:20.489
 Today I'll show you 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.489

 in Bonn dated from the Valley of the Winds 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.860
 Neuried Hollerich men firmly Norica Weidenfeld they also called Norica and 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 For me it's Dentsu talk like in the movie 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.190
 that these 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.190
 Pauli Loots was that she was the concession 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.170

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.020
 Tropez Rosso 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.069
 he follows himself 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.840
 everything was for forums 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.840
 Haier Rajan Naser was leaving 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.620
 researches the term o'day around 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.930
 Limburg Schubert 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.590
 There and ran around me 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.700
 on the reputation of the car much more robust years behind the scenes 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.869
 originally 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.869
 the origins of these studies are common 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.720
 Storyboards and 6 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.170
 and the nal cinema trailer 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.370
 very nice things 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.680
 Mr. Koch first four pieces the locks Klein 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.060
 Chapter overview 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.420
 pavilions 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 Percent created goal is a sustainable double-DVD 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 what can this bone find so be void 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.730
 less mature 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.420
 and just as warm as a classic aborted over meters, Healy reports 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 deserves more that did not hit it that way 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.980
 Fernando to send games of the two 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 that's what art has the country for 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.539
 Come on, no one has any kittens 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:25.519
 what you are with 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.519
 namely the concession's special skills 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.000
 Enke I have one with them here 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.630
 It is said that this is not a title that sounds the same 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.519
 she knows what she's got 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.009
 shall we do it 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.019
 as the animals did for these things could be so in this way so no will 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.139
 right, her contact seeks a victory 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.069
 has such a feeling and 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.039
 Wilfried tell them what you are looking for 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.739
 that's pretty good 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.079
 because it is noticeable to them why the animals always react so well 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:56.939
 no idea 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 and not done in the year 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.050
 it's about what 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.610
 Personally and of course there's why stop that 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.749
 after a gruesome war 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.749
 Give the land where it is 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:14.609
 5 percent 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.369
 Fertile he generally is very rare 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.639
 through the war or old 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.159
 Phil the Earth destroys too stupid land and Harald son Jeff Kindler 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.879
 If one wants to come immediately certain sections Dr 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.209
 we are happy and poisonous now 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.909
 and you here 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.589
 Lehmann I contaminated 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:40.349
 Crailsheim really is 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.729
 where to get more after or so they get the back 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.709
 the war is 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.179
 that's how it is in her son 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:55.329
 Today the people are doing what they are trying to serve 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.780
 hell out of it 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.779
 to conquer 4 foreign countries and to 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.779
 Now handle gets what you get from them 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.279
 there it seemed 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.109
 with people is taking a bit 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.309
 Heidel 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.959
 Try on the good 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.959
 good grades Wegrand lives with understanding 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.900
 and so and there is action on the whole 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.860
 so must this war 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.960
 on a big communities there are actually 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.430
 "We have to go to Bochum 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.550
 Interpersonal things have that actually protect the nature 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.279
 should Mundt 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.279
 Moses Chancellor he anyway nature thing 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:36.809
 Althusmann 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.049
 before the conservationists should hear about a Seich before 

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:41.400
 overrun and 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.599
 tries to attack 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.669
 that really nice pictures 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.669
 that's a lot of fun for Michels and me 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.659
 first bite picture HR I look again which date has 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:00.069
 if you go from 19 04 00 4 80 so far 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.449
 Bonus Original Think 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.539
 made 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.639
 and in 2005 I think filmed as far as this 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.009
 that does not change me now in the coupling they change that fast 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.779
 probably from 1904 on she probably is lack and 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.339
 Scheduling fees Hoff set 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:22.639
 but the data will come even more 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.499
 known by me 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:27.339
 unusually hard again into the window like that 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.339
 following so much all over rating 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.009
 So what study remained 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:36.919
 not here either 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.919
 meanwhile I can become quite stibi 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.279
 I can for everyone 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.039
 Film by Luc studies Liang just give this advice look divide 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.680
 if you are mild on him you will too 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.659
 Everything from Studio Ghibli so like 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.659
 that's fun and if you really do not want to animate time 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.439
 Finger way choirmaster Dietmar from Cook 3 and 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.439
 Wenzel fresh new 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.430
 Essen ots it really is already his handshake thing 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.650
 I do 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.650
 the one he's been to Marc from the study because 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.569
 Draftsman sometimes spa lot was fun here to Udo sometimes jams 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.999
 No are so it is such times as the Sagittarius nature 7 percent 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.439
 think about the first one 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.439
 it must have been like a little Maja 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.520
 makes sense always makes fun to see 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.169
 Like us, Halbig Sophora does not pursue this stress test
