taking this one is the better idea what
am<00:01:00.309> i<00:01:00.369> doing<00:01:00.670> using<00:01:00.969> that<00:01:01.059> chain<00:01:01.360> gun<00:01:14.909> I'm

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
am i doing using that chain gun I'm

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.080 
am i doing using that chain gun I'm
curious<00:01:16.330> if<00:01:16.569> they<00:01:17.130> left<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.460> this<00:01:18.670> version

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
curious if they left it in this version

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.410 
curious if they left it in this version
or<00:01:19.210> not

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.960 

again<00:01:27.660> rockets<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.490> useful

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
again rockets are really really useful

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.920 
again rockets are really really useful
here

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.990 

but<00:01:39.930> we're<00:01:40.080> not<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> Red<00:01:41.189> Door<00:01:41.430> just

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
yet we're gonna hop back down here get

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.660 
yet we're gonna hop back down here get
your<00:01:47.189> chain<00:01:47.670> gun<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:48.979> all<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.189> way<00:01:50.280> through

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
your chain gun out all the way through

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:03.219 
your chain gun out all the way through

and<00:02:04.229> yes<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.280> how<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.270> up

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and yes this is how you actually get up

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.740 
and yes this is how you actually get up
there<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.360> run<00:02:09.780> back<00:02:10.050> through<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.530> I

there you can run back through here I
can't<00:02:12.750> remember<00:02:12.989> there's<00:02:13.319> like<00:02:13.670> there's<00:02:14.670> one

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
can't remember there's like there's one

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.320 
can't remember there's like there's one
somewhere<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:19.220> guess<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.370> won't<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.849> can't<00:02:21.120> tell

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
somewhere I guess I won't I can't tell

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.570 
somewhere I guess I won't I can't tell
in<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.660> version<00:02:21.900> which<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.800> but

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
in this version which one it is but

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.680 
in this version which one it is but
there's<00:02:23.819> one<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:26.099> also<00:02:26.340> lowers<00:02:27.030> somewhere

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
there's one that also lowers somewhere

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.559 
there's one that also lowers somewhere
here<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.319> think<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> may<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:29.090> yeah<00:02:30.090> there

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
here and I think I may be in yeah there

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.170 
here and I think I may be in yeah there
we<00:02:30.690> go<00:02:32.540> things<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.750> did<00:02:33.959> not<00:02:34.200> show<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.760> PC

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
now unlike the PC version they did

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.570 
now unlike the PC version they did
actually<00:03:01.290> fix<00:03:01.620> these<00:03:02.010> guys

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:26.980 

we're<00:03:11.580> gonna<00:03:11.700> switch<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.240> shotgun<00:03:12.720> here

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.870 

yeah<00:03:27.990> they<00:03:28.560> actually<00:03:28.590> fixed<00:03:29.490> some<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
yeah they actually fixed some of the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.580 
yeah they actually fixed some of the
enemies<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:31.850> know<00:03:32.850> right<00:03:33.300> it's<00:03:33.569> like<00:03:33.870> weird<00:03:34.230> or

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
enemies I know right it's like weird or

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.140 
enemies I know right it's like weird or
something

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.580 

I<00:03:41.790> was<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.879> good<00:03:43.060> hit

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
I was a good hit

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.580 
I was a good hit
it's<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.010> good<00:03:45.160> head<00:03:45.400> but<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:47.140> doesn't<00:03:47.470> mean

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
it's a good head but that doesn't mean

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.400 
it's a good head but that doesn't mean
you<00:03:47.890> can<00:03:48.099> sit<00:03:48.760> here<00:03:49.000> like<00:03:49.690> your<00:03:49.840> cavities

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
you can sit here like your cavities

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.460 
you can sit here like your cavities
develop<00:03:51.340> I've<00:03:51.610> got<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:51.940> take<00:03:52.060> them<00:03:52.239> out

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
develop I've got to take them out

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.229 
develop I've got to take them out
through<00:03:53.470> your<00:03:53.680> eyeball<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:55.030> most

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
through your eyeball the most

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.010 
through your eyeball the most
unconventional<00:03:55.780> way<00:03:56.290> possible<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.780> got<00:03:58.930> to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
unconventional way possible but I got to

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.380 
unconventional way possible but I got to
take<00:03:59.140> them<00:03:59.260> out<00:04:01.800> it's<00:04:02.800> still<00:04:03.130> short<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.730> it's

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
take them out it's still short and it's

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:13.470 
take them out it's still short and it's
still<00:04:05.940> pretty<00:04:06.940> damn<00:04:07.239> easy<00:04:07.269> I<00:04:12.330> don't<00:04:13.330> have
