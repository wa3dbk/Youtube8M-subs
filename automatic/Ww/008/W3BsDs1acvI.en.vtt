00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.050
 now let's go all this is the new video 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.700
 they just released the captives bring 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.800
 truth is very impressive and on top of 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.650
 100 of the me that I am a person that I 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.189
 says he translates a shit every face 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.980
 each one and it's worse but this call of 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.130
 duty has done me 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.970
 that is to say that it is a pass I go to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.460
 say why 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.590
 have said that you can customize your 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.040
 avatar and you can customize your avatar 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:43.360
 as in uncharted 3 or another game that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.760
 You can customize the avatar too 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.960
 to see what you read is that I have it here if not 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.560
 I forget there will be a specialist streak 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.480
 what does that mean 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.460
 what the specialist did 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.220
 hidden streak and you see a hidden streak 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.309
 it means that there is a nuclear or out there 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.720
 you will surely see it later when 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 that if you want to go 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.780
 as well 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.390
 will have infected 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.570
 you will say to some who have not had 433 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.610
 ife states so that those affected a 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.990
 game mode where I was in the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:24.700
 handsome 3 who was 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.549
 for a character it was not an uncle 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.770
 and that after five seconds he became infected 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.009
 one and if they killed you infected you can 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.049
 turn infected and if they have infected 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.130
 we were going we went that did not explain well 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:43.240
 that well infected infected them in 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.880
 the court and cost and that's why I said that 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.679
 It is also impressive for the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.469
 I get infected because to me he pulled me 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:55.439
 a few more in water is missing 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.439
 disinfected but good too 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.130
 he seeks to destroy all of life 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.869
 god who always attended the threading 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.780
 tic's have changed it and they have put another 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.170
 type that is almost the same but you will have to 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.330
 do something else for that 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.840
 specified to do something other than not 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.930
 it is a bomb and it is going to be called 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.689
 André that I'll put the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.840
 the translation on your screen now 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.390
 same is living me not but good 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.970
 the souls good before with the maps 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.150
 better maps have named more than two 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.090
 removing the bean that is the map that you 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.930
 They give when they prayed the game 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.560
 following named two maps one is 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:53.090
 call obtain I will also put it in the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.420
 screen that is about a gas station 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.549
 in the middle of an abandoned road 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.459
 mother your mobility is very good for me 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.709
 to do and there we are taking a 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.920
 how much game because there is that map 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.380
 impressive is already medium medium large 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.239
 and another map that is called narrow vale 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.360
 I also told other screens not 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.440
 worry everything is counted so that 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.530
 to make it easier and this map is 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.980
 for me a fat santa punctured in a 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.410
 stick because this map is very narrow in 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.069
 medium of that size in between but it's very 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.069
 narrow 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.500
 and the truth 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.300
 I do not like that map, I hope I do not 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.270
 I touch the words but I do not 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.450
 touch and many maps have come out 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.150
 more apart from these two we got a lot 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.760
 more goes more but not those named the 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.080
 name no more than these two and good the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.110
 weapons 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.360
 the souls 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.370
 has not named any but apparently 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.370
 I've seen a few that I've seen 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.019
 in class creation and I've seen the mica 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 14 that is the weapon that was in the wow 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:14.579
 for three the s 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.370
 sc 2010 that is a new weapon the mts 2 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:21.600
 556 that is another new soul that is a 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.490
 shotgun I think and the type is called tight 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.430
 nothing more and surely it will be bursts 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.560
 as they did waters or three but that 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.920
 you know will be automatic or semi-automatic 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.640
 Who knows 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.970
 and high school has seen a gun 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:42.080
 that will surely be the first of all 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.419
 which is called p 226 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:51.229
 and well they have also changed the way 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:54.650
 move has added another way to move 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.330
 how to do as a final two but not 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.750
 a profile of the idea of ​​crawling by 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.639
 the floor and other movements that the 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.659
 true that he explained us very well but 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.969
 good and most important of all that not 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.729
 there is a death streak yes sir 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:14.030
 infinity ward by legit on was not 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.370
 made of dead at least at least not 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.629
 They have said they have told us that it is not going to 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.629
 behind deaths but who knows 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.570
 when presenting it in the language is missing 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.760
 they said there was no refining streak what 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.340
 what they did but let's see if they were 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:34.060
 or they put it and 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:37.150
 there will also be a one way worth what is 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.950
 what are we going type mode oblige is that in 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.280
 where an online mode will be played 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:45.280
 competitive about online mode go and 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.180
 well then if it remains there will be mode 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.210
 league is worth league mode and well this is 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.940
 liked to follow me workers because I 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.730
 I have been impressed to give them the 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.860
 favorites subscribe for more sharing 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.150
 or so that the masses know and we 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.330
 we see in the next video until the 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.330
 next
