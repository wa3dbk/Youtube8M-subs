00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.509
 for this tablet blog.de and mobile giggs 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.690
 I'm just at an event from Lenovo 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.119
 in frankfurt and april, the novo 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.790
 the lenovo thinkpad 10 imagine that 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.610
 is a new 10 1 inch tablet 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.860
 that we can see here now with keyboard 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.080
 and is ultimately a bigger one 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.170
 version of the ces presented 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.840
 sync eight the 8 inch tablet devices so 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.309
 the same intel quad core processor 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 along with two gigabytes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.650
 Memory and various 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.970
 memory options it can go up to 128 gb 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.170
 high marked in it so neat 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.550
 data storage well once go 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 bit around the device 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.579
 respectively is the specification 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.880
 It depends on the model 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.450
 either windows 8.1 quite normal or 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.579
 but windows 8.1 pro we have to go 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.769
 quickly look at the resolution 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.870
 it has a few display so 1920 x 1200 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.020
 pixel that is very nice 10.1 inches 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.060
 full hd and well we go on around that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.290
 tray around first let's have a look 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.240
 Add this wealth to the keyboard case 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.460
 we know similar similar accessories 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 already from other manufacturers and that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.130
 works very similar one has yes 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.049
 a case that the tablet then 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.299
 protected 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.659
 the back is a rush for the camera 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.460
 we have also for the stylus to 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.290
 one can buy optional then so 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.260
 a small bracket installed here 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.970
 and then we put out the tablet then 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.970
 can you look like that quickly? 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.220
 So up here there is now 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.170
 So the tablet and then you can with it 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.610
 can you ever write it is called 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.100
 accessories but also a correct keyboard 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.320
 that they are more of a keyboard 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.170
 Cover the fencing is a correct one 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.470
 keyboard accessories should do likewise 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.750
 give 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.740
 Well then we come to the tablet itself 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.200
 we have a camera up here otherwise 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.300
 below the windows button is not 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.980
 very forward but if we then the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.560
 we look at one side 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.400
 whole line of connections here behind 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.380
 hides a full-fledged usb 3.0 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.050
 connection we see here is so 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.520
 no micro or mini usb but whole 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.290
 more complete with that one further around the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.989
 We will come here for connections 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.970
 for the ports for the docking station 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.630
 or for the cover that we 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.080
 have here 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.640
 then one of these comes in 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.260
 micro-usb connection then we have here 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.050
 Behind hides depending on equipment 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.750
 a micro sd card slot but also a 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.450
 microsd slot and a power rocker for 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.850
 the volume here still the audio 1 resp 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.860
 exit and in order to have one more 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.650
 clenched power button comes on the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.280
 back, of course, a camera with led 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.350
 lightning 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.360
 by the way, we have four in this model 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.769
 gigabyte of RAM in there will be 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.080
 so again different 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.750
 versions from two to four gigabytes 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.120
 In addition , I can say in my own words 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.850
 to buy a stylist as well 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.280
 here is walkie talkie emperor on the 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.130
 10.1 inch display integrated 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.769
 additional accessories for the lenovo thinkpad 10 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.269
 is this cover i mean here stands 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.170
 also the name of the quick quick stop cover 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.599
 and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.849
 that also comes here to the connection of the 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.010
 is magnetically similar to the service 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.180
 can not go up first 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.580
 like I do not try it 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.950
 but that's the way the display is 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.020
 protected there but it can also completely 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.019
 We'll do that around now 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.750
 and then we have the thinkpad 8 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.260
 in the back such a fold out for the camera 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.050
 so that's quite handy that's good 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.480
 the lenovo thinkpad 10 as I said it 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.910
 will be in april a price 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.190
 we do not know yet but as soon as that 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.950
 tablet is officially presented here 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.840
 We can also sure the price of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.610
 tablets and yes I'm natural for 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.610
 tablet blog.de fell to see christl
