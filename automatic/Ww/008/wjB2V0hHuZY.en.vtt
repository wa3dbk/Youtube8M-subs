but it's cost to do it business so we're

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.040 
but it's cost to do it business so we're
gonna<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.119> we'll<00:00:21.270> demonstrate<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.960> we

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
gonna do is we'll demonstrate what we

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.990 
gonna do is we'll demonstrate what we
call<00:00:22.230> control<00:00:22.859> techniques<00:00:23.310> which<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.670> just

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
call control techniques which is just

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.470 
call control techniques which is just
the<00:00:24.660> obedience<00:00:25.170> calling<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.740> off<00:00:26.210> such<00:00:27.210> like

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the obedience calling them off such like

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.109 
the obedience calling them off such like
that<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.199> we'll<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.880> active<00:00:29.880> tags

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that and then we'll do some active tags

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.659 
that and then we'll do some active tags
which<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.480> where<00:00:30.630> they'll<00:00:30.810> let<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> dog<00:00:31.199> loose
