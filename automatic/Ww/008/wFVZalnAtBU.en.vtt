00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
some of the best in the world so let's

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.400 
some of the best in the world so let's
go<00:02:32.920> ahead<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.130> take<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.490> out<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.380> a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
go ahead and take this out now this is a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.890 
go ahead and take this out now this is a
fully<00:02:36.100> modular<00:02:37.770> power<00:02:38.770> supply<00:02:39.720> here's<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
fully modular power supply here's the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.230 
fully modular power supply here's the
ratings<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.530> side<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.070> see<00:02:42.700> it's<00:02:42.850> fully

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
ratings on the side and see it's fully

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.460 
ratings on the side and see it's fully
modular<00:02:43.540> right<00:02:44.050> there

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
modular right there

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.840 
modular right there
and<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.240> look<00:02:46.480> at<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.870> all<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.650> cuts<00:02:48.430> and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
and if you look at it all the cuts and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.850 
and if you look at it all the cuts and
all<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> plastic<00:02:49.360> connections<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.350> mean

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
all the plastic connections I mean

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.320 
all the plastic connections I mean
they're<00:02:50.980> perfect<00:02:51.190> none<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.700> them<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:51.910> crooked

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
they're perfect none of them are crooked

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.780 
they're perfect none of them are crooked
I<00:02:52.540> mean<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.170> looks<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.500> me<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> lot<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.490> time

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
I mean it looks to me like a lot of time

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.720 
I mean it looks to me like a lot of time
and<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.500> lot<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.650> build<00:02:56.830> quality<00:02:56.920> went<00:02:57.430> into

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
and a lot of build quality went into

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
and a lot of build quality went into
this<00:02:57.880> power<00:02:58.150> supply

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this power supply

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.760 
this power supply
there's<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.250> 120<00:03:01.180> millimeter<00:03:01.570> fan<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
there's the 120 millimeter fan like I

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.580 
there's the 120 millimeter fan like I
said<00:03:03.100> before<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.600> one<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.170> very<00:03:05.350> few

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
said before this is one of the very few

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.530 
said before this is one of the very few
power<00:03:05.860> supplies<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.489> market<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.330> will

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
power supplies on the market that will

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.410 
power supplies on the market that will
actually<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.080> fan<00:03:08.320> will<00:03:08.560> kick<00:03:08.830> off<00:03:09.070> at<00:03:09.880> no

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
actually the fan will kick off at no

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.710 
actually the fan will kick off at no
load<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:11.080> low<00:03:11.500> load<00:03:11.800> conditions<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
load in low load conditions and the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.150 
load in low load conditions and the
reason<00:03:14.020> they<00:03:14.110> do<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.350> is<00:03:14.650> they<00:03:14.680> want<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.070> be

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
reason they do that is they want to be

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.460 
reason they do that is they want to be
as<00:03:15.280> silent<00:03:15.640> as<00:03:16.030> possible<00:03:16.630> for<00:03:16.840> as<00:03:16.959> long<00:03:17.200> as

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
as silent as possible for as long as

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.030 
as silent as possible for as long as
possible

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
possible

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.040 
possible
and<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.850> going<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.060> be<00:03:19.180> silent<00:03:19.720> at<00:03:19.810> full

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
and this is going to be silent at full

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.310 
and this is going to be silent at full
load<00:03:20.290> anyways<00:03:21.220> but<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.030> actually<00:03:22.600> turns<00:03:22.930> off

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
load anyways but it actually turns off

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.380 
load anyways but it actually turns off
the<00:03:23.590> fan<00:03:23.800> turns<00:03:24.100> off<00:03:24.340> or<00:03:24.640> it's<00:03:24.910> completely

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
the fan turns off or it's completely

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.550 
the fan turns off or it's completely
silent<00:03:26.020> operation<00:03:26.830> at<00:03:27.430> low<00:03:27.970> or<00:03:28.780> no<00:03:29.290> load

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
silent operation at low or no load

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.530 
silent operation at low or no load
conditions<00:03:30.190> there's<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:31.000> back<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
conditions there's the back that the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.780 
conditions there's the back that the
normal<00:03:31.870> switch<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:33.010> has<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.190> standard

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
normal switch it has a standard

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.840 
normal switch it has a standard
connector<00:03:34.360> which<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.570> good<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.370> said<00:03:36.610> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
connector which is good like I said and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.259 
connector which is good like I said and
there's<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> other<00:03:37.239> side<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.910> just

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
there's the other side just it just

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.750 
there's the other side just it just
looks<00:03:40.930> quality<00:03:41.830> that's<00:03:42.130> all<00:03:42.430> there<00:03:42.580> is<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.910> it

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
looks quality that's all there is to it

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.000 
looks quality that's all there is to it
standard<00:03:45.760> cable<00:03:46.180> this<00:03:47.080> is<00:03:47.260> not<00:03:47.440> as<00:03:47.590> thick<00:03:47.830> as

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
standard cable this is not as thick as

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.440 
standard cable this is not as thick as
some<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.340> others<00:03:48.519> I've<00:03:48.700> done<00:03:48.880> reviews<00:03:49.269> on

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
some of the others I've done reviews on

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.190 
some of the others I've done reviews on
because<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.080> only<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.380> 750<00:03:51.130> watt<00:03:51.280> power

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
because this is only a 750 watt power

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.780 
because this is only a 750 watt power
let's<00:03:53.200> go<00:03:53.410> ahead<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.920> look<00:03:54.070> at<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.700> cabling

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
let's go ahead and look at the cabling

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
let's go ahead and look at the cabling
it<00:03:57.790> comes<00:03:58.209> in<00:03:58.360> its<00:03:58.510> own<00:03:58.630> little<00:03:58.870> case<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.650> mean

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
it comes in its own little case I mean

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.620 
it comes in its own little case I mean
this<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.170> highest<00:04:02.410> quality<00:04:06.329> this<00:04:07.329> is<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
this is the highest quality this is the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.690 
this is the highest quality this is the
highest<00:04:07.840> quality<00:04:08.260> boxing<00:04:09.010> I've<00:04:09.160> ever<00:04:09.400> seen

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
highest quality boxing I've ever seen

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.759 
highest quality boxing I've ever seen
for<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.000> power<00:04:10.239> supply<00:04:10.420> so<00:04:11.200> let's<00:04:11.320> go<00:04:11.470> ahead<00:04:11.530> and

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
for a power supply so let's go ahead and

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.349 
for a power supply so let's go ahead and
take<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.310> box<00:04:12.549> out<00:04:12.820> of<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.970> way<00:04:15.150> let's<00:04:16.150> look

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
take this box out of the way let's look

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.949 
take this box out of the way let's look
at<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.570> cables<00:04:16.989> exclusively<00:04:18.840> they're<00:04:19.840> in

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
at the cables exclusively they're in

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.640 
at the cables exclusively they're in
some<00:04:20.140> kind<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.380> little<00:04:20.590> satchel<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:22.470> all<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
some kind of little satchel and all the

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.890 
some kind of little satchel and all the
cables<00:04:24.100> aren't<00:04:24.250> happily<00:04:24.550> just

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
cables aren't happily just

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.469 
cables aren't happily just
pull<00:04:25.050> them<00:04:25.199> out<00:04:28.070> okay<00:04:29.090> take<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.210> rubber<00:04:30.389> band

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
pull them out okay take the rubber band

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:39.650 
pull them out okay take the rubber band
off<00:04:33.199> okay<00:04:34.199> here's<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.680> 22<00:04:37.070> 20<00:04:38.070> 24<00:04:38.639> pin<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.210> as

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
off okay here's the 22 20 24 pin and as

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.680 
off okay here's the 22 20 24 pin and as
you<00:04:39.840> can<00:04:39.960> see<00:04:40.259> the<00:04:40.680> sleeving<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.580> not<00:04:41.880> all<00:04:42.330> the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
you can see the sleeving is not all the

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.110 
you can see the sleeving is not all the
way<00:04:42.810> up<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.560> end<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.009> connector<00:04:44.340> but

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
way up to the end of the connector but

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.520 
way up to the end of the connector but
it's<00:04:45.270> pretty<00:04:45.479> close<00:04:45.810> especially<00:04:46.110> there

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
it's pretty close especially there

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.189 
it's pretty close especially there
that's<00:04:46.680> pretty<00:04:46.979> close<00:04:47.220> right<00:04:47.550> there

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
that's pretty close right there

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.310 
that's pretty close right there
so<00:04:49.199> but<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.650> sleeving<00:04:49.979> looks<00:04:50.340> very<00:04:50.729> good

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
so but the sleeving looks very good

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.350 
so but the sleeving looks very good
probably<00:04:52.320> not<00:04:52.860> quite<00:04:53.280> as<00:04:53.490> good<00:04:53.639> as<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.880> muskan

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
probably not quite as good as the muskan

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.240 
probably not quite as good as the muskan
if<00:04:54.600> you<00:04:54.780> can<00:04:54.930> believe<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.350> but<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.620> looks<00:04:56.160> very

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
if you can believe it but it looks very

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.770 
if you can believe it but it looks very
good<00:04:57.740> here<00:04:58.740> all<00:04:58.979> your<00:04:59.250> these<00:05:00.240> look<00:05:00.449> like<00:05:00.570> all

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
good here all your these look like all

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.850 
good here all your these look like all
the<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.650> cpu<00:05:02.539> 12-volt<00:05:03.539> ATX<00:05:03.990> power<00:05:04.289> and<00:05:04.680> the

PCI Express connectors and if you look

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.710 
PCI Express connectors and if you look
at<00:05:08.280> them<00:05:08.370> there's<00:05:08.550> there's<00:05:08.940> yellow<00:05:09.419> it's

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.670 
aspect here okay
I<00:05:32.479> remember<00:05:33.479> once<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.870> sonic<00:05:34.169> power<00:05:34.320> supply

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
I remember once the sonic power supply

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.250 
I remember once the sonic power supply
had<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:34.949> long<00:05:35.130> time<00:05:35.370> ago<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:36.539> lot<00:05:36.690> of<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.900> PC

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
had a long time ago and a lot of the PC

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.320 
had a long time ago and a lot of the PC
power<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.500> cooling<00:05:37.680> did<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.340> as<00:05:38.460> well<00:05:38.639> is<00:05:38.880> they

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
power and cooling did it as well is they

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.180 
power and cooling did it as well is they
would<00:05:39.510> sleeve<00:05:39.900> up<00:05:40.139> to<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.380> first<00:05:40.620> connector

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
would sleeve up to the first connector

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.070 
would sleeve up to the first connector
then<00:05:41.669> after<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.270> connector<00:05:42.659> there<00:05:42.810> be<00:05:42.930> no

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
then after the connector there be no

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.870 
then after the connector there be no
sleeting<00:05:43.409> but<00:05:43.650> these<00:05:43.800> are<00:05:43.949> a<00:05:44.190> hundred<00:05:44.760> percent

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
sleeting but these are a hundred percent

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.670 
sleeting but these are a hundred percent
fully<00:05:45.539> sleeved<00:05:46.050> cables<00:05:48.409> looks<00:05:49.409> to<00:05:49.560> me<00:05:49.650> like

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
fully sleeved cables looks to me like

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.980 
fully sleeved cables looks to me like
there's<00:05:50.039> plenty<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.400> cables<00:05:50.909> here<00:05:51.180> there's

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
there's plenty of cables here there's

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.990 
there's plenty of cables here there's
old<00:05:52.289> floppy<00:05:52.650> for<00:05:53.039> those<00:05:53.190> that<00:05:53.580> still<00:05:53.849> use

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
old floppy for those that still use

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.670 
old floppy for those that still use
floppy<00:05:55.880> my<00:05:56.880> impression<00:05:57.630> on<00:05:57.810> this<00:05:58.380> power

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
floppy my impression on this power

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.360 
floppy my impression on this power
supply<00:05:58.889> is<00:05:59.520> I<00:06:00.300> can't<00:06:00.780> wait<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.349> not<00:06:01.650> hear<00:06:02.099> it<00:06:02.220> in

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
supply is I can't wait to not hear it in

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.700 
supply is I can't wait to not hear it in
action<00:06:02.940> I<00:06:03.120> really<00:06:03.750> think<00:06:03.960> it's<00:06:04.169> going<00:06:04.440> that's

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
action I really think it's going that's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.680 
action I really think it's going that's
going<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:04.949> be<00:06:05.099> where<00:06:05.310> it<00:06:05.430> shines<00:06:05.789> it's<00:06:06.090> an<00:06:06.510> 80

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
going to be where it shines it's an 80

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.899 
going to be where it shines it's an 80
plus<00:06:06.990> gold<00:06:07.130> it's<00:06:08.130> not<00:06:08.340> going<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.550> pull<00:06:08.729> that

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
plus gold it's not going to pull that

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.409 
plus gold it's not going to pull that
much<00:06:09.090> power<00:06:09.330> from<00:06:09.750> my<00:06:09.960> wall<00:06:10.620> outlet<00:06:11.159> and<00:06:11.419> also

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
much power from my wall outlet and also

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.149 
much power from my wall outlet and also
it's<00:06:13.229> going<00:06:13.470> to<00:06:13.530> be<00:06:13.710> super<00:06:14.430> super<00:06:14.970> quiet<00:06:15.449> and<00:06:16.159> I

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
it's going to be super super quiet and I

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.279 
it's going to be super super quiet and I
may<00:06:17.639> actually<00:06:17.789> test<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.599> powers<00:06:18.930> we<00:06:19.080> go<00:06:19.229> ahead

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
may actually test the powers we go ahead

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.860 
may actually test the powers we go ahead
and<00:06:19.590> raved<00:06:19.770> up<00:06:19.979> here<00:06:20.310> I<00:06:20.550> want<00:06:21.449> to<00:06:21.510> try<00:06:21.720> it<00:06:21.780> I

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
and raved up here I want to try it I

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.960 
and raved up here I want to try it I
want<00:06:22.050> to<00:06:22.110> see<00:06:22.320> if<00:06:22.470> I<00:06:22.590> can<00:06:22.800> actually<00:06:22.949> put<00:06:23.940> a

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
want to see if I can actually put a

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.680 
want to see if I can actually put a
small<00:06:24.419> load<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.110> and<00:06:25.289> see<00:06:25.680> if<00:06:25.949> the<00:06:26.340> fan<00:06:26.729> does

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
small load to it and see if the fan does

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.719 
small load to it and see if the fan does
not<00:06:27.930> spin<00:06:28.349> so<00:06:28.530> let<00:06:28.710> me<00:06:28.800> go<00:06:28.949> ahead<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.250> zoom<00:06:29.370> in

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
not spin so let me go ahead and zoom in

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.899 
not spin so let me go ahead and zoom in
just<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:30.120> little<00:06:30.150> bit<00:06:30.740> okay<00:06:31.740> here's<00:06:32.250> my<00:06:32.490> button

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
just a little bit okay here's my button

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.279 
just a little bit okay here's my button
that<00:06:33.029> I'm<00:06:33.120> going<00:06:33.240> to<00:06:33.300> use<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.659> start<00:06:33.960> to<00:06:34.050> power

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
that I'm going to use the start to power

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.029 
that I'm going to use the start to power
supplies<00:06:34.560> my<00:06:34.830> tester<00:06:35.340> here

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
supplies my tester here

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.359 
supplies my tester here
so<00:06:36.369> let's<00:06:36.639> go<00:06:36.759> ahead<00:06:36.969> and<00:06:37.089> kick<00:06:37.330> it<00:06:37.479> on<00:06:38.249> now<00:06:39.249> if

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:39.369 
so let's go ahead and kick it on now if

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:43.079 
so let's go ahead and kick it on now if
you<00:06:39.490> look<00:06:39.729> the<00:06:40.449> power<00:06:41.319> supply<00:06:41.710> fan<00:06:42.099> jumped

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:43.089 
you look the power supply fan jumped

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:45.600 
you look the power supply fan jumped
just<00:06:43.360> for<00:06:43.569> a<00:06:43.599> second<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:44.229> you<00:06:44.949> can<00:06:44.979> see<00:06:45.159> that

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
just for a second and you can see that

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.420 
just for a second and you can see that
it's<00:06:45.789> powering<00:06:46.119> this<00:06:46.389> fan<00:06:46.749> right<00:06:46.779> here<00:06:47.430> the

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
it's powering this fan right here the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.149 
it's powering this fan right here the
stock<00:06:48.729> to<00:06:48.909> a<00:06:48.939> fan<00:06:49.330> and<00:06:49.659> the<00:06:50.619> fan<00:06:50.649> is<00:06:50.949> not

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
stock to a fan and the fan is not

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:54.570
