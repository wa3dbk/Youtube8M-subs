one of them old doc fish didn't we I'm
very<00:00:07.500> begging<00:00:15.830> actually<00:00:16.830> up<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> stall

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
very begging actually up in the stall

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.790 
very begging actually up in the stall
rather<00:00:18.119> than<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> outside<00:00:19.140> corners<00:00:19.650> I'd

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
rather than on the outside corners I'd

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.529 
rather than on the outside corners I'd
rather<00:00:20.039> catch<00:00:20.279> him<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> outside<00:00:21.060> corners

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
rather catch him on the outside corners

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.880 
rather catch him on the outside corners
but<00:00:21.689> every<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.199> then<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.410> sneak<00:00:22.710> up

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
but every now and then they sneak up

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:39.170 
but every now and then they sneak up
inside<00:00:23.279> them<00:00:23.519> stalls<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:37.640> you<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.910> thing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
inside them stalls to you know one thing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
inside them stalls to you know one thing
a<00:00:39.270> lot<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> people<00:00:39.710> try<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.739> avoid<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.309> my

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
a lot of people try to avoid in my

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.000 
a lot of people try to avoid in my
opinion<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.809> cable<00:00:43.079> systems<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
opinion is the cable systems that you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.350 
opinion is the cable systems that you
have<00:00:44.219> around<00:00:44.430> these<00:00:44.670> docs<00:00:44.940> whether<00:00:45.180> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
have around these docs whether it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.180 
have around these docs whether it's
cables<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:45.899> time<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> bank<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
cables that are time to bank to the the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279 
cables that are time to bank to the the
dock<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> bank<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> cables<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> are

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
dock to the bank or the cables that are

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.049 
dock to the bank or the cables that are
basically<00:00:50.719> keeping<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> doc<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.289> place<00:00:52.620> it's

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
basically keeping the doc in place it's

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.400 
basically keeping the doc in place it's
unbelievable<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.090> much<00:00:54.300> activity<00:00:54.809> goes<00:00:55.170> on

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
unbelievable how much activity goes on

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
unbelievable how much activity goes on
around<00:00:55.620> those<00:00:55.949> cables<00:00:56.399> fish<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.850> suspend

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
around those cables fish will suspend

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
around those cables fish will suspend
because<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.350> those<00:00:58.890> cables<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.460> older<00:00:59.760> they

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
because as those cables get older they

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.180 
because as those cables get older they
get<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.449> plankton<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.109> algae<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.980> him

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
get you know plankton and algae on him

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.160 
get you know plankton and algae on him
the<00:01:02.670> bait<00:01:02.879> fish<00:01:03.120> come<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.690> feed<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.049> them

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the bait fish come up and feed on them

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780 
the bait fish come up and feed on them

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and the bass just suspend right behind

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.780 
and the bass just suspend right behind
him<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.630> bass<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.890> mean<00:01:08.040> they're<00:01:08.189> they

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
him the bass is so I mean they're they

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.130 
him the bass is so I mean they're they
can<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.000> behind<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.420> cable<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:09.930> feel

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
can get behind the cable and they feel

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
can get behind the cable and they feel
like<00:01:10.170> they're<00:01:10.470> hiding<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> mean

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
anytime you get around doc systems don't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
anytime you get around doc systems don't
just<00:01:14.640> throw<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> cables<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.509> see

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
just throw it the cables you can see

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.780 
just throw it the cables you can see
visible<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.380> front<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.430> they've<00:01:17.610> got

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
visible up front but if they've got

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
visible up front but if they've got
tie-down<00:01:18.330> cables<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> great<00:01:19.409> place<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
tie-down cables it's a great place to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
tie-down cables it's a great place to
fish<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> jerk<00:01:20.369> bait<00:01:20.610> especially<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
spring when the fish are suspended when

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.950 
spring when the fish are suspended when
they're<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.030> starting<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.390> move<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.780> and
