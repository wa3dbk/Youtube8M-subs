00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello everyone omega and good 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.710
 to country class 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.660
 dynamite guns searching on youtube i 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.219
 I realized that there is no single lesson 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 on the construction of the gun 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.869
 so I decided to create my own what to us 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 you need any hard block dynamite 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:33.050
 water button and redstone that's how she 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.050
 looks like a country that's how it works 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.120
 boom and blast chic 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:50.300
 let's try build take any 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 solid block and build such a wall 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.160
 where will the water and gun be located in 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.550
 which will lay the dynamite and 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.860
 so the length should be 5 blocks 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.900
 Now we put a block here so that the water does not 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 leaked and exhibit here tente with this 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.840
 hand we hold that he completely 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:23.840
 here not grabbing one block 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 sorry not grabbing one block 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.119
 put here 2 buttons 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.119
 the gun is ready 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.540
 try to read include first there 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.550
 where the shadow of the shadow captures 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.680
 there I am glad that he does not capture one 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.950
 dynamite and then where everything is 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.390
 fully captured let's do it again 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:52.050
 I will explain the principle of its work water 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 repels dynamite up we first 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.200
 activate the chain is deactivated all 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 blocks 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.990
 dynamite except the last it falls 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.509
 water in water is known nothing even 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.880
 creepers do not explode after which immediately 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.080
 same instantly we activate u will give 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.310
 chain where the last block is captured 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.100
 after which also falls into the water and here from 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.100
 water explosions an explosion in water occurs 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.350
 pressure and this unit flies there over here 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.080
 in principle, this is the whole explanation 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.170
 it was necessary just like that for a bit 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.540
 scientific but in fact everything here 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.239
 easy if you understand to understand it 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.730
 works so you certainly do not need 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.530
 know it all like there why considering when 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.200
 why is water pressed here and how 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.060
 still your doctor just repeat 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.870
 design know what you need to lay 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.720
 go here 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.190
 first click here and remember this 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.930
 instantly press the chain 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.209
 all blocks then they and deactivated 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.290
 then you will succeed but if you 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.380
 like this video then you can 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.730
 subscribe to the channel and like 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.350
 comment then how did you build your 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.350
 cannon in the comments all bye
