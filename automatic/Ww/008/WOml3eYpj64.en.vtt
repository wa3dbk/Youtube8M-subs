00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
now these are called our colonization's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
now these are called our colonization's
so<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.600> want<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> fiddle<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.229> those<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so do you want to fiddle with those and

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.180 
so do you want to fiddle with those and
try<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.069> get<00:02:11.220> just<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.760> hand<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.450> x-ray

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.970 

now<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:17.180> might<00:02:17.420> look<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:18.050> bunch<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.710> kids

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
now it might look like a bunch of kids

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
hello mangos sheets around in this

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.380 
hello mangos sheets around in this
circle<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.200> then<00:02:36.320> it'll<00:02:36.650> develop<00:02:37.010> a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
circle and then it'll develop a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:50.890 
circle and then it'll develop a
3-dimensional<00:02:38.390> view<00:02:49.210> we<00:02:50.210> can<00:02:50.420> actually<00:02:50.660> do

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
3-dimensional view we can actually do

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.270 
3-dimensional view we can actually do
that<00:02:51.050> what<00:02:51.230> that's<00:02:51.410> called<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.830> contrast

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
that what that's called is a contrast

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.010 
that what that's called is a contrast
study<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.270> that's<00:02:53.420> very<00:02:53.600> good<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:53.990> know

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
study so that's very good that you know

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.170 
study so that's very good that you know
about<00:02:54.320> that<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.980> basically<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.640> happens<00:02:56.030> is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
about that so basically what happens is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.210 
about that so basically what happens is
defend<00:02:56.540> depending<00:02:56.990> on<00:02:57.080> what<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.440> want<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:58.040> take

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
defend depending on what we want to take

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.250 
defend depending on what we want to take

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
I didn't see any of that but I think I

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.220 
I didn't see any of that but I think I
think<00:03:39.819> they<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:40.120> quite<00:03:40.419> anxious<00:03:40.629> to<00:03:40.989> stick

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
think they just quite anxious to stick

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.559 
think they just quite anxious to stick
the<00:03:41.349> needle<00:03:41.620> in<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.889> vein<00:03:42.069> so<00:03:42.849> sometimes<00:03:43.419> they

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
the needle in the vein so sometimes they

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:44.940 
the needle in the vein so sometimes they
don't<00:03:43.689> always<00:03:44.019> think<00:03:44.200> about<00:03:44.680> what<00:03:44.829> you've

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
don't always think about what you've

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.979 
don't always think about what you've
been<00:03:45.099> teaching<00:03:45.430> them<00:03:45.760> but<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:46.870> just

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
been teaching them but it's just

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.470 
been teaching them but it's just
enthusiasm<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.700> forgot<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.120> say<00:03:49.450> you

out<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.810> tube<00:04:10.050> with<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.260> needle<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.709> one<00:04:10.890> thing

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
out of a tube with a needle is one thing

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.670 
out of a tube with a needle is one thing
but<00:04:11.280> how<00:04:11.819> do<00:04:11.880> young<00:04:12.180> kids<00:04:12.510> handle<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.380> real

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
but how do young kids handle the real

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.960 
but how do young kids handle the real
thing<00:04:15.169> I<00:04:16.169> know<00:04:16.980> that<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.519> have<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.730> put<00:04:17.880> up

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
thing I know that you have to put up

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.190 
thing I know that you have to put up
with<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.389> want<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.660> event<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.139> I

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
with it if you want to be event and I

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.530 
with it if you want to be event and I
thought<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.500> was<00:04:19.620> really<00:04:19.829> interesting<00:04:20.540> okay

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
thought it was really interesting okay

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.990 
thought it was really interesting okay
so<00:04:21.989> apparently<00:04:22.470> some<00:04:23.070> people<00:04:23.100> obviously<00:04:23.820> not

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
so apparently some people obviously not

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.970 
so apparently some people obviously not
you<00:04:24.210> thought<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.960> was<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.080> bit<00:04:25.260> too<00:04:25.590> much<00:04:25.919> and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
you thought it was a bit too much and

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.740 
you thought it was a bit too much and
they<00:04:26.370> perhaps<00:04:26.639> thought<00:04:26.790> well<00:04:27.000> maybe<00:04:27.240> it's<00:04:27.540> not

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
they perhaps thought well maybe it's not

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.580 
they perhaps thought well maybe it's not
for<00:04:27.960> me<00:04:28.080> but<00:04:28.260> you<00:04:28.590> like<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.010> part<00:04:29.250> yeah<00:04:30.590> it's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
for me but you like that part yeah it's

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.440 
for me but you like that part yeah it's
just<00:04:31.710> interesting<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.490> see<00:04:32.669> what<00:04:32.850> goes<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.240> in

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
just interesting to see what goes on in

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.150 
just interesting to see what goes on in
sadder<00:04:33.900> animals<00:04:34.680> body

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
sadder animals body

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.190 
sadder animals body
so<00:04:35.490> what<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.669> kids<00:04:35.910> really<00:04:36.270> learned<00:04:36.570> by<00:04:36.780> seeing

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
so what a kids really learned by seeing

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.780 
so what a kids really learned by seeing
something<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.740> confronting<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.490> has<00:04:38.639> an

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
something is confronting it has an

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.659 
something is confronting it has an
actual<00:04:39.270> operation<00:04:40.220> anything<00:04:41.220> else<00:04:41.490> they

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
actual operation anything else they

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.210 
actual operation anything else they
learn<00:04:41.970> some<00:04:42.210> enthusiasm<00:04:43.050> for<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.740> science

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
learn some enthusiasm for the science

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.550 
learn some enthusiasm for the science
behind<00:04:44.540> veterinary<00:04:45.540> science<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.229> real

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
behind veterinary science it is a real

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
behind veterinary science it is a real
true<00:04:46.950> science<00:04:48.139> to<00:04:49.139> me<00:04:49.290> it<00:04:49.500> presents<00:04:49.919> a<00:04:50.310> lot<00:04:50.550> of

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
true science to me it presents a lot of

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.070 
true science to me it presents a lot of
challenges<00:04:50.729> when<00:04:51.389> you're<00:04:51.540> doing<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:51.840> sort

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
challenges when you're doing this sort

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.050 
challenges when you're doing this sort
of<00:04:52.169> thing<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:52.979> shows<00:04:53.280> them<00:04:53.610> some<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:53.910> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
of thing so it shows them some of the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.430 
of thing so it shows them some of the
challenges<00:04:54.540> they're<00:04:54.720> going<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.930> be<00:04:55.020> up<00:04:55.110> for<00:04:55.350> in

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
challenges they're going to be up for in

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.040 
challenges they're going to be up for in
the<00:04:55.530> future<00:04:55.710> if<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.639> can<00:04:56.790> enthuse<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:57.660> one<00:04:57.930> of

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the future if I can enthuse just one of

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.409 
the future if I can enthuse just one of
them<00:04:58.169> enough<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:59.100> say<00:04:59.790> yeah<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.000> want<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.270> take

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
them enough to say yeah I want to take

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.090 
them enough to say yeah I want to take
up<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.600> book<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.169> want<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.410> walk<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.560> walk<00:05:01.889> and

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
up the book I want to walk the walk and

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.670 
up the book I want to walk the walk and
do<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.789> study<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.270> become<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.539> bit<00:05:03.780> we<00:05:04.500> could

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
do the study and become a bit we could

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.100 
do the study and become a bit we could
get<00:05:04.850> some<00:05:05.850> great<00:05:06.000> people<00:05:06.360> out<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.780> this<00:05:06.900> and

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
get some great people out of this and

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.540 
get some great people out of this and
that's<00:05:07.169> one<00:05:07.380> of<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> things<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.770> we<00:05:07.860> love<00:05:08.520> to

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
that's one of the things that we love to

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.290 
that's one of the things that we love to
see<00:05:08.729> people<00:05:09.150> are<00:05:09.419> dedicated<00:05:09.660> from<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:11.300> young

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
see people are dedicated from a young

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.810 
see people are dedicated from a young
age<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.810> develop<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.860> true<00:05:14.310> love<00:05:14.550> for<00:05:14.760> the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
age and develop a true love for the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.580 
age and develop a true love for the
profession<00:05:15.360> because<00:05:16.020> then<00:05:16.410> they<00:05:16.560> have

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
profession because then they have

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.770 
profession because then they have
compassion<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.550> empathy<00:05:17.669> with<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.450> animals

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
compassion and empathy with the animals

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.630 
compassion and empathy with the animals
and<00:05:18.870> that's<00:05:19.050> really<00:05:19.680> important<00:05:20.160> in<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.370> in

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
and that's really important in that in

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.940 
and that's really important in that in
that<00:05:20.669> profession<00:05:21.180> he<00:05:21.870> saw<00:05:22.050> an<00:05:22.380> animal<00:05:22.710> that

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
that profession he saw an animal that

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.040 
that profession he saw an animal that
was<00:05:23.070> really<00:05:23.400> sick<00:05:24.090> or<00:05:24.240> had<00:05:24.330> been<00:05:24.419> hit<00:05:24.600> by<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.780> car

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
was really sick or had been hit by a car

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.090 
was really sick or had been hit by a car
would<00:05:25.289> you<00:05:25.410> know<00:05:25.530> what<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.740> do

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
would you know what to do

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.740 
would you know what to do
yes<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.580> would<00:05:26.729> because<00:05:26.820> we<00:05:27.030> learnt<00:05:27.210> CPR<00:05:27.630> and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
yes I would because we learnt CPR and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.090 
yes I would because we learnt CPR and
that<00:05:27.900> was<00:05:28.050> probably<00:05:28.200> learning<00:05:28.530> my<00:05:28.620> favorite

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
that was probably learning my favorite

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.770 
that was probably learning my favorite
things

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
things

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.540 
things
yes<00:05:30.780> is<00:05:31.169> it<00:05:31.320> hard<00:05:31.560> to<00:05:31.710> do<00:05:31.860> cuz<00:05:32.100> it's<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.460> know

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
yes is it hard to do cuz it's you know

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.969 
yes is it hard to do cuz it's you know
they're<00:05:32.789> different<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.180> us<00:05:33.330> it's<00:05:34.020> well<00:05:34.950> I

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
they're different to us it's well I

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.400 
they're different to us it's well I
guess<00:05:35.220> it's<00:05:35.430> sort<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.330> same<00:05:36.570> as<00:05:36.750> doing<00:05:36.900> CPR

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
guess it's sort of the same as doing CPR

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.920 
guess it's sort of the same as doing CPR
on<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.560> human<00:05:38.039> do<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.789> chest<00:05:39.300> compressions<00:05:39.419> in

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
on a human do the chest compressions in

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.170 
on a human do the chest compressions in
breathing<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.680> but<00:05:41.669> if<00:05:41.760> you<00:05:41.850> actually<00:05:41.970> think

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
breathing and but if you actually think

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.340 
breathing and but if you actually think
about<00:05:42.450> what<00:05:42.720> you're<00:05:42.840> doing<00:05:42.870> because<00:05:43.169> if<00:05:43.289> you

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
about what you're doing because if you

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.659 
about what you're doing because if you
get<00:05:43.440> it<00:05:43.560> wrong<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:43.830> might<00:05:43.950> actually<00:05:44.220> hurt<00:05:44.520> an
