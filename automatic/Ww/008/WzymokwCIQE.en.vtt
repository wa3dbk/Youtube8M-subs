00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 good morning to all guys here harmony 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.430
 if the staff of vv let's play fifa punto 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.930
 it on the facebook page and on our website 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.809
 in description and today we are here with the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.170
 pogba player view iv this player 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 even on the ultimate team looks like 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 a mighty player will indeed be 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.010
 own power in fact at 76 of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.800
 shooting speed 79 pitale compared to the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.560
 uninformed version 82 of passage 82 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.150
 of dribbling 78 defense and 82 hit 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.150
 of head 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.189
 all statistics above 75 and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.450
 speed we will see later that it is a slight one 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.430
 surprise 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.320
 ok said this as usual pro e 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 against I used it in two 4 8 by three 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.860
 different then usual series version a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 pisa bus to the low cost one in the first 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 all three midfielders version 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.809
 aligned and he in the middle and one is me 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.149
 really liked it 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.300
 while the second time with the cdc that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.610
 it was not him and he more out of the way 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.460
 in short it seems in a 4 3 3 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.219
 ok that said let's start with your own i 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 pro the first pro is the transition 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.970
 passage intended as short passages more 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.380
 that the long passages for the passages 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 this player's courses really are 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.020
 excellent also long passages but not 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.310
 demerit because at 86 of passages 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.860
 long 88 of short passages and this is not 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.229
 useful is not only an end in itself but is 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.189
 very useful because the pro I want 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.939
 talking to you now is stealing the ball 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.040
 the interception in short because it has a 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.979
 excellent defense value that translates 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.110
 in game in a 82 of slip 83 of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.960
 tackle and 78 and wins 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.079
 the interception then the passage is 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.150
 very useful because ruby ​​ball recover 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.970
 ball because also a 89 of physical strength 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.159
 it is a 88 of aggression so you can do it 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.290
 to steal the ball and then immediately to the classroom 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.450
 with passages that arrive on the pils of the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.310
 player so no random passages and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.860
 then also possibly make throws 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 long then a nice up position for 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.479
 the passage but also for the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.790
 defense features said this 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.409
 let's move on to another feature that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.869
 I have already mentioned physical strength 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.849
 the physical strength of this player is 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.009
 devastating makes the difference between 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.049
 a normal player and then how 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.519
 this player at 89 of physical strength e 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.200
 so you also see here that they are there 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.480
 players trying to take the ball off you 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 for meters and meters and don't make it 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.849
 the only thing is the only way and get yourself 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.209
 do it the only way it really is butterfly 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.370
 and of course since it's all related 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.930
 physical strength is also excellent for the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.120
 his dribbling his dribbling is not 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.620
 understood as the three stars and the three 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.870
 skill stars because it has only three stars 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.359
 written but is meant just like 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.459
 ball control how to turn around in 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.620
 spaces and santana the man alone holding 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.819
 pressed to the two in fact you see here has 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.269
 a speed that I did not expect 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.829
 in fact before I said to you 78 of snap and 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.659
 74 of acceleration that I have 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.269
 happily surprised because if in mine 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.609
 opinion seem much more that is when 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.889
 I all take myself from the two even look 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.780
 that in a union among other things you succeed in 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.609
 turn around and do things really 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.290
 excellent you manage to go away to 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.120
 opposing players only doing 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.980
 right and left keeping the field at 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.019
 ball then really a thumbs up 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.340
 super dribbling because when 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.840
 dribbling and the others succeed you 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.819
 anyway to take it as its own 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.970
 speed can't move because 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.959
 physical strength therefore really 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.319
 midfielder characteristics 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.480
 really really really good e 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.099
 then there are TVs when you talk about poop 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.340
 posts above all from distance shots 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.579
 in fact to an effect 84 that has me 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.500
 surprised however it is however a value 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.919
 almost an end in itself because with him 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.629
 getting to pull around is a little bit 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.730
 so-so, for example, because you used it 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.470
 to the right, therefore, he was pulling left and 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.629
 throws to effect above all because of three 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.560
 skill stars and three stars weak foot 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.599
 also and do not come very well if it 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.870
 put to the right rather than a 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.940
 left however the shots from outside are 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.859
 always always dangerous it never is me 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.760
 happened that the porter had life 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.859
 easy 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.290
 the pounds from outside to 93 pull power and 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.120
 98 of lecce so the shots are 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.519
 devastating are really devastating ho 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.560
 made six goals in nine games without 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.000
 count those who didn't count me 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.409
 because he disconnects he goes to the target 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.229
 because it happens bach and this did 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:19.199
 triplet 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:21.060
 Instead ok now we come to have against 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.750
 said three-star ski the three stars 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.550
 weak foot 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.120
 these are not against heavy though 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.919
 he had 4 and 4 would be a great one 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.130
 midfielder would really be a 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.570
 great midfielder because three 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.220
 weak foot stars means that ad 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.900
 example also the power shots vi 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.090
 they are a little lopsided stretched by 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.229
 left because he is to be 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.419
 the interest of the skins means that there is 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.039
 you must only limit yourself to the very best 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.320
 dribbling with ball control then 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.630
 would have another solution more would be 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.570
 even better 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.300
 ok now let's talk instead of another 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.250
 against which, however, it is somewhat relative because 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.780
 depends on the period at this time 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.650
 this player since the beginning 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.750
 worth 150 130,000 in short, more than 100,000 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.360
 I will not spend this money on him 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.970
 never ever buy it I immediately 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.110
 resold because this player to mine 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.650
 opinion can be worth 40 thousand ok can be worth 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:22.289
 50,000 ok but more not because anyway 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.180
 there are alternatives really like de 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.440
 red if you need to use a CD or even that 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.000
 same vidal 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.550
 hence or even its version does not 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.020
 informs therefore he is a very good player 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.090
 but more than 50 thousand in my opinion is not worth it 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.380
 having said that I hope I have been helpful 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.419
 to have clarified your ideas on this 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.580
 phenomenon in real life is also up to 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.090
 of meetings we say and leave you ours 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.090
