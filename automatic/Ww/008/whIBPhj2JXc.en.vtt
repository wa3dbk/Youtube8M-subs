 hello my name is yoma keko and this is my 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.119
 So beautiful house I love to do 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.450
 what most people do 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.250
 minecraft eat sleep and little else now 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.810
 I need wood to warm up in the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.099
 winter so let's cut this 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.930
 well tree around here I also need 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.890
 pretty wood so I'm going to cut down 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.390
 quite demons this supposedly the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.380
 tree ends here why the hell there 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.290
 is his mother on the floor a book not 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.329
 you know suspect all this no more there is more 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.309
 but this leaves this I never had 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.519
 past such thing I'm going to make a turn here 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.230
 to apply deeper my god but 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.420
 what's up with the tree this up 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.780
 force it to root this tree not 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.699
 understand nothing I'm going down to see what happens 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.250
 it seems that this continues every time 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.180
 it becomes more suspicious where it will take me 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.750
 this tree I am very deep 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.740
 good meaning of what happens 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.740
 what is this 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.380
 marquitos here is my house has already 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.040
 finish that speak the portal if 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.040
 closed the portal 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.610
 follow me I'll take it to the surface 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.260
 How long have you been in the mine for two years? 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 since 1.4 still believe I do not remember 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.920
 nothing quiet are horses appear from 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.540
 once in a while out there it seems that all the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.880
 world has changed a lot 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.800
 I'm outdated and take two years 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 locked in there is normal that you will lose 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.509
 many things 20 I teach my house and doki 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.340
 teach me the good thing that you see here is my 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.590
 house has enough things like 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 to survive and so big question 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.399
 what were you doing there locked in that mine 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.259
 you think it was by own will of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.850
 man and I did not want but someone opened the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.030
 portal in the wrong place and everything 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.710
 it started to not be the wrong place to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.570
 what do you mean no 10 million to see the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.100
 prophecy if you open a portal in a 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.110
 desert then all the bad bugs 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.140
 this dimension comes into me because it is 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.159
 the same temperature 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.220
 wait wait wait now you said 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.319
 portal what the hell is a portal nothing 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.239
 knows how to make a portal but the player 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.709
 minecraft are you let me obsidian and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.980
 we go to a place where I can make a 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.379
 portal 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.989
 Well, this is the only place near 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.200
 house where you can build good here 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.310
 I have removed things but good these people 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.870
 if it is perfect 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.790
 well then if you want to see portal you have 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.200
 place lesbian in this way is worth and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.200
 make an exact square 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.160
 we already have the portal to get things from 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.690
 another world and such but what you do not have 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.410
 what to do is do it with deserted because 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.410
 if there are no problems 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.790
 I do not know but there are stones that had 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.090
 before stones or I'm wrong I think 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.569
 sand but I removed it all then it was 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.569
 a desert 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.370
 Cart knew but I do not know what I removed 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.120
 from the sand this is still a damn 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.120
