00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:02:08.410 

I<00:01:50.500> think<00:01:51.500> it's<00:01:51.620> nice<00:02:06.760> it's<00:02:07.760> up<00:02:07.940> towards<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
I think it's nice it's up towards the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.080 
I think it's nice it's up towards the
sky<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.960> it<00:02:09.080> condenses<00:02:09.740> on<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.130> top<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
sky and it condenses on the top of the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.820 
sky and it condenses on the top of the
lid<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.480> think<00:02:11.660> it's<00:02:11.750> not<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> conversation<00:02:14.830> I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
lid I think it's not a conversation I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.830 
lid I think it's not a conversation I
don't<00:02:16.760> know<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.630> means<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.050> kind<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:20.570> water

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
don't know it means to kind of the water

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:42.210 
don't know it means to kind of the water
kind<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.290> comes<00:02:21.470> out<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.830> something<00:02:23.350> because<00:02:24.350> I

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.560 

think<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.520> because<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.030> thing<00:02:44.540> that

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
think it's because of the thing that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:53.440 
think it's because of the thing that
goes<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.080> well<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.830> hard<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:52.580> kinda<00:02:53.270> say

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
goes in well it's hard and I kinda say

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.810 
goes in well it's hard and I kinda say
maybe<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:54.050> replaced<00:02:54.470> an<00:02:54.709> old<00:02:54.890> toilet<00:02:55.250> it's

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
maybe this replaced an old toilet it's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.530 
maybe this replaced an old toilet it's
hard<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.120> say<00:02:59.530> yeah
