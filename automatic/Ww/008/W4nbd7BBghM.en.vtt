 good thing is today I will talk about is how do you see 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.410
 measure the ph of your aquarium for fish 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 good ornamental here I have an example 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.070
 of a normal freshwater aquarium which 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.369
 has four kings fish that are from 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.760
 same species is in spite of colors 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.939
 different and also of various sizes 1 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.390
 Colder hour and a drunken husk né 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.510
 good everyone has the same pick up here is the ph 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.770
 neutral will boo the ph for each fish 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 so attention 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.700
 see your pH of your fish before 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.750
 make any changes in the water 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.879

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 Tropical you can get in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.199
 any pet store is good here 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:10.110

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:14.460
 plastic that is where you are to see you 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.159

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.700

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.960
 simple to do this test you get the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.700
 vidrinho puts it here and will have to stay 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.460
 water in this brand 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 If you pass a little, it's okay. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.970
 It just can not be too much so you do not 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.560
 it's variation in result 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.110
 our angular fish I think 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.509
 I'm going to give food but it's aligned right? 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:09.840
 with the line it is important to close your 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:12.170
 court is he's sorry right now after 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.910
 You got water. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.400
 you apply three drops of this product if 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:31.530
 apply more redo the test 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:33.660
 Are you cover and now are you? 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.810
 shake up down 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.000
 On request after that you have to 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.860
 wait two minutes but in case I go 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.980
 start doing it now for you to come 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.120
 after two minutes you come here and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:54.739
 compare the coloring where it is right 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.130
 well here it is at 6 and means 77 is 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.120
 good 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:04.140
 mine in case my aquaro gave 7 a 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:09.630
 may vary depending on water 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:13.620
 you turn and see here is neutral acid 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.480
 alkaline my god 7 or is this 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.120
 neutral and mine does not have to mess with anything 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.290
 but if your fish is different from one 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.880
 Tilapia 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:30.209
 the disk you have to see if there is the 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.620
 water is adequate with the fish before 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.040
 this is what I have this product is from 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.310
 Canine also of the same brand as you 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.950
 You can also purchase 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.310
 animals and the acid ne 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.709
 good is the following after you did 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:58.230
 this is important to close your bottle 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:01.799
 well, do not vary to scare the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.709
 Tests right occur if cheating 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.930
 well this glass is important here 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.090
 rinse with plenty of water 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:15.450
 never pay attention to this in the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.150
 aquarium do not return water you took 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.840
 never return can harm fish 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.210
 good and then you cover is important 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.020
 washing and not to stay residues 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.190
 next time 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.500
 you are no longer change the color is good it is 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.930
 important to remember again that each 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:39.479
 fish type has a good pH is here 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.599
 fourth then we know that ph is 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.940
 neutral for you to choose your fish 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.159
 You always have to choose with the same. 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.610
 pick you can never put a text 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:54.210
 with neutral ph along with a kiss that has 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.990
 ph alkaline and soy animal you 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.539
 consult someone who knows the situation and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.610
 it's also you see 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.889
 sometimes even logic itself indicates 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.099
 what are the fish that can be 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.159
 combined ne 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.960
 Good, that's what we have to 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.000
 show you 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.630
 and you can also see other videos 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.370
 over the affection of the acid as 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.550
 apply in water 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.990
 the former runs the bactericidal fungicide 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:31.069
 ok good so this is it 's good test 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.069
 catch you
