so<00:00:20.119> I've<00:00:21.119> attached<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:22.080> core<00:00:22.529> thread<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
so I've attached a core thread and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
so I've attached a core thread and
basically<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.930> do<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.560> tie<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.099> on

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
basically to do that you just tie it on

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.390 
basically to do that you just tie it on
and<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.849> thread<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.300> through<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.160> I've<00:00:29.160> been

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and you thread it through and I've been

and you thread it through and I've been
showing<00:00:29.779> how<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> spin<00:00:31.830> paper<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.200> just<00:00:34.200> like

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
showing how to spin paper so just like

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.240 
showing how to spin paper so just like
in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> demonstration<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.820> need<00:00:36.120> some

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
in the demonstration you need some

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.000 
in the demonstration you need some
wrapping<00:00:38.250> paper<00:00:38.280> torn<00:00:39.120> into<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:39.660> strips

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
wrapping paper torn into little strips

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.779 
wrapping paper torn into little strips
you<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.190> some<00:00:41.640> wool<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.600> she<00:00:43.440> need<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.100> cone

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you need some wool and she need a cone

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
you need some wool and she need a cone
of<00:00:45.059> yarn<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:47.180> start<00:00:48.180> by<00:00:50.210> core<00:00:51.210> spinning<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
of yarn so start by core spinning a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
of yarn so start by core spinning a
little<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> wool<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.730> core

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
little bit of wool on to your core

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
little bit of wool on to your core
thread<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:55.260> course<00:00:55.469> thinning<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> just

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
thread and of course thinning is just

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.979 
thread and of course thinning is just
like<00:00:56.250> regular<00:00:56.940> spinning<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:57.690> you're<00:00:57.840> doing

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
like regular spinning but you're doing

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.789 
like regular spinning but you're doing
it<00:00:58.230> perpendicular<00:00:59.129> instead<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:01.250> straight<00:01:02.420> so

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
it perpendicular instead of straight so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
it perpendicular instead of straight so
start<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.820> core<00:01:06.060> spinning<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
start out and your core spinning and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.149 
start out and your core spinning and
you're<00:01:06.869> drafting<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.860> letting<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you're drafting it out and letting it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.910 
you're drafting it out and letting it
pile<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:09.590> then<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.159> want<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.610> split<00:01:12.350> your<00:01:13.350> wool

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
pile on then you want to split your wool

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.859 
pile on then you want to split your wool
and<00:01:14.720> insert<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.990> piece<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> paper<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.130> then

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
and insert a piece of paper and then

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:25.640 
and insert a piece of paper and then
continue<00:01:18.869> spinning<00:01:23.930> start<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> wrap<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
continue spinning start to wrap the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.700 
continue spinning start to wrap the
paper<00:01:25.860> yarn<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.780> you'll<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
paper yarn on and then you'll see you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.600 
paper yarn on and then you'll see you
have<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.950> little<00:01:29.220> end<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.100> could<00:01:32.310> try

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
have this little end and you could try

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.539 
have this little end and you could try
and<00:01:32.970> plus<00:01:33.329> paper<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.840> paper<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.560> wool<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> like

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and plus paper to paper but wool is like

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.330 
and plus paper to paper but wool is like
glue<00:01:35.930> might<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.049> well<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> give<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
glue might as well just use it to give a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.390 
glue might as well just use it to give a
little<00:01:38.610> added<00:01:38.909> strength<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.130> able<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
little added strength and to be able to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880 
little added strength and to be able to
keep<00:01:41.579> spinning<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.450> secure<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> ends<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
keep spinning so secure the ends of a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.240 
keep spinning so secure the ends of a
little<00:01:44.130> piece<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.520> wool<00:01:44.780> then<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:47.009> want
