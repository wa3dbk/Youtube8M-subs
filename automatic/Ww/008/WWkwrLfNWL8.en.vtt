00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello again I am rubÃ©n Ã¡lvarez professor 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.589
 of unified kinesiology and here I am 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.780
 again to explain a second of 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.080
 it's a second way of talking to your 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.360
 body 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.750
 this test is from the chains 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.110
 muscle we are going to check the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.610
 muscle chain response 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.029
 before and after our 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.180
 body before a question that I ask 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.180
 to my body and we're going to verify this 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.550
 shortening I have contraction of a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.520
 chain or relaxation of a chain to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.620
 through the length of my arms 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.600
 if you can check and you can see now 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.170
 when they have my arms of the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.329
 relaxed way is that my thumbs 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.579
 they match 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.010
 although this is my starting position of 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.949
 my chains are now equalized 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.409
 well if we continue with the example of before 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.070
 for example, checking a question 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.310
 obvious as 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.870
 I'm wearing a blue shirt and stretched my 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.320
 arms 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.610
 and what happened you see that an arm of mine in 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.610
 my right arm has been cut 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880
 it is an affirmative answer before a 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.060
 ask what I just did to my 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.060
 body 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.030
 therefore now I relax again 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.600
 reason the chains come back through their 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.320
 site again I look at the same 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 previous position 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.460
 I wear pigtails in my hair stretched the 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.820
 arms 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.560
 they remain the same as before, therefore 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.290
 it's like an answer he's saying 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 who did not bring anger effectively as 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.119
 you can see you do not see any anger 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.400
 well it is for testing with this series of 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.320
 questions and more ways of asking that 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.229
 we will learn in the workshop and that 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.650
 we will use to see the whole subject 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.460
 nutritional 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.520
 one 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.520
 you just saw and I hope that I have 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.170
 liked and that you have woken up 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.170
 interest thanks
