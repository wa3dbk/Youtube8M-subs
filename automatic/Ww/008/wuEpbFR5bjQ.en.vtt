00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.400 
there for no reason what's the point of
even<00:02:27.170> making<00:02:27.440> this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
even making this

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.660 
even making this

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
how does have a feeling that they won't

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.580 
how does have a feeling that they won't
they<00:02:31.910> think<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.510> people<00:02:32.810> would<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.320> able<00:02:33.350> to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
they think that people would be able to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.820 
they think that people would be able to
bought<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.070> don't<00:02:34.580> know<00:02:34.640> my<00:02:34.850> opinion<00:02:35.530> yeah<00:02:36.530> if

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
bought I don't know my opinion yeah if

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.650 
bought I don't know my opinion yeah if
you<00:02:37.520> want<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.760> walk<00:02:37.970> with<00:02:38.000> shoe<00:02:38.210> rule<00:02:38.330> off<00:02:38.480> with

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
you want to walk with shoe rule off with

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.210 
you want to walk with shoe rule off with
the<00:02:38.750> sniper<00:02:38.960> it's<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.350> because<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> for

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
the sniper it's just because the for

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.010 
the sniper it's just because the for
some<00:02:40.430> reason<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> sniper<00:02:41.120> shot<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.570> lot<00:02:41.840> by

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
some reason the sniper shot a lot by

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.710 
some reason the sniper shot a lot by
itself<00:02:42.350> when<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.010> have<00:02:43.190> no<00:02:43.370> idea<00:02:43.700> why<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.510> we

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
itself when we have no idea why so we

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.000 
itself when we have no idea why so we
just<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.650> let<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:45.950> go<00:02:46.070> with<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.310> flow

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
just like just let it go with the flow

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.230 
just like just let it go with the flow
and<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:51.290> just<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.560> heads<00:02:51.770> up<00:02:51.950> if<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.700> really<00:02:53.090> do

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
and it just a heads up if you really do

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.449 
and it just a heads up if you really do
want<00:02:53.480> these<00:02:53.570> monster<00:02:54.110> song<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.370> have

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
what you'll see in the video too at the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.170 
what you'll see in the video too at the
end<00:03:02.870> because<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.290> go<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.610> box<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.910> pick<00:03:05.000> up<00:03:05.150> a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
end because we go to box and pick up a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.170 
end because we go to box and pick up a
few<00:03:05.390> guns<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.980> they<00:03:07.220> go<00:03:07.430> from<00:03:07.580> really<00:03:07.940> test

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
few guns and they go from really test

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.840 
few guns and they go from really test
and<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:09.770> guess<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.310> where<00:03:10.459> all<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
and I guess this is where all the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.970 
and I guess this is where all the
problems<00:03:11.120> spawn<00:03:11.570> on<00:03:11.990> top<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.560> roof<00:03:12.740> at

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
problems spawn on top of the roof at

get and I guess right here what you seem
right<00:03:55.850> now<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.510> foil<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.140> go

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
right now this the foil that you go

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.470 
right now this the foil that you go
through<00:03:57.440> when<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.820> link<00:03:58.820> both<00:03:59.090> machines

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
through when you link both machines

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.780 
through when you link both machines
together<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.950> that's<00:04:01.340> where<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:01.610> basically

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
together and that's where you basically

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.229 
together and that's where you basically
go<00:04:02.209> in<00:04:02.420> its<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.140> Tupac<00:04:03.709> for<00:04:04.400> boxes<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.209> you

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
go in its like Tupac for boxes if you

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.479 
go in its like Tupac for boxes if you
see<00:04:05.570> if<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.900> watch<00:04:06.110> closely<00:04:06.410> there's<00:04:07.280> four

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
see if you watch closely there's four

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.900 
see if you watch closely there's four
boxes<00:04:07.880> for<00:04:08.120> some<00:04:08.299> reason<00:04:08.950> but<00:04:09.950> yeah<00:04:10.190> we're

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
boxes for some reason but yeah we're

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.340 
boxes for some reason but yeah we're
just<00:04:11.090> flying<00:04:11.239> around<00:04:11.420> trying<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.900> find<00:04:12.049> some

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
just flying around trying to find some

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.340 
just flying around trying to find some
random<00:04:12.530> glitches<00:04:13.510> see<00:04:14.510> how<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.170> map

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
random glitches see how it is the map

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.430
