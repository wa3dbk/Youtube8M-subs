00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:05.740 

okay<00:00:04.609> the<00:00:04.760> next<00:00:04.880> one<00:00:05.060> I'm<00:00:05.300> going<00:00:05.480> to<00:00:05.569> go<00:00:05.720> over

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
okay the next one I'm going to go over

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.960 
okay the next one I'm going to go over
is<00:00:06.470> this<00:00:07.430> one

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
is this one

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.199 
is this one
I<00:00:08.770> hated<00:00:09.770> this<00:00:10.070> one<00:00:10.280> when<00:00:10.490> I<00:00:10.549> first<00:00:10.910> saw<00:00:11.150> the

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.209 
I hated this one when I first saw the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.970 
I hated this one when I first saw the
algorithm<00:00:11.840> for<00:00:12.049> it<00:00:12.170> but<00:00:12.289> I<00:00:12.350> found<00:00:12.619> a<00:00:12.830> better

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
algorithm for it but I found a better

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.859 
algorithm for it but I found a better
way<00:00:15.610> remember<00:00:16.610> in<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.000> last<00:00:17.150> video<00:00:17.420> when<00:00:17.840> I

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
way remember in the last video when I

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.130 
way remember in the last video when I
said<00:00:18.140> if<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:18.350> learnt<00:00:18.560> this<00:00:18.770> case<00:00:19.900> then<00:00:20.900> we're

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
said if you learnt this case then we're

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.890 
said if you learnt this case then we're
going<00:00:21.290> to<00:00:21.380> be<00:00:21.470> able<00:00:21.590> to<00:00:21.740> learn<00:00:22.040> two<00:00:22.460> more

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
going to be able to learn two more

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.310 
going to be able to learn two more
because<00:00:23.900> most<00:00:24.140> of<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.320> algorithm<00:00:24.910> using<00:00:25.910> the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
because most of the algorithm using the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.500 
because most of the algorithm using the
next<00:00:27.320> ones<00:00:27.820> well<00:00:28.820> there's<00:00:28.970> actually<00:00:29.060> going<00:00:29.420> to

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
next ones well there's actually going to

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.069 
next ones well there's actually going to
be<00:00:29.600> three<00:00:29.960> this<00:00:30.530> one<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.130> two<00:00:31.460> more<00:00:32.079> because

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
be three this one and two more because

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.200 
be three this one and two more because
if<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:33.410> remember<00:00:33.860> from<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.579> previous<00:00:34.610> video

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
if you remember from the previous video

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.510 
if you remember from the previous video
and<00:00:35.480> this<00:00:36.079> algorithm<00:00:37.180> is<00:00:38.180> are<00:00:38.860> due<00:00:39.860> to<00:00:40.130> our

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
and this algorithm is are due to our

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.010 
and this algorithm is are due to our

to our prime F F Prime the algorithm for
this<00:00:58.719> is<00:00:59.719> essentially<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.770> same<00:01:01.010> all<00:01:01.850> we're

this is essentially the same all we're

this is essentially the same all we're
doing<00:01:02.540> is<00:01:02.780> changing<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:04.070> first<00:01:04.759> are<00:01:05.770> the
