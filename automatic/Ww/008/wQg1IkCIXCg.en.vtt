00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
this is a i'm going to make a new board

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.950 
this is a i'm going to make a new board
so<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.580> old<00:00:08.700> pintail<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.420> an<00:00:09.510> 8<00:00:09.660> ply

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
so this is my old pintail it's an 8 ply

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.860 
so this is my old pintail it's an 8 ply
you<00:00:10.620> know<00:00:10.740> 40<00:00:11.070> inch<00:00:11.190> by<00:00:11.370> ten<00:00:12.120> inch<00:00:12.300> global<00:00:12.690> was

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you know 40 inch by ten inch global was

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.299 
you know 40 inch by ten inch global was
mosaic<00:00:13.320> pintail<00:00:13.650> with<00:00:13.799> little<00:00:14.040> kick<00:00:14.190> tail

anyways<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> point<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.630> um<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:16.619> actually

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
anyways the point is um I'm actually

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.800 
anyways the point is um I'm actually
making<00:00:17.190> us<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> smaller<00:00:18.359> kind<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
making us like a smaller kind of

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.400 
making us like a smaller kind of
symmetrical<00:00:19.820> freestyle<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:21.689> Carver

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
symmetrical freestyle little Carver
commuter<00:00:22.949> board<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:24.660> it's

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
commuter board out of it so because it's

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.700 
commuter board out of it so because it's
still<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> really<00:00:25.050> good<00:00:25.289> board<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.680> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
still a really good board but it's a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.400 
still a really good board but it's a
little<00:00:25.859> bit<00:00:25.949> shoot<00:00:26.130> up<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> edges<00:00:27.260> so<00:00:28.260> this

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
little bit shoot up at the edges so this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.040 
little bit shoot up at the edges so this
is<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.800> drop<00:00:29.220> thru<00:00:29.840> drive<00:00:30.840> thru

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
is it it's drop thru drive thru

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.569 
is it it's drop thru drive thru
templates<00:00:31.470> right<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.550> cardboard<00:00:34.579> so

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
templates right there just cardboard so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.819 
templates right there just cardboard so
yeah<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.829> 32

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
yeah that's it right there it's about 32

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.790 
yeah that's it right there it's about 32
inches<00:00:37.860> long<00:00:38.480> 8<00:00:39.480> inches<00:00:39.840> wide<00:00:40.079> 24<00:00:40.680> inch

inches long 8 inches wide 24 inch
wheelbase<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.370> think<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.420> that's

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
wheelbase I think it's about that that's

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660 
wheelbase I think it's about that that's
might<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> exact<00:00:43.800> specs<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.489> that's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
might not be the exact specs but that's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.180 
might not be the exact specs but that's
pretty<00:00:45.180> close<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
pretty close and it's going to have a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
pretty close and it's going to have a
good<00:00:47.430> amount<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> concave<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> be

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
good amount of concave it's going to be

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
good amount of concave it's going to be
it's<00:00:49.230> gonna<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.590> nice<00:00:49.800> sport<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> think

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it's gonna be really nice sport I think

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
it's gonna be really nice sport I think
and<00:00:50.579> um<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.239> I'll<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:51.989> soon<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and um so I'll make it pretty soon you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
and um so I'll make it pretty soon you
know<00:00:52.620> hopefully<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.100> shop<00:00:53.280> class<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.820> they

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
know hopefully in shop class when they

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.990 
know hopefully in shop class when they
fix<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> saws<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> have

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
fix the saws and it's going to have

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.810 
fix the saws and it's going to have
slant<00:00:57.530> 150<00:00:58.530> millimeter<00:00:58.920> trucks<00:00:59.250> which<00:00:59.670> is
