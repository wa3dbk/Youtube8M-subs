00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770

but that really concludes my my review
of<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:22.950> PSP<00:02:23.460> 3000<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:25.200> hope<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.590> enjoyed

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
of my PSP 3000 I really hope you enjoyed

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.930 
of my PSP 3000 I really hope you enjoyed
it<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:27.060> my<00:02:27.210> overall<00:02:27.600> view<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.080> PSP<00:02:28.940> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
it but my overall view on the PSP the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.450 
it but my overall view on the PSP the
PSP<00:02:30.300> 3000<00:02:30.840> overall<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.500> would<00:02:31.560> give<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.130> nine

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
PSP 3000 overall I would give it a nine

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.110 
PSP 3000 overall I would give it a nine
point<00:02:32.760> one<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.330> ten<00:02:33.680> it's<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.130> PSP<00:02:35.520> 3000

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
point one out of ten it's a the PSP 3000

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.500 
point one out of ten it's a the PSP 3000
is<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.330> decent<00:02:36.870> upgrade<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> PSP<00:02:38.040> line<00:02:38.510> but

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
is a decent upgrade to the PSP line but

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.270 
is a decent upgrade to the PSP line but
trust<00:02:39.870> me<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.590> you're<00:02:40.739> thinking<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.160> getting

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
trust me if you're thinking of getting

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.949 
trust me if you're thinking of getting
the<00:02:41.489> PSP<00:02:41.940> 3000<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.350> 2000<00:02:44.190> model

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
the PSP 3000 and you have the 2000 model

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.660 
the PSP 3000 and you have the 2000 model
really<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.830> worth<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.640> upgrade

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
really it's not really worth the upgrade

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.770 
really it's not really worth the upgrade
just<00:02:48.239> keep<00:02:48.600> your<00:02:48.750> mm<00:02:50.150> also<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.390> really<00:02:51.540> much

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
just keep your mm also not really much

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.479 
just keep your mm also not really much
of<00:02:51.810> an<00:02:52.050> upgrade<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> 1000<00:02:53.400> but

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
of an upgrade if you have a 1000 but

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.979 
of an upgrade if you have a 1000 but
trust<00:02:53.730> me<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.989> really<00:02:55.290> don't<00:02:55.500> need<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.860> but

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
trust me you really don't need it but

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.360
