00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
and then let's say I want to put

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.380 
and then let's say I want to put
twitterrific<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:26.230> my<00:03:26.530> background<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:28.180> i<00:03:28.270> would

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
twitterrific on my background so i would

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.650 
twitterrific on my background so i would
keep<00:03:28.570> pressing<00:03:28.960> the<00:03:29.080> home<00:03:29.260> button<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:30.150> then

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.670 

so<00:03:34.660> i'll<00:03:34.840> keep<00:03:35.080> pressing<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.470> home<00:03:35.650> button

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
so i'll keep pressing the home button

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.410 
so i'll keep pressing the home button
and<00:03:36.250> then<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:39.250> would<00:03:41.280> by<00:03:42.280> default<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:43.030> run<00:03:43.300> it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
and then it would by default you run it

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.110 
and then it would by default you run it
in<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.630> background<00:03:44.110> but<00:03:44.800> then<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.940> only

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120
