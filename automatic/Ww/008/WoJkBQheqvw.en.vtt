 Hi everyone, this blog snow, and today I am 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.670
 Here to show you mine. 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.670
 favorite mobile apps 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.760
 who has his side does not even know how annoying it is 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.430
 the good practice is the name of the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.199
 legal apps are apple only then 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.699
 it ends here who has your android not 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.120
 can find a lot about assets 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.140
 Leggett I searched quite a long time 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.960
 some time I downloaded all the pine 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.170
 applications and stating if I liked 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 not for me to get my apps 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 Preferred 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.960
 I'll show you the first one now. 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.000
 The goal that I'm going to show you is 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.809
 Evernote Evernote helps me a lot 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.210
 because it's like a notepad but 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 that you can leave your cell phone or 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.590
 computer 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 The good thing about this is that since I work with 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.420
 the blog business 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.040
 sometimes I need to use some things 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 on my cell phone on the computer then it's 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.380
 It is easier to pass here than pass 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.360
 for the job, it's a lot of work 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.700
 so you can attach photos videos is 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.200
 files of any kind for 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.159
 the next is the next application is the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.470
 shazam 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.079
 the chez ethics so you have a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.909
 restaurant you are in a store 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.920
 located in the mall and you hear a 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.700
 cool music but you do not know the name of the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.790
 music 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.079
 Cesar is for this, it's just you 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 here he will listen to the song and will 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.560
 tell the singer the album is the oil was 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.509
 released will show everything right 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 It's good because I've already encountered several 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.180
 songs here, this question all 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.250
 songs I've already found and then 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.189
 only you leave the computer for you 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:08.369
 See you right here and give you a choice 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.600
 listening here is ok 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.300
 next 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.840
 is the next objective is an application 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.450
 photos is ox is nitro I already showed to 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.210
 my me she kind of loved it 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.340
 It's a favorite photo objective, it's him 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.560
 that I use for all most 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.560
 my conditions and use it because he 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.340
 has an effect that is my favorite of 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.410
 all 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.240
 I do not like the strong photo effect. 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.050
 so I'll show you how he 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.650
 stay 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.390
 I'm going to get a picture of me here, me. 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.300
 I got this photo here. 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.740
 Then he will give you the photo to adjust. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.120
 also what you want 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.340
 the descent is ok, and you're coming 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 This is the original photo, the effect I 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.350
 I like this one here, see. 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.480
 one illuminated in the photo and the one 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.970
 cool contrast in the picture is nothing much 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.210
 so that's why I like him 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.730
 besides you can put the ball 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.800
 you can put those effects 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.920
 here you see you can increase or 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.500
 I have also noticed that I like 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.150
 that 's just here in the corner 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.280
 're seeing still can you fix the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.570
 temperature elimination 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.660
 these things so most of the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:35.550
 photo managers make another application 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.160
 good this app some people have 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.930
 angry with me because of it because to 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.060
 me it's the best app in the world 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.000
 application that have already invented a 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.060
 face that invented if app it is of 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.070
 most serious men app because it is 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.790
 well I do not know if you know it's just one 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.370
 person counts a lot of bad joke too much 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.020
 then this app helps me in 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.790
 my Indian legs are as follows 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.060
 every time you find a bad joke I 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.270
 I'll make a sound from here, for example. 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.330
 I'm going to tell you a joke because the 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:18.540
 police do not like soap business and 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.820
 there are people then this app is too much 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.080
 because of this because he has 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:39.390
 all sounds yesterday other sounds here he 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:41.010
 must have sound here is to see that that 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:50.250
 if the stone was too bad you can 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:54.210
 to put this you have that then have 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.520
 various sounds look goes several sounds that 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.130
 you push the button you make the sound that 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.330
 you want 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:06.120
 let's go to another mouth had the other 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.910
 application that is also very good is 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.450
 Photo request is the vs cocan 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:17.760
 he has this app here 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.640
 he has it is very good you can create 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.710
 their own effects or use the 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.460
 effects that already have here are also let's 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.540
 I'll take a picture inside the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.820
 gallery choose photo this thing like this 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.600
 and uploaded the photo after I 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.540
 I chose 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.840
 and then I just like who I am I chose this 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.160
 photo here this is the photo without effect to him 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.640
 has several effects he has done in 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:51.000
 black and white has these effects here 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:55.040
 have to be done here all and done there 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.040
 I have my favorites that are this one 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.030
 this is where he also gives only one 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:09.750
 dog in the photo 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:12.180
 This is black and white and this one that 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.740
 It's also one I like 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:21.120
 the cool it is that you can fix the 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.120
 contrast to lighting all that 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:29.569
 you can increase the temperature looks 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:32.990
 You set it any way you want. 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.399
 has more settings than others 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.779
 applications 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:39.679
 so that's what makes it pretty cool 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:42.080
 also in names for the latter to apply 

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:44.449
 what this app helps me 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.779
 a lot is the instant sais 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.610
 this application is useful because it is the 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:52.009
 dais great when you will post a 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.929
 great fact he always focus cuts a 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.999
 photo framed for example if I 

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:59.389
 take a picture here now it would cut 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:01.429
 more or less here would explain 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.899
 border on the photo so she can 

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:04.490
