00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.660
 hello today we will talk to you 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.430
 about making yeast dough 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.290
 many that this process is pretty 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.480
 difficult but not so important to consider 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.410
 technology of preparation and competently 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.150
 work with dragee 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.580
 Yeast is such a microscopic 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.410
 organisms that are at optimal 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.050
 coincidence begin to grow 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.390
 this process is called fermentation at 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.420
 this they give off alcohol and carbon dioxide 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.850
 alcohol makes our dough sour 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.939
 smell and carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.530
 loosen it and make arable land there are two 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.629
 dough preparation method 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.269
 and guys and we are safe 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.109
 bezoparnym prepare the dough in no 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.210
 first it is easier 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:50.920
 and secondly, I like it better for 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:50.920
 of this we need flour salt milk 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.629
 butter sugar and yeast the first thing 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.750
 will need to do this sift 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.360
 flour and and we will need 500 grams 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.040
 for this we use this 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:11.270
 sieve them or take a sieve 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.380
 spoon flour into it flour way flour 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.380
 should be at room temperature 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.510
 take a special container 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:35.189
 and sift her flour we do it for 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.710
 so that it is saturated with oxygen and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:44.570
 the dough became more airy and fluffy 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.450
 remove the sifter take the milk 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.729
 we will need it 250 milliliters or 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.150
 1 glass 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.150
 pour into the tank 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:10.030
 add 10 grams of dry yeast and two 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.030
 tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.050
 take the whisk 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.430
 we whip slightly 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.280
 add two pinches of salt to flour 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.660
 and 6 tablespoons of vegetable oil 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.530
 now combine our milk with flour 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.630
 the basic rule of cooking any 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.410
 the dough is to add liquid to the flour 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.410
 they are the opposite 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.460
 we shift our dough to the table 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:27.579
 and begin to mix it mix 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:27.579
 under the edges of our dough in the middle 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.280
 important role in shaping dough 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.730
 play dishes and 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.530
 or as it is called gluten when 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.540
 kneading dough gluten can 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.760
 win over so that it is no longer 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.040
 will be so elastic therefore not worth it 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.249
 be too zealous 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.659
 we shift our dough into a bowl and 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.939
 we can cover it with a towel 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:58.250
 film or such special 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:04:04.209
 cover and remove to a warm place for minutes 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:06.739
 30 to 40 as you can see the dough has risen 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.430
 Now it needs to be pressed to remove 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.430
 carbon dioxide 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:27.590
 we are laying 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:33.080
 and remove to a warm place this time 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.220
 minutes for 20 to 30 as you can see dough 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.620
 came up the second time 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.130
 now you can make cakes out of it 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.050
 pies buns by the way exactly buns we 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.650
 will do with you this time for this 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.380
 we will need sesame dried cherries without 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.380
 pumpkin seed and egg 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:59.620
 we shift our dough to the table 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.620
 its in two parts 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.450
 in one part we mix the cherry in another 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.450
 we mix some Finnish 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:01.030
 we got 2 dough one with cherry 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.630
 another seed is now starting 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.630
 form a pool 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:14.070
 tear off a small piece and circular 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:17.160
 movements press the edges of the dough to the middle 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:22.180
 form here such round buns 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.600
 take the lattice let's go not silicone 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.639
 mat 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.580
 By the way, oil it is not 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.430
 need to put a bun around no 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.169
 such a mat can take advantage 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.449
 ordinary baking sheet populated pgama 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.260
 or greased and start 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:38.370
 to form 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.370
 leftover buns 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:58.720
 we put the buns on the mat now 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:03.030
 cover them give a little rest a 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.030
 we are still in volume 1 egg 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:19.569
 so that our buns were rosy and 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:24.879
 brilliantly grease them with a beaten egg for 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:29.699
 of this we take a brush and uniform 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:29.699
 movements we grease all surface 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.830
 and now we sprinkle our sesame buns 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:52.979
 and put them in preheated to 180 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:52.979
 degrees oven for 20-25 minutes 

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.500
 buns ready to put tea
