there's real time radar takes a little

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 
there's real time radar takes a little
bit<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> load<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.699> animated<00:01:00.390> radar<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
bit to load but it is animated radar so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
bit to load but it is animated radar so
that<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:02.039> give<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.140> let<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.439> know

like overhead so as you can see today

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.789 
like overhead so as you can see today
there's<00:01:10.740> nothing<00:01:11.460> there's<00:01:11.880> nada<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
there's nothing there's nada but then it

north central Wisconsin and so forth one
of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> things<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.070> wanted<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> show<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
of the things I wanted to show you

of the things I wanted to show you
particularly<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> LG<00:01:25.259> ignite<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:27.030> LG

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
particularly on the LG ignite is the LG

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.620 
particularly on the LG ignite is the LG
ignite<00:01:27.750> comes<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:29.000> weather<00:01:30.000> widget<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
ignite comes with a weather widget that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.830 
ignite comes with a weather widget that
is<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:31.140> powered<00:01:31.590> by<00:01:32.390> AccuWeather<00:01:33.390> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is actually powered by AccuWeather so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.499 
is actually powered by AccuWeather so
this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> widget<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.460> sits<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:35.970> my<00:01:36.150> screen

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
this is a widget that sits on my screen

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.740 
this is a widget that sits on my screen
and<00:01:37.430> taps<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.970> pulls<00:01:39.150> open<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.600> widget

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and taps it and it pulls open a widget

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.899 
and taps it and it pulls open a widget
so<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:40.920> different<00:01:41.369> look<00:01:41.579> but

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so it's just a little different look but

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.810 
so it's just a little different look but
it's<00:01:42.090> pulling<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> same<00:01:42.810> information<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
it's pulling the same information so it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.450 
it's pulling the same information so it
gives<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> nice<00:01:45.570> graphic<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
gives you a nice graphic of the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
gives you a nice graphic of the
conditions<00:01:47.460> outside<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.899> look<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.229> hourly

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
conditions outside I can look at hourly

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.859 
conditions outside I can look at hourly
conditions<00:01:50.250> highs<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.909> lows<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.570> look

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
conditions highs and lows you know look

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.749 
conditions highs and lows you know look
at<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:51.990> information<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.890> then<00:01:53.070> similarly<00:01:53.610> a
