00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello I am and benavidez and this is a 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.069
 advice over practical natural cooking 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.250
 this time we are going to make a dressing 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.460
 of mustard and honey is one of my 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 favorites for a long time I searched 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.370
 some way to do it 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.140
 I found it with a boat bought in a 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.930
 very specific place that was very expensive 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.990
 and finally I got to the perfect mix 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.760
 that I like I remind you that you can 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.189
 put a little more than one ingredient 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.620
 a little bit more of the other depending on 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.379
 what it is that your family likes 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.239

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.629
 spoonful of mayonnaise two tablespoons 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.420
 honey and a little seasoning to me 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.819

00:00:53.819 --> 00:01:00.260

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.580
 a little more 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.030
 two tablespoons of honey 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.040

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.080
 my taste is the best in the world very good 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.080
 very pure and very cheap 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.659
 I repeat that this is to your liking now 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.230
 I have already met people who like more 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.000
 sweet flavor that predominant 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.530

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.200

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.710
 give your personal touch 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.600
 if you like more one ingredient than another 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.400

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.369
 a little bit this amount I'm 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.330
 doing is more or less for two dishes 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.330
 of salad we stir it perfectly 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.830
 I'm doing it with a fork what 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.230
 you can do with a beater if you have it 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.600
 if you do not have no problem, nothing 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.640
