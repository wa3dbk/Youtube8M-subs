00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
seconds so that's pretty cool it didn't

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
seconds so that's pretty cool it didn't
really<00:01:16.439> roll<00:01:16.740> two<00:01:16.890> greatest<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.670> no

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
really roll two greatest at so no

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.289

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
obvious I don't use a deadly reach so

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.060 
obvious I don't use a deadly reach so
that's<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:21.450> very<00:01:21.600> useful<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.170> me<00:01:22.320> let's<00:01:22.950> move

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that's not very useful to me let's move

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.460 
that's not very useful to me let's move
on<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> pants<00:01:23.850> ooh<00:01:24.060> these<00:01:24.780> look<00:01:25.200> pretty

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
decent they did roll all resistance some

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.440 
decent they did roll all resistance some
pretty<00:01:28.140> high<00:01:28.380> decks<00:01:28.650> although<00:01:29.460> no<00:01:29.700> sockets<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
pretty high decks although no sockets so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
pretty high decks although no sockets so
you<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.770> able<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you know I'm not going to be able to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.499 
you know I'm not going to be able to
make<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> damage<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.329> got

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
make up for the damage then we got

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.749 
make up for the damage then we got
terios<00:01:34.079> might<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.560> pretty<00:01:34.979> much<00:01:35.189> needs<00:01:35.460> three

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
terios might it pretty much needs three

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
terios might it pretty much needs three
sockets<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:37.079> great<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
sockets to be really great but it is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.420 
sockets to be really great but it is
still<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> great<00:01:39.090> chest<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> ninety

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
movement speed out of it so it is still

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
movement speed out of it so it is still
a<00:01:45.869> pretty<00:01:46.049> great<00:01:46.229> chest<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.770> lower<00:01:47.280> end<00:01:47.520> gear

random<00:03:16.829> rolls<00:03:17.040> on<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.430> or<00:03:17.609> maybe<00:03:18.569> even<00:03:18.690> three<00:03:19.199> I

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
random rolls on it or maybe even three I

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.129 
random rolls on it or maybe even three I

know it rolls life / hit for sure and I

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.539 
know it rolls life / hit for sure and I
believe<00:03:23.510> attack<00:03:24.510> speed<00:03:25.040> but<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.160> one<00:03:26.370> didn't

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
believe attack speed but this one didn't

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.170 
believe attack speed but this one didn't
turn<00:03:26.579> out<00:03:26.849> too<00:03:27.030> well<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:28.349> I'll<00:03:28.440> put<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.739> aside

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
turn out too well so I'll put that aside

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.509 
turn out too well so I'll put that aside
so<00:03:30.180> out<00:03:30.569> of<00:03:30.599> all<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.169> I<00:03:31.410> didn't<00:03:32.250> get<00:03:32.310> too
