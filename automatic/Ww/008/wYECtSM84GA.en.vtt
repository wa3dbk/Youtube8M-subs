00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
it during cooking I'm gonna cover it

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.190 
it during cooking I'm gonna cover it
with<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.390> double<00:01:19.780> layer<00:01:20.020> of<00:01:20.049> foil<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:23.020> rub

a<00:01:23.229> little<00:01:23.470> bit<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.649> butter<00:01:23.830> across<00:01:24.220> it<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:24.429> it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
a little bit of butter across it so it

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.149 
a little bit of butter across it so it
doesn't<00:01:24.729> stick<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.720> surface<00:01:26.200> just<00:01:26.500> make

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
doesn't stick to the surface just make

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.310 
doesn't stick to the surface just make
them<00:01:27.280> complete<00:01:27.700> in<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.030> top<00:01:28.270> by<00:01:28.539> folding<00:01:29.200> it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
them complete in the top by folding it

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.669 
them complete in the top by folding it
over<00:01:29.789> now<00:01:30.789> put<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.179> side<00:01:31.420> down<00:01:31.690> on<00:01:32.200> top<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.619> the

over now put it side down on top of the

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.020 
over now put it side down on top of the
basin<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.259> we're<00:01:35.350> gonna<00:01:35.470> use<00:01:35.770> that<00:01:35.950> rim<00:01:36.310> to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
basin and we're gonna use that rim to

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.430 
basin and we're gonna use that rim to
tie<00:01:37.209> the<00:01:37.270> string<00:01:37.390> around<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.959> that<00:01:38.049> helped<00:01:38.319> us

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
tie the string around and that helped us

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.100 
tie the string around and that helped us
to<00:01:38.530> get<00:01:38.679> it<00:01:38.799> in<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.039> out<00:01:39.069> of<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.369> pan<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:40.110> loop

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
to get it in and out of the pan a loop

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.169 
to get it in and out of the pan a loop
of<00:01:41.200> string<00:01:41.350> around<00:01:43.080> clear<00:01:44.909> across<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.090> the

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.469 
of string around clear across to the
other<00:01:46.299> side<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.520> bring<00:01:48.819> it<00:01:49.030> back<00:01:49.060> round<00:01:49.360> to

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
other side and bring it back round to

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.670 
other side and bring it back round to
form<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.810> handle

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
form a handle

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.070

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
go about halfway up the sides now that's

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.419 
go about halfway up the sides now that's
going<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.140> take<00:02:09.229> about<00:02:09.380> two<00:02:09.800> hours<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.130> cook

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
going to take about two hours to cook

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.040 
going to take about two hours to cook
through<00:02:10.729> keep<00:02:11.090> an<00:02:11.240> eye<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.600> make<00:02:11.810> sure<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.410 
lid fits well and the steam stays within
and<00:02:14.240> then<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.450> doesn't<00:02:14.690> boil<00:02:14.990> dry<00:02:16.420> when

some<00:02:24.890> castor<00:02:25.340> sugar<00:02:25.370> then<00:02:26.180> we<00:02:26.270> need<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.570> heat

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
some castor sugar then we need to heat

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.870 
some castor sugar then we need to heat
that<00:02:27.230> gently<00:02:27.709> stirring<00:02:28.250> every<00:02:28.640> now<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.850> again

that gently stirring every now and again

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.000 
that gently stirring every now and again
until<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.330> sugar<00:02:29.540> dissolves<00:02:29.800> while<00:02:30.800> that's

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
until the sugar dissolves while that's

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.320 
until the sugar dissolves while that's
warming<00:02:31.250> I'm<00:02:31.580> just<00:02:31.700> going<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.880> slice<00:02:32.090> my

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
warming I'm just going to slice my

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.640 
warming I'm just going to slice my
orange<00:02:34.570> now<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.630> sugars<00:02:35.959> dissolved<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.590> I'm

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
orange now the sugars dissolved so I'm

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.770 
orange now the sugars dissolved so I'm
going<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.830> pop<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> slices<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.600> just

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
going to pop in the slices and it's just

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.710 
going to pop in the slices and it's just
gonna<00:02:38.900> simmer<00:02:39.260> away<00:02:39.380> for<00:02:39.560> about<00:02:39.980> 30<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.360> 40

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
gonna simmer away for about 30 to 40

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.210 
gonna simmer away for about 30 to 40
minutes<00:02:42.020> until<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.500> mixture<00:02:42.620> goes<00:02:42.950> really

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
minutes until the mixture goes really

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.250 
minutes until the mixture goes really
thick<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.270> syrupy<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.660> sort<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.930> goes<00:02:45.080> like

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
thick and syrupy it sort of goes like

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.230 
thick and syrupy it sort of goes like
golden<00:02:45.740> syrup<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.370> texture<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.000> will

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
golden syrup and it's texture so it will

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.860 
golden syrup and it's texture so it will
reduce<00:02:47.600> down<00:02:47.630> quite<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.140> lot<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.800> time<00:02:49.870> and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
reduce down quite a lot in that time and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.390 
reduce down quite a lot in that time and
the<00:02:50.990> puddings<00:02:51.260> been<00:02:51.410> cooking<00:02:51.740> for<00:02:51.920> two<00:02:52.070> hours

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the puddings been cooking for two hours

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.690 
the puddings been cooking for two hours
so<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.790> ready<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.340> good<00:02:55.520> idea

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
so it's ready and now it's a good idea

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.699 
so it's ready and now it's a good idea
just<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> leave<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.630> sit<00:02:56.900> for<00:02:56.930> five<00:02:57.320> minutes

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
just to leave it to sit for five minutes

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.729 
just to leave it to sit for five minutes
before<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.130> turn<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.459> out<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:03.260> looks<00:03:03.440> very

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
before you turn it out it looks very

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.490 
before you turn it out it looks very
nice<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.459> there<00:03:04.700> it's<00:03:05.390> probably<00:03:05.840> easiest<00:03:06.230> I

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
nice in there it's probably easiest I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.560 
nice in there it's probably easiest I
think<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.830> put<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.790> plate<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.180> top<00:03:08.360> because

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
think to put the plate on top because

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.850 
think to put the plate on top because
it's<00:03:08.690> quite<00:03:08.870> heavy<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.320> then<00:03:09.410> turn<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.739> that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
it's quite heavy and then turn it that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.800 
it's quite heavy and then turn it that
