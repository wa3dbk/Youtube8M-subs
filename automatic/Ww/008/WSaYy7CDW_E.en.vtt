00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
I played so yeah so all now we see a lot

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 
I played so yeah so all now we see a lot
of<00:00:55.379> different<00:00:55.860> pixie<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.309> Europe<00:00:56.640> we've<00:00:56.820> seen

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of different pixie in Europe we've seen

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.880 
of different pixie in Europe we've seen
something<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.660> team<00:00:57.899> when<00:00:58.109> na<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.829> do

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
something like the team when na what do

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.290 
something like the team when na what do
you<00:00:58.949> actually<00:00:59.039> think<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.789> all<00:00:59.910> these<00:01:00.030> pics

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you actually think about all these pics

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
you actually think about all these pics
I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:01.500> every<00:01:02.309> region<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.730> kind<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
I think every region is kind of

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.780 
I think every region is kind of
experimenting<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.619> pics<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.640> can

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
experimenting a lot with pics what can

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
experimenting a lot with pics what can
work<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.600> break<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> method<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:07.350> something

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
work to break the method or something

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490 
work to break the method or something
because<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:09.600> meta<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.260> pretty

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
because the meta right now is pretty

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
because the meta right now is pretty
boring<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.189> honest<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.850> three<00:01:12.270> pigs

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
good na Jeong us all right now because I
didn't<00:01:45.750> play<00:01:45.869> them<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> month<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.939> think

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
didn't play them in a month and I think

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
didn't play them in a month and I think
that<00:01:48.420> European<00:01:49.140> jungles<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.740> probably

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that European jungles are like probably

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
that European jungles are like probably
one<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> strongest<00:01:50.549> position<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.299> they

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
one of the strongest position and they

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.240 
one of the strongest position and they
have<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> lot<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> jungles<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:53.040> really

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
have a lot of jungles that are really

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
have a lot of jungles that are really
good<00:01:53.430> mechanically<00:01:54.000> skills<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.720> wears<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
good mechanically skills and wears an a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.399 
good mechanically skills and wears an a
it's<00:01:56.490> um<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.299> can't<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:57.899> tell<00:01:58.170> much<00:01:58.350> about

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it's um I can't really tell much about

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.950 
it's um I can't really tell much about
it<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.549> both<00:02:00.210> reasons<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it but I think both reasons are in a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.569 
it but I think both reasons are in a
fine<00:02:01.350> spot<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
fine spot right now and have like the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.700 
fine spot right now and have like the
same<00:02:02.610> champion<00:02:03.090> pigs<00:02:03.270> same<00:02:04.049> type<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> play

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
same champion pigs same type of play

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.660 
same champion pigs same type of play

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.640 
jungle is coming up or personally
thinking<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:17.909> think<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.420> spirit<00:02:19.049> stone<00:02:19.319> buff

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
thinking I think the spirit stone buff

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.880 
thinking I think the spirit stone buff
is<00:02:20.069> pretty<00:02:20.670> Opie<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.359> think<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.290> gives<00:02:22.439> some

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
is pretty Opie I think it gives some

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.890 
is pretty Opie I think it gives some
Janice<00:02:23.430> too<00:02:23.700> much<00:02:23.879> sustain<00:02:24.269> like<00:02:24.659> for<00:02:24.840> example

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
Janice too much sustain like for example

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.929 
Janice too much sustain like for example
