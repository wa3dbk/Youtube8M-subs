00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
again there are three things when it

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.920 
again there are three things when it
comes<00:00:06.920> to<00:00:07.189> accurate<00:00:08.029> and<00:00:08.180> successful

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
comes to accurate and successful

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.379 
comes to accurate and successful
forehands<00:00:09.799> and<00:00:09.860> backhands<00:00:09.950> and<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:11.120> first

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
forehands and backhands and the first

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.140 
forehands and backhands and the first
one<00:00:11.660> is<00:00:11.900> the<00:00:12.440> height<00:00:12.710> of<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.429> ball<00:00:13.610> over<00:00:14.030> the

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
one is the height of the ball over the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.060 
one is the height of the ball over the
net<00:00:14.179> now<00:00:14.750> this<00:00:14.870> is<00:00:15.049> something<00:00:15.230> that<00:00:15.500> too<00:00:15.860> many

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
net now this is something that too many

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.730 
net now this is something that too many
people<00:00:16.580> actually<00:00:16.939> don't<00:00:17.390> appreciate<00:00:17.720> so<00:00:18.200> have

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
people actually don't appreciate so have

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.010 
people actually don't appreciate so have

tournament in America and just take a
look<00:00:28.790> at<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.090> height<00:00:29.360> of<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.899> ball<00:00:30.079> as<00:00:30.290> it

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
look at the height of the ball as it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.380 
look at the height of the ball as it
travels<00:00:30.950> over<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.369> net<00:00:31.579> because<00:00:31.969> there's<00:00:32.210> a

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
travels over the net because there's a

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.299 
travels over the net because there's a
definite<00:00:33.050> relationship<00:00:33.230> between<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.100> height

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
definite relationship between the height

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.610 
definite relationship between the height
of<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.579> ball<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.480> eventual<00:00:35.960> depth<00:00:36.440> of

of the ball and the eventual depth of

of the ball and the eventual depth of
the<00:00:36.710> ball<00:00:36.890> too<00:00:37.370> many<00:00:37.550> people<00:00:37.940> think<00:00:38.420> that

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
the ball too many people think that

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.209 
the ball too many people think that
you've<00:00:38.719> got<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:38.960> hit<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.199> ball<00:00:39.350> low<00:00:39.859> over<00:00:40.190> the

you've got to hit the ball low over the

net and the only problem with Burrell is

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.329 
net and the only problem with Burrell is
that<00:00:41.899> they<00:00:42.019> drop<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.469> ball<00:00:42.679> short<00:00:43.010> if<00:00:43.160> you

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
that they drop the ball short if you

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.700 
that they drop the ball short if you
want<00:00:43.670> depth<00:00:44.359> from<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:44.719> board<00:00:44.960> you've<00:00:45.199> got<00:00:45.499> to
