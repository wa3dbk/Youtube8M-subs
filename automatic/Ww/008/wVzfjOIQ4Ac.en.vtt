00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.889
 so that's the end of what for 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.210
 feeling is here yes I do not know either 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.280
 really 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.440
 we have a done all that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.119
 well but we also lost the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.369
 maybe we could still point 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.720
 and LEDs also not good I succeeded 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.070
 just hear that appreciate will just be 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 switched off 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.279
 so yes i am actually from the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 contest 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.619
 yes i think it was the first half 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.420
 there it is 10 minutes name it is 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 I think audience enjoy what you find out 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 and get that wonderful feeling yeah yeah 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 definitely went out just as good what 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.860
 that really good in the match and then 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.640
 if there is such a big light they get it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 longer buildings 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.350
 breaking point was your second yellow card yes 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.670
 Yes I think so 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 I just think it's a good action 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.199
 van van mission and I still have three baskets 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 he said I sat in your back 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.149
 with that I make that make that action and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 yes then it is off the field and how know 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.309
 you know that it is going to be incredibly difficult 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.840
 to become 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.340
 yes of course it is a whole in one 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 with 10 people 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.909
 yes then it becomes difficult for healthy ones 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 of course different but no then you know 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.900
 that it is almost finished how is it over 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.260
 against this big team player 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
 opponent stand suarez messi neymar yes 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.799
 just fantastic 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.990
 much respect for them but did not see a country 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.950
 bloom black like one for you 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 opponents 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 what was it like to play against them yes 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 beautiful goes now is of course the well-known 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 action that you already want to run on 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.509
 the last minute hairdresser you know that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 kind of stuff and I think it's okay 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.500
 Of course he was going or likely 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.079
 but we don't sin well but happy 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 happy authority minutes later 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.920
 perhaps hoped for a draw 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.750
 giving us the chance to continue 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.189
 that is unfortunately now in and we 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.850
 we should now be entitled to the third 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.280
 place 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 yeah that's sour i think we will this year 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.299
 also a goal of course last season 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.119
 we wanted to continue 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.610
 walked into jimmy's that's now the case 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.240
 but now have to switch the same before 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.240
 the europe body
