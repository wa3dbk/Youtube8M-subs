whatever<00:01:57.540> well<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.770> don't<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
whatever well we don't really have to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.539 
whatever well we don't really have to
cross<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.000> Atlantic<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.040> surveillance

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
cross the Atlantic so the surveillance

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.969 
cross the Atlantic so the surveillance
is<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> come<00:02:03.509> big<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.469> Europe

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
is going to come big time in Europe

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.340 
is going to come big time in Europe
there<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.219> already<00:02:05.570> many<00:02:06.570> plans<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.200> place

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
there are already many plans in place

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
there are already many plans in place
and<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.310> don't<00:02:08.459> stop<00:02:08.759> them<00:02:09.000> we're<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and if we don't stop them we're going to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.590 
and if we don't stop them we're going to
have<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> data<00:02:10.890> retention<00:02:11.220> law<00:02:11.760> active

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
have a data retention law active

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.920 
have a data retention law active
all<00:02:13.080> over<00:02:13.350> Europe<00:02:13.800> which<00:02:14.040> basically<00:02:14.520> means

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
all over Europe which basically means

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.410 
all over Europe which basically means
logging<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.170> storing<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.280> traffic<00:02:17.520> not

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
software project we launched it's sort

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.520 
software project we launched it's sort
of<00:03:14.520> do-it-yourself<00:03:14.970> surveillance<00:03:15.960> and<00:03:16.290> it's

both men to have a fun tool to work with

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.250 
both men to have a fun tool to work with
to<00:03:19.650> do<00:03:20.280> tracking<00:03:20.910> at<00:03:21.090> events<00:03:21.510> which<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.080> be<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
to do tracking at events which can be a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.710 
to do tracking at events which can be a
useful<00:03:22.470> thing<00:03:22.710> but<00:03:23.430> also<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.850> learn<00:03:24.450> about

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
useful thing but also to learn about

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.620 
useful thing but also to learn about
surveillance<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.830> general<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:27.060> have<00:03:27.330> been

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
surveillance in general so we have been

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.500 
surveillance in general so we have been
putting<00:03:28.050> out<00:03:28.140> everything<00:03:28.890> in<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.640> open<00:03:29.970> the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
analysis on the on the data it's

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.050 
analysis on the on the data it's
basically<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.500> who<00:04:11.010> talks<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.490> who<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.670> who

far<00:05:33.270> as<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:33.480> conference<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.730> think<00:05:35.730> it's<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:35.970> it's

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
far as a conference I think it's a it's

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.600 
far as a conference I think it's a it's
a<00:05:36.990> well-designed<00:05:37.500> conference<00:05:38.070> because<00:05:38.310> they

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
a well-designed conference because they

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.920 
a well-designed conference because they
sort<00:05:38.850> of<00:05:38.940> made<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.390> that<00:05:39.990> it's<00:05:40.560> not<00:05:40.950> just<00:05:41.280> about

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
sort of made it that it's not just about

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.330 
sort of made it that it's not just about
commercial<00:05:42.930> stuff<00:05:43.170> it's<00:05:43.410> not<00:05:43.590> only<00:05:43.860> about

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
commercial stuff it's not only about

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.600 
commercial stuff it's not only about
blogging<00:05:45.210> or<00:05:45.480> blogging<00:05:45.960> but<00:05:46.890> you<00:05:47.100> have<00:05:47.280> all

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
blogging or blogging but you have all

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.600 
blogging or blogging but you have all
these<00:05:48.060> things<00:05:48.420> are<00:05:48.780> pretty<00:05:49.140> active<00:05:49.710> along

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
these things are pretty active along

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.420 
these things are pretty active along
with<00:05:51.120> each<00:05:51.240> other<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:51.810> there's<00:05:52.590> no<00:05:52.830> single

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
with each other and there's no single

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.600 
with each other and there's no single
dominant<00:05:53.960> seen<00:05:54.960> in<00:05:55.320> here<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.890> I<00:05:56.190> think<00:05:56.400> that's

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
dominant seen in here and I think that's

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.430 
dominant seen in here and I think that's
why<00:05:56.790> it<00:05:56.850> works<00:05:57.180> so<00:05:57.300> well<00:05:57.420> so<00:05:57.870> it's<00:05:58.020> all<00:05:58.380> about

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
why it works so well so it's all about

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.920 
why it works so well so it's all about
networking<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.400> people<00:06:00.090> actually<00:06:00.450> talk<00:06:00.660> it's

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
networking and people actually talk it's

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.930 
networking and people actually talk it's
very<00:06:01.110> open<00:06:01.290> everybody<00:06:01.890> listens<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.520> everybody

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
very open everybody listens to everybody

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.820 
very open everybody listens to everybody
