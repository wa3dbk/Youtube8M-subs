00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.210
 hi how about i am the 100 come this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.290
 small tutorial of the body teach 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.670
 make three types of generated from 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.260
 obsidian the easiest subject 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.640
 complicated and good to treat you 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.349
 general if you win try a small 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.670
 trick that exists in machine that yes 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.759
 we grabbed what would be a little 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.200
 rest not rest in general and good at each 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.849
 side to what would be above and close 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.290
 has what would be a water reservoir 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.059
 which is in motion 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.829
 obsidian simply return without 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.210
 lose what would be lava therefore 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.730
 if we grab here what we have a 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.489
 lava bucket we let go over what 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.110
 would be the dot of reston as they see 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.820
 becomes what obsidian would be 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.839
 without losing what lava would be so 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.570
 so much we are going to have a generator 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.039
 infinity of oxidized ok and good to know 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.530
 this is very simple we simply go 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.600
 to place what would be two sides one 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.100
 two tower height by two 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.570
 this side a tower of two height by 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.640
 this other side a thinker in the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.230
 half a hole that would be under the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.850
 dispenser here to jobs has placed 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.609
 that would be a bucket from the to a block 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.739
 quoted from the hole that we did ok and good 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.870
 here we are going to deposit a bucket of 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.670
 wash here the water and here the ok 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.840
 and well, now, the only thing that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.700
 we are going to do is place here what 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.110
 it would be a little button we propose some 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.460
 remains remember that every time 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.540
 let's do this little trick we're going to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.640
 lose what would be one 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.650
 right ok so let's lose one 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.090
 of recovery I take that into account and 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.280
 well now we simply press the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.960
 button quoted leaves the wash we hope that 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.730
 become citizens we return to you 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.290
 to the little button and we already have our block 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.640
 obsidian to do it every time 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.370
 we want every time we put 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.900
 a little bit of subtract ok now let's 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.400
 move to the second which is automatic 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.350
 simply by placing what would be 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 one folded that he cited on this side two 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.900
 blocks and on this side 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.180
 now let's place that would be three 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.670
 back on this side 1 2 and 3 2 by 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.050
 here 2 here and we would stay with this 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.040
 way now we have grasped that they would be 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.020
 repeaters 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.970
 we will use a total of 4 repeaters 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.070
 in this little invention see what they are 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.530
 those looking towards this side and 2 looking 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.170
 to the side of there ok 1 and 2 and everything and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.689
 with delay box 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.240
 shut up no to 4 delay but here 4 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.530
 lag 3 of reston here here we go to 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.210
 open what would be the hole we are going to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.740
 put what would be the bucket the water 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.660
 here we are going to place that follows the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.160
 dispenser looking straight in from 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.520
 we thought has placed that will be the bucket 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.590
 of lava 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.540
 or redstone will be searched 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.310
 and well we simply put here the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.730
 right point we put in a little button 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.019
 ok we press it and as you can see it 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.730
 turns do not study at the moment that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.650
 converted us and diana is returned what 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.260
 would be the lava inside the dispenser without 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.879
 never lose the lava ok we break it down 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.860
 no other correct point we return to 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.810
 give the button turns into obsidian it 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.910
 returns the lava inside thinker and 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.950
 it works 100% ok and now let's move on 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.599
 to the third by which is more or less what 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.129
 same but with a different system ok 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.470
 between use hoppers and if you have left over 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.330
 all good I do not know if it makes them more 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.680
 easy and good simply by placing what 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.150
 They would be two height or side part 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.450
 exactly the same we place the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.660
 huequito the water the bucket of water back 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.430
 here the thinker with lava inside 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.230
 lala ok 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.360
 to think with lava inside let's look 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.210
 to what would be a comparator 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.580
 hoppers 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.870
 move forward to look for what would be 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.340
 by the torches and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.440
 and a rest 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.030
 and well now we simply place what 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.860
 that would be three milestones blocks towards 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.780
 back with which side one makes a new 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.340
 here we put a block quoted here 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.930
 we put a torch to return each 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.700
 one of the rest on top of what would be 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.860
 this block here we are going to place one of 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.780
 reston and one of reston a repeater 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.819
 looking at it there with four delays 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.220
 kane here a compared looking that there 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.690
 and well above the right torch we 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.160
 has caused that there would be two hoppers one 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.080
 thermite here and the other looking straight ahead 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.340
 we break is again now going 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.900
 placed facing the other 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.129
 hopper inside unleashed we 're going to 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.080
 introduce it unite in anyone in this 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.459
 case to another made a little point of rest the 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.959
 right point is going to stay there until 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.900
 that the skewers pay here we are going to 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.910
 place what would be a cute little button 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.560
 ok now let's place what would be the 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.450
 little dot of remains that we always put 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.430
 we put correct conti we press the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.959
 button and as you can see it becomes 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.069
 oxidize in the moment at the moment 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.720
 convert or if they give lava 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.980
 returns to what would be the dispenser and 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.030
 well this following three ways 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.470
 do what would be a generator of 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.090
 Obsidian I hope you liked them 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.959
 have served subscribe life favorites and 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.959
 See you in the next opportunity
