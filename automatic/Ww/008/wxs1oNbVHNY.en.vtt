00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.500 

so<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.069> some<00:00:08.250> knives<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.820> all<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.420> them

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
so you have some knives and all of them

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.820 
so you have some knives and all of them
come<00:00:09.660> pretty<00:00:09.809> decent<00:00:10.139> from<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.290> factory<00:00:10.710> but

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
come pretty decent from the factory but

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.080 
come pretty decent from the factory but
something<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.160> come<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> little<00:00:11.370> bit<00:00:11.580> stiff<00:00:11.880> or

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
something to come a little bit stiff or

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.950 
something to come a little bit stiff or
sometimes<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.510> need<00:00:12.600> to<00:00:12.690> make<00:00:12.809> some

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
sometimes you need to make some

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.540 
sometimes you need to make some
different<00:00:13.110> adjustments<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.830> them<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.220> it's

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
different adjustments to them and it's

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.609 
different adjustments to them and it's
pretty<00:00:14.700> simple<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.450> little<00:00:16.110> video<00:00:16.260> for

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
pretty simple to do a little video for

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.190 
pretty simple to do a little video for
that<00:00:16.800> right<00:00:17.520> here<00:00:17.790> so<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.720> instance<00:00:19.050> this

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
that right here so for instance this

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.490 
that right here so for instance this
this<00:00:19.650> bench<00:00:19.920> made<00:00:20.599> 915<00:00:21.599> triage<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.200> I<00:00:22.230> got

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
this bench made 915 triage that I got

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.470 
this bench made 915 triage that I got
came<00:00:23.250> up<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.579> stiff<00:00:23.820> from<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> factory<00:00:24.419> I'd

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
came up as stiff from the factory I'd

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.060 
came up as stiff from the factory I'd
open<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.810> I'd<00:00:24.930> try<00:00:25.169> and<00:00:25.230> whip<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> open<00:00:25.829> and<00:00:26.009> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
open it I'd try and whip it open and I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
open it I'd try and whip it open and I
would<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.399> to<00:00:26.520> there<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.149> would<00:00:27.270> close<00:00:27.450> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
would get to there and I would close and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.479 
would get to there and I would close and
I<00:00:27.720> tried<00:00:27.960> whip<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.259> open<00:00:28.500> again<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.340> would

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
I tried whip it open again and I would

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.889 
I tried whip it open again and I would
get<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:29.700> there<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.210> kept<00:00:30.419> trying<00:00:30.540> to<00:00:30.689> open

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
get to there and I kept trying to open

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.040 
get to there and I kept trying to open
it<00:00:31.020> and<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.529> kept<00:00:31.770> not<00:00:32.340> opening<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it and it just kept not opening and so

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.389 
it and it just kept not opening and so
sometimes<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.590> need<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.010> adjust<00:00:35.100> them<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
sometimes then you need to adjust them a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
sometimes then you need to adjust them a
little<00:00:35.579> bit<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.329> very<00:00:36.480> easy<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.720> do<00:00:36.870> they

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit and it's very easy to do they

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
little bit and it's very easy to do they
come<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.440> little<00:00:37.829> Torx<00:00:38.160> screw<00:00:38.460> here

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
come with these little Torx screw here

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.400 
come with these little Torx screw here
and<00:00:39.269> you<00:00:39.359> just<00:00:39.480> get<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> Torx<00:00:39.899> bit<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> put<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
and you just get a Torx bit you put it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.720 
and you just get a Torx bit you put it
in<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.679> and<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.010> listen<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.429> little<00:00:41.609> bit

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
in there and you listen up a little bit

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
in there and you listen up a little bit
so<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.719> went<00:00:42.899> out<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.109> Lowe's<00:00:43.289> and<00:00:43.679> I<00:00:44.339> bought

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
so I went out to Lowe's and I bought

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
so I went out to Lowe's and I bought
some<00:00:44.609> Torx<00:00:44.910> bits<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> smallest<00:00:45.929> that<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
some Torx bits and the smallest that I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
some Torx bits and the smallest that I
got<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> kit<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.309> found<00:00:47.519> at<00:00:47.609> Lowe's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

need<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> smaller<00:01:18.390> Torx<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
need a a smaller Torx bit so what do you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.410 
need a a smaller Torx bit so what do you
do<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> find<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> smaller<00:01:21.149> set

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
do you got to find a smaller set

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.920 
do you got to find a smaller set

pull this bit out and there's a couple

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.740 
pull this bit out and there's a couple
ways<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.219> can<00:01:44.369> use<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> knives

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
ways you can use this a lot of knives

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
ways you can use this a lot of knives
like<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.439> triage<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.189> saw<00:01:47.340> were<00:01:47.490> pretty

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
like that triage as you saw were pretty

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.490 
like that triage as you saw were pretty
simple<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> use<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.539> can<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.810> put<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
simple to use I can just put it in and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.590 
simple to use I can just put it in and
just<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.520> fingers<00:01:50.969> I<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> twist<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
just with my fingers I can twist it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.670 
just with my fingers I can twist it
however<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:51.990> osborne

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
however this osborne

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.590 
however this osborne
is<00:01:52.799> tight<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.789> i<00:01:53.850> can't<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.359> that<00:01:54.420> with

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
is tight and i can't really do that with

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.109 
is tight and i can't really do that with
my<00:01:54.719> fingers<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:56.100> next<00:01:56.280> step<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:56.939> comes

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
my fingers so the next step is it comes

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.779 
my fingers so the next step is it comes
with<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.329> little<00:01:57.600> extension<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:59.579> can

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
with this little extension and you can

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.340 
with this little extension and you can
put<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> bit<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.810> locks<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.259> there

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
put the bit in there locks in there

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.410 
put the bit in there locks in there
magnetically<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.210> give<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
magnetically and if that will give you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
magnetically and if that will give you
enough<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.380> try<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
enough you can get in there and try and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.570 
enough you can get in there and try and
twist<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.490> again<00:02:05.640> still<00:02:06.270> pretty<00:02:06.840> stiff<00:02:07.580> so

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
twist it again still pretty stiff so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.940 
twist it again still pretty stiff so
next<00:02:09.210> step<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:10.320> little<00:02:10.590> case<00:02:10.800> actually

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
next step this little case actually

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.340 
next step this little case actually
doubles<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> handle<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.780> put<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.110> into

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
doubles as a handle you put this into

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640 
doubles as a handle you put this into
here<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.060> locks<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:15.450> there<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.470> can

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
here and it locks in there and you can

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.770 
here and it locks in there and you can
then<00:02:16.950> put<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.730> there

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
then put that in there

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.930 
then put that in there
and<00:02:19.040> there<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.490> can<00:02:20.520> loosen<00:02:20.850> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
and there you go now you can loosen it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.880 
and there you go now you can loosen it
gives<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> bit<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.630> leverage<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.170> nice

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
gives you a bit of leverage so nice

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.670 
gives you a bit of leverage so nice
simple<00:02:23.250> little<00:02:23.610> design<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:25.290> thing<00:02:25.500> comes

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
simple little design this thing comes

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.809 
simple little design this thing comes
back<00:02:25.770> out<00:02:28.010> bits<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.310> said<00:02:29.520> are<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.700> there

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
back out bits like you said are in there

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.260 
back out bits like you said are in there
magnetically<00:02:30.450> they<00:02:30.810> store<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.260> here<00:02:32.270> this

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
magnetically they store in here this

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.699 
magnetically they store in here this
fits<00:02:33.600> right<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.959> here<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.410> then<00:02:34.500> there's<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
fits right in here and then there's a

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.900 
fits right in here and then there's a
little<00:02:34.800> plastic<00:02:35.010> piece<00:02:35.220> out<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
little plastic piece out here so that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.030 
little plastic piece out here so that
when<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.120> close<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:37.080> doesn't<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.920> won't

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
when you close it it doesn't it won't

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.770 
when you close it it doesn't it won't
fall<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> back<00:02:39.450> there's<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.750> little

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780
