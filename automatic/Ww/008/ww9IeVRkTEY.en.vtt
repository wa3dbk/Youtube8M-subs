00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.740
 happy to the set was because of the allowed 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.539
 playing here and just proteco success 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 I think I'm under water right now 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.170
 on the way and also writes behind us 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.060
 that's why I'm going wild 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.880
 assuming that they attack a hai 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.040
 and he finds the very realistic cool 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.360
 and I'll try with them 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.590
 speak but it is definitely 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.149
 heavy but loud just prayer niche 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:49.100
 upset I was think I was asking 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.510
 As it is always short question why 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 So I was just in case for mine 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.949
 I eat such a cage and it is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.989
 already very impressed when it riesen 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.149
 Pfizer's mouth tears open and you get the feeling 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.510
 I devoured 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.070
 it is of course even blurred than 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.170
 so if you are to tv then you have to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.510
 you first spoil yourself a little bit 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.119
 but it is really very fine and really 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 should not you have seen it that way 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.659
 she can also describe very difficult 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.640
 So that's really all around you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.020
 that's why i also shot and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.060
 Unfortunately, with little all connects 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.320
 the pc is popped round though 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.009
 usually you can be there already 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.780
 turn in all directions and then has 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.189
 Just give this all around 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.079
 usually not as natural 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.819
 you have already light incidence down 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.560
 that's the difference too ok going on 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.420
 So there you do not have that as more 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.710
 really totally isolated but me 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 here has a bit of light 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.929
 is not dramatic now but it is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.600
 Of course, a small disadvantage 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.259
 I think the ps4 broke 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.000
 can not be now 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.829
 i wanted to get into the broken sorry before the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.299
 old gentleman was all clears think 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.530
 I'd rather take a look and have a look 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.530
 which is different
