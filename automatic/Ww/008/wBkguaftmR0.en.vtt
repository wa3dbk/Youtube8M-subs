00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
okay we're going to do a demonstration

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.859 
okay we're going to do a demonstration
of<00:00:10.980> installing<00:00:11.850> and<00:00:12.299> removing<00:00:12.510> spiral<00:00:13.290> locks

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
of installing and removing spiral locks

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.320 
of installing and removing spiral locks
first<00:00:15.869> thing<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.350> need<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.650> do<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.789> open

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
first thing you need to do is to open

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.620 
first thing you need to do is to open
the<00:00:19.340> spiral<00:00:20.340> lock<00:00:20.520> kind<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> little

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the spiral lock kind of like a little

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.169 
the spiral lock kind of like a little
spring<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:23.660> helps<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:25.699> putting<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> spiral

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
spring this helps in putting the spiral

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.540 
spring this helps in putting the spiral
lock<00:00:27.329> in<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.109> also<00:00:28.740> helps<00:00:29.130> them<00:00:29.249> when<00:00:29.369> they're

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
lock in and also helps them when they're

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
lock in and also helps them when they're
in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.759> groove<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.869> take<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.320> any<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
in the groove to take up any of the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.740 
in the groove to take up any of the
extra<00:00:32.189> clearance<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> groove<00:00:33.420> tool<00:00:34.190> I

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
extra clearance from the groove tool I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.950 
extra clearance from the groove tool I
always<00:00:36.750> start<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.280> tab<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> rod

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
always start with the tab on the rod

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.400 
always start with the tab on the rod
side<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> piston<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.550> help<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
side of the piston this will help you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
side of the piston this will help you
get<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> spiral<00:00:43.890> logs<00:00:44.039> out<00:00:44.250> later<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
get the spiral logs out later if you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.869 
get the spiral logs out later if you
ever<00:00:45.359> need<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:46.949> start<00:00:47.399> by<00:00:47.579> putting

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
ever need to you just start by putting

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
ever need to you just start by putting
the<00:00:48.390> bottom<00:00:48.750> part<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> groove<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.399> then

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the bottom part in the groove and then

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
the bottom part in the groove and then
you<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> walk<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.870> around<00:00:52.019> with

sure one you have the correct number

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
sure one you have the correct number
some<00:01:08.400> Pistons<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.840> Pistons<00:01:10.200> take

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
some Pistons take one some Pistons take

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.789 
some Pistons take one some Pistons take
two<00:01:10.759> consult<00:01:11.759> your<00:01:11.939> piston<00:01:12.570> manufacturer<00:01:13.380> for

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
two consult your piston manufacturer for

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.429 
two consult your piston manufacturer for
that<00:01:13.979> information<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:15.930> make<00:01:16.259> sure<00:01:16.290> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that information you just make sure that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.630 
that information you just make sure that
it's<00:01:16.770> seated<00:01:16.979> all<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.369> around<00:01:19.640> that's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it's seated all the way around that's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.870 
it's seated all the way around that's
good<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.509> simple<00:01:21.689> how<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.649> we<00:01:22.829> remove<00:01:23.280> spiral

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
good and simple how do we remove spiral

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
good and simple how do we remove spiral
locks<00:01:24.030> moving<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:24.960> simple<00:01:25.409> take<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> little

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
locks moving them simple take a little

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.550 
locks moving them simple take a little
small<00:01:26.280> screwdriver<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.229> usually<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
small screwdriver I usually have it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.880 
small screwdriver I usually have it
filed<00:01:28.860> down<00:01:29.840> one<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> mistakes<00:01:31.350> everyone

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
filed down one of the mistakes everyone

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.889 
filed down one of the mistakes everyone
seems<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.450> there<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
seems to make is they go in there and

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.160 
seems to make is they go in there and
they<00:01:34.020> try<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:35.060> pry<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.869> try<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
they try to just pry it out you try to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.270 
they try to just pry it out you try to
pry<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.430> keeps<00:01:38.780> popping<00:01:39.780> back<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
pry it out it keeps popping back in the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.910 
pry it out it keeps popping back in the
trick<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.820> keep<00:01:42.090> pushing<00:01:42.630> down<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.649> get

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
trick is to keep pushing down so we get

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.389 
trick is to keep pushing down so we get
in<00:01:44.070> behind<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.259> keep<00:01:46.710> pushing<00:01:46.979> down

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
in behind it and just keep pushing down

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.209 
in behind it and just keep pushing down
and<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.930> pops<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:50.039> like

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
and that pops it up right right like

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.450 
and that pops it up right right like
that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.289 
that
at<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.659> point<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.380> could<00:01:52.560> either<00:01:53.119> pop<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
at that point you could either pop it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.450 
at that point you could either pop it
around<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> screwdriver<00:01:55.430> grab<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
around with the screwdriver grab a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.290 
around with the screwdriver grab a
little<00:01:56.640> pair<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.939> pliers<00:01:57.320> do<00:01:58.320> whatever

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.920 

but<00:02:02.930> always<00:02:03.440> push<00:02:03.980> down<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.820> go<00:02:05.510> towards<00:02:05.870> the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
but always push down and go towards the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.640 
but always push down and go towards the
middle<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.980> will<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.350> just<00:02:09.380> like

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:09.650 
middle and that will do it just like

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.680 
middle and that will do it just like
that
