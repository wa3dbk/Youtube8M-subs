00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello friends and heart welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.130
 adjustment this time the Scania pieces of 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.309
 and in scale 1 to 4 available 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.200
 was asked 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 the chances are quite good so have something 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.699
 Prepared friends work in alcohol 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 one and the other, namely the poor 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.529
 Cooler for the always after 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 Well, I would have said well now 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.849
 caution carefully presented 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.070
 I would have wanted to be a bit overzealous 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.660
 friends of modest texture and must 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.969
 say the texture is awesome the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.130
 mature say awesome look like that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.559
 bolliger Bissel evil but that will be fine 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.809
 fit texture moderately out a dream 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.340
 lights are all what you look at 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.500
 can imagine and blinkers 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.710
 work that fits everything very well 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.710
 in the cockpit view, however, no 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.420
 relatively little effort so a bit 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 so bad out there but good of us 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.430
 need at the test with fully loaded 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:09.470
 look trailer then try it yet 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.470
 just around the middle with the deliverer 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.740
 optical or bad song so can 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.250
 you already imagine with him one 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 design or other transports as well 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.909
 friend delay tractors so I have to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.530
 Let's be honest, we will do that now 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.140
 a fully loaded friends we would be 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.270
 just times 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.600
 this forums with and happens about it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.880
 looks really good working 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.409
 perfect 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.960
 and then you can lay off again 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.880
 this standard so far everything is fine 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.369
 this would come as well as from only at 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.700
 further and let the whole again 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.130
 That's the stress of frustration 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.080
 is at the top speed of the horsten 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.820
 seventies demands there was clear and 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.970
 have been so nice feather and green desk was 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.580
 I had good with relatively poor 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.130
 so maybe quite good to be me 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.300
 Although so much suspension is deeper 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.869
 to have defined Scania starks now 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.019
 try to bring the manure very quickly 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.540
 interested in what the soya gives 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.920
 visually it just looks awesome 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.580
 but there is really nothing to it 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 find fault 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.920
 we'll try it again for now 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.720
 pull and see if and home that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.120
 first problem is a bit too 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.910
 hard for the spanish ivan base lies 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.400
 the truth lies or whether it is on am 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.100
 zubringer server is located or just on the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.280
 tractor with dsa bad 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.120
 combination unfortunately more is very 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.040
 you want the good work 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.750
 but the perpetrator seems so hard to 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.450
 its what I'm going up now 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.790
 she is really crazy but good for 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.410
 discounters can not do anything with calls 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.500
 Not so bad though 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.040
 cockpit proved to be plain 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.840
 has been 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.730
 look in the log file and 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.290
 show that you do not say anything and that is 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.030
 pretty good friends and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.190
 covered this time short and concise 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.850
 Ideas do not look so bad 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.860
 good 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.000
 especially at the court until the next 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.000
 presentation and bye
