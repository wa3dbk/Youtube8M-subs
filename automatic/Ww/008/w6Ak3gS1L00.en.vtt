 Kiepenkerl out of joy at gardening 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.330
 Welcome with the patented system 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.620
 From Miami, everyone at home can easily 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.599
 grow mushrooms 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.389
 to grow mushrooms yourself 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.010
 exciting and educational at the same time 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.109
 both for children and for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.760
 Adults breed themselves within 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 three weeks the tastiest 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.439
 mushrooms and learn something 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.920
 mushrooms are and how they grow 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.840
 day 1 take the bag with the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.720
 Cover it from the packaging 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.210
 A fungus is actually the visible one 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.460
 fruit of a mold and underground 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.860
 the eye grows invisible to the eye 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.559
 mold also called helium 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 this is a dense network of fine 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.980
 threads 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.660
 open the bag with the earth 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.780
 Put the earth in a bucket 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.080
 or a bowl and add 250 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.670
 milliliters of clean water to only one 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.460
 shake so that the blanket 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 earth is not too fine then the bucket 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.240
 or bowl with the ceiling earth well 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.270
 cover with it the added 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.530
 moisture in 24 hours well in the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.530
 blanket that can move in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.350
 where compost can grow 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.180
 still no champignons form 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.370
 to the compost with a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.370
 so-called deck earth to be covered 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.770
 the pluck and the damp deck earth 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.530
 loose and in a uniform position 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.420
 install the compost after that at the time 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 again completely with the reverse 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.440
 close the lid 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.010
 The museum is now growing in the ceiling 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.010
 continue 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.090
 day 5 open the time and spray 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.519
 with a plant syringe 150 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.119
 milliliters of clean water evenly 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.119
 over the blanket 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.630
 with the inverted lid on the farm 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.750
 z , a small room is created 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.670
 completely finished is because co2 and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.040
 Humidity come from the compost 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.670
 and cover up and get caught in 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.160
 this room 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.350
 in this way, a very high arises 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.690
 co2 content and a very high 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.240
 Humidity what the ideal 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.430
 circumstances are fast for the museum 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.550
 and balance the ceiling earth 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 streaky 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.960
 day 7 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.360
 now the next phase has started 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.590
 150 milliliters of clean water 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.200
 evenly spray over the ceiling earth 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.690
 Turn the lid over and top in 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.340
 Press the packaging box 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.230
 Packaging carton is now on the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.080
 edge of the white under part 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.650
 through the hole in the top of the packaging box 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.540
 once 125 milliliters of water in the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.540
 pour in the lid 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.780
 Now the next phase has begun the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.879
 Packaging box on the edge of the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.650
 white under part provides for one 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.420
 enclosed breeding room with a 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.720
 calculated number of small holes 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.790
 for exactly the right co2 content and 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.739
 as much humidity as possible 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.690
 to keep 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.489
 The lid is up in the packaging box 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.290
 attached and serves as one 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.319
 water reservoir for an extra 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.060
 humidity 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.160
 The special design of the lid ensures 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.709
 for that the increased humidity 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.470
 Also in the lower breeding room for the 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.090
 mushrooms come so the museum becomes that 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.459
 in the ceiling earth is to 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.440
 brought the moisture to train the first 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.440
 as small buds are visible 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.109
 the little bud growing about 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.799
 five days to mature champignons 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.389
 zoom 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.730
 the mushrooms do not grow 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:11.060
 continue to appear but appear in 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.989
 Weekly waves A wave is one 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.989
 harvest period 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.320
 pick the mushrooms by them 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.840
 Carefully break up or 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.090
 you can turn out in the same way 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.820
 after the first more waves reach 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.010
 until the compost is leached out and that 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.010
 growth of mushrooms gradually stops 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.350
 all ingredients for a successful cultivation 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.720
 are ready in may shampoo 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.510
 system so that they are additional 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.460
 nothing needs additional fertilizer 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.440
 or pesticides are not 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.260
 required 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.500
 pure nature healthier and fresher it works 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.500
 Not 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.379
