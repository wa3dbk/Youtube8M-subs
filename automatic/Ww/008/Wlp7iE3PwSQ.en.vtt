00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
to make with 12 flashes all right so

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
to make with 12 flashes all right so
here's<00:01:48.299> first<00:01:48.600> flash<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> pretty<00:01:49.979> big

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
here's first flash this is a pretty big

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.399 
here's first flash this is a pretty big
stand<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> snoot<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> we're<00:01:52.320> gonna

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
stand with a snoot on it and we're gonna

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.730 
stand with a snoot on it and we're gonna
have<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.280> shooting<00:01:53.490> right<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
have it kind of shooting right at the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.539 
have it kind of shooting right at the
basis<00:01:55.740> face

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
basis face

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.450 
basis face
and<00:01:56.670> we'll<00:01:57.030> see<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.329> does<00:01:58.399> okay<00:01:59.399> so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and we'll see what that does okay so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.539 
and we'll see what that does okay so
then<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.030> got<00:02:00.290> one<00:02:01.290> more<00:02:01.439> stand<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
then we got one more stand here this is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.740 
then we got one more stand here this is
the<00:02:02.670> second<00:02:03.030> flash<00:02:03.210> we're<00:02:03.450> gonna<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the second flash we're gonna have it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.300 
the second flash we're gonna have it
about<00:02:03.960> half<00:02:04.890> power

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
about half power

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.429 
about half power
another<00:02:05.939> snoot<00:02:06.329> aiming<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.110> side<00:02:07.320> of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
another snoot aiming kind of the side of

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.330 
another snoot aiming kind of the side of
the<00:02:07.500> base<00:02:07.680> we'll<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.610> what<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.759> does<00:02:09.319> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
the base we'll see what that does and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.920 
the base we'll see what that does and
this<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.520> third<00:02:11.760> flash<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.300> gonna<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.599> it's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
this is third flash I'm gonna have it's

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
this is third flash I'm gonna have it's
pretty<00:02:13.140> far<00:02:13.349> back<00:02:13.470> from

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
pretty far back from

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
pretty far back from
the<00:02:14.130> basis<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:14.849> gonna<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.300> shooting

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the basis we're gonna have it shooting

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.720 
the basis we're gonna have it shooting
at<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> ground<00:02:16.020> probably<00:02:16.650> I'll<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.520> shoot<00:02:17.640> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
at the ground probably I'll just shoot a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.710 
at the ground probably I'll just shoot a
couple<00:02:17.970> times<00:02:18.180> see<00:02:18.450> where<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.660> hitting

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
couple times see where it's hitting

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.589 
couple times see where it's hitting
that's<00:02:19.349> probably<00:02:19.709> pretty<00:02:19.830> good<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:21.360> should

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
that's probably pretty good that should

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.490 
that's probably pretty good that should
be<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:22.080> fine<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:24.569> flash<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.080> pretty<00:02:25.349> far

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
be just fine this flash is pretty far

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.670 
be just fine this flash is pretty far
back<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:25.890> about<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.069> hundred<00:02:26.489> feet<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:28.349> it's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
back it's about a hundred feet and it's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.170 
back it's about a hundred feet and it's
just<00:02:28.830> gonna<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.099> hitting<00:02:29.310> kind<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.970> far

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
just gonna be hitting kind of really far

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.760 
just gonna be hitting kind of really far
back<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.569> grass<00:02:30.780> they're<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.560> gonna<00:02:31.650> be

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
back in the grass they're not gonna be

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.370 
back in the grass they're not gonna be
doing<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.980> whole<00:02:32.100> lot<00:02:32.160> we've<00:02:32.640> about<00:02:32.760> half<00:02:32.970> power

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
doing a whole lot we've about half power

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.410 
doing a whole lot we've about half power
should<00:02:34.380> look<00:02:34.560> pretty<00:02:34.590> cool<00:02:35.010> though<00:02:35.420> okay

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
should look pretty cool though okay

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.510 
should look pretty cool though okay

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
have just kind of shooting on the grass

here this is crazy one of the this one's
gonna<00:02:53.430> be<00:02:53.519> illuminating<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> tree<00:02:54.299> right<00:02:54.540> up

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690

another one right here is gonna be
shooting<00:02:57.930> light<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.290> between<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> trees<00:02:58.950> and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
shooting light in between the trees and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.850 
shooting light in between the trees and
then<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.150> one<00:03:00.330> more<00:03:00.480> over<00:03:00.690> here<00:03:00.860> same

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860

then we have one more over here same
thing<00:03:02.569> it's<00:03:03.569> gonna<00:03:03.810> be<00:03:04.459> illuminating<00:03:05.459> this

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
thing it's gonna be illuminating this

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.600 
thing it's gonna be illuminating this
tree<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:07.709> gonna<00:03:07.860> hopefully<00:03:08.220> give<00:03:08.489> it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
tree and it's gonna hopefully give it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.430 
tree and it's gonna hopefully give it
just<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.850> backlit<00:03:09.239> kind<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.510> skeleton<00:03:09.750> look<00:03:10.170> and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440

here's number nine this is going to be
another<00:03:15.120> side<00:03:15.450> lighting<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.560> bassist

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
another side lighting on the bassist

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.009

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859

and here's number we're at I think 10

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.720 
and here's number we're at I think 10
maybe<00:03:28.410> nine<00:03:28.680> I'm<00:03:28.950> not<00:03:29.070> sure<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.280> lost<00:03:29.519> count

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
maybe nine I'm not sure I lost count

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.300 
maybe nine I'm not sure I lost count
we're<00:03:30.480> at<00:03:30.540> 10<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.989> here's<00:03:31.829> another<00:03:31.980> half

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
we're at 10 and here's another half

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.009 
we're at 10 and here's another half
power<00:03:32.549> on<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.000> snoot<00:03:33.390> gonna<00:03:33.600> be<00:03:33.720> hitting<00:03:33.930> the

side<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.440> base<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.790> should<00:03:35.970> look

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
side of the base and it should look

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.870 
side of the base and it should look
pretty<00:03:36.120> good<00:03:36.500> one<00:03:37.500> more<00:03:37.650> flash<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.579> 11
