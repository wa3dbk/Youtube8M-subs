00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
also going to need a bowl I'm using my

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.940 
also going to need a bowl I'm using my
Styrofoam<00:00:29.460> ball<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:32.960> heat<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.110> before<00:00:34.410> my

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
Styrofoam ball I heat up before my

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.610 
Styrofoam ball I heat up before my
little<00:00:35.309> bit<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.210> easier<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
little bit so it's easier to get the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
little bit so it's easier to get the
shape<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.309> gotta<00:00:41.520> cover<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.059> ball<00:00:42.270> just

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
shape and we gotta cover the ball just

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
shape and we gotta cover the ball just
like<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.760> dolls<00:00:44.760> heads<00:00:46.309> both

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
like we do for the dolls heads both

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.389
