00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.890
 hello everyone and now i will show how 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.259
 take off 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.230
 ventilation of crankcase gases on audi a6 c5 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.490
 here we are crankcase ventilation here it is 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.250
 sucks crankcase gases 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.880
 this valve cover from this one over here 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 look and these all attempts are reported 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.689
 in tee and then stands here 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.320
 infectious pump and all these gases 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 I suck at doing to his brother to taste 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.239
 so first thing you need to disconnect here 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.649
 here here from fittings then take off 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 these are all magnetic valves and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.760
 connect all clamps from here 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.149
 now do so first disconnect 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.070
 ventilation system as a gas container is great 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:59.789
 dofiga valve cover for that just 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:04.320
 squeeze on the fitting in a hamoudi 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.400
 plastic and Stalin do the same 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.790
 it is this valve cover further i 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.140
 connected without connector from this site 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.740
 The site was unscrewed by opening three blocks and and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 simply 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.860
 obginaem turned aside now 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.950
 screw the clamps on and Jason 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.990
 whether the pump will try to shoot our 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 system and so we disconnected 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.290
 from the collector pump all clamps and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.619
 it can now be removed as such 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:51.890
 wiggling we poured tons of pump 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.890
 then now we are left filmed to 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:59.340
 intake manifold clutch which 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 goes to the inlet here you see and you can 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 will completely remove the system when you 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.710
 and so there drew a small 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.530
 problemka the fact is that this 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.340
 the crime that you see there after 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.569
 tee it goes right under the inlet 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.810
 customer collector throttle valve 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:24.540
 rather, and therefore to disconnect there 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.379
 system gkg we need to remove not the flap 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.510
 Well, at least the inlet or 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.670
 can you try here on gingerbread 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.640
 development but I failed because 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.140
 remove the inlet this pipe for this 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.569
 removed here the main such here 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:49.879
 harmonica now we get one here 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.879
 bolt and remove so we barely twisted 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:02.000
 how can i take out solve this bolt 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.360
 Here we took this patrol a bite at the fact that 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.360
 we will order 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.690
 Now we will be there if you look closely 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.690
 we will continue to remove the ventilation system 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:31.870
 crankcase gases in general help all 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.060
 tormenting a little to 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.670
 last crankcase ventilation pipe 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.459
 gases without removing the throttle valve 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.100
 simply unrealistic therefore we will shoot 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.150
 throw him so he does not choke this 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.470
 unscrew this pipe which is 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.350
 taste is served from below here one more and 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.370
 unscrew 4 screws when I was a little in 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.590
 minute to disconnect the cable 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.900
 accelerator go so little 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.470
 having suffered we got the throttle 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:11.500
 the flap that's how scary she is to me 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:15.190
 move on later and now here it is not 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.620
 managed to connect this pipe 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.479
 crankcase ventilation another one 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.669
 which is where it was very difficult 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:28.479
 for crawl and now we will pull out 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:34.530
 the whole circle so we took all the ventilation 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.530
 crankcase gases are not able to look 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:43.219
 Here, see how it was clogged with me 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.139
 Little 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.860
 This despite the fact that a year ago 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.860
 she was cleaned 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.790
 but
