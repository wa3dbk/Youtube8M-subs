ok<00:00:40.010> what<00:00:41.010> we're<00:00:41.160> doing<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.820> off

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
ok what we're doing is we're going off

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
ok what we're doing is we're going off
we're<00:00:42.510> strumming<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> power<00:00:43.110> core<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
we're strumming the power core of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.070 
we're strumming the power core of
plucking<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.040> power<00:00:44.250> chord<00:00:44.490> so<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:44.790> going

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
plucking the power chord so we're going

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.270

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
do the same thing and then down to the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.320 
do the same thing and then down to the
seventh<00:00:59.070> fret<00:00:59.310> here<00:00:59.970> it's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.150> little

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330

so<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.670> end<00:01:17.789> result<00:01:18.090> should<00:01:18.149> sound<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.570> this

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.950 

now<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.920> root<00:01:35.730> chord<00:01:36.000> part<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> chorus

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
is basically C D and E minor so it's an

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:53.380
