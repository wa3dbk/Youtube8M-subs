00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.450
 and I want to tell you one thing is that 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.730
 I have not been uploading videos for a week now 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.910
 it's because it's flawed 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.980
 a game throughout this week is worth 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.840
 most likely linked videos 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.500
 playing it the story may the 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 play again and so I'm recording and 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.500
 I 'm also sure that I'll play online and if 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 there would be worth it but now we are going here to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.350
 through who the fuck is clear, and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.550
 let's see let's make an attack on 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.970
 I have been told that it is quite 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.410
 well really that's two freckles five 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.440
 dragons 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.020
 everything besides magician and the archers of this 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.329
 was to take up space and it 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.300
 successes that I think some have done are 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.790
 around here they are 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.890
 all one of thunder and rage is worth it 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.739
 I'm going to wait for it to be done and 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.449
 you're back so guys is worth it 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.340
 we are here again I have done the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.670
 photos to see after having waited and 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.940
 today or good we are going to see the attack 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.900
 crazy how is this going? 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.080
 it will be a little surrendered 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.730
 let's find someone 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.030
 this not 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.360
 there is very little resources of terms 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.670
 similar would be fine 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.080
 a little bit, do not have a break, I do not have 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.180
 nothing so I have to have a lot 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.660
 care that I do not have a wall break 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.660
 yes 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.730
 and we do not have as strong as that one 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.220
 had not something like this be more or 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.500
 except this one is more or less well is not 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.690
 nothing bad around here have a defense 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.400
 aerial and below have another one we could 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.390
 attack below to destroy this 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.770
 aerial pantry 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 when you look at the Christmas trees 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.850
 I do not know I think we would attack from here towards 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.470
 above 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.220
 let's see how we do this as if 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.040
 they have something in here they have nothing 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.469
 so 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.469
 a little here and another one out there 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.159
 a machine so that back 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.770
 so that sins do a little bit to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.130
 go putting more magicians here and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.130
 I could scream what I have 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.980
 like japan this over here 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.400
 the one that did not destroy it but good more or 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.360
 less 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.360
 and I would like to start 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.819
 and another one over here 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.739
 in this aspect 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.540
 let's put the king and an archer by 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.099
 here if something to distract 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.099
 I think it's going to rage 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.320
 the two stars was empty and the hundred 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.320
 Per hundred I do not know if I will give you 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.090
 Dragons is dead 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.249
 mondragÃ³n and eros now let's let 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.540
 go running and devastating those two 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:27.159
 dragons 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.159
 but I do not think that life 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.680
 there goes to a house dragons drag 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.019
 come on, quickie 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:43.040
 I already have a pretty damaged dragon like 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.040
 you see the other is killing us 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.270
 at least we have come because it has 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.700
 finished before better 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.760
 so we see two stars we have 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.560
 got done so it would be won to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.480
 sometimes we leave more crazy attacks for 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.650
 here 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.900
 and good in a few days 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.230
 I'm going to tell you something else about the plan and 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.239
 that you will see then is the favorite 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.239
 and until the next video goodbye
