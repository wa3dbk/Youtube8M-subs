00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
easy to kind of travel with as well I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.140 
easy to kind of travel with as well I
suppose<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
suppose but I really think that this is

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
my skin it's not massively potent but if

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.890 
my skin it's not massively potent but if
you've<00:03:23.549> got<00:03:23.730> quite<00:03:23.970> sensitive<00:03:24.419> skin<00:03:24.750> there's

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
because it is very very gentle and then

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.129
