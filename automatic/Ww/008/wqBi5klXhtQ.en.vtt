00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.559
 very good guys we give but in 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.720
 minecraft cuadreros la snapshot 15w 31-c 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.820
 of minecraft 1.9 is the third 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.860
 subject coming out this week 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.599
 third nothing only to 1.9 although at 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.970
 be in the same week then basically 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.039
 what are corrected are bugs worth when 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.840
 see a version of a snapshot 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.169
 basically it is the same only 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.420
 that things are corrected then in this 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.160
 case is here today painted look 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.840
 what piece of dragon he gave me for the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.110
 battle of the future good work 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.510
 the dragon is not teaching the thing of 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.600
 guys as you know you have added a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.850
 bunch of things to minecraft 1.9 between 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.430
 others may have escaped 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.219
 some then apart from announcing that 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 has come out in the 15w 31-c version and 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:05.289
 consequential books that have been added 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.820
 the ton arrow and go where to go to the beach 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.710
 Well, basically, it 's a black dam 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.330
 is one of the colorful arrows that in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.979
 this case, as you are seeing are 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.020
 all black in this version I do not know by 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.970
 what all of them will have looked for and in this 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.900
 case as you will see if he shot it with 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.700
 a bow then 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.440
 neither has any effect or anything simply 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.680
 see how a normal person has also been 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.750
 cause the effect but sf to be normal 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.720
 then one thing that I forgot 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.110
 show you from the previous version worth of 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.180
 minecraft 15w 31 ab and in this case what 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.100
 does and is that glass panels and 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.040
 the bars so in this case when 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.890
 when we put ourselves they look like this 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.230
 As you are seeing, they do not look like a 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.660
 full face as you could see before 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.250
 that it looked like a lie I'm going to put everything 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.910
 it looked before like what you can see 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.200
 now in the block it is as it is now 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.869
 have solved schools so that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.960
 minecraft go faster vale let's say 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.310
 which is a way to save memory 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.380
 The bars are seen as sticks 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.020
 the glass was also seen before 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.040
 As I'm going to show you now, it looked like 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.680
 this way the glass panel when 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.540
 we did not have anything around and now 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.610
 as you are seeing it is also seen as a 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.740
 stick this is basically going to change 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.480
 many things also in minecraft in 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.459
 this case, together with those that have already 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.200
 taught of the two entrants after 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.480
 addition also 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.920
 go putting more changes and in this case 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.840
 Well, it does not bother me because it's 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 pretty cool this about having a stick like that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.830
 this way it's cool I do not know if it's cool 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.769
 then if we put him for example 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.440
 let's say we have a carpet is worth and 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.239
 we put a carpet here because then 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.790
 we have a table is a table 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.400
 iron a glass table effÃ©n also 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.920
 here as you see or even using 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.799
 the castle that we have here 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.260
 as you see good goes more basically is what 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.299
 same only that good in this way 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.099
 the enter as you see can not be joined nor 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.530
 nothing is simply a stick is a fence 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.230
 but you can also do this 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.150
 to make a table decoration but 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.099
 Well, with this, it's not all that I 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.470
 I wanted to teach the thing is how you see 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.299
 this has a 2 x 2 profile here 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.220
 we have a profile on the normal fence 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.260
 4 x 4 therefore as of now 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.209
 will come parkhurst even more difficult 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.489
 Here is an example of what happens 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.230
 when we started to extend both the 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.720
 crystal like the iron apart and it 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.440
 I forgot to say that one with the other 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.710
 put together and extend well if that and 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.100
 Well, they work like this in this way 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.270
 and with this I've taught everything I 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.730
 missing one thing missing one thing is 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.380
 true is something that you have been 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.020
 commenting on comments 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.400
 commenting on the same thing is how 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.290
 I'm seeing that we have to the point of 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.210
 It's worth before when we break 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.300
 they did not give anything however if we break 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.910
 now to put game or event in game or 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.010
 from zero you will see that they do not release to 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.690
 sometimes it's worth zero sometimes one already 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.430
 twice in this case, he has released 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.830
 only two sticks but basically 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.960
 can release from zero to two suits each 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 Once we break some dead bush 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.440
 therefore it is a way also of 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.630
 get no wood but if you stick to 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.880
 to be able to build wooden things so 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.020
 guys now if this has been the snapshot 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.520
 I also let you download the 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.820
 description I hope you've been a 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.970
 see you in the next video and 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.970

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.310
