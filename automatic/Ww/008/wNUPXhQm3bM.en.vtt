 very difficult because although it seems that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.210
 is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 nothing because they know and dance and sing and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.670
 such is a lot you have to do all the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.640

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.630
 part between each smile when you look 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.750
 to a person and suddenly that person 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.600
