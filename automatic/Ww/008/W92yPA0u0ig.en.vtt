let's fast-forward here a couple of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.520 
let's fast-forward here a couple of
seconds<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> where<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.240> beat<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.049> with

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
seconds to where I beat them all with

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you light a zombie on fire there's our

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
you light a zombie on fire there's our
first<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.210> completely<00:01:57.600> lose<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.840> here

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
first one and I completely lose it here

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
first one and I completely lose it here
is<00:01:58.680> what<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.399> happen<00:01:59.549> is

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
is what you don't want to have happen is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.359 
is what you don't want to have happen is
that<00:02:00.530> now<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> about<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> fifty<00:02:02.159> percent

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
that now you have about a fifty percent

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980 
that now you have about a fifty percent
chance<00:02:02.549> every<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.240> dropping<00:02:03.659> your<00:02:03.750> flare

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
chance every time of dropping your flare

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.300 
chance every time of dropping your flare
hit<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.500> them<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:04.860> they<00:02:05.159> could

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
hit it with them because they could

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.639 
hit it with them because they could
swing<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.790> or<00:02:06.119> whatever<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
swing at you or whatever and that that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.619 
swing at you or whatever and that that
happens<00:02:08.129> pretty<00:02:08.280> frequently<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> got<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
happens pretty frequently so you got to

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.969 
happens pretty frequently so you got to
be<00:02:09.690> very<00:02:09.720> cautious<00:02:10.080> where<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> drop<00:02:10.800> your

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
is where you can get a good number of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.920 
is where you can get a good number of
zombie<00:02:21.569> flares<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:24.060> only<00:02:24.209> get<00:02:24.390> one<00:02:24.420> flare

three<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.530> believe<00:05:24.010> in<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.220> harder

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
three I believe in the harder

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.250 
three I believe in the harder
difficulties<00:05:24.790> there's<00:05:25.180> three<00:05:25.570> zombies<00:05:25.840> in

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
difficulties there's three zombies in

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.160 
difficulties there's three zombies in
this<00:05:26.350> area<00:05:27.030> but<00:05:28.030> just<00:05:28.300> for<00:05:28.450> sake<00:05:28.720> of<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:28.990> where

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
this area but just for sake of it where

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.130 
this area but just for sake of it where
does<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.290> go<00:05:29.470> to<00:05:29.790> now<00:05:30.790> once<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.450> flick<00:05:31.960> that

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
does it go to now once you flick that

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.010 
does it go to now once you flick that
switch<00:05:32.590> yeah<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.910> start<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.330> next<00:05:34.570> group<00:05:34.870> of

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
switch yeah you start the next group of

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.530 
switch yeah you start the next group of
zombies<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:35.680> it's<00:05:35.830> also<00:05:35.980> safe<00:05:36.310> point<00:05:36.550> now

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
zombies and it's also safe point now

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.570 
zombies and it's also safe point now
this<00:05:37.660> is<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.810> halfway<00:05:38.020> point<00:05:38.200> so<00:05:38.710> this<00:05:39.550> is

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
this is the halfway point so this is

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.190 
this is the halfway point so this is
decent<00:05:40.030> place<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.180> start<00:05:40.450> off<00:05:40.630> with<00:05:40.840> but<00:05:41.110> the

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
decent place to start off with but the

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.690 
decent place to start off with but the
nice<00:05:41.350> thing<00:05:41.380> about<00:05:41.590> having<00:05:41.830> that<00:05:42.100> save<00:05:42.400> point

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
nice thing about having that save point

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.450 
nice thing about having that save point
is<00:05:42.850> case<00:05:43.600> you<00:05:43.720> fuck<00:05:43.930> up<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:45.070> can<00:05:45.220> be<00:05:45.280> very

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
is case you fuck up you can be very

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.130 
is case you fuck up you can be very
easily<00:05:45.580> start<00:05:45.910> off<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.270> now<00:05:46.330> here's<00:05:46.600> this<00:05:46.990> is

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
easily start off and now here's this is

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.500 
easily start off and now here's this is
