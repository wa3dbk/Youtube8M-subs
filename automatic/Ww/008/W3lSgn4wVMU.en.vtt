three games just with this I would kill

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.330 
three games just with this I would kill
one<00:00:55.140> person<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> AC<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.980> kill<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.309> or

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
one person with the AC or kill one or

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.709 
one person with the AC or kill one or
two<00:00:56.550> people<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> ACR<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.480> come<00:00:57.629> out

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
two people the ACR and then come out

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
two people the ACR and then come out
with<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> lights<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.829> also<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.940> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
with this and lights and also now I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.490 
with this and lights and also now I
think<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.539> also<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.170> good<00:01:01.320> gun

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
think this is also a really good gun

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.479 
think this is also a really good gun
because<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> sub<00:01:02.460> note<00:01:02.670> sub<00:01:03.629> nosed

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
because it's the sub note sub nosed

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.899 
because it's the sub note sub nosed
version<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.049> 44<00:01:07.049> Magnum<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.700> all<00:01:08.700> those

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
version of the 44 Magnum and all those

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.580 
version of the 44 Magnum and all those
is<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:10.130> 44<00:01:11.130> magnum<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> bit<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.590> accurate

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
is a 44 magnum is a bit more accurate

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.649 
is a 44 magnum is a bit more accurate
and<00:01:13.799> powerful<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> overall

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and powerful I think this is the overall

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
and powerful I think this is the overall
gun<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.740> other<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.189> has<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> lower

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gun because the other one has a lower

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.690 
gun because the other one has a lower
fiery<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.549> more

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
fiery so if this one can get more

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
fiery so if this one can get more
bullets<00:01:21.060> off<00:01:21.180> faster<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
bullets off faster then it was going to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.830 
bullets off faster then it was going to
be<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> lot<00:01:22.740> more<00:01:22.770> deadly<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.420> lethal

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
be a lot more deadly now our lethal

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
be a lot more deadly now our lethal

weapon I mean you still take mile for

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.530 
weapon I mean you still take mile for
pretty<00:02:49.489> long<00:02:49.670> ranges<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.239> just<00:02:50.390> really

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
pretty long ranges it's just really

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.720 
pretty long ranges it's just really
defensive<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.140> I've<00:02:52.040> attended<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.610> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
spray and drop shot so the Scorpion is

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.280 
spray and drop shot so the Scorpion is
probably<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.760> most<00:02:55.819> powerful<00:02:56.360> secondary<00:02:57.019> and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
probably the most powerful secondary and

we were using the MSR unlocked a level

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.729 
we were using the MSR unlocked a level
66<00:03:56.920> we<00:03:57.920> have<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:59.090> proficiency<00:03:59.840> impact<00:04:00.349> on<00:04:00.560> it

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
66 we have the proficiency impact on it

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.289 
66 we have the proficiency impact on it
so<00:04:01.130> when<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.459> shoot<00:04:01.639> through<00:04:01.819> walls<00:04:01.849> it<00:04:02.180> does

so when you shoot through walls it does

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.430

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.619 
think tears all right now we were using
the<00:06:50.799> it's<00:06:51.099> like<00:06:51.219> I<00:06:51.339> said<00:06:51.549> before<00:06:51.639> oh<00:06:52.089> wait

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:52.629 
the it's like I said before oh wait

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:54.329 
the it's like I said before oh wait
we're<00:06:53.229> using<00:06:53.379> range<00:06:53.739> on<00:06:53.919> this<00:06:54.009> because<00:06:54.159> it

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:54.339 
we're using range on this because it

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:55.979 
we're using range on this because it
does<00:06:54.459> have<00:06:54.610> low<00:06:54.729> range<00:06:54.999> in<00:06:55.539> my<00:06:55.719> opinion

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:55.989 
does have low range in my opinion

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:57.449 
does have low range in my opinion
especially<00:06:56.349> when<00:06:56.679> you're<00:06:56.799> using<00:06:56.919> silencer

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:57.459 
especially when you're using silencer

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.189 
especially when you're using silencer
silencer<00:06:57.639> kinds<00:06:58.149> of<00:06:58.239> balances<00:06:58.719> out<00:06:58.809> the<00:06:58.869> range

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
silencer kinds of balances out the range

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.829 
silencer kinds of balances out the range
and<00:06:59.349> everything<00:06:59.769> I<00:06:59.979> like<00:07:00.819> silencer<00:07:01.569> like

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:01.839 
and everything I like silencer like

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.600 
and everything I like silencer like
makes<00:07:02.049> it<00:07:02.199> bad<00:07:02.349> so<00:07:02.649> then<00:07:02.919> when<00:07:03.189> we<00:07:03.279> put<00:07:03.489> on

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
makes it bad so then when we put on

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.979 
makes it bad so then when we put on
range<00:07:03.909> it<00:07:04.119> kind<00:07:04.389> of<00:07:04.419> kind<00:07:04.539> of<00:07:04.689> brings<00:07:04.839> it<00:07:04.929> back

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:04.989 
range it kind of kind of brings it back

00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:09.569 
range it kind of kind of brings it back
a<00:07:05.139> little<00:07:05.259> bit<00:07:05.849> now<00:07:07.919> assess<00:07:08.919> a<00:07:09.129> sleight<00:07:09.549> of

you're in a big gun battle assassins fro
so<00:07:16.779> I<00:07:16.839> can't<00:07:17.079> be<00:07:17.199> seen<00:07:17.379> a<00:07:17.409> dead<00:07:17.769> silence<00:07:17.979> so<00:07:18.279> I

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:18.339 
so I can't be seen a dead silence so I

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:22.199 
so I can't be seen a dead silence so I
can't<00:07:18.549> be<00:07:18.669> heard<00:07:19.619> our<00:07:20.669> this<00:07:21.669> time<00:07:21.909> we're<00:07:22.089> be

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:22.209 
can't be heard our this time we're be

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:28.529 
can't be heard our this time we're be
running<00:07:22.539> UAV<00:07:24.659> UAV<00:07:25.769> stealth<00:07:26.769> bomber<00:07:27.009> and<00:07:27.309> EMP<00:07:28.119> I
