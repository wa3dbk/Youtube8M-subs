00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that's the only frustrating thing but

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.440 
that's the only frustrating thing but
that's<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.820> tablet<00:02:03.149> UI<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that's just because the tablet UI is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.320 
that's just because the tablet UI is
still<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.930> beta<00:02:03.960> mode<00:02:04.579> other<00:02:05.579> than<00:02:05.759> that

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
still in beta mode other than that

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.270 
still in beta mode other than that
is<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.480> really<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.650> run<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.130> should

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
is a really really good run you should

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.820 
is a really really good run you should
check<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.759> out
