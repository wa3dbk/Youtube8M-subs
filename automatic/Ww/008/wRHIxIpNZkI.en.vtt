you're gonna find when you wind up doing

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.069 
you're gonna find when you wind up doing
this<00:03:17.489> compared<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.060> chopping<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:18.600> dark

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
this compared to chopping up dark

powder<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.709> at<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.489> basically

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
powder in it at all this is basically

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.449 
powder in it at all this is basically
cocoa<00:03:24.510> fat<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:25.110> cocoa<00:03:25.440> butter<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.310> it's

cocoa fat with cocoa butter so it's

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.830 
cocoa fat with cocoa butter so it's
gonna<00:03:26.549> wind<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:26.910> dropping<00:03:27.329> up<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.750> gonna
