00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.460
 many believe that robin is simple and 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.580
 plainly a gay boy who batman 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.619
 touch though this vision comes 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.960
 from the Batman television series of 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.800
 the 40s because the truth be said 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.500
 there is no robin there are five and 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.660
 probably there will be more so 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.270
 I would like to tell you a little about these 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.579
 characters so peculiar and at the same time without 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.920
 so much recognition let's start with 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.560
 dick grayson the original robin and the one that 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.130
 you can say it's the most successful robin 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.199
 of all 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.329
 grayson has a story similar to the 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.789
 from wayne his family was purse seine 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.609
 known as the strain grace muse or 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.320
 lost grayson strainers one day were 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.170
 killed by a gangster called 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.030
 anthony tony his co batman was 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.920
 investigating the case and put grayson 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.540
 under his legal tutoring as he was 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.430
 wait for the dark knight saw 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.830
 skills in the boy and decided 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.140
 train him to be his assistant together 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.740
 they managed to solve the case of their done 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.540
 this 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.790
 Grayson became the son that wen 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.480
 I had never had so during a 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.180
 good weather 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.100
 this was his faithful assistant and I said that 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.009
 Grayson was the most successful 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.350
 all the robin he was the ringleader of 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.810
 the young titans next to wallace or 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.549
 flash kit after a while grayson is 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.259
 separated from batman and started using the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.420
 name nightwing becoming the 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.630
 budget billing protector that is something 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.310
 as well as the evil sister of codeshare 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.350
 Imagine caring for something like Batman and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.149
 I did not have an assistant but one day a boy 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.000
 orphan from the street tried to steal 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.729
 the rubbers of the batmobile this guy was 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.039
 Jason Todd Batman welcomed him and trained him 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.409
 to do the second robin however 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.479
 there was something wrong with this guy he did not 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.670
 I understood why Wayne left his 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.009
 enemies instead of killing them all at once 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.050
 by all there is even a part of the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.300
 story where there are unknowns and all 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.520
 killed or not a drug-addicted rapist 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.289
 Unfortunately, this would not last long 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.880
 that at a time when batman is 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.920
 I found busy doing a mission 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.350
 everything began to inquire about his mother 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.910
 biological at the end 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.160
 hill-wood ended up being the right 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.319
 but the joker blackmailed his mother 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.140
 makes both decided to face it 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.239
 to the very serious error when they were found 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.400
 in front of the nemesis of batman his mother 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.040
 he betrayed him and handed him over 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.470
 very coldly he destroyed it with just 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.049
 a metal bar as a curious fact 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.120
 one of the attacks that the joker uses 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.250
 in the video game in justice simulates the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.799
 Beating provided to Jason Todd 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.079
 batman did not manage to arrive on time alone 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.870
 saw the body of his protégé and here 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.310
 arrives the third robin tim drake a boy 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.709
 that followed the adventures of batman and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.959
 robin from almost its beginnings I investigate 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.569
 very well and came up with the identity of both 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.030
 grayson as of wayne drake tried 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.099
 convince his hero to train him but 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.319
 he refused by the weight of death 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.389
 of tops however at the end access to 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.760
 take it as your protégé as it is not 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.889
 strange tim's mother was killed and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.950
 his father ended up crippling all this 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.439
 thank gold or see things start 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.629
 to put on 'without at this point then 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.790
 there was a moment where wayne disappeared 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.859
 so white had to ask for help 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.689
 grayson to impersonate the knight 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.909
 dark they do it well while the 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.069
 dark knight is not found but not 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.290
 by much because Wayne would come back and 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.629
 Grayson would go back to his old ways 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.549
 nightwing in one of his adventures the 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.000
 bot ravens hero met with a 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.550
 batman 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.280
 false that used weapons and murdered 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.830
 without consent this batman is the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.680
 villain red wood also known as 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.540
 Jason todd the second robin sure 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.880
 you're wondering hey there were not 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.430
 already killed Jason todd as the answer 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.650
 is yes but it happens and it turns out that a 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.860
 character named George revived him with 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.230
 help from the google be all revived 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.630
 forgotten and with a hatred inside it 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.150
 had a better idea than to take justice 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.790
 your hands and become the antihero 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.220
 red hood that has given problems to both 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.030
 nightwing like a blacks more like a 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.400
 batman 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.680
 a whole stone in the shoe good as 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.079
 we know tim drake has a crippled father 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.150
 he does not know his double identity but 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.820
 when he discovers it forces his son to 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.840
 robin leave work and so it drake 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.180
 did 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.610
 he also arrived at the fourth robin called 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.950
 from Fanny Brawne also known as her 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.890
 power the daughter of a supervillain and 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.930
 nemesis of tim drake club master I think 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.690
 that it should also be highlighted that team 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.880
 and stephanie were once boyfriends 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.050
 when Drake's father died this one 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.900
 decided to adopt 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.000
 his identity however brown was robin 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.970
 at that time so he invented a new 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.490
 alter ego called red robin clear brown 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.229
 it would not last long because he disobeyed 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.030
 many batman orders and the 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.520
 they fired here comes in again 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.830
 'tie-break' but still as red robin 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.889
 the last robin until the moment 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.530
 llama damián wayne so is the son of 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.379
 bruce I feel such and will his mother 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.240
 this I believe scientifically and also what 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.669
 I think as one more of the sect of the 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.020
 murderers however this guy is 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.090
 extremely fúrico and of bad character 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.400
 even threatening grace 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.560
 jones and tim drake while batman is 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.509
 I was missing 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.430
 demián does the robin function during 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.310
 some time but his mother created a clone of 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.289
 he whom they call 'the heretic' to do 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.479
 the story a little shorter in the middle of 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.090
 a war they had wayne was killed 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.800
 for its double ending like this with the 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.050
 history of the roe to the present 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.659
 and jake doing batman's assistant 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.210
 again this was the story of the 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.130
 clear robin reviewed very very briefly 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.930
 so you know 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.560
 robing there is no one 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.229
 or there were 5 and also it's not a character 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.360
 Ladybug to the contrary each of 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.240
 they have a spectacular history the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.350
 which one deserves a good round of applause 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.350
 all and chau
