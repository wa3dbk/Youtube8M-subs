00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
official firmware update today I'm also

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.660 
official firmware update today I'm also
going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> speculate<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> good

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
going to speculate that there is a good

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.399 
going to speculate that there is a good
possibility<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.200> might<00:01:40.350> be

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
possibility that there might be

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
possibility that there might be
something<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.070> build<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> prepare<00:01:42.030> us

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
something in this build to prepare us

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.819 
something in this build to prepare us
for<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.479> update<00:01:42.930> because<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
for that update because I do think it is

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.090 
for that update because I do think it is
realistic<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> expect<00:01:44.880> Sony<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:46.259> eventually

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
realistic to expect Sony to eventually

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160 
realistic to expect Sony to eventually
make<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> these<00:01:48.060> cameras<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> very
