soon as it comes out its Lily to behold

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.310 
soon as it comes out its Lily to behold
it<00:01:19.520> immediately<00:01:20.090> hits<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.479> air<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.840> pops<00:01:21.080> up

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
it immediately hits the air and pops up

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.050 
it immediately hits the air and pops up
because<00:01:21.649> of<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.830> pressure<00:01:22.039> difference<00:01:22.490> the

because of the pressure difference the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.320 
because of the pressure difference the
water<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:23.800> corn<00:01:24.800> mix<00:01:25.070> actually<00:01:25.880> boils

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
water in that corn mix actually boils

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.870 
water in that corn mix actually boils
and<00:01:26.509> expands<00:01:27.289> so<00:01:27.470> rapidly<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:28.520> steam<00:01:28.850> is

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
and expands so rapidly that steam is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.810 
and expands so rapidly that steam is
formed<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:30.050> pops<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.500> up<00:01:30.590> into<00:01:30.860> this

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
formed and it pops it up into this

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.719 
formed and it pops it up into this
crunchy<00:01:32.360> what's<00:01:32.810> called<00:01:33.050> a<00:01:33.140> Colette<00:01:33.580> so<00:01:34.580> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
crunchy what's called a Colette so the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.670 
crunchy what's called a Colette so the
bottom<00:01:35.030> line<00:01:35.060> steam<00:01:35.869> captured<00:01:36.470> in<00:01:36.590> the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
bottom line steam captured in the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.760 
bottom line steam captured in the
cornmeal<00:01:37.159> expands<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.000> voila<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.960> Collette<00:01:39.560> is

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
cornmeal expands and voila a Collette is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.370 
cornmeal expands and voila a Collette is
born<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:40.790> guess<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> cheese<00:01:41.540> Colette<00:01:41.990> just

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
born but I guess a cheese Colette just

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.850 
born but I guess a cheese Colette just
doesn't<00:01:42.799> sound<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.460> tasty<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:45.470> doodle<00:01:45.770> is
