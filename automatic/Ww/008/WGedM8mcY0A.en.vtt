00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
gonna be like season one all over again

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
gonna be like season one all over again
but<00:02:06.719> other<00:02:06.899> than<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.320> can't<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.710> tell

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
but other than that I can't really tell

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.219 
but other than that I can't really tell
if<00:02:08.160> till<00:02:08.489> took<00:02:08.670> off<00:02:09.030> her<00:02:09.179> arm<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.750> think<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
if till took off her arm and I I think I

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.380 
if till took off her arm and I I think I
see<00:02:10.440> her<00:02:10.560> other<00:02:10.739> arm<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.610> could<00:02:11.940> be

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
see her other arm so it could be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
see her other arm so it could be
a little<00:02:12.930> different<00:02:13.200> scenario<00:02:13.590> if<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.370> cut

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
a little different scenario if you cut

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.340 
a little different scenario if you cut
off<00:02:14.610> her<00:02:14.730> arm<00:02:14.940> maybe<00:02:15.180> she'll<00:02:15.480> survive<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.110> bit

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
off her arm maybe she'll survive a bit

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
off her arm maybe she'll survive a bit
longer<00:02:16.590> maybe<00:02:17.310> she'll<00:02:17.640> actually<00:02:17.819> bleed<00:02:18.360> out

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
longer maybe she'll actually bleed out

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.199 
longer maybe she'll actually bleed out
maybe<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> cut<00:02:20.160> off<00:02:20.280> her<00:02:20.430> arm<00:02:20.640> she<00:02:20.790> might

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
maybe if you cut off her arm she might

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.480 
maybe if you cut off her arm she might
just<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.600> know<00:02:21.720> die<00:02:21.990> immediately<00:02:22.860> without

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
just you know die immediately without

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.650 
just you know die immediately without
kidding<00:02:23.910> actually<00:02:24.030> getting<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.480> say<00:02:24.630> goodbye

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
kidding actually getting to say goodbye

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.290 
kidding actually getting to say goodbye
or<00:02:25.050> anything<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.890> maybe<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.850> can<00:02:26.970> actually

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
or anything so maybe that can actually

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.850 
or anything so maybe that can actually
make<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.660> cutting<00:02:28.110> off<00:02:28.260> their<00:02:28.380> arm<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.650> bad

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
make the cutting off their arm a bad

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.400 
make the cutting off their arm a bad
choice<00:02:29.220> while<00:02:29.880> killing<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.660> Walker<00:02:30.900> could<00:02:31.140> be

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
choice while killing the Walker could be

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.690 
choice while killing the Walker could be
a<00:02:31.440> good<00:02:31.680> choice<00:02:31.830> cook<00:02:32.070> any<00:02:32.220> connected<00:02:32.580> say

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
a good choice cook any connected say

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.160 
a good choice cook any connected say
goodbye<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.030> her<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.390> everything<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:33.990> we'll

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
goodbye to her and everything so we'll

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.660 
goodbye to her and everything so we'll
see<00:02:34.290> how<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.440> plays<00:02:34.530> out<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.190> see<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.490> Kenny

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
see how it plays out and see if Kenny

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.820 
see how it plays out and see if Kenny
actually<00:02:36.090> gets<00:02:36.300> mad<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.720> kumon<00:02:36.959> time<00:02:37.140> for

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
actually gets mad at kumon time for

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.710 
actually gets mad at kumon time for
whatever<00:02:38.489> choice<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.180> she<00:02:39.209> made<00:02:39.360> because

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
whatever choice that she made because

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.479 
whatever choice that she made because
Kenny<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.739> pretty<00:02:40.890> emotional<00:02:40.980> sometimes

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
Kenny can get pretty emotional sometimes

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.490 
Kenny can get pretty emotional sometimes
but<00:02:42.000> either<00:02:42.150> way<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.569> surgery<00:02:43.020> we<00:02:43.200> end<00:02:43.350> up

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
but either way I think surgery we end up

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.410 
but either way I think surgery we end up
dying<00:02:43.709> anyway<00:02:43.860> because<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.910> know<00:02:45.030> how<00:02:45.270> would

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
dying anyway because you know how would

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.120 
dying anyway because you know how would
they<00:02:45.510> get<00:02:45.660> air<00:02:45.840> pastor<00:02:46.380> maybe<00:02:46.620> bonnie<00:02:46.890> has

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
they get air pastor maybe bonnie has

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.470 
they get air pastor maybe bonnie has
some<00:02:47.310> supplies<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.850> her<00:02:47.910> backpack<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.360> i

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
some supplies in her backpack like i

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.290 
some supplies in her backpack like i
said<00:02:48.660> before<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.709> I'll<00:02:50.340> today<00:02:50.640> actually<00:02:50.820> end

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
said before but I'll today actually end

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.880 
said before but I'll today actually end
up<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.630> know<00:02:51.690> patching<00:02:52.110> her<00:02:52.200> up<00:02:52.380> too<00:02:52.530> well<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
up you know patching her up too well and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
up you know patching her up too well and
she<00:02:53.100> could<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.580> end<00:02:53.820> up<00:02:53.880> dying<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.330> blood

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
she could just end up dying for blood

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.570 
she could just end up dying for blood
loss<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.690> everything<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:56.070> pretty<00:02:56.310> much

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
loss and everything so it's pretty much

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.640 
loss and everything so it's pretty much
the<00:02:56.640> end<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.209> her<00:02:57.300> now<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.200> background<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the end of her now in the background you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.140 
the end of her now in the background you
see<00:02:58.739> some<00:02:59.010> kind<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.220> place<00:02:59.550> they're<00:02:59.790> actually

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150

at probably a little cabin or something

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.620 
at probably a little cabin or something
probably<00:03:02.160> gonna<00:03:02.370> even<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:02.820> stay<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.390> I

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
probably gonna even like stay there I

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.000 
probably gonna even like stay there I
doubt<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.410> probably<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.709> keep<00:03:04.890> on

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
doubt it but it probably just keep on

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.890 
doubt it but it probably just keep on
moving<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.090> wanted<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.420> bring<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
moving on but I wanted to bring it up to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.750 
moving on but I wanted to bring it up to
actual<00:03:07.320> grouping<00:03:07.769> split<00:03:08.130> up<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:08.430> right

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
actual grouping split up because right
