we go okay list a launcher iPad and it
launches<00:00:26.740> pretty<00:00:27.100> fairly<00:00:27.369> easily<00:00:27.610> in<00:00:28.360> fast<00:00:29.109> so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890

basically on this is the right of

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.920 
basically on this is the right of
recognition<00:00:32.199> program<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.910> can<00:00:34.120> keep<00:00:34.660> all

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
recognition program and you can keep all

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.799 
recognition program and you can keep all
your<00:00:34.989> documents<00:00:35.920> that<00:00:36.519> you<00:00:36.550> are<00:00:37.449> right<00:00:37.659> in

anywhere on the screen and you can use
even<00:01:24.910> cursive<00:01:25.450> writing<00:01:25.630> because<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:26.020> will

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
even cursive writing because it will

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.620 
even cursive writing because it will
recognize<00:01:26.680> your<00:01:27.370> handwriting<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.390> let's

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
recognize your handwriting so let's

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:42.330 
recognize your handwriting so let's
write<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:29.370> writing<00:01:33.750> recognition<00:01:39.480> program<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
write a writing recognition program and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.950 
write a writing recognition program and
once<00:01:42.550> you've<00:01:42.790> finished<00:01:42.940> you<00:01:43.360> say<00:01:43.540> about<00:01:43.900> a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
once you've finished you say about a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.890 
once you've finished you say about a
second<00:01:44.410> you<00:01:44.740> see<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.280> types<00:01:45.550> out<00:01:45.760> what<00:01:46.720> you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
second you see and it types out what you

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.140 
second you see and it types out what you
just<00:01:47.110> wrote<00:01:47.530> by<00:01:47.980> hand<00:01:48.010> now<00:01:48.820> normally

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
just wrote by hand now normally

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.180 
just wrote by hand now normally
sometimes<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:50.020> will<00:01:50.230> capitalize<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.159> first

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
sometimes it will capitalize the first

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.910 
sometimes it will capitalize the first
letter<00:01:51.520> but<00:01:52.240> not<00:01:52.510> all<00:01:52.720> cases<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.440> want<00:01:53.890> to

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
letter but not all cases I want to

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.010 
letter but not all cases I want to
emphasize<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.820> program<00:01:55.240> does<00:01:55.480> not<00:01:55.780> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
emphasize that this program does not a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.990 
emphasize that this program does not a
hundred<00:01:56.320> percent<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.980> works<00:01:57.159> about<00:01:57.430> eighty

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
hundred percent it works about eighty

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.810 
hundred percent it works about eighty
percent<00:01:58.180> of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.480> time<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.159> works<00:02:00.670> pretty

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
percent of the time and it works pretty

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.050 
percent of the time and it works pretty
well<00:02:01.000> if<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.170> don't<00:02:02.470> like<00:02:03.250> typing<00:02:03.760> all<00:02:03.940> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
well if you don't like typing all the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.850 
well if you don't like typing all the
time<00:02:04.270> on<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.540> keyboard<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.620> just<00:02:05.710> want

quick<00:03:46.709> period<00:03:48.620> right<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.160> do<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.850> kind

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
quick period right here to do is a kind

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.380 
quick period right here to do is a kind
of<00:03:51.840> little<00:03:52.800> not<00:03:53.010> across<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.090> gives<00:03:54.240> me<00:03:54.360> a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
of little not across and it gives me a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.660 
of little not across and it gives me a
quick<00:03:54.600> period<00:03:54.750> if<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.020> want<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.470> or<00:03:55.680> i<00:03:55.709> can<00:03:55.890> I

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
quick period if I want that or i can I

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.750 
quick period if I want that or i can I
can<00:03:57.090> also<00:03:57.270> of<00:03:58.170> course<00:03:58.230> i<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:59.130> write<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> period

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
can also of course i can write a period

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.880 
can also of course i can write a period
as<00:03:59.850> well<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.750> let's<00:04:00.959> try<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.170> go<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.590> second

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
as well so let's try to go to the second

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.710 
as well so let's try to go to the second
line<00:04:02.070> again<00:04:06.920> they<00:04:07.920> really<00:04:08.250> need<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.430> have<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:09.060> a

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
line again they really need to have a a

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.920 
line again they really need to have a a
button<00:04:10.650> dedicated<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:12.090> going<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> second

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
button dedicated to going to the second

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.050 
button dedicated to going to the second
line<00:04:13.050> because<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> real<00:04:14.610> big<00:04:14.910> problem

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
line because that is a real big problem

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.050 
line because that is a real big problem
with<00:04:15.330> this<00:04:15.450> program<00:04:16.640> another<00:04:17.640> thing<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.910> I

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
with this program another thing that I

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.310 
with this program another thing that I
like<00:04:18.239> about<00:04:18.270> this<00:04:18.480> program<00:04:18.780> though<00:04:19.170> is<00:04:19.290> that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
like about this program though is that

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.340 
like about this program though is that
you<00:04:19.590> can<00:04:19.770> use<00:04:20.040> different<00:04:21.109> abbreviated<00:04:22.109> words
