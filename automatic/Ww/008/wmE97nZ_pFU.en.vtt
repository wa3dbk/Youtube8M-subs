 I had not been policed ​​and depressed about doctors and I discovered that 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:22.039
 pitadinha - could be a bigger trauma 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.120
 Dante height informed the modern dengue manager and no defeat the half the 

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:29.119

 No more countryside here. 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.639
 then it will twist is positive 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.940
 which so far no one has noticed that goes to the locality 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.999
 American football took time to accept 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.890
 how much 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.190
 in the opinion of being you are right we will wait for a second opinion 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.040
 we react late 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.630
 but now we want to make up for lost time by changing the rules of the game 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.949
 the own vice president of the anfp to o'shea suffered three compositions in the 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.240
 player times 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.040
 now the freedom that has seven in change 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.610
 that can go from 200 thousand dollars to who leaves of purpose in the head 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.699
 of opponents 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.610
 5 although of the season the technician of the equipment of munique the city in new york and 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.830
 with the players to discuss how to adapt to the novelties and how to 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.919
 protect 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.250
 only the strangest thing is that 15 are against the new rules some 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:40.499
 supposedly taikô as we are going to make an offensive move to be forbidden that 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.770
 our chosen helmet does not make sense if I give all of myself 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.800
 play to 100% I will not hurt myself with the good judge return it shows the obscure 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.419
 world is the most violent sport in the world I do not agree with the change 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:00.780
 because it takes aggression and then with six dead 16 many friends but the 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.490
 researchers and even fraud where changes are part of the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.490
 evolution of the sport 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.810
 the long-distance launch that today is one of the main 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.430
 characteristics of American football was only allowed in 1906 when 20 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.430
 players died during matches 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.039
 of violent moves 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.490
 while small changes happen inside the field the researchers try 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.370
 find a way to diagnose the disease and players still in activity 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.330
 a hope for millions of sports people and for anything between 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.570
 others this action does not shut up and does not make a point of being a 'teacher' 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:44.040
 great 100 years but for all my energy in these discoveries I do not want 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.710
 give up a long life in the healthy
