walkthrough on 100 floors today i'm

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.030 
walkthrough on 100 floors today i'm
going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.210> be<00:00:06.270> showing<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.660> level<00:00:06.930> 71<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.830> 80

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
going to be showing you level 71 to 80

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.839 
going to be showing you level 71 to 80
so<00:00:08.790> let's<00:00:08.970> get<00:00:09.120> started<00:00:10.400> so<00:00:11.400> basically<00:00:11.670> we're

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
so let's get started so basically we're

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.070 
so let's get started so basically we're
going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> be<00:00:12.090> doing<00:00:12.210> level<00:00:12.540> 71<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.080> au<00:00:15.080> right

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
going to be doing level 71 to au right

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.880 
going to be doing level 71 to au right
so<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.560> level<00:00:16.859> 70<00:00:17.190> floor<00:00:17.820> 71<00:00:18.439> you<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.619> like

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
so on level 70 floor 71 you have like

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
so on level 70 floor 71 you have like
these<00:00:20.010> dashed<00:00:20.310> lines<00:00:20.580> all<00:00:20.820> around<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.420> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
these dashed lines all around this I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.099 
these dashed lines all around this I
think<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.439> yin-yang<00:00:22.710> Singh<00:00:23.250> symbol<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.660> do

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
think it's a yin-yang Singh symbol so do

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.929 
think it's a yin-yang Singh symbol so do
if<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.710> look<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.099> bottom<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.460> quickly

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
if you look at this bottom one quickly

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.759 
if you look at this bottom one quickly
for<00:00:27.599> instance<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.800> free<00:00:29.220> oil<00:00:29.429> six<00:00:30.240> lines

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
for instance you have free oil six lines

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
for instance you have free oil six lines
but<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:32.070> call<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.579> I'm<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.390> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
but just call them I'm just going to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.990 
but just call them I'm just going to
call<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.719> free<00:00:33.930> dashed<00:00:34.170> lines<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
call them free dashed lines so then you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
call them free dashed lines so then you
want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> reflect<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.660> onto<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.960> top<00:00:37.170> bomb<00:00:37.380> but

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
want to reflect it onto the top bomb but

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.880 
want to reflect it onto the top bomb but
make<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:39.180> join<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.200> free

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
make them all like join up so like free

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.610 
make them all like join up so like free
like<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.899> mean<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> same<00:00:43.440> for

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
like that I mean you do the same for

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.139 
like that I mean you do the same for
this<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.100> replace<00:00:44.520> dashed<00:00:44.910> runs

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
this one you just replace dashed runs

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.369 
this one you just replace dashed runs
with<00:00:45.300> straight<00:00:45.510> ones<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> straight<00:00:46.200> ones

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
with straight ones and a straight ones

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
with straight ones and a straight ones
with<00:00:46.559> dash<00:00:46.770> blondes<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:47.940> makes<00:00:48.180> sense<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
with dash blondes it all makes sense in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.670 
with dash blondes it all makes sense in
a<00:00:48.660> second<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.590> got<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.449> like<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.680> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
a second so it's got to be like that and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
a second so it's got to be like that and
then<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.469> opposite<00:00:59.600> like

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
then for this one it's the opposite like

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.479 
then for this one it's the opposite like
that<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.320> pause<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> video<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.129> just

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that just pause the video right now just

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.030 
that just pause the video right now just
so<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.019> what<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> meant<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> do

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so you can see what what you meant to do

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.280 
so you can see what what you meant to do
and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.760> replay<00:01:08.210> right<00:01:09.210> toe<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.080> floor

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and then replay right toe so for floor

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
and then replay right toe so for floor
72<00:01:10.979> basically<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.880> you're<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> want

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
72 basically what you're going to want

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.899 
72 basically what you're going to want
to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.510> slide<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.470> circle<00:01:14.310> car<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.700> go<00:01:14.820> out

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to do slide this circle car all go out

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
to do slide this circle car all go out
to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> top<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.590> triangle<00:01:16.979> car<00:01:17.250> way<00:01:17.460> up

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
to the top then this triangle car way up

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
to the top then this triangle car way up
to<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.759> top<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.049> square<00:01:19.290> car

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to the top and the square car

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
to the top and the square car
independent<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.430> good<00:01:20.580> car<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.930> door

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
independent a good car and then the door

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.200 
independent a good car and then the door
will<00:01:22.140> open<00:01:23.869> that's<00:01:24.869> floor<00:01:25.049> 72<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.580> floor

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
will open that's floor 72 now for floor

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.899 
will open that's floor 72 now for floor
73<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.380> pretty<00:01:28.650> difficult<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.340> basically

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
73 it's pretty difficult so basically

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550 
73 it's pretty difficult so basically
what<00:01:30.060> you've<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.170> you've<00:01:31.320> got

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
what you've got one you what you've got

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.580 
what you've got one you what you've got
to<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.540> get<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.659> digit<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> middle<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to do is get this digit in the middle to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.690 
to do is get this digit in the middle to
get<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.450> well<00:01:36.450> 73<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.829> you've<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.100> ad<00:01:38.340> x

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
get to well 73 but you've got ad x

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.640 
get to well 73 but you've got ad x
divided<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.049> number<00:01:40.290> so

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
divided to get to that number so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.280 
divided to get to that number so
basically<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.070> got<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> add<00:01:41.430> 20<00:01:42.110> when<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> got

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
basically you got to add 20 when you got

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.090 
basically you got to add 20 when you got
x<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.740> x<00:01:43.770> 2<00:01:44.479> minus<00:01:45.479> 10<00:01:46.340> times<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.579> by<00:01:47.759> free

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
x up x 2 minus 10 times it by free

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.620 
x up x 2 minus 10 times it by free
divide<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> by<00:01:50.369> two<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:51.500> 15<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
divide it by two at 15 and then you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.219 
divide it by two at 15 and then you
gotta<00:01:54.810> divide<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> by<00:01:55.380> 4<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.020> gotta

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
gotta divide it by 4 and then you gotta

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
gotta divide it by 4 and then you gotta
times<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.399> by<00:01:59.520> 5<00:02:00.110> minus<00:02:01.110> 5<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.159> then<00:02:02.850> add<00:02:03.270> free

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
times it by 5 minus 5 and then add free

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.089 
times it by 5 minus 5 and then add free
to<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.649> 70<00:02:05.070> fruit<00:02:05.659> that's<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:07.320> easy<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to get 70 fruit that's not easy but it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.160 
to get 70 fruit that's not easy but it
was<00:02:08.190> pretty<00:02:08.399> difficult<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:09.420> floor<00:02:09.629> 73

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
was pretty difficult so that's floor 73

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.949 
was pretty difficult so that's floor 73
now<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.129> floor<00:02:11.340> 74<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.540> got<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.780> tap

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
now for floor 74 you just got to tap

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.880 
now for floor 74 you just got to tap
this<00:02:13.110> little

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
this little

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.520 
this little
I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.360> hexagon<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.080> bottom<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
I think it's a hexagon at the bottom and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.860 
I think it's a hexagon at the bottom and
then<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> reveals<00:02:17.790> these<00:02:18.060> shapes<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.720> all

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
then it reveals these shapes with all

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.390 
then it reveals these shapes with all
different<00:02:19.020> colors<00:02:19.470> basically<00:02:20.280> their

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
different colors basically their

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.990 
different colors basically their
sequence<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.240> what<00:02:21.660> colors<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.490> for

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
sequence of what colors you can have for

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.890 
sequence of what colors you can have for
like<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.480> six<00:02:24.930> shaded<00:02:25.770> saw<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.550> shape<00:02:27.060> so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
like a six shaded saw a shape so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.940 
like a six shaded saw a shape so
basically<00:02:28.230> you've<00:02:28.380> got<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.590> find<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.920> other

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
basically you've got to find the other

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.610 
basically you've got to find the other
last<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:30.030> basically<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.110> got<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.470> make

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
last one basically you just got to make

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.510 
last one basically you just got to make
it<00:02:31.680> yellow<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> top<00:02:33.050> blue<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.440> dark<00:02:35.100> blue<00:02:35.370> on

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
the right light blue on the bottom right

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.900 
the right light blue on the bottom right
red<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> bottom<00:02:42.410> purple<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.910> bottom

some reason it there we go and that will

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.570 
some reason it there we go and that will
make<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.390> scale<00:03:12.600> go<00:03:12.810> down<00:03:13.019> tap<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.400> in

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
make the scale go down tap this one in

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.270 
make the scale go down tap this one in
your<00:03:14.700> inventory<00:03:15.739> tap<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.269> ammon<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
well then this scale was up I mean you

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.000 
well then this scale was up I mean you
want<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.200> took<00:03:22.290> your<00:03:22.440> phone<00:03:22.560> forward<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.920> little

want to took your phone forward a little

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.770 
want to took your phone forward a little
bit<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.370> make<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.640> other<00:03:23.730> one<00:03:23.850> green<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.750> I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
bit to make the other one green so I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.330 
bit to make the other one green so I
just<00:03:25.380> noticed<00:03:25.680> i<00:03:25.739> didn't<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.100> no<00:03:26.250> sound<00:03:26.459> on

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
just noticed i didn't have no sound on

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.740 
just noticed i didn't have no sound on
right<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.850> this<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.269> one<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.630> i'm

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
right so this is the one that i'm

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.870 
right so this is the one that i'm
probably<00:03:30.930> gonna<00:03:31.110> have<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.350> speed<00:03:31.739> up<00:03:31.769> on<00:03:32.190> but

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
probably gonna have to speed up on but

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.090 
probably gonna have to speed up on but
um<00:03:33.090> they<00:03:34.079> see<00:03:34.140> what<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.530> got<00:03:34.650> what<00:03:34.890> what

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
um they see what you got what what

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.949 
um they see what you got what what
you've<00:03:35.370> got<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.640> do<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.480> got<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.660> make<00:03:36.840> this

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
you've got to do is you got to make this

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.420 
you've got to do is you got to make this
into<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> square<00:03:37.620> they'll<00:03:38.010> probably<00:03:38.040> be<00:03:38.400> a

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
into a square they'll probably be a

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.780 
into a square they'll probably be a
little<00:03:39.290> image<00:03:40.290> over<00:03:40.560> there<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.370> then

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
little image over there and then

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.449 
little image over there and then
basically<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.840> gotta<00:03:43.190> solve<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
basically you just gotta solve the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.300 
basically you just gotta solve the
puzzle<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:45.000> make<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.299> into<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> square<00:03:46.049> I'm<00:03:46.980> just

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
puzzle to make it into a square I'm just

00:03:47.310 --> 00:04:04.530 
puzzle to make it into a square I'm just
gonna<00:03:47.489> do<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:48.269> see<00:03:48.840> you

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.949 

and<00:04:05.260> then<00:04:05.409> once<00:04:05.620> you've<00:04:06.150> got<00:04:07.150> into<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.689> shape

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
and then once you've got into this shape

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.899 
and then once you've got into this shape
you're<00:04:08.650> going<00:04:08.829> to<00:04:08.920> want<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.189> tap<00:04:09.400> this<00:04:09.549> little

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
you're going to want to tap this little

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.330 
you're going to want to tap this little
square<00:04:10.150> new<00:04:10.329> inventory<00:04:10.629> and<00:04:11.170> then<00:04:11.890> put<00:04:12.159> it<00:04:12.250> in

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
square new inventory and then put it in

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.660 
square new inventory and then put it in
the<00:04:12.430> middle<00:04:12.599> I'm<00:04:13.599> in<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.019> door<00:04:14.170> open<00:04:14.670> so

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
the middle I'm in the door open so

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.770 
the middle I'm in the door open so
basically<00:04:15.939> now<00:04:16.120> we<00:04:16.180> move<00:04:16.389> onto<00:04:16.600> floor<00:04:17.669> 77<00:04:18.780> this

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
basically now we move onto floor 77 this

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.689 
basically now we move onto floor 77 this
is<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> pretty<00:04:20.350> simple<00:04:20.680> one<00:04:20.859> because<00:04:21.549> it's

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
is a pretty simple one because it's

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.180 
is a pretty simple one because it's
floor<00:04:21.910> 77<00:04:22.570> they're<00:04:22.750> both<00:04:22.930> sevens<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:23.949> you<00:04:24.039> got

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
floor 77 they're both sevens so you got

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.249 
floor 77 they're both sevens so you got
to<00:04:24.280> get<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.580> seventh<00:04:25.000> dot<00:04:25.300> lit<00:04:25.509> up<00:04:25.630> basically

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
to get this seventh dot lit up basically

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.469 
to get this seventh dot lit up basically
when<00:04:26.350> you<00:04:26.380> touch<00:04:26.620> this<00:04:26.770> button<00:04:26.979> they<00:04:27.820> like

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
when you touch this button they like

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.090 
when you touch this button they like
dots<00:04:28.750> light<00:04:29.050> up<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.680> want<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:29.889> get<00:04:29.979> it

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
dots light up and you want to get it

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.650 
dots light up and you want to get it
exactly<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:30.820> seventh<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.919> let<00:04:32.919> go<00:04:33.130> and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
exactly on the seventh and let go and

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.450 
exactly on the seventh and let go and
the<00:04:34.660> door<00:04:34.840> will<00:04:34.930> open<00:04:35.080> pretty<00:04:35.979> simple<00:04:36.160> that

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
the door will open pretty simple that

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.010 
the door will open pretty simple that
one<00:04:36.639> in<00:04:37.120> my<00:04:37.240> opinion<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:37.599> should<00:04:37.900> have<00:04:37.990> been

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
one in my opinion that should have been

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.740 
one in my opinion that should have been
lower<00:04:38.320> now<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.490> quite<00:04:39.849> a<00:04:39.880> tricky<00:04:40.300> one<00:04:40.479> to

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
lower now this is quite a tricky one to

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.400 
lower now this is quite a tricky one to
figure<00:04:41.500> out<00:04:41.650> but<00:04:41.940> basically<00:04:42.940> this<00:04:43.900> emblems

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
figure out but basically this emblems

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.810
