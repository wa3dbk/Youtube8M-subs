unit<00:02:58.110> dismounted<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.370> um<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.690> mean<00:03:00.960> this<00:03:01.170> is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
unit dismounted so um I mean this is

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.470 
unit dismounted so um I mean this is
this<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.190> would<00:03:03.060> say<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.420> is

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
this is I would say that this is

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.240 
this is I would say that this is
inconclusive<00:03:04.110> um<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> seems<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:07.800> it's

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
inconclusive um but it seems that it's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.090 
inconclusive um but it seems that it's
more<00:03:08.640> effective<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.240> dismount<00:03:09.800> shot<00:03:10.800> calves

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
more effective to dismount shot calves

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.880 
more effective to dismount shot calves
and<00:03:11.460> get<00:03:11.940> them<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.260> engage<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.440> prolonged

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
melee with with enemy infantry than it

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.800 
melee with with enemy infantry than it
is<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.190> charge<00:03:17.490> your<00:03:17.940> shot<00:03:18.300> gap<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.630> there

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
is just a charge your shot gap in there

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.080 
is just a charge your shot gap in there
and<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.110> them<00:03:19.260> fight<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.470> out<00:03:19.850> because<00:03:20.850> they
