00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.089
 to pass three closed the spokesman of pp 2 shades combines different 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:08.039
 elements 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.389
 we talk about the digital edition one of the great advantages of photography 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.169
 modern 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.230
 and is that the later edition offers a multitude of possibilities are 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.089
 our scope to only two points that awaits all 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.390
 In the following report we show some tricks so you can take the 

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:26.759
 maximum match though other digital photographs 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.759
 the secret photo editing programs 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.079
 as well 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.570
 let's remember the eyes 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.750
 Good skin tone seems to be raining though sunlight 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.830
 correct eyes 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.450
 teeth whitening 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.309
 nowadays anything is possible thanks to difficult programs 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 tools that allow us 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.670
 the photographs that we take with our cameras 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.350
 what a beginner recommends 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.360
 the retouching efe little by little 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.530
 - in December the network 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.659
 in certain impurity resolved for copartner of the art improvement and 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.410
 and one hundred percent of their work has improved 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.860
 suppose we want to convert this photo 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350
 the black and white 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350
 the first thing we have to do that stack with the selected program 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 click on file next 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.690
 we visualize the photograph 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.340
 we use in lima feb 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.250
 and then 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 we click on grayscale 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.780
 in this way 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.930
 so simple 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.780
 we manage to eliminate 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.720
 emotion of color 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 we already have our winter white photography 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.509
 what we will have to do most often are color corrections 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.930
 those photos that have gone dark or as maximum contrast 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.370
 They are very easy to correct 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.410
 In the image menu at your feet there are several options 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.420
 although our intention is 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.460
 yopi contrast 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.950
 we will get better located we use the coffee you levels 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.360
 once 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.150
 we will beat levels adjustment we will see the histogram of the image 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.389
 dragging the level controllers that are below the traffic 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.869
 we can see how the shadows that you see as this picture are changing 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.679
 we will use the regulator on the right to correct the lights 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.669
 left for the shadow 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:36.139
 When the result is satisfactory, you just have to press 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.359
 we generate it now 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.119
 we want civil 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:49.369
 to send it as the birthday greeting ap for it we only have 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.189
 have to select the text folder that appears on the toolbar of the 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.489
 program as a capital art 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.379
 as this is city this tool in the upper part of the program these 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.699
 the pecs options appear 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.459
 well of this bar options 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.329
 we can select the color 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.779
 font 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.809
 just click on the photo 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.239
 start writing the desired text 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.239
 their size or color does not convince them 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:21.639
 because we can modify all these aspects once explained the text 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.529
 that's why we have to go again 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.669
 the options on the top bar of the screen 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.669
 we can also place the text to the desired position 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.349
 we will find in the tab of 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.210
 we click 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.409
 about the layer of the text that we want to move 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.159
 the seem fundamentally marked 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.859
 we do not select the tool 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.349
 we click on the image 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.599
 the votes and he was crossed 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.519
 the sections until the text is placed in the desired position 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.429
 finally we can also add him to take down with the photo is very simple act 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:59.989
 the top of the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.669
 we click on selection 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.619
 then selecting everything 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.619
 Once we have selected the entire image, we click 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.839
 Caesar a bond window we choose tricolor the size of the frame a pixel 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.259
 we click is what there is 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.259
 we will go the final result 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.449
 the market there are many digital image editing programs although 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.930
 expensive so more plausible 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.450
 others as well as it is free offer us multiple possibilities of 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.939
 tools to improve 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.819
 limit our photographs 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.729
 deserves to work for forms 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.360
 a landscape of the normal photo placed and made in the hand of the artist 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.319
 photography gardening 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.319
 although sometimes a subject our professional 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.209
 the tambo uelzen viciarse have changed those proposals are a reality 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.740
 tmz 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.690
 there are thresholds of tutorial courses and free courses of payment that we 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.150
 will help to know it and get the most out of these tools 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.699
 as we can see it is very easy to improve our football 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.219
 the maximum possible match and that is a leader to our friendships 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.589
 encourage you to try 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.559
 a little practice you will face everything you are capable of doing 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.809
 proposals
