00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello everyone gets upset 08 I hope 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.370
 that you have good in any case me I 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.870
 am fine then today I'm you 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.889
 make a pretty fast video because 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.660
 I have a few things to tell you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.340
 but besides that I introduced you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 quickly from gameplay so I was in 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.640
 multi team on the standoff map that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.900
 I appreciate it enormously 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.520
 and besides, it's by far my favorite 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 among everything is in the gameplay itself 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.210
 was playing so with the scorpion is equipped 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.350
 from the quick charger and the silencer to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.170
 level of my strengths that I had 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.640
 ghosts and determination stone and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.990
 robustness and finally I had to have 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.219
 dexterity 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.690
 so you noticed it but I 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.120
 cut gameplay because I wanted 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.170
 really make a quick video and then 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.850
 anyway the rest of the gameplay 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.070
 is not very interesting to watch 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.480
 even though I admit that the part that I 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.010
 promise you to years past no one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.870
 football game is good it's still 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 a nuclear with the sport pawns that the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 proposes anyway 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.809
 so here I want to clarify also that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 two gameplays are long enough and I 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.320
 even think it's okay my 2nd or 3rd 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.940
 nuclear I do not know anymore anyway 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.289
 I was stressing to death and so if you 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.820
 see temporize and that's normal being 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.320
 given that I really did not want to miss 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.180
 nuclear power and even less with the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.589
 scorpions so here i'm going to talk 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.939
 quickly from the scorpions confess not to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.790
 tell you a few things 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.530
 so scorpions there is a weapon that I 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.080
 hate simply because 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.750
 apart from close the completely can 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.860
 so that's my opinion of course but he 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 must have a different opinion 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.520
 witness this weapon I really like them 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.710
 what because as I said the door 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.180
 and it is very small after certainly 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.369
 melee you will be very very 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.259
 advantage thanks to the rate of fouquet 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.790
 that happened to me at mid-distance or 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.990
 long distance I think you can 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.909
 give up your duels 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.100
 because a person with a minimum 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.080
 to shoot she will have no difficulty in 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.509
 to kill you because because of his 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.520
 rate of fire is there huge recoil and of 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.440
 far away there no gang power 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.820
 to avoid a maximum recoil I 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.710
 advise you the muffler or the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.929
 front handle or maybe even the barrel 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.550
 instead of the silent but good this 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.140
 weapon I can not give you too much 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.970
 advice because frankly I 'm going 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.429
 go up in gold and after I could touch 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.409
 only once and in addition to all that sound 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.390
 charger is very small I think it 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.369
 must be 30 ball in and the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.509
 he shot too quickly and saw the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.920
 number of balls to put in 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.899
 kill a guy that's hard 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.459
 to chain several and so it's for 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.920
 that I would advise the charger 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.630
 fast to load large capacity but in 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.579
 having tried both I prefer 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.470
 widely a fast charger and for 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.489
 finish one thing after a little 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.959
 belittle this weapon 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.400
 I tried to do business in the head 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.239
 in hardcore and I advise you 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.010
 to really try 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.780
 because I can tell you that about 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.000
 this weapon if you put the handle rgo 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.010
 with a silencer and quick charger 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 you are going to make a pure massacre because 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.950
 that this weapon you very very quickly but 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.660
 really fast compared to others 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.640
 souls whether near or far 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.440
 and jeanneney that a very fast pace 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.299
 elevated and how hardcore close up like 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.709
 by far it takes two balls I can you 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.200
 to say that it falls to me very quickly 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.880
 so here in summary the scorpions is 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.079
 not really a weapon that I appreciate 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.709
 because she is far from 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.510
 versatile 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.579
 although it is largely feasible to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.590
 to make leaps gameplay with but good 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.430
 it's not a weapon I'm going to use 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.380
 everyday 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.060
 so now I wanted to do this 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.620
 fast video especially to warn you 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.970
 than 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.769
 video meal for a week 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.459
 because I'm on vacation for 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.750
 one week 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.970
 and suddenly I go home to my mother during 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.959
 all this week I said a lot of 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.830
 times week of a knife finally brief 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.390
 so as I already told you our 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.459
 some videos the connection of the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.690
 ball is just rotten and suddenly that's 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.209
 would put another week 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.709
 the bit of a video of five or six 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.569
 minutes I wonder even if that 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.860
 would not take longer but good 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.840
 that's why I prefer to wait 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.650
 also to go home for you a 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.810
 few other videos 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.799
 that was really all I 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.840
 wanted to tell you but I was holding 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.010
 really to make a quick video before 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.019
 to leave since I have left 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.090
 more time and so there will be 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.400
 no video next week and 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.410
 I'm sorry but as soon as I get home 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.720
 I do it again a video plus a tutorial I 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.069
 think but by cons for the video I 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.819
 do not know too much what I'm going 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.379
 do for the moment 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.870
 but I still have the week 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.900
 to think about it so here I think 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.430
 having said everything except maybe a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.480
 thing as long as I think about it because there is 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.790
 a lot of people who asked me a 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.500
 question if I was accepted on the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.060
 Community code chain qg and codes 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.069
 cf for my last one video 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.480
 but for now I have proved again 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.799
 answer but within a week 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.840
 I will have an answer I think 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.060
 and so I tell you I 'll tell you if 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.950
 I was accepted even though I think this 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.389
 will be useless to tell you because I 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.599
 think my subscribers will not increase 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.940
 wrong at once so that's it 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.169
 for this short video I do not know if 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.549
 will remain some time on the video being 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.229
 given that I do not have the video under them 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.270
 eyes anyway I hope this 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.340
 video will please you anyway I'm 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.530
 really sorry for inactivity 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.120
 forgiveness that will follow but but I have 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.310
 not too much choice 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.610
 finished so this part on a 41.5 I 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.660
 believe if I remember well for 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.030
 confirmed immunizations I believe that I 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.630
 had 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.820
 5.26 because it was elimination 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.710
 to confirm I'll make it happen 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.940
 I forgot to say it after I you 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.010
 grant that this is nothing exceptional 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.380
 but it's still a nuclear 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.910
 if the video Did you remember to 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.590
 as always the green thumb that makes 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.400
 that he is always helping me and who is 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.250
 always happy 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.180
 I still have trouble on the end 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.560
 do not hesitate to share and 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.640
 comment on the video and do not hesitate 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.230
 also to subscribe if it's not 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.610
 still done on this I tell you to the
