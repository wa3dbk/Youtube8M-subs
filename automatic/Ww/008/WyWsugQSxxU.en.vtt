00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
more time so how do we mitigate this it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
more time so how do we mitigate this it
has<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.379> where<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> flashbang<00:00:59.699> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
has to do with where the flashbang is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
has to do with where the flashbang is
located<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:01.289> you're<00:01:01.410> looking<00:01:01.559> at<00:01:01.829> just

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
located and what you're looking at just

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.369 
located and what you're looking at just
like<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> phasing

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
like that and it's a kind of phasing

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
like that and it's a kind of phasing
effect<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.970> let's<00:01:06.150> show<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.479> guys<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> couple

effect so let's show you guys a couple

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.690 
effect so let's show you guys a couple
of<00:01:07.170> things<00:01:07.350> including<00:01:07.700> line-of-sight

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
of things including line-of-sight

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
of things including line-of-sight
blocking<00:01:09.270> which<00:01:09.450> works<00:01:09.869> part<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> time<00:01:10.830> as

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
blocking which works part of the time as

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.200 
blocking which works part of the time as
long<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> lucky<00:01:11.670> bounce<00:01:11.820> with

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
long as you get a lucky bounce with

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
long as you get a lucky bounce with
friendly<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.439> over<00:01:13.560> feel<00:01:14.280> the

damage as I've been doing so far it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260 
damage as I've been doing so far it's
actually<00:01:55.380> stepping<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> flashbang<00:01:56.759> or

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.890 

just<00:02:12.410> like<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.490> look<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.180> that's

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
just like that you can look up if that's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.450 
just like that you can look up if that's
the<00:02:15.140> worst<00:02:15.320> case<00:02:15.530> scenario<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> lot<00:02:16.400> of

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
the worst case scenario but a lot of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.530 
the worst case scenario but a lot of
times<00:02:16.640> you're<00:02:16.730> gonna<00:02:16.820> find<00:02:17.030> yourself<00:02:17.150> being

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
times you're gonna find yourself being

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.780 
times you're gonna find yourself being
blinded<00:02:18.020> because<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.350> lose<00:02:18.530> control<00:02:19.190> or<00:02:19.700> you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
blinded because you lose control or you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.340 
blinded because you lose control or you
lose<00:02:20.000> contact<00:02:20.240> with<00:02:20.510> where<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.900> flashbang

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
lose contact with where that flashbang

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.750 
lose contact with where that flashbang
is<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:21.860> doesn't<00:02:22.040> work<00:02:22.190> as<00:02:22.430> good

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
is so that doesn't work as good

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.330 
is so that doesn't work as good
it's<00:02:23.000> simply<00:02:23.300> quickly<00:02:23.510> changing<00:02:23.960> your<00:02:24.050> fov

it that mitigates it go ahead marble man
one<00:03:07.850> more<00:03:08.000> time<00:03:08.210> I<00:03:08.360> don't<00:03:08.390> have<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.660> worry

about moving around or moving backwards
or<00:03:11.540> turning<00:03:12.380> my<00:03:12.470> fov<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.550> have<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.790> place

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
or turning my fov I just have to place

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.100 
or turning my fov I just have to place
him<00:03:14.330> in<00:03:14.510> between<00:03:14.660> it

go<00:03:15.350> ahead<00:03:15.530> Bowman<00:03:15.830> one<00:03:15.980> more<00:03:16.190> time<00:03:18.130> it's<00:03:19.130> that

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
go ahead Bowman one more time it's that

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.310 
go ahead Bowman one more time it's that
simple<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.390> mitigate<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.840> flashbang

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
simple so to mitigate the flashbang

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.640 
simple so to mitigate the flashbang
change<00:03:22.040> your<00:03:22.160> fov<00:03:22.450> turn<00:03:23.450> around<00:03:23.750> go<00:03:24.380> around<00:03:24.500> a
