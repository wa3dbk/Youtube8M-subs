00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.180
 today I will talk about how to maintain your 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.910
 bright and blue pool using the 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.250
 basically bbb method will use 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.279
 common household products that can 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 find in any store or market 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.190
 which are bleach and bicarbonate bleach 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.860
 to balance the water in your pool and 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.770
 you will only need one chemical more than 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.510
 is the muriatic acid that will be used 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.510
 to reduce the ph 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.850
 will also use chlorox bleach 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.160
 bicarbonate to increase the quality and 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.500
 the borax to increase the ph goes to 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.260
 need muriatic acid from your store 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.510
 local I use 31 percent acid 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.140
 they sell a weaker acid but 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.910
 basically the acid will reduce the ph 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.720
 increases ph with borax and increases 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.530
 alkalinity with bicarbonate and disinfect 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.530
 your water with chlorine 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.760
 chlorine bleach is the same 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.400
 ingredient as the liquid plugin the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.330
 chlorine I use on my route is 12.5 of 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.970
 sodium 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.670
 sodium hypochlorite in its bleach 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.299
 Chlorine is 8.25 percent sodium 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.299
 hypochlorite 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.000
 so yes check your water and the ph is 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.870
 low as this one would have to put borax 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.870
 to increase it 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.899
 If the pH is too high, I would put acid 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.899
 muriatic to reduce it 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.190
 what he is trying to achieve is to have the ideal 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.440
 from 7.4 to 7.6 that will make the scoreboard 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 be more effective in killing the bacteria 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.220
 and viruses 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.049
 you will also need to try 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.020
 get a balance of alkalinity 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.980
 generally what you want is between 80 a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.970
 120 ppm parts per million in most 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.170
 of luck the pools 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.700
 the alkalinity is adapted with the ph 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.680
 then when you decrease the ph 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.350
 with acid the alkalinity will decrease 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.870
 when you use bicarbonate to quality 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.870
 will increase the ph just a little 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.319
 one of the main reasons that 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.329
 wants to keep the alkalinity to a 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.569
 normal level is because it prevents the 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.930
 ph bounce when the pH increases or decreases 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.930
 quickly 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.909
 a good reason to use chlorine in your 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.530
 pool is that it will not increase its level 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.750
 of conditioner then it goes to 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.569
 need 30 to 50 parts per million 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.459
 ppm of conditioner in your beta you 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.129
 You can use a strip like this to 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.519
 measure or you can use a test equipment 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.519
 tyler 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.390
 apart from doing the bbb method 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.099
 successfully is to have a good team of 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.219
 test I suggest the test equipment 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.890
 tyler how this test tests the calcium 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:37.569
 alkalinity hardness ph conditioner 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.569
 chlorine and it has been base demand 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.310
 This is a test equipment 5 in 1 use 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.270
 this my pool route test 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.660
 alkalinity th and acid demand and the other 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.910
 chlorine test 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.490
 I recommend exam strips so that 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.800
 give you a good chemical reading 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.940
 way to verify the results you 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.940
 it gives a good reading 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.040
 one very important thing to know is the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.889
 size of your pool you have to know 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.750
 How many gallons or liters of water do you have? 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.870
 in your pool to increase the correct 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.350
 amount of chemicals 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.750
 then using the method is a bbb 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.290
 easy and economical way to maintain 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.240
 your pool then by keeping your 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.750
 Water balance with the right amount 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.880
 of chlorine and the correct level of ph does not 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.400
 you will have to worry about algae in your 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.160
 pool and eliminate the need for 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.169
 expensive treatments for your pool 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.970
 this is a quick look at treatment 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.970
 from solberg to with the bbb method
