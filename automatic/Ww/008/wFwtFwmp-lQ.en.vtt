00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello to all today we find ourselves 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.779
 for a video to explain 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 how to increase your fps number 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.580
 so your world pictures per second so 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 have a more fluid shadow minecraft on 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.730
 this game firstly let's go you 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.240
 go into computer property for 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 see a little bit about your configuration 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.109
 so you have to know that to play 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.539
 minecraft minimum managed to play that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.929
 is going to be two gigabytes of ram RAM 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.260
 ram it's the same to have a minecraft 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.190
 8 it's going to be four so here I am 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.020
 not talking about the card processor 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.180
 graphic because he does not ask for it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 really a big processor a big 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 graphic card so I did not think 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.379
 worth talking about when you have 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.910
 minecraft and check also just make 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.140
 a right click does execute the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.280
 graphics processor check that it 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.480
 be the graphics card that 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.989
 selected and not the graphics 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 integrate if you have problems with 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 the abstract 2nd purpose there you remind me 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.510
 thank you it's me where he had 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 lag problems or very bugs 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.040
 surely because of that so check 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.000
 well we end up 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 no no I just go on the internet 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 then show you then if you want 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.630
 further analysis of your computer 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 that you go in I would put read in 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.659
 the description no panic that's it 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.670
 will analyze your pc performance 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.990
 he has and say basically 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.250
 what is missing about how you 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 will be able to exploit it will be a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.210
 bar so got fed up you go 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.430
 understand in five seconds when he 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.900
 is going to be charged basically he's going to you he 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.540
 he will give you the perfumes finally 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.740
 how are you going? 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:56.549
 game on your pc 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:58.079
 when you want to go morals you good 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.100
 the first time was super slow here 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.840
 it's not the first time I'm doing 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.939
 So its smallest So there is already a 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 little scan to see just to basel 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.299
 to the minimum minimum it's going to be two 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.200
 gigas of ram it's going to be cat and that's it 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.890
 is going to be more so here he gives me a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.330
 minimum so it's good after a 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.980
 recommended so recommended by a 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.900
 Flowing image is good too 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.720
 and touques and here we go 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.260
 found in play in re here we are 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.129
 found in play so here I wanted 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.760
 to tell you is to go in 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.290
 so the options had to improve the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.330
 performances so the graphics already 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 you put them in front of them already 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.450
 becomes very ugly not lizards but 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.920
 good me it requires less resources 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.780
 its grid a few frames per second 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.430
 also the particles you remove them 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.750
 the performances let you max fps that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.849
 will you put the most pictures by 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.780
 second possible the distance is going to you the 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.430
 go down until you are 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.720
 content at the level of fluidity view 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.400
 reels there will be games show you 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.530
 with the ad viewer you see there you 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.629
 do you take it off the road and I 'm fine 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.310
 will look like it's worth 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.830
 I looked at him harbor and hand there you 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.280
 it's more like moving 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.870
 it's very ugly but we do not care 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.580
 the advanced opengl you can disable 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.959
 it's a trick with mapping them 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.400
 clouds you clear you clear 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.950
 head here and there normally you 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:43.709
 should have a minecraft he persists 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:46.049
 yours hello options here 3d 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.640
 anaglyph or if ever good it goes in 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.680
 have but good if you have lines 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.760
 and blue and red colors that's it 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.360
 can be done do a little 3d effect 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.799
 Okay, let's find ourselves on the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.420
 java site because you have to know that 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.730
 minecraft turn with java so it's okay 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.540
 quite a bit of your memory and 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.280
 not much else 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.659
 so already to play you are obliged 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.180
 to have java so the most version 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.799
 recent possible download there and if 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.930
 for example, you have more than 4 gigas 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.670
 ram 4 gigabytes or more it can be 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.220
 interesting to download version 64 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.949
 allart bits that normal java works 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.039
 with maximum works by only using 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.870
 gigabytes of RAM I'm eight 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.560
 so it hurts to stay in the ass 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.789
 with two gigas of ram so we can 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520
 can go with him and finally me 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.289
 I have good for you it's me 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.430
 when I was 8 then for that 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.860
 I looked for a little bit I found 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.690
 that it was necessary to have the 64- bit version 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.330
 including those who want the normal version 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.030
 this is the 64 bit here is the links 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.910
 according to the description then the 64 bit 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.430
 this is where you download it here 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.840
 are cramps had uploaded a file 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.729
 after when you are in the process of 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.919
 download you go to the computer 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.330
 open you go in to uninstall at 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.110
 change a game program remonstrated 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.400
 uninstall or modify a program 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.960
 there you are looking for java and you 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.360
 uninstall you click on it or done 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.610
 to install like this and after 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.020
 normally when the 64 bit java will be 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.300
 installed there will only be him and 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.650
 minecraft already much better market 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.800
 I hope to have helped you have 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.120
 enlightened having to have improved your 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.460
 minecraft game conditions 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:25.990
 we say maybe, but I hope to 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.990
 soon on my channel here is the test
