the name of the Father the Son and the
Holy<00:06:51.060> Spirit<00:06:51.720> so<00:06:52.139> if<00:06:52.650> they<00:06:53.010> have<00:06:53.130> had<00:06:53.310> that

Holy Spirit so if they have had that

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.240 
Holy Spirit so if they have had that
baptism<00:06:53.840> they<00:06:54.840> must<00:06:55.260> have<00:06:55.470> heard<00:06:55.740> of<00:06:55.980> the<00:06:56.070> Holy

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
that is on Christ Jesus so Paul said

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.980 
that is on Christ Jesus so Paul said
that<00:07:19.680> was<00:07:19.889> a<00:07:19.919> preparatory<00:07:20.669> baptism<00:07:21.270> but<00:07:21.810> now

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
that was a preparatory baptism but now

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.350 
that was a preparatory baptism but now
that<00:07:22.229> Jesus<00:07:22.590> has<00:07:22.770> come<00:07:23.070> died<00:07:23.490> and<00:07:23.760> risen<00:07:23.910> again

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
that Jesus has come died and risen again

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.700 
that Jesus has come died and risen again
it's<00:07:25.169> not<00:07:25.470> any<00:07:25.830> longer<00:07:26.100> sufficient<00:07:27.380> so<00:07:28.380> this

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
it's not any longer sufficient so this

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.300 
it's not any longer sufficient so this
in<00:07:29.130> verse<00:07:29.400> 5<00:07:29.700> when<00:07:30.540> they<00:07:30.690> heard<00:07:30.960> this<00:07:31.229> they
