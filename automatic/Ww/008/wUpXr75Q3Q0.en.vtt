 check it out 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.070
 and today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.000
 very easy which is a closed pot 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.980
 pressure 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.689
 if you like then click down 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.590
 Saying that you liked it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.040
 Let's go and I'll leave it ready here or 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.590
 less than half a pound of hake fillet 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.950
 which has been seasoned with garlic a little bit 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.010
 fresh red pepper salt and thyme 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 mincemeat here a chopped onion in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 slice a tomato without seed into slices 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 a little yellow pepper gives more - 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.239
 environment as big as metal 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.090
 red pepper is also large and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.439
 potatoes applied so as to cover two 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.960
 small potatoes 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.420
 I also added a little area here to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 There are more people coming from 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.369
 coconut and this weird mix that is half 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.860
 cup of white wine do not dolce people 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.549
 with a tablespoon of flour 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 mix well served wheat ta that 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 people are going to do it now 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.520
 everything inside the pressure cooker 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 state 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.430
 put pressure on you five 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.500
 a little more or less because 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.920
 obviously this Portuguese sea is well 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.200
 thin okay if it were a cation also makes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.150
 with which action could be left 17 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.979
 minutes more or less but like ours 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.479
 It's very thin 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.280
 we will leave less time wasted 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.170
 the rubbers and then took a pan 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.729
 pressure here will start with the cause 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.470
 a bed a little of every thing is a 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.870
 I did not go out, I did not go 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.010
 the liquids we were going to plate 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.250
 cut 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.570
 it's good 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:17.930
 well, a good amount to be well 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.840
 distributed because after the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.640
 knack you're here you can be if 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.910
 does not have Serbian freshness in 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.010
 pressure cooker even good I made a bed 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.290
 with the first ingredients 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.820
 now this is a bed of fish 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.440
 now I'll put it back a little bit more 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.630
 from here 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.630
 so we will have new layers 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.270
 tomato does not scare the lack of water 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.610
 of the recipe everything that is here will end 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.310
 missing link will not burn do not 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.510
 you put water is very likely to 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.810
 be very liquid make a good broth 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.980
 Wait to invest the hot pepper 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.230
 that will stay 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:14.019
 if we put only wine with the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.160
 flour and coconut milk then're okay there 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.989
 They're going to have to put in a little more salt 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.840
 because those ingredients that you touched 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.000
 now not as previously tempered but 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.760
 if you want it may already time too 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.080
 God that I do it to be more 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:39.140
 practical yet there's a salt 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:44.450
 now is the white wine with the spoon 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:47.570
 wheat flour soup and here the milk 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.840
 coconut in the brand of your choice 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:55.810
 O my then there a shake line 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.810
 basic and back 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.489
 รณ the time of divine lord cooking is 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.560
 that 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.810
 You will count 15 minutes when the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.940
 pressure cooker is sub- year even 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.150
 after the pressure cooker has 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.729
 uploaded a lot 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.650
 then you know you got the pressure and 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.049
 It's time for you to start counting the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.550
 five minutes after they pick up 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.410
 This pressure is five minutes 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.789
 cook we will hang up and leave there 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.600
 Of course if you are in a hurry you do not have 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.910
 problem arises in the sink takes the pressure 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.560
 It's okay, but if you did not let it go. 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.630
 rest with the pressure inside 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.490
 leave a little more than 16 thousand little saints 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.750
 so to ensure that everything is well 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.389
 coming 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.650
 so now we just wait and then I 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.370
 I will open the pressure cooker to 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.370
 show you 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.410
 good now we called cinnamon 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.410
 pressure to be totally the 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:15.270
 we're going to open it, too. 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:18.120
 That made him suck hard yet. 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.669
 right now is to have any post I will 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.370
 put there in that ingredients bowls 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.460
 So that we can see right as it was 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.680
 the texture 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:38.150
 then you can see that the potato has 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:38.150
 point right tinho she had cooked right 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:46.620
 still half of the old gent 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.630
 If you do not like it, you want to do it. 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.849
 more Grossinho is easy just let one 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.120
 a little more accurate in the lining 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.569
 it will arrive okay to take a little piece 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.629
 of fish 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:07.860
