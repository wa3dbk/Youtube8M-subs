ankle over here and the foot could looks
like<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:11.069> back<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.489> forth<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> don't

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
like a go back and forth but I don't

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
like a go back and forth but I don't
want<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.209> force<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.599> though

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
want to force it though

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.040 
want to force it though
and<00:02:14.330> everything<00:02:15.330> else<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.540> pretty<00:02:15.750> good<00:02:15.840> too

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and everything else is pretty good too

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.170 
and everything else is pretty good too
so<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.290> don't<00:02:16.410> really<00:02:16.500> need<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.940> louder<00:02:17.940> than

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
so they don't really need it louder than

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.680 
so they don't really need it louder than
that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.590
