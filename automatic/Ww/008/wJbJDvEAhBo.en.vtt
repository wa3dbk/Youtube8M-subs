differences<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.670> embrace<00:02:14.420> those

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
differences and to embrace those

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.660 
differences and to embrace those
differences<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.590> not<00:02:15.770> be<00:02:15.950> crippled<00:02:16.370> by<00:02:16.490> any

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
differences and not be crippled by any

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.000 
differences and not be crippled by any
sense<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.090> fear<00:02:17.330> about<00:02:17.600> them<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.170> think<00:02:18.890> there

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
sense of fear about them I think there

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.350 
sense of fear about them I think there
are<00:02:19.100> some<00:02:19.220> good<00:02:19.400> lessons<00:02:19.580> for<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.090> us<00:02:20.180> in

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
are some good lessons for all of us in

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.800 
are some good lessons for all of us in
life<00:02:20.569> about<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.110> don't<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:23.209> yeah<00:02:23.420> it's<00:02:23.720> a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
life about that don't you so yeah it's a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.540 
life about that don't you so yeah it's a
really<00:02:23.989> cool<00:02:24.230> book<00:02:24.440> if<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.160> don't<00:02:25.370> say<00:02:25.519> so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
really cool book if I don't say so

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.270 
really cool book if I don't say so
myself

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
myself

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.520 
myself
and<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.459> think<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.760> provides<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.450> platform<00:02:28.080> for

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and I think it provides a platform for

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
and I think it provides a platform for
teachers<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.730> children<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.360> schools<00:02:30.959> right

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
teachers and children in schools right

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
teachers and children in schools right
across<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.560> country<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.190> fact<00:02:32.430> right

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
across the country and in fact right

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.120 
across the country and in fact right
across<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.750> world<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.140> know<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.980> have

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
across the world you know just to have

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.340 
across the world you know just to have
conversations<00:02:35.819> about<00:02:35.940> our<00:02:36.360> similarities<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
conversations about our similarities and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.750 
conversations about our similarities and
our<00:02:37.500> differences<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.510> enables<00:02:39.959> us<00:02:40.080> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
our differences and it enables us to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.220 
our differences and it enables us to
think<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:41.819> times<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.780> might<00:02:42.959> be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
think about times when we might be

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.500 
think about times when we might be
crippled<00:02:44.220> by<00:02:44.340> our<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.760> fear<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:45.270> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
crippled by our and fear about the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.210 
crippled by our and fear about the
differences<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:48.239> how

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
differences that we have and just how

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.220 
differences that we have and just how
liberated<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.370> can<00:02:50.580> be<00:02:50.850> as<00:02:51.150> an<00:02:51.420> individual<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
liberated we can be as an individual and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.710 
liberated we can be as an individual and
as<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.440> society<00:02:52.890> when<00:02:53.670> we<00:02:53.790> get<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> realizing

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
as a society when we get to realizing

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.600 
as a society when we get to realizing
that<00:02:54.900> differences<00:02:55.770> are<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.069> something<00:02:56.489> that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
that differences are not something that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.910 
that differences are not something that
we<00:02:56.730> should<00:02:56.910> fear<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.810> that's<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.200> dingoes<00:02:58.739> are
