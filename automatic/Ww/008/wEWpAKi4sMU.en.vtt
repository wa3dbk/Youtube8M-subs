00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Printed Circuit Boards, Front Panel Engraving, Plastic &amp; Metal Parts 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.500
 2D and 3D milled parts 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.500
 All this can be done on a milling machine 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.100
 Technodrill. 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.400
 CNC milling machine Technodrill works in 3 3D axes. 

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:16.798
 Works with quality software 

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:19.998
 all common industrial formats like 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.700
 PGL, XO, Excelon, Mixilon, EXOD, DXF, etc. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.500
 The precision mechanism allows precise spindle guidance in space. 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.200
 This provides a useful workspace. 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400
 The Z axis is programmable up to 73 mm. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.200
 The dimensions of the desktop are 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.900
 290 x 340 mm 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.900
 Thanks to the "Tungsten" mechanisms used 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 you achieve high accuracy and repeatability. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.000
 The spindle is able to work with milling machines and drills from 0.2 mm. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 and speeds of 10,000 to 29,000 rpm 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.900
 With these parameters 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.300
 you can handle depanelization 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.100
 and milling any PCB shapes. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.400
 With 800W spindle supplied as standard 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.700
 you can produce printed circuit boards 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.400
 directly by engraving up to class 5 using appropriate tools. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.300
 Technodrill accepts most graphics formats by default. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.500
 You can use fine surface milling tools 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.800
 thanks to a surface sensor that is in the base assembly. 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 The sensor detects the surfaces and corrects the Z axis for the materials being machined 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.600
 and provides ideal surface and real-time milling correction. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.066
 For greater comfort, Technodrill 2 can be equipped with a pneumatic spindle 

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.566
 controlling the automatic exchanger 

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:07.066
 5 tools. 

00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:12.666
 The operator can easily add more accessories to Technodrill. 

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:26.266
 Technodrill can also be a dispensing head, 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.566
 for dosing pastes, adhesives and sealants. 

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:40.766
 All this is standard 

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:41.966
 Gaalad software 

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:47.366
 or, thanks to imported CAD, you can create a 

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:50.966
 engrave any labels, logos, etc. 

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:56.366
 You can also use a cutting knife instead of a spindle 

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:59.966
 and process flexible materials such as plastics, textiles, etc. 

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:06.566
 CAD data can be used for cutting. 

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:16.266
 An optional accessory is a vacuum plate 

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:20.166
 for easy attachment 

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.966
 PCB or flexible materials. 

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:27.766
 Basic kit (starter kit) for milling 

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:32.466
 The first steps of the CNC milling machine will help you. 

00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:35.137
 Using the CNC milling machine Technodrill 

00:03:35.358 --> 00:03:36.396
 - Milling DPS motifs 

00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:37.696
 - Engraving panels 

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:38.958
 - Machining of plastics including 3D 

00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:40.258
 - Soft metal machining 3D 

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:41.509
 - Cutting plastic, leather, flexi PCB 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:42.803
