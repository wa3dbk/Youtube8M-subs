impressed today the crew got up ready to
work<00:02:01.100> they<00:02:02.100> clearly<00:02:02.460> were<00:02:02.670> were

work they clearly were were
were<00:02:04.310> well-trained<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.180> go<00:02:05.270> out<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.510> do

were well-trained to go out and do
things<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:06.020> they<00:02:06.350> pulled<00:02:06.560> out<00:02:06.680> their<00:02:06.830> PDRs<00:02:07.490> and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
things we they pulled out their PDRs and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.100 
things we they pulled out their PDRs and
we<00:02:07.820> got<00:02:07.970> right<00:02:08.149> into<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.450> complex<00:02:08.869> set<00:02:09.080> of

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
we got right into a complex set of

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.420 
we got right into a complex set of
procedures<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.800> they<00:02:10.100> had<00:02:10.190> never<00:02:10.310> seen

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
procedures that they had never seen

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
never would have known it it was just as

couple of days well I'll tell you I've
been<00:03:14.810> flying<00:03:14.989> these<00:03:15.200> shuttles<00:03:15.410> for<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:17.030> long

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
as we can find shuttles and it's not

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.610 
as we can find shuttles and it's not
uncommon<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.850> see<00:03:19.940> little<00:03:20.360> bits<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.780> pieces<00:03:21.380> of

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
uncommon to see little bits of pieces of

things<00:03:21.830> floating<00:03:22.400> out<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.580> lot<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.940> times<00:03:23.090> ice<00:03:23.390> a

things floating out a lot of times ice a

things floating out a lot of times ice a
lot<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.810> times<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.200> little<00:03:24.410> piece<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.560> lint

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
lot of times it's a little piece of lint

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.280 
lot of times it's a little piece of lint
it's<00:03:25.760> amazing<00:03:26.239> how<00:03:26.360> something<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:27.019> bright

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
it's amazing how something in bright

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.650 
it's amazing how something in bright
sunlight<00:03:27.650> can<00:03:28.640> look<00:03:28.880> much<00:03:29.090> bigger<00:03:29.360> than<00:03:29.600> it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
sunlight can look much bigger than it

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.949 
sunlight can look much bigger than it
really<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.880> it's<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.390> very<00:03:32.510> hard<00:03:32.900> to

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
really is so it's it's very hard to

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.050 
really is so it's it's very hard to
identify<00:03:33.590> what<00:03:34.160> those<00:03:34.310> little<00:03:34.549> things<00:03:34.820> might

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
identify what those little things might

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.270 
identify what those little things might
be<00:03:35.330> I<00:03:35.570> would<00:03:36.320> say<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:36.620> not<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.799> particularly

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
be I would say it's not a particularly

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.830 
be I would say it's not a particularly
uncommon<00:03:37.880> thing<00:03:38.060> when<00:03:38.180> you're<00:03:38.330> concentrating

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
uncommon thing when you're concentrating

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.470 
uncommon thing when you're concentrating

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
actuators are back on the wing so you

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.129 
actuators are back on the wing so you
know<00:05:26.729> we<00:05:26.880> are<00:05:27.000> shaking<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.479> vehicle<00:05:27.840> up<00:05:27.960> and

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
know we are shaking the vehicle up and

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.439 
know we are shaking the vehicle up and
perhaps<00:05:28.440> you<00:05:28.949> know<00:05:29.070> after<00:05:29.550> I've<00:05:29.789> stuck<00:05:30.150> out<00:05:30.300> we

perhaps you know after I've stuck out we

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.529 
perhaps you know after I've stuck out we
knock<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.349> few<00:05:31.650> things<00:05:31.889> at<00:05:32.099> payload<00:05:32.759> Bay<00:05:35.539> we'll

knock a few things at payload Bay we'll

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:37.969 
knock a few things at payload Bay we'll

go to the Kennedy Space Center now I

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:44.950 
go to the Kennedy Space Center now I
said<00:05:38.460> we<00:05:38.520> have<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.669> couple<00:05:38.849> of<00:05:38.970> questions<00:05:39.389> there

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
could that have been the co-orbiting

object that we saw yesterday and for
Paul<00:06:00.199> have<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:00.680> any<00:06:00.979> idea<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.759> number<00:06:01.940> of

Paul have you any idea the number of

red is currently tracking

red is currently tracking
let's<00:06:07.280> see<00:06:07.430> I'll<00:06:07.520> start<00:06:07.789> with<00:06:07.940> what<00:06:08.479> the<00:06:08.509> first

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
let's see I'll start with what the first

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.680 
let's see I'll start with what the first
question<00:06:09.789> you<00:06:10.789> know<00:06:10.910> that<00:06:11.180> that's<00:06:11.389> one<00:06:11.569> of<00:06:11.630> the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
question you know that that's one of the

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.480 
question you know that that's one of the
things<00:06:11.870> we're<00:06:12.020> looking<00:06:12.259> at<00:06:12.380> right<00:06:12.530> now<00:06:12.590> and

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
things we're looking at right now and

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.850 
things we're looking at right now and
the<00:06:13.819> object<00:06:14.150> that<00:06:14.509> that<00:06:15.410> we<00:06:15.530> had<00:06:15.680> yesterday

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
the object that that we had yesterday

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.469 
the object that that we had yesterday
you<00:06:16.130> know<00:06:16.220> we're<00:06:16.460> making<00:06:16.729> estimates<00:06:17.240> of<00:06:17.360> how

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
you know we're making estimates of how

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.510 
you know we're making estimates of how
big<00:06:17.720> that<00:06:18.050> object<00:06:18.680> was<00:06:18.800> unfortunately<00:06:19.460> we

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
big that object was unfortunately we

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.490 
big that object was unfortunately we
didn't<00:06:19.729> have<00:06:19.849> a<00:06:19.880> good<00:06:20.090> range<00:06:20.690> measurement<00:06:21.289> so

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
didn't have a good range measurement so

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.890 
didn't have a good range measurement so
it's<00:06:22.370> very<00:06:22.550> hard<00:06:22.849> to<00:06:22.940> figure<00:06:23.090> out<00:06:23.240> exactly<00:06:23.330> how

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
it's very hard to figure out exactly how

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.930 
it's very hard to figure out exactly how
big<00:06:24.320> that<00:06:24.590> that<00:06:24.979> object<00:06:25.160> was<00:06:25.460> that<00:06:25.639> we<00:06:25.759> saw

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
big that that object was that we saw

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.260 
big that that object was that we saw
with<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.180> with<00:06:26.570> the<00:06:26.660> cameras<00:06:27.110> so<00:06:27.380> so

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
with the with the cameras so so

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.550 
with the with the cameras so so
certainly<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:29.389> is<00:06:29.509> possible<00:06:29.570> if<00:06:30.139> it's<00:06:30.259> a<00:06:30.349> shim

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
certainly it is possible if it's a shim

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.760 
certainly it is possible if it's a shim
stock<00:06:31.360> but<00:06:32.360> it's<00:06:32.479> not<00:06:32.630> a<00:06:32.660> one<00:06:33.050> per<00:06:33.590> one

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
stock but it's not a one per one

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.290 
stock but it's not a one per one
correlation<00:06:34.400> right<00:06:34.550> now<00:06:34.729> because<00:06:34.970> we<00:06:35.180> just

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
correlation right now because we just

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.969 
correlation right now because we just
don't<00:06:35.509> know<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.810> size<00:06:36.050> of<00:06:36.229> that<00:06:36.320> object<00:06:36.530> so

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
don't know the size of that object so

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.670 
don't know the size of that object so
it's<00:06:37.550> a<00:06:37.639> possibility<00:06:38.110> but<00:06:39.110> we're<00:06:39.289> taking<00:06:39.409> it

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
it's a possibility but we're taking it

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.439 
it's a possibility but we're taking it
one<00:06:39.800> step<00:06:40.009> further<00:06:40.280> and<00:06:40.639> doing<00:06:41.360> the

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
one step further and doing the

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:42.850 
one step further and doing the
inspections<00:06:41.930> today<00:06:42.050> that<00:06:42.349> make<00:06:42.470> sure<00:06:42.650> that

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
inspections today that make sure that

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.379 
inspections today that make sure that
there's<00:06:43.099> no<00:06:43.280> other<00:06:43.460> critical<00:06:43.880> piece<00:06:44.090> that

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
there's no other critical piece that

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.809 
there's no other critical piece that
we've<00:06:44.750> lost<00:06:44.990> and<00:06:45.380> I'll<00:06:46.009> let<00:06:46.159> Paul<00:06:46.370> into<00:06:46.729> the

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
we've lost and I'll let Paul into the

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.230 
we've lost and I'll let Paul into the
number<00:06:47.060> of<00:06:47.090> objects<00:06:48.880> thanks<00:06:49.880> Steve<00:06:50.060> you're

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
number of objects thanks Steve you're

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.649 
number of objects thanks Steve you're
the<00:06:50.360> X<00:06:50.479> photo<00:06:50.800> I<00:06:51.800> think<00:06:52.490> the<00:06:52.849> the<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:53.120> NORAD

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659 
the X photo I think the the the NORAD

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.270 
the X photo I think the the the NORAD
catalogue<00:06:54.139> is<00:06:54.259> somewhere<00:06:54.530> around<00:06:54.650> 8,000

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
catalogue is somewhere around 8,000

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.029 
catalogue is somewhere around 8,000
objects<00:06:55.729> that<00:06:55.880> they<00:06:56.030> track<00:06:56.300> but<00:06:56.710> that<00:06:57.710> number

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
objects that they track but that number

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.420 
objects that they track but that number
goes<00:06:58.610> up<00:06:58.639> and<00:06:59.000> down<00:06:59.560> frequently<00:07:00.560> and<00:07:00.770> and<00:07:01.039> I

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
goes up and down frequently and and I

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.100 
goes up and down frequently and and I
could<00:07:01.729> be<00:07:01.909> remembering<00:07:02.330> last<00:07:02.509> year's<00:07:02.780> number

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
could be remembering last year's number

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.639 
could be remembering last year's number
so<00:07:03.320> it's<00:07:03.979> in<00:07:04.099> the<00:07:04.219> thousands
