 Turkson he has his limits then but when the are reached 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.169
 not binding 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.919
 weeps 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.980
 Well done when in custody with the vehicles 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.140
 could do more Stendal what a team could cleverly use that 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.230
 Is that possible 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.619
 Yes 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 s imagine a room 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.290
 in all use 24 hours a day 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 a living room 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.410
 to make a game 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 Above all else, it should be easy 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.769
 when when we use the place here 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.769
 It can also be a bedroom side what to expect 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.600
 stackable stool 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 Drawers roll up a bed at dizzy heights 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.150
 Clever ideas can make little room for something great 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.940
 everyone has something 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.810
 it's about maximizing space and being creative with it 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.960
 4 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.770
 Let's just be creative with a room like this 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.880
 Do you really wake up a sofa in the living room? 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.930
 what if we try something different 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.000
 b 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.120
 Look here is just a whole wall for storage 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.979
 and a cuddly nest branches now everyone can do what he wants 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.979
 at the same time and together 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.010
 and being together is a good thing or 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.420
 Let's just try something different 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.410
 here we have six friends then push them together why would have 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.160
 Not 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.820
 with guitars data volume for privacy at a great 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 a common table where everyone can gather together can work 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.649
 epd 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.420
 and to use the available space optimally and had to be open 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.180
 and a few minor little ideas are about concealed space 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.930
 find and use and pick furniture for many things 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.689
 own 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.699
 and it works the Guardia Civil or little space you have 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.049
 you should not give up your dreams you make the little h 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:47.959
 it's about making more space more than they can possibly imagine 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.699
 and it's not about waiting for that to happen today 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.449
 a dreamlike home does not have to be big but 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.819
 Dennis funny if you think carefully 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.020
 the space after allowing it all the time is right here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.290
 and what about the whole time
