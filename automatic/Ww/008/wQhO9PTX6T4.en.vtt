from way back when of course I didn't
know<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.490> was<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> classic<00:00:12.000> from<00:00:12.120> way<00:00:12.269> back<00:00:12.420> when

I<00:00:12.720> was<00:00:12.750> from<00:00:13.019> out<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.260> country<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.160> had

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
I was from out of the country so we had

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.589 
I was from out of the country so we had
to<00:00:14.460> go<00:00:14.550> back<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> whole<00:00:15.360> lot<00:00:15.570> of

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
to go back in and do a whole lot of

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.319 
to go back in and do a whole lot of
research<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.290> how<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.400> originally<00:00:18.060> done

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:18.329 
research on how it was originally done

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.870 
research on how it was originally done
what<00:00:18.840> materials<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.500> were<00:00:19.560> using<00:00:19.919> how<00:00:20.669> they

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
what materials they were using how they

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.030 
what materials they were using how they
shot<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.329> all<00:00:21.540> what<00:00:22.020> camera<00:00:22.200> angles<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:22.800> did

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
shot at all what camera angles they did

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.819 
shot at all what camera angles they did
the<00:00:23.550> style<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.000> animation<00:00:24.149> and<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.470> even

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
the style of animation and you know even

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.440 
the style of animation and you know even
just<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.279> right<00:00:26.700> down<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.029> sort<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> how

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
just the way right down to sort of how

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.150 
just the way right down to sort of how
the<00:00:27.509> puppets<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.020> even<00:00:28.259> built<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.950> that

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the puppets are even built because that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.249 
the puppets are even built because that
seemed<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.489> have<00:00:29.640> quite<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> big<00:00:30.119> factor<00:00:30.540> on<00:00:30.660> how

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
seemed to have quite a big factor on how

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.189 
seemed to have quite a big factor on how
they<00:00:31.500> moved<00:00:31.770> they<00:00:32.759> plotted<00:00:33.210> around<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:34.079> was

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
they moved they plotted around it was

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.619 
they moved they plotted around it was
exciting<00:00:34.679> stuff<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:36.000> commercials<00:00:36.480> we

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
exciting stuff when we do commercials we

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.720 
exciting stuff when we do commercials we
generally<00:00:37.350> shoot<00:00:37.590> things<00:00:37.859> in<00:00:38.039> probably<00:00:38.489> four

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
generally shoot things in probably four

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.669 
generally shoot things in probably four
or<00:00:38.760> five<00:00:38.850> separate<00:00:39.390> elements<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.019> then<00:00:40.140> bring

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
or five separate elements and then bring

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.299 
or five separate elements and then bring
them<00:00:40.769> all<00:00:40.920> back<00:00:40.949> together<00:00:41.640> again<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.089> post<00:00:42.449> in

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309

Miller<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.730> don't<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.030> any<00:00:48.269> of<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
Miller we don't do any of that it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.770 
Miller we don't do any of that it's
pretty<00:00:49.800> much<00:00:49.890> exactly<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.600> done

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
pretty much exactly as the it was done

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.509 
pretty much exactly as the it was done
originally<00:00:51.989> we're<00:00:52.530> shooting<00:00:52.859> it<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.190> film

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
and if there's any rigging that needs

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
and if there's any rigging that needs
removing<00:00:56.249> or<00:00:56.640> anything<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.420> gets

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
removing or anything that it just gets

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.649 
removing or anything that it just gets
taken<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.170> again<00:00:58.620> digitally<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.429> an<00:01:00.300> animator

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
taken out again digitally as an animator

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.479 
taken out again digitally as an animator
I<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:01.170> don't<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.499> involved<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.159> model

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I really don't get involved in the model

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
I really don't get involved in the model
building<00:01:03.179> process<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.050> go<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> talk<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so in these old animated series they're

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.709 
so in these old animated series they're
kept<00:01:29.040> things<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.640> simple<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.360> stuff<00:01:30.630> like

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
kept things really simple so stuff like

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:31.940 
kept things really simple so stuff like
the<00:01:30.930> fact<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> mouth
