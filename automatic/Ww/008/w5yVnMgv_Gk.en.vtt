00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.340
 well that's exactly where his place is 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.590
 party for new video with elia 3 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.930
 chips ram the combos possible finally 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.360
 the moment the pork combo I'm coming 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.030
 to find you are ready 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.530
 to be his clique applies to the same we have 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.350
 so two trap networks one has a 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.290
 portal that is here buried and another 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.540
 here and if my calculations are good if I 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.219
 have not messed up chances are they 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.570
 be very very violent attention the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.760
 eyes that triggered everything and damaged 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.900
 more animation it all started and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.610
 it smashes and push 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.770
 what do I like that oh it's 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.870
 beautiful it's beautiful it's l'ia 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.430
 truck bus tram 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.110
 good will put the replay I will 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.000
 would like to explain in othe putsch but 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.070
 basically I made a network a place 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.559
 a network completely nothing to see a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 another place completely nothing to see 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 but thanks to the portal that teleports 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.670
 can trigger both and do it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 a one shot 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.440
 it's huge reacted it's dangerous 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.750
 one without the other we learned the push 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.640
 for you go back that so it will be a 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.590
 pediatrician objects making packages seems 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.049
 it's going to be huge month he moderates them 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.250
 deacons hop I wanted to test r because 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830
 that gives and thrown to his I tested 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.960
 all the elements are good to see that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 but the confused sram can the trap 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.979
 guys and it's going to be the same for 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.690
 rogue for a lot of combos for 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.350
 as you said six cooperation 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.670
 lesson hours 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.400
 it's really healthy to quote 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.140
 carry with its huge there the network 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 you can do something crazy 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.840
 takes time certainly good after it's 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.030
 well funny is that the beginning we go 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 find iron and we will find 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.400
 property better way to improve 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.250
 it's good and everything but there already 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.570
 what am I going to make a copy we will get 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.880
 find for the explanation to the putsch 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.350
 it's gone for the putsch so it's 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.460
 not very complicated in any case of what 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.990
 I found me now as you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.280
 say see a lot of changes what 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.810
 I think there is much better to do and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.189
 all but there that I have found already 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.659
 it's not very complicated so I'm going 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.650
 do not do something as big as anything to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.189
 now we'll just but soon it 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.159
 the principle 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.750
 so we'll put a portal sees the 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.580
 metro and we go the metro here it's very 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.190
 well I will put next 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.600
 another round and there you can put 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.420
 traps in fact simply on 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.470
 that one 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.090
 no need to put a game not in 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.800
 subway just has a few around 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.430
 because I do not know if they have any 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.720
 do the trick 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.510
 look i like to be the most doors 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.500
 and we'll put it where the thing is 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.660
 that now that she 's portal and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.070
 as soon as the trigger to the coup sua 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.110
 of gates he goes direct and carry them 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.190
 so if you put looting of 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.510
 network in fact it's not going all the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.250
 trigger it will trigger that those who 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.420
 are roughly adjacent those who are going 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.520
 to be triggered that on this box there 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.780
 what about the portal box I have not 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.590
 if you follow me but you understand 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.880
 I think I will not give too much and 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.990
 on the other hand it deprives to teleport there 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.030
 where he is rising above one 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.110
 will make the biggest network down there 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.190
 we're going to put traps but it's not 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.540
 there that with the most violent actually 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.760
 but we can still be pretty good 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.160
 huh there down we can already put 5 6 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.880
 mass trap three sneaky snares a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.280
 deadly 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.230
 so it's already a lot I 'm going 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.220
 maybe not everything possible but nothing is 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.680
 will still end up with a little 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.820
 mortality a little place here and this is where 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 high especially that it becomes interesting 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.060
 this is where you start you can 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.140
 make a network but a network like 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.490
 usually another one as usual 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.050
 just have to tell you that the point 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.730
 entry will be here where there is the portal of 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.760
 blow it's going to trigger everything and it's going to be 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.620
 very violent 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.959
 it's going to be very very violent then 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.730
 moved back to 3 for now I pass have 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.510
 weighed it's patrice is not that sure 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.250
 in fact to put in place 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.780
 finally the two portals it's really 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.580
 ultra simple after the network will take 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.780
 of time again men you have not 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.070
 need to find someone a single 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.200
 nobody to put so many traps 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.580
 this is just to make my guy who 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 often crunch more for men 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.810
 you can have booster all 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.360
 new ready to do that faster 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.820
 so we'll put that there ok he can in 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.080
 put another here not put too much 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.880
 too much but we can see you but 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.410
 others there but now you do you 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.360
 make a basic bird a lao year like 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.300
 you're used to doing to me 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.340
 will leave even duquette it's the way 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.110
 which I found are better in gip 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.320
 maybe not better but other ways 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.780
 to do it here I tend subway you go 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.580
 see that if I'm not mistaken by 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.830
 logic we will explain a little 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.690
 so what are you gonna do 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.040
 I pushed the putsch here I think 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.359
 yes the orange box we will trigger 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.140
 to all the traps here because they are 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.700
 all on the same box 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.650
 all the hot dishes in fights on the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.669
 cash caspar so that's all done in 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.430
 oak are already busy a lot of 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.740
 damages 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.600
 then it's going to teleport all up there 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.410
 is there low it's gone again for the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.660
 second network of traps 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.949
 okay so let's go for the launch I 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.090
 will triggered that a trap could have if 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.610
 I do not think it's all that 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.199
 normally it should be good flat 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.220
 and so you want to listen to everything 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.620
 which is down since all that is in 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.860
 up up there he goes up in water and you 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.130
 it triggered everything is huge and it 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.550
 hurts the damage 6300 that makes 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.229
 it's 8000 cold to 8000 damage in nine 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.840
 tours and again I have not optimized because 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.759
 that I showed it's really ultra 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.050
 violent and then it's not rock 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.070
 do not change my mind that I just dance 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.930
 the placement the hands to do some 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.960
 crazy combos I do not know what that 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.009
 gives with more portal still no that 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.740
 would not have changed much that if 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.180
 I go in that one that teleport me 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.440
 in the bottom one and if I have him 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.220
 then to the sahel m or in addition to the bottom 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.949
 indecisive I go there what does it matter to me 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.020
 do absolutely nothing down there so see 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.550
 a way to do crazy things what we 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.080
 see there a little quick video I think 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.160
 no longer like it on there 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.199
 will have other videos explanation I 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.690
 think to make networks with 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.729
 eliatropes bus tram because I have 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.349
 want to test that it's cool cool 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.699
 cool cool cool 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.889
 there will be quizzes are stuff 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.990
 like that it is certain and certain 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.810
 it's huge this little combo so a 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.360
 little quick video with pingu faith and 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.909
 faïza can finally pingu the iliad 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.490
 the heliotrope forgiveness and it can go to 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:50.870
 his benchtop and lexus the tram like 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.790
 usually so here I am really 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.070
 pleased with them 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.440
 what can be done with heliotrope 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.540
 more ram a little quick multi combo 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.490
 preview but it promises because here it is 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.690
 just the beginning I found that in two 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.950
 seconds to do was not even found 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.510
 it's just that I thought about it directly and 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.950
 that portals and suddenly I tested 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.170
 is really effective 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.550
 finally effective I do not know if it will be 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.280
 super effective than that but it is this 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.180
 idea it's original c and then even I 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.830
 think there is really a way to do 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.990
 required points with which make the 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.190
 fight finally that will win 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.900
 you can win a fight 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.760
 so it's really not 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.290
 give in light if you liked to do 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.330
 turn the video does not have as usual 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.330
 dubai everyone and all good evening
