we go in on how to do that you guys came
up<00:00:22.519> with<00:00:22.670> a<00:00:22.820> great<00:00:23.300> tip<00:00:23.750> for<00:00:23.960> cleaning<00:00:24.320> pruners

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
up with a great tip for cleaning pruners

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.470 
up with a great tip for cleaning pruners
which<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.130> should<00:00:25.310> do<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.730> lot<00:00:26.060> when<00:00:26.359> you're

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
which you should do a lot when you're

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.870 
which you should do a lot when you're
pruning<00:00:26.720> exactly<00:00:27.590> because<00:00:27.769> it<00:00:27.920> helps<00:00:28.279> from

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
pruning exactly because it helps from

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.320 
pruning exactly because it helps from
transferring<00:00:29.830> pests<00:00:30.830> and<00:00:31.009> disease<00:00:31.640> from<00:00:32.060> rose

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
transferring pests and disease from rose

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.270 
transferring pests and disease from rose
to<00:00:32.599> Rose<00:00:32.810> and<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:33.590> makes<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:33.950> really<00:00:34.160> easy

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
to Rose and so it makes it really easy

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.130 
to Rose and so it makes it really easy
and<00:00:34.610> these<00:00:34.760> wipes<00:00:35.030> are<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:35.450> easy<00:00:35.630> I<00:00:35.780> mean<00:00:35.990> look

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
and these wipes are so easy I mean look

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.390 
and these wipes are so easy I mean look
at<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.290> you<00:00:36.560> don't<00:00:36.710> have<00:00:36.770> to<00:00:36.890> mix<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:37.220> in<00:00:37.280> a

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
at that you don't have to mix it in a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.250 
at that you don't have to mix it in a
bucket<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.090> it's<00:00:38.480> just<00:00:38.690> done<00:00:38.840> right<00:00:39.020> there<00:00:39.140> so

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
bucket and it's just done right there so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.530 
bucket and it's just done right there so
I<00:00:39.290> think<00:00:39.710> that's<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:40.010> right<00:00:40.580> there<00:00:40.820> is<00:00:40.910> amazing

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
I think that's a right there is amazing

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.800 
I think that's a right there is amazing
now<00:00:41.930> that<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.250> pruners<00:00:43.490> are<00:00:43.640> clean<00:00:43.880> how<00:00:44.600> do<00:00:44.660> I

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
and you've probably seen it in many

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.560 
and you've probably seen it in many
Gardens<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:55.310> all<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:55.760> bloom<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.180> way<00:00:56.390> on

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
top yeah that's because those upper most

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.330 
top yeah that's because those upper most
buds<00:00:59.090> secrete<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.630> hormone<00:00:59.720> to<00:01:00.260> inhibit<00:01:00.680> bud

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
buds secrete a hormone to inhibit bud

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.940 
buds secrete a hormone to inhibit bud
formation<00:01:01.910> below<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:02.900> what<00:01:03.200> you<00:01:03.350> want<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.680> do

formation below so what you want to do

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.540 
formation below so what you want to do
with<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.840> climbing<00:01:05.840> rose<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.980> want<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:07.310> run

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
with a climbing rose is you want to run

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.690 
with a climbing rose is you want to run
it<00:01:07.730> a<00:01:07.880> little<00:01:08.150> lateral<00:01:08.480> either<00:01:09.410> out<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:10.250> this

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
it a little lateral either out like this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.470 
it a little lateral either out like this
or<00:01:11.180> like<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.230> depending<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.370> how<00:01:13.640> wide<00:01:13.940> the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
or like this depending on how wide the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.020 
or like this depending on how wide the
structure<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.230> that<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.770> Rose<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.220> on<00:01:16.400> because

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
structure is that the Rose is on because

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.790 
structure is that the Rose is on because
a<00:01:17.060> lot<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.660> people<00:01:17.870> I<00:01:17.930> think<00:01:17.960> get<00:01:18.230> confused<00:01:18.650> too

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
a lot of people I think get confused too

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.680 
a lot of people I think get confused too
when<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.310> read<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> tag<00:01:19.790> that<00:01:19.820> says<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.420> climber

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
when you read a tag that says a climber

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.720 
when you read a tag that says a climber
gets<00:01:20.930> 8<00:01:21.140> foot<00:01:21.350> wide<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.920> lot<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.400> people<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:22.700> think

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
gets 8 foot wide a lot of people I think

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.670 
gets 8 foot wide a lot of people I think
tend<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.780> means<00:01:23.960> 4<00:01:24.170> feet<00:01:24.350> on<00:01:24.470> each<00:01:24.620> side

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
tend that that means 4 feet on each side

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.950 
tend that that means 4 feet on each side
which<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.190> not<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.490> case<00:01:25.640> no<00:01:26.120> not<00:01:26.600> if<00:01:26.810> you're

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
which is not the case no not if you're

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.780 
which is not the case no not if you're
taking<00:01:27.410> those<00:01:27.560> canes<00:01:27.890> from<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.310> base<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.700> the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
taking those canes from the base of the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.899 
taking those canes from the base of the
plant<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.680> so<00:01:30.680> you're<00:01:30.800> looking<00:01:30.890> at<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.130> 16<00:01:31.670> foot

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
plant and so you're looking at a 16 foot

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.030 
plant and so you're looking at a 16 foot
span<00:01:32.150> right<00:01:32.480> so<00:01:32.750> putting<00:01:32.960> 3<00:01:33.350> roses<00:01:33.800> in<00:01:33.950> there

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
span right so putting 3 roses in there

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.430 
span right so putting 3 roses in there
would<00:01:34.190> be<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:34.520> overcrowding<00:01:35.060> right<00:01:35.440> exactly

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
would be just overcrowding right exactly

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.840 
would be just overcrowding right exactly
and<00:01:36.530> then<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.800> don't<00:01:36.980> get<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.220> airflow<00:01:37.640> in

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
and then you don't get the airflow in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.730 
and then you don't get the airflow in
you're<00:01:38.090> inviting<00:01:38.630> disease<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.350> everything

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
you're inviting disease and everything

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.460 
you're inviting disease and everything
so<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.670> just<00:01:40.940> makes<00:01:41.150> it<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.390> lot<00:01:41.570> easier<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.140> do

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
so it just makes it a lot easier to do

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.830 
so it just makes it a lot easier to do
that<00:01:42.650> because<00:01:42.830> what<00:01:43.820> will<00:01:44.000> happen<00:01:44.030> when<00:01:44.690> you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
that because what will happen when you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.410 
that because what will happen when you
run<00:01:45.110> them<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.380> little<00:01:45.770> lateral<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:47.150> you'll

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
run them a little lateral is that you'll

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.710 
run them a little lateral is that you'll
get<00:01:47.750> these<00:01:48.229> what<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:49.070> call<00:01:49.100> breaks<00:01:49.700> or<00:01:50.150> lateral

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
get these what we call breaks or lateral

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.480 
get these what we call breaks or lateral
shoots<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.580> they'll<00:01:52.580> come<00:01:53.030> from<00:01:54.220> there<00:01:55.220> and

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
shoots and they'll come from there and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.570 
shoots and they'll come from there and
they'll<00:01:55.880> form<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.420> cane<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:57.740> cane<00:01:58.100> will<00:01:58.340> have

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
they'll form a cane that cane will have

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.060 
they'll form a cane that cane will have
a<00:01:58.610> bloom<00:01:58.970> on<00:01:59.180> top<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:00.080> you'll<00:02:00.260> have<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.470> wall<00:02:00.830> of

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
a bloom on top so you'll have a wall of

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.310 
a bloom on top so you'll have a wall of
bloom<00:02:01.370> instead<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:02.360> right<00:02:02.630> guitar<00:02:03.020> and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
bloom instead of just right guitar and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.840 
bloom instead of just right guitar and
that<00:02:03.470> makes<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.740> lot<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:03.890> sense<00:02:04.220> now<00:02:04.430> I'm

we say when you play are roses and about
four<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.590> five<00:02:15.620> years<00:02:16.099> what<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.550> want<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.910> do

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
four to five years what you want to do

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.790 
four to five years what you want to do
is<00:02:17.209> start<00:02:17.450> looking<00:02:17.840> for<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.140> older<00:02:18.470> canes

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
is start looking for the older canes

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.830 
is start looking for the older canes
because<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.610> do<00:02:19.760> want<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> limit<00:02:20.480> them<00:02:20.569> to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
because you do want to limit them to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.100 
because you do want to limit them to
like<00:02:21.319> five<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.860> eight<00:02:22.010> canes<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.730> bush<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:24.050> you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
like five to eight canes of bush so you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.199 
like five to eight canes of bush so you
would<00:02:24.500> start<00:02:24.860> taking<00:02:25.160> out<00:02:25.580> some<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:26.090> your

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
would start taking out some of your

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.900 
would start taking out some of your
older<00:02:26.660> kings<00:02:26.959> after<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.010> then<00:02:28.580> it'll

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
older kings after that and then it'll

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.000 
older kings after that and then it'll
encourage<00:02:29.480> more<00:02:29.959> growth<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.739> start

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
encourage more growth and you can start

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.309 
encourage more growth and you can start
all<00:02:31.190> over<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.000> helps<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.660> eliminate

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
all over and that helps to eliminate

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.650 
all over and that helps to eliminate
what<00:02:33.830> we<00:02:33.980> call<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.489> naked<00:02:35.239> knee

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
what we call the naked knee

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.809 
what we call the naked knee
you<00:02:35.840> know<00:02:36.050> yep<00:02:36.650> you're<00:02:36.890> not<00:02:37.040> seeing<00:02:37.459> their

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
think should go out if it was a pruning

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.800 
think should go out if it was a pruning
time<00:02:54.230> situation<00:02:54.730> what<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.760> would<00:02:56.030> probably<00:02:56.209> do

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
time situation what I would probably do

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.430 
time situation what I would probably do
is<00:02:57.610> seeing<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:59.030> these<00:02:59.299> canes<00:02:59.690> over<00:03:00.140> here

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
is seeing that these canes over here

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.289 
is seeing that these canes over here
well<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.890> want<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.220> cut<00:03:01.400> out<00:03:01.430> all<00:03:01.610> your<00:03:02.030> first

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.069 
of all go through and cut out all your
dead<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.370> know<00:03:04.640> kind<00:03:05.269> of<00:03:05.360> what<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.840> that

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
dead so you know kind of what it is that

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.710 
dead so you know kind of what it is that
you're<00:03:06.230> looking<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.829> but<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.510> going

you're looking at but this this is going

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.960 
you're looking at but this this is going
to<00:03:08.810> start<00:03:09.110> having<00:03:09.590> canes<00:03:09.980> come<00:03:10.310> over<00:03:10.549> here<00:03:10.760> so

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
to start having canes come over here so

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.069 
to start having canes come over here so
I<00:03:11.180> would<00:03:11.660> probably<00:03:11.900> take<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:13.280> would<00:03:13.760> take

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
I would probably take I would take

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.350 
I would probably take I would take
