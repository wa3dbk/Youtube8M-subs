00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
like eighth note beats even though they

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
there's notes on all four beats you got

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.780

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
to make sure it lines up exactly with

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.850 
to make sure it lines up exactly with
the<00:03:18.000> click<00:03:18.240> or<00:03:18.420> if<00:03:18.990> you're<00:03:19.350> counting<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.830> loud

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
the click or if you're counting out loud

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.760 
you see I have a bass drum on beats one
and<00:03:23.190> two<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:24.210> then<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.230> snare<00:03:25.530> drum

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770

on beats three and four these quarter

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.030 
on beats three and four these quarter
note<00:03:44.760> beats<00:03:45.060> don't<00:03:45.750> look<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.200> complicated

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
note beats don't look that complicated

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.190 
note beats don't look that complicated
on<00:03:47.190> paper<00:03:47.489> but<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.180> lot<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.540> experienced

at<00:03:51.750> slower<00:03:52.080> tempos<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:53.160> make<00:03:53.370> sure<00:03:53.400> they're

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820
