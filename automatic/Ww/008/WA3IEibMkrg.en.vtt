00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hello I'm going to do a video review

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.300 
hello I'm going to do a video review
today<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.600> hornby<00:00:04.290> West<00:00:04.710> Country<00:00:05.069> class

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
today of the hornby West Country class

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.030 
today of the hornby West Country class
which<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.910> just<00:00:06.120> got<00:00:07.670> here<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:08.820> are<00:00:09.830> this<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:10.889> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
which I just got here we are this is the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.709 
which I just got here we are this is the
temporary<00:00:11.490> little<00:00:11.790> layout<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.210> set<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.599> my

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
temporary little layout I set up on my

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.110 
temporary little layout I set up on my
desk<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.830> run<00:00:14.400> things<00:00:14.610> up<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.940> down

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
desk so I can run things up and down

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.590 
desk so I can run things up and down
it's<00:00:15.570> rather<00:00:15.719> limited<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:17.090> yeah<00:00:18.090> well<00:00:18.359> it's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it's rather limited but yeah well it's

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000 
it's rather limited but yeah well it's
enough<00:00:18.779> attend<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> testing<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.529> loko<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.920> so

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
enough attend to testing a loko and so

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.640 
enough attend to testing a loko and so
on<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> yes<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.359> must<00:00:21.630> say<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
on and yes I must say this is this is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.099 
on and yes I must say this is this is
one<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.800> my<00:00:22.949> favorites<00:00:23.340> yet<00:00:24.109> it's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
one of my favorites yet it's

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.370 
one of my favorites yet it's
surprisingly<00:00:25.769> small<00:00:26.130> actually<00:00:26.699> fought<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
surprisingly small actually fought for a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.359 
surprisingly small actually fought for a
Pacific<00:00:28.380> locomotive<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:28.980> probably<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
Pacific locomotive it's probably one of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.600 
Pacific locomotive it's probably one of
the<00:00:29.490> shortest<00:00:29.929> wheelbases<00:00:30.929> I've<00:00:31.289> seen<00:00:31.610> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the shortest wheelbases I've seen this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
the shortest wheelbases I've seen this
is<00:00:32.790> shorter<00:00:33.239> than<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> maillard<00:00:36.300> type<00:00:36.690> that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
is shorter than the maillard type that

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.340 
is shorter than the maillard type that
the<00:00:37.350> a4<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:39.000> much<00:00:39.690> shorter<00:00:39.719> than<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the a4 and it's much shorter than the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.100 
the a4 and it's much shorter than the
Coronation<00:00:42.710> mean<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.860> comparison<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.430> us

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
Coronation mean in comparison to us

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.869 
Coronation mean in comparison to us
locos<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.600> us<00:00:48.870> steam<00:00:49.140> locomotives

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
locos you at us steam locomotives

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.069 
locos you at us steam locomotives
British<00:00:50.879> ones<00:00:51.059> always<00:00:51.239> look<00:00:51.480> rather<00:00:51.629> quaint

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
British ones always look rather quaint

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
British ones always look rather quaint
and<00:00:52.699> tiny<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:54.480> comparison<00:00:55.070> yes<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and tiny by comparison yes this one is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.549 
and tiny by comparison yes this one is
really<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.109> very<00:00:58.199> nice<00:00:58.559> performer<00:01:00.320> I'll<00:01:01.320> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
really a very nice performer I'll just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
really a very nice performer I'll just
show<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.370> slow<00:01:02.789> running<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.390> like

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
show you what slow running into like

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.000 
show you what slow running into like
I've<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:05.030> standard<00:01:06.030> hornby<00:01:08.600> control<00:01:09.600> box

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
I've got a standard hornby control box

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.800 
I've got a standard hornby control box
which<00:01:11.010> isn't<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.340> good<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:11.850> sort<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.479> fine

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
which isn't very good for sort of fine

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.010 
which isn't very good for sort of fine
control<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> nice<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.150> sort<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
control but you get a nice in sort of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.830 
control but you get a nice in sort of
sensation<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> control<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.689> actual

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
sensation of control with the the actual

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.280 
sensation of control with the the actual
variable<00:01:19.170> resistor<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.170> there

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
variable resistor that you get there

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.440 
variable resistor that you get there
that's<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.740> nice

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.889 

I<00:01:26.539> like<00:01:27.530> about<00:01:27.649> this<00:01:27.770> one<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:28.039> it's<00:01:28.250> got<00:01:28.369> very

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
I like about this one is it's got very

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.169 
I like about this one is it's got very
defined<00:01:31.180> recessed<00:01:32.180> wheels<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.590> here<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.179> all

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
defined recessed wheels in here the all

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.700 
defined recessed wheels in here the all
the<00:01:35.329> little<00:01:35.539> little<00:01:35.869> bits<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.320> then<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.530> can

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the little little bits and then you can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.429 
the little little bits and then you can
breathe<00:01:37.189> they<00:01:37.460> really<00:01:37.700> stand<00:01:37.939> out<00:01:38.179> nicely<00:01:38.479> so

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
breathe they really stand out nicely so

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.880 
breathe they really stand out nicely so
you<00:01:39.530> get<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.679> sense<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.100> movement<00:01:41.799> over<00:01:42.799> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
you get a sense of the movement over the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.039 
you get a sense of the movement over the
wheels<00:01:43.100> they're<00:01:43.509> not<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.750> don't<00:01:44.869> get

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
wheels they're not that you don't get

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.719 
wheels they're not that you don't get
that<00:01:45.110> with<00:01:45.259> other<00:01:45.500> locomotives<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:46.490> course

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
that with other locomotives of course

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.300 
that with other locomotives of course
but<00:01:46.970> I<00:01:47.179> mean<00:01:47.509> with<00:01:48.200> these<00:01:48.380> it's<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.219> a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
but I mean with these it's it's a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.740 
but I mean with these it's it's a
slightly<00:01:49.490> different<00:01:49.789> design<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.270> think<00:01:50.630> than

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
slightly different design I think than

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.899 
slightly different design I think than
the<00:01:50.840> usual<00:01:52.060> sort<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.119> spokes<00:01:53.479> on<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.740> wheel

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
the usual sort of spokes on the wheel

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.679 
the usual sort of spokes on the wheel
anyway<00:01:55.909> yes<00:01:56.210> it's<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.689> very<00:01:56.960> nice<00:01:57.829> locomotive

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
anyway yes it's a very nice locomotive

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.270 
anyway yes it's a very nice locomotive
I'll<00:01:59.689> just<00:01:59.929> show<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.530> what<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.770> really<00:02:01.130> like

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
I'll just show you what I really like

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.080 
I'll just show you what I really like
about<00:02:01.310> this<00:02:01.670> one<00:02:01.880> which<00:02:02.569> is<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.369> air

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
about this one which is that the air

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.389 
about this one which is that the air
streaming<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.229> actually<00:02:06.500> complete<00:02:07.159> it's

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
streaming is not actually complete it's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.309 
streaming is not actually complete it's
actually<00:02:07.670> partially<00:02:07.939> air<00:02:08.329> streamed<00:02:08.750> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.660 

streamlining<00:02:12.319> normally<00:02:13.099> I'll<00:02:13.280> show<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.549> what

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
streamlining normally I'll show you what

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.330 
streamlining normally I'll show you what
a<00:02:13.730> typical<00:02:14.690> streamlined<00:02:15.590> locomotive<00:02:16.130> looks

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
a typical streamlined locomotive looks

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.830 
a typical streamlined locomotive looks
like<00:02:16.519> it's<00:02:16.730> one<00:02:16.849> of<00:02:16.940> these<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.750> a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
like it's one of these this is a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.330 
like it's one of these this is a
carnation<00:02:18.170> class<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.739> see<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.010> goes<00:02:19.160> all

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
carnation class you can see it goes all

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.270 
carnation class you can see it goes all
the<00:02:19.370> way<00:02:19.700> over<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.090> all<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.329> way<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.930> back

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280

no bits of the front at the front of
this<00:02:36.950> one<00:02:37.190> however<00:02:37.459> you've<00:02:37.880> got<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.750> smoke

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
this one however you've got the smoke

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.800

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
box sitting out of the front I think

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.629 
box sitting out of the front I think
maybe<00:02:42.079> they<00:02:42.290> made<00:02:42.470> they<00:02:42.769> meant<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.370> when<00:02:43.489> they

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
maybe they made they meant it when they

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.309 
maybe they made they meant it when they
designed<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.269> put<00:02:44.630> something<00:02:44.989> over<00:02:45.109> the

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
designed this one put something over the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.660 
designed this one put something over the
front<00:02:45.560> here<00:02:45.739> but<00:02:45.920> maybe<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.220> didn't<00:02:46.430> look<00:02:46.489> so

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
front here but maybe it didn't look so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.009 
front here but maybe it didn't look so
good<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:49.190> smoke<00:02:50.150> blocks<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.660> front<00:02:50.870> is

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
good this smoke blocks of the front is

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.569 
good this smoke blocks of the front is
is<00:02:51.290> obviously<00:02:51.620> more<00:02:51.859> accessible<00:02:52.400> than<00:02:52.430> it

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
is obviously more accessible than it

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.120 
is obviously more accessible than it

where you catch the boat over to Calais

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.490 
where you catch the boat over to Calais
get<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> trend<00:03:58.410> Paris<00:03:59.990> which<00:04:00.990> was<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.170> French

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
get a trend Paris which was a French

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.680 
get a trend Paris which was a French
sort<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.220> version<00:04:02.520> of<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.640> same<00:04:02.790> train<00:04:03.060> all

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690

sort of version of the same train all
first<00:04:04.110> class<00:04:04.200> apparently<00:04:04.980> all<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.190> coaches

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.010 
were very very very nicely decorated I
think<00:04:08.850> there's<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.030> couple<00:04:09.180> at<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.390> nrm<00:04:09.840> you

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
think there's a couple at the nrm you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
think there's a couple at the nrm you
might<00:04:10.170> be<00:04:10.290> able<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.580> York<00:04:12.530> yes<00:04:13.530> lots<00:04:13.890> of

and so on you can stick on the front and
you<00:04:27.090> can<00:04:27.270> say<00:04:27.630> all<00:04:27.840> this<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.200> salisbury

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
something like these they could power

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.890 
something like these they could power
drivers<00:04:36.120> in<00:04:36.240> there<00:04:36.390> which<00:04:36.480> is<00:04:36.510> quite<00:04:36.750> nice

interior which they don't do on all
their<00:05:01.200> models<00:05:01.470> but<00:05:01.590> whenever<00:05:01.770> they<00:05:01.979> do<00:05:02.040> it's<00:05:02.280> a

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
their models but whenever they do it's a

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.969 
their models but whenever they do it's a
real<00:05:02.520> treat<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:04.229> looks<00:05:04.470> really<00:05:04.560> nice<00:05:04.919> and

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
real treat that looks really nice and

you<00:05:05.610> can<00:05:05.760> just<00:05:05.970> about<00:05:06.120> see<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.390> as<00:05:06.600> it's<00:05:06.780> going

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
you can just about see it as it's going

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.409 
you can just about see it as it's going
along<00:05:07.790> because<00:05:08.790> there's<00:05:09.030> enough<00:05:09.180> with<00:05:09.300> just

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
along because there's enough with just

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.469 
along because there's enough with just
enough<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.110> gap<00:05:10.140> between<00:05:11.000> as<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.150> can<00:05:12.300> see

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
enough of a gap between as you can see

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.510 
enough of a gap between as you can see
if<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.690> just<00:05:12.840> move<00:05:12.990> these<00:05:13.260> up<00:05:13.470> here<00:05:13.680> just<00:05:14.310> enough

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
if I just move these up here just enough

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.700 
if I just move these up here just enough
of<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.669> gap<00:05:14.700> between<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.270> low<00:05:15.390> contender<00:05:16.080> you

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
of a gap between the low contender you

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.630 
of a gap between the low contender you
can<00:05:16.890> glimpse<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.400> as<00:05:17.550> it's<00:05:17.700> going<00:05:17.880> by<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:19.640> yes

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
can glimpse it as it's going by so yes

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.190 
can glimpse it as it's going by so yes
I've<00:05:20.940> seen<00:05:21.150> some<00:05:21.360> amazing<00:05:21.570> models<00:05:22.020> where

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
I've seen some amazing models where

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.420 
I've seen some amazing models where
people<00:05:22.530> have<00:05:22.770> fully<00:05:23.760> outfitted<00:05:23.970> these<00:05:24.540> with

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
people have fully outfitted these with

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.340 
people have fully outfitted these with
DCC<00:05:26.430> lighting<00:05:26.910> systems<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.630> they've<00:05:28.320> got

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
DCC lighting systems and they've got

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.230 
DCC lighting systems and they've got
each<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.950> these<00:05:29.070> little<00:05:29.460> pinhole<00:05:29.880> lights

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
each of these little pinhole lights

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.719 
each of these little pinhole lights
fitted<00:05:30.840> with<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.140> different<00:05:31.560> fiber<00:05:32.100> optic<00:05:32.460> wire

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
fitted with a different fiber optic wire

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.300 
fitted with a different fiber optic wire
so<00:05:33.120> they<00:05:33.240> glow<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:34.440> also<00:05:34.710> they've<00:05:34.860> even<00:05:35.130> done

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
so they glow and also they've even done

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.050 
so they glow and also they've even done
a<00:05:35.729> little<00:05:36.150> flickering<00:05:36.919> red<00:05:37.919> light<00:05:38.160> in<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
a little flickering red light in the

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.670 
a little flickering red light in the
firebox<00:05:39.479> as<00:05:39.750> well<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:40.110> it<00:05:40.169> looks<00:05:40.350> like<00:05:40.500> it's

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
firebox as well so it looks like it's

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.860 
firebox as well so it looks like it's
flickering<00:05:41.220> fibers<00:05:41.669> I'll<00:05:42.090> link<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.570> video<00:05:42.660> to
