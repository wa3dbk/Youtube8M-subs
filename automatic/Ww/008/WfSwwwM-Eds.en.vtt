00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
cold weather sit on a fence it'll be car

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.490 
cold weather sit on a fence it'll be car
let<00:02:45.760> me<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:46.000> camping<00:02:46.510> that's<00:02:46.660> what<00:02:46.840> we<00:02:46.959> do<00:02:47.200> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
let me go camping that's what we do and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.920 
let me go camping that's what we do and
it<00:02:47.920> proves<00:02:48.459> beautifully<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.079> Sun<00:02:51.930> now

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it proves beautifully in the Sun now

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.890 
it proves beautifully in the Sun now
this<00:02:53.079> will<00:02:53.290> double<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.620> size<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.250> about<00:02:54.810> 20<00:02:55.810> or

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
this will double in size in about 20 or

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.120 
this will double in size in about 20 or
so<00:02:55.959> minutes<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:02.440> brings<00:03:02.739> back<00:03:02.829> out

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
so minutes see this brings back out

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.069 
so minutes see this brings back out
again<00:03:03.329> so<00:03:04.329> that's<00:03:04.720> good<00:03:05.549> into<00:03:06.549> our<00:03:06.730> bowl<00:03:07.079> which

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
again so that's good into our bowl which

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.860 
again so that's good into our bowl which
has<00:03:08.260> been<00:03:08.500> greased<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:09.670> into<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.299> warm<00:03:10.570> place

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
has been greased and into a warm place

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.620 
has been greased and into a warm place
for<00:03:11.320> about<00:03:12.310> 20<00:03:12.760> or<00:03:12.820> 30<00:03:13.000> minutes<00:03:13.150> till<00:03:13.540> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
for about 20 or 30 minutes till it

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.490 
for about 20 or 30 minutes till it
doubles<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:14.019> size<00:03:15.690> okay<00:03:16.690> after<00:03:16.870> 25<00:03:17.350> minutes

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
doubles in size okay after 25 minutes

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.449 
doubles in size okay after 25 minutes
out<00:03:17.859> dough<00:03:18.609> has<00:03:18.970> doubled<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.450> size<00:03:20.459> we're

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
out dough has doubled in size we're

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.680 
out dough has doubled in size we're
going<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.760> remove<00:03:22.170> plastic<00:03:23.170> film<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:25.510> so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
going to remove plastic film that's so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.560 
going to remove plastic film that's so
they<00:03:25.810> can<00:03:25.980> mat<00:03:26.980> back<00:03:27.220> down<00:03:27.400> again<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.450> now

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
they can mat back down again and now

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.349 
they can mat back down again and now
we're<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.750> going<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.489> punch<00:03:30.489> down<00:03:30.760> into<00:03:31.269> the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
we're just going to punch down into the

have to do this for too long we're going

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.759 
have to do this for too long we're going
to<00:03:54.319> divide<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.519> into<00:03:55.670> our<00:03:56.329> tins<00:03:56.780> however<00:03:57.620> you

they'll<00:04:08.510> have<00:04:08.629> to<00:04:08.750> be<00:04:08.829> divided<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.129> don't<00:04:10.489> cut

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
they'll have to be divided and don't cut

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.039 
they'll have to be divided and don't cut
if<00:04:11.180> you're<00:04:11.329> using<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:12.040> silicon<00:04:13.040> mat<00:04:13.909> don't<00:04:14.720> cut

if you're using a silicon mat don't cut

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.009 
if you're using a silicon mat don't cut
with<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.530> knife<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:16.100> little<00:04:16.699> silicon<00:04:17.299> spatula<00:04:17.840> is

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
with a knife a little silicon spatula is

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.949 
with a knife a little silicon spatula is
fine<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:19.100> we're<00:04:19.820> going<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.150> do<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.389> roughly

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
fine so we're going to do it roughly

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.659 
fine so we're going to do it roughly
into<00:04:21.580> thirds<00:04:26.590> okay<00:04:27.590> one<00:04:27.949> lot<00:04:28.160> is<00:04:28.310> going<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.520> be

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
into thirds okay one lot is going to be

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.140 
into thirds okay one lot is going to be
bread<00:04:28.940> rolls<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.860> other<00:04:31.039> two<00:04:31.370> sections

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
bread rolls and the other two sections

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.570 
bread rolls and the other two sections
are<00:04:32.600> going<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:33.050> be<00:04:33.199> put<00:04:33.650> into<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:35.410> pan<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.800> made

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
are going to be put into a pan and made

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.560 
are going to be put into a pan and made
into<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.030> loaf<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.510> bread<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:40.180> roughly<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.360> same

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
into a loaf of bread so roughly the same

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.260 
into a loaf of bread so roughly the same
size<00:04:42.039> get<00:04:43.039> your<00:04:43.250> loaf<00:04:43.430> tin<00:04:43.699> which<00:04:43.880> has<00:04:44.060> been

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
size get your loaf tin which has been

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.900 
size get your loaf tin which has been
lightly<00:04:44.479> greased<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:46.070> just<00:04:46.310> drop<00:04:46.490> your<00:04:46.669> bread

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
lightly greased and just drop your bread

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.740 
lightly greased and just drop your bread
into<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.509> and<00:04:48.490> now<00:04:49.490> we<00:04:49.550> stand<00:04:50.030> it<00:04:50.300> in<00:04:50.419> a<00:04:50.509> warm

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
into that and now we stand it in a warm

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.310 
into that and now we stand it in a warm
place<00:04:50.840> for<00:04:51.550> another<00:04:52.960> fifteen<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.050> twenty

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
place for another fifteen to twenty

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.800 
place for another fifteen to twenty
minutes<00:04:54.349> or<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:54.770> until<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:56.180> doubles<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.630> size

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
minutes or so until it doubles in size

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.170 
minutes or so until it doubles in size
again<00:04:57.050> it'll<00:04:57.470> actually<00:04:57.620> mold<00:04:58.160> together<00:04:58.460> and

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
again it'll actually mold together and

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.150 
again it'll actually mold together and
