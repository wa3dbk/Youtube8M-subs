00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
a dig phase kind of emotion if you state

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.510 
a dig phase kind of emotion if you state

all that weight resisted against you is

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279 
all that weight resisted against you is
only<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> pull<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.329> farther<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
your natural running motion so be sure

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.330 
your natural running motion so be sure
that<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.510> leaning<00:00:54.870> forward<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.500> simulate

that big base partner is giving the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.040 
that big base partner is giving the
resistance<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> most<00:00:59.820> important<00:01:00.480> key<00:01:00.719> here

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
resistance the most important key here

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
resistance the most important key here
is<00:01:01.230> making<00:01:01.859> sure<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> let<00:01:02.640> them

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
is making sure that you can let them

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
is making sure that you can let them
maintain<00:01:03.390> natural<00:01:03.690> running<00:01:04.260> form<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:05.070> you're

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
maintain natural running form if you're

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
maintain natural running form if you're
giving<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.760> too<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.030> resistance<00:01:06.420> where

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
giving them too much resistance where

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
giving them too much resistance where
it's<00:01:07.500> slowing<00:01:07.830> them<00:01:08.130> down<00:01:08.159> where<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.060> can't

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it's slowing them down where they can't

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240 
it's slowing them down where they can't
be<00:01:09.510> explosive<00:01:10.200> you've<00:01:10.530> got<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> let<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
be explosive you've got to let up a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.160 
be explosive you've got to let up a
little<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.670> complete<00:01:12.360> six<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.840> eight<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
little bit complete six to eight of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
little bit complete six to eight of
these<00:01:13.260> resisted<00:01:13.950> runners<00:01:14.310> driving<00:01:15.270> through

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
these resisted runners driving through

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.990 
these resisted runners driving through
about<00:01:15.810> 20<00:01:16.380> meters<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.310> very<00:01:17.520> important<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
about 20 meters it's very important that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.120 
about 20 meters it's very important that
you<00:01:18.090> stay<00:01:18.330> very<00:01:18.600> explosive<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.770> keep<00:01:19.979> those

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you stay very explosive so keep those

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
you stay very explosive so keep those
rest<00:01:20.490> periods<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.390> extended<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> a

minute half to two minutes in between

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.270 
minute half to two minutes in between
each<00:01:24.210> rep<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:25.290> forget<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.890> starts

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
each rep don't forget that your starts

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.460 
each rep don't forget that your starts
are<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> most<00:01:26.759> important<00:01:27.450> part<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.900> short

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
are the most important part of short

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
are the most important part of short
first<00:01:28.740> sprints<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.759> very<00:01:29.970> important

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
first sprints so it's very important

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
first sprints so it's very important
that<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.110> work<00:01:31.350> through<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.680> big<00:01:31.979> phase<00:01:32.280> and
