apart and fix it my problem here is one

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.300 
apart and fix it my problem here is one
of<00:00:17.359> these<00:00:17.509> tabs<00:00:17.810> broke<00:00:18.289> as<00:00:18.529> you<00:00:18.949> can<00:00:19.130> see

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
of these tabs broke as you can see

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.060 
of these tabs broke as you can see
supposed<00:00:19.880> to<00:00:19.939> be<00:00:20.029> four<00:00:20.239> tabs<00:00:20.539> here<00:00:20.839> it<00:00:21.650> broke

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
supposed to be four tabs here it broke

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.019 
supposed to be four tabs here it broke
so<00:00:22.099> it's<00:00:22.460> wobbling<00:00:23.150> while<00:00:24.699> we're<00:00:25.699> trying<00:00:25.909> to

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
so it's wobbling while we're trying to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.659 
so it's wobbling while we're trying to
grind<00:00:26.269> something<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.109> that's<00:00:28.009> not<00:00:28.249> going<00:00:28.609> to

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
grind something and that's not going to

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.269 
grind something and that's not going to
help<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.539> we're<00:00:30.470> going<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:30.619> take<00:00:30.769> this<00:00:30.949> apart

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
help so we're going to take this apart

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.689 
help so we're going to take this apart
now<00:00:32.260> so<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.379> first<00:00:33.590> step<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.280> take<00:00:34.489> this

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
now so the first step is to take this

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.869 
now so the first step is to take this
little<00:00:35.829> bolt<00:00:36.829> off<00:00:37.179> as<00:00:38.179> you<00:00:38.329> could<00:00:38.480> see<00:00:38.719> it's<00:00:39.019> a

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
little bolt off as you could see it's a

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.529 
little bolt off as you could see it's a
tiny<00:00:40.879> little<00:00:41.030> cap<00:00:41.420> bolt<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:43.730> size<00:00:43.969> I<00:00:44.239> need

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
tiny little cap bolt and the size I need

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.139 
tiny little cap bolt and the size I need
is<00:00:46.239> 3/8<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:48.350> can<00:00:48.500> also<00:00:48.649> use<00:00:48.949> a<00:00:48.980> 10<00:00:49.820> millimeter

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
is 3/8 you can also use a 10 millimeter

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.860 
is 3/8 you can also use a 10 millimeter
but<00:00:50.660> it'll<00:00:50.870> be<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:50.989> little<00:00:51.230> loose<00:00:52.179> 3/8<00:00:53.179> let's

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
but it'll be a little loose 3/8 let's

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.770 
but it'll be a little loose 3/8 let's
see<00:00:54.019> if<00:00:54.260> it's<00:00:54.410> perfect<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.339> just<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.420> be<00:00:56.510> clear

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
see if it's perfect and just to be clear

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.239 
see if it's perfect and just to be clear
that<00:00:56.859> normally<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.010> lose<00:00:58.280> it<00:00:58.579> this<00:00:59.089> way<00:01:00.249> but

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
that normally you lose it this way but

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.819 
that normally you lose it this way but
you<00:01:02.030> have<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.269> do<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.539> opposite<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.289> know<00:01:03.320> you

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
you have to do the opposite you know you

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.610 
you have to do the opposite you know you
do<00:01:04.010> clockwise<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.940> take<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.360> off<00:01:05.480> so<00:01:06.290> this<00:01:06.470> I'm

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
do clockwise to take it off so this I'm

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.590 
do clockwise to take it off so this I'm
going<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.890> be<00:01:06.950> using<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.370> pliers<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:10.600> 3/8

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
going to be using a pliers and this 3/8

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.760 
going to be using a pliers and this 3/8
too<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.820> I'm<00:01:14.420> going<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.630> hold<00:01:14.810> this<00:01:14.990> white<00:01:15.260> part

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
too so I'm going to hold this white part

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.350 
too so I'm going to hold this white part
and<00:01:16.540> turn<00:01:18.910> there<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.080> turn<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.040> then

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
and turn there so you turn it and then

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.730 
and turn there so you turn it and then
from<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.390> point<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.110> easier<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.590> turn

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
from that point on it's easier to turn

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.350 
from that point on it's easier to turn
once<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:25.190> break<00:01:25.370> it<00:01:25.520> loose<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.970> screws

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
once you break it loose that screws

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.800 
once you break it loose that screws
comes<00:01:29.630> up<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.410> bolt<00:01:30.650> comes<00:01:30.980> apart<00:01:31.630> after<00:01:32.630> that

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
comes up the bolt comes apart after that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.580 
comes up the bolt comes apart after that
take<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.800> blade<00:01:34.040> out<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:36.160> three<00:01:37.160> washes<00:01:38.590> pull

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
take the blade out and three washes pull

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.250 
take the blade out and three washes pull
them<00:01:39.770> right<00:01:39.800> out<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:42.380> have<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.650> black<00:01:43.370> one<00:01:43.640> a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
them right out so we have a black one a

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.770 
them right out so we have a black one a
cap<00:01:45.260> washer<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:46.460> has<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.730> slot<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.750> goes

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
cap washer that has a slot that goes

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.320 
cap washer that has a slot that goes
exactly<00:01:48.230> and<00:01:48.920> on<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.580> bolt<00:01:52.090> there<00:01:53.090> are<00:01:53.150> three

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
exactly and on that bolt there are three

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.180 
exactly and on that bolt there are three
washers<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:55.150> from<00:01:56.150> this<00:01:56.300> point<00:01:56.570> on<00:01:57.010> what<00:01:58.010> you

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
washers and from this point on what you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.940 
washers and from this point on what you
need<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:59.200> there's<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.290> little<00:02:00.590> groove

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
need to do is there's a little groove

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.610 
need to do is there's a little groove
there<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.760> need<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.060> hold<00:02:02.330> that<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.990> then

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
there you need to hold that and then

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.940 
there you need to hold that and then
turn<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.550> side<00:02:04.850> clockwise<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:06.350> let's<00:02:06.770> do

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
turn this side clockwise so let's do

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.740 
turn this side clockwise so let's do
that<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.490> need<00:02:07.610> some<00:02:07.850> sort<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.179> pliers<00:02:08.450> to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
that you need some sort of a pliers to

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.210 
that you need some sort of a pliers to
do<00:02:08.899> that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
do that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.100 
do that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
I'm going to be using a little vice

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.390 
I'm going to be using a little vice
grips<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:14.930> hold<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.990> out<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.500> right<00:02:20.220> on

that group I'm going to put that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.670 
that group I'm going to put that
vice-grip<00:02:24.290> locked<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.530> there<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:27.470> once<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.620> get

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
vice-grip locked in there and once I get

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.490 
vice-grip locked in there and once I get
that<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> clockwise<00:02:33.030> turn<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.900> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
that just do a clockwise turn and it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.540 
that just do a clockwise turn and it's
loose<00:02:37.670> take<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.880> out<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:41.160> see<00:02:41.370> it's

greased it i would polish it a little

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.830 
greased it i would polish it a little
bit<00:02:51.780> use<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:51.990> little<00:02:52.350> bit<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:53.360> sandpaper<00:02:54.360> and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.870 

polish<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.870> completely<00:02:58.710> that'll<00:02:59.130> be<00:02:59.250> nice<00:02:59.640> and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
polish it completely that'll be nice and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:13.550 
polish it completely that'll be nice and
smooth<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.110> put<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.470> back<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:12.560> after

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
smooth and you put it back right after

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.940 
smooth and you put it back right after
you<00:03:14.310> take<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.760> apart<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.470> reverse<00:03:16.800> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
you take that apart you reverse the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.120 
you take that apart you reverse the
process<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.640> put<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.570> new<00:03:18.750> pot<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:20.010> get

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
process and put the new pot in you get

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.660 
process and put the new pot in you get
the<00:03:20.250> new<00:03:20.370> part<00:03:20.670> from<00:03:21.360> amazon<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:22.080> about

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
the new part from amazon it's about

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.250 
the new part from amazon it's about
three<00:03:23.670> dollars<00:03:23.820> i<00:03:24.150> believe<00:03:24.420> that's<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
three dollars i believe that's the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.900 
three dollars i believe that's the
reason<00:03:25.440> i'm<00:03:25.680> doing<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:26.100> instead<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.580> buying

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
reason i'm doing this instead of buying

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.680 
reason i'm doing this instead of buying
a<00:03:27.209> new<00:03:27.830> jar<00:03:28.830> which<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.930> around<00:03:30.930> $25<00:03:32.360> anyway<00:03:33.360> so

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
a new jar which is around $25 anyway so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.150 
a new jar which is around $25 anyway so
you<00:03:33.750> basically<00:03:34.670> repeat<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.820> process<00:03:37.010> put<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
you basically repeat the process put the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.390 
you basically repeat the process put the
shaft<00:03:38.400> in<00:03:38.640> first<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:41.930> just<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.130> screw

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
shaft in first and just and you screw

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.610 
shaft in first and just and you screw
this<00:03:44.550> counterclockwise<00:03:47.959> till<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.200> nice<00:03:49.590> and

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
this counterclockwise till it's nice and

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.210 
this counterclockwise till it's nice and
snug<00:03:50.600> give<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.780> little<00:03:51.930> yank<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:53.040> don't

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
snug give it a little yank you don't

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.970 
snug give it a little yank you don't
have<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.459> do<00:03:53.580> too<00:03:53.850> much<00:03:54.030> because<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:55.590> mixer

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
have to do too much because the mixer

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.130 
have to do too much because the mixer
rotates<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> opposite<00:03:57.480> direction<00:03:57.720> and

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
rotates in the opposite direction and

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.160 
rotates in the opposite direction and
that'll<00:03:58.380> automatically<00:03:58.830> tighten<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.110> all

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
that'll automatically tighten so all

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.160 
that'll automatically tighten so all
three<00:04:01.500> washes<00:04:01.950> are<00:04:02.130> back<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.640> place<00:04:03.140> put<00:04:04.140> the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
three washes are back in place put the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.810 
three washes are back in place put the
blade<00:04:04.739> on<00:04:05.150> just<00:04:06.150> match<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.980> shape<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.280> the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
blade on just match the shape of the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.150 
blade on just match the shape of the
hole<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.540> shaft<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:13.140> go<00:04:13.950> so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
hole with the shaft and then go so

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.340 
hole with the shaft and then go so
little<00:04:14.430> nut<00:04:14.840> remember<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:15.959> got<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.260> do

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
little nut remember you got to do

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.289 
little nut remember you got to do
counterclockwise<00:04:16.919> this<00:04:17.400> time

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
counterclockwise this time

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.680 
counterclockwise this time
right<00:04:19.139> so<00:04:19.879> use<00:04:20.879> a<00:04:20.910> 3/8<00:04:21.509> nut<00:04:21.690> driver<00:04:22.169> and

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
right so use a 3/8 nut driver and

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:33.640 
right so use a 3/8 nut driver and
tighten<00:04:26.900> that's<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:29.479> spin<00:04:30.479> smooth<00:04:31.669> and

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
tighten that's it so spin smooth and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.089 
tighten that's it so spin smooth and
proper<00:04:35.449> wobbling<00:04:36.449> that's<00:04:37.349> how<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.590> fix<00:04:37.889> it

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
proper wobbling that's how you fix it

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.939 
proper wobbling that's how you fix it
pretty<00:04:38.490> premier<00:04:39.240> or<00:04:39.599> butterflies<00:04:40.169> broken

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
pretty premier or butterflies broken
