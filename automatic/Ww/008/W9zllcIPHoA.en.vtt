iPhone or Android we do get asked quite
a<00:00:38.910> bit<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.390> Smart<00:00:39.690> Start<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
a bit about this Smart Start so I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.420 
a bit about this Smart Start so I
thought<00:00:40.379> I'd<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> quick<00:00:40.860> video<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
thought I'd make a quick video just to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.850 
thought I'd make a quick video just to
demonstrate<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.149> working<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.770> over<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
demonstrate it all working so over to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.760 
demonstrate it all working so over to
the<00:00:43.950> car<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.399> give<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> quick<00:00:44.820> demo<00:00:45.770> this

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the car just give you a quick demo this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.049 
the car just give you a quick demo this
is<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.039> car<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.520> system<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:47.940> been

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
is the car that the system has been

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.110 
is the car that the system has been
fitted<00:00:48.480> onto<00:00:48.660> our<00:00:49.020> dq7

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
fitted onto our dq7

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.360 
fitted onto our dq7
2007<00:00:51.530> 4.2<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.660> goes<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.440> remote<00:00:55.710> control<00:00:55.890> so

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
2007 4.2 so it goes to remote control so

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
2007 4.2 so it goes to remote control so
I'll<00:00:56.640> demonstrate<00:00:56.820> using<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> pager<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I'll demonstrate using the pager so you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.719 
I'll demonstrate using the pager so you
can<00:00:58.829> block<00:01:04.309> unlock<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:08.130> also<00:01:08.400> remote

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
can block unlock and you can also remote

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.570 
can block unlock and you can also remote
start<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.510> remote<00:01:09.810> control<00:01:10.460> once<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
start from this remote control once you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.980 
start from this remote control once you
activate<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.000> remote<00:01:12.270> start<00:01:12.450> there's<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
activate the remote start there's a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.340 
activate the remote start there's a
delay<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> approximately<00:01:14.010> 15<00:01:14.520> seconds

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
delay of approximately 15 seconds

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.510 
delay of approximately 15 seconds
between<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.619> car<00:01:16.799> she<00:01:16.950> carrying<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
between the car she carrying out the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
between the car she carrying out the
command<00:01:20.720> show<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.990> there's<00:01:22.140> nobody

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
command show you that there's nobody

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.140 
command show you that there's nobody
inside

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.330 

so<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.300> should<00:01:30.540> fire<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.870> as<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.130> done

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
so that should fire up as it has done

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.250 
so that should fire up as it has done
now

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.410 

can<00:01:35.680> also<00:01:35.830> switch<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.220> off<00:01:36.640> from<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.150> remote

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
can also switch it off from the remote

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.690 
can also switch it off from the remote
control

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.080 

and<00:01:41.700> we've<00:01:42.180> also<00:01:43.610> connected<00:01:44.610> his<00:01:44.790> boot

our<00:02:45.800> delay<00:02:46.100> now<00:02:46.310> which<00:02:46.430> put<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.580> wait<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:48.290> it's

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
our delay now which put a wait so it's

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.600 
our delay now which put a wait so it's
going<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.620> perform<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:49.070> command<00:02:49.340> there's<00:02:49.550> a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
going to perform the command there's a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.640 
going to perform the command there's a
delay<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:49.850> approximately<00:02:50.570> 15<00:02:50.960> seconds<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.500> I

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
delay of approximately 15 seconds like I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:01.630 
delay of approximately 15 seconds like I
said<00:02:51.800> earlier<00:02:52.100> on

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.979 

maybe<00:03:02.640> our<00:03:02.819> car<00:03:03.030> starts<00:03:03.420> up<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.840> can<00:03:06.840> also

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
maybe our car starts up you can also

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.020 
maybe our car starts up you can also
switch<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.379> off<00:03:07.620> from<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> phone<00:03:08.159> as<00:03:08.310> well

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.740 

so<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.600> gonna<00:03:11.750> send<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.050> command<00:03:12.320> again

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.460 

so<00:03:19.050> command<00:03:19.410> has<00:03:19.590> been<00:03:19.620> received<00:03:21.230> car<00:03:22.230> shuts

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
so command has been received car shuts

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.730 
so command has been received car shuts
down<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:24.030> SmartStart<00:03:24.480> itself<00:03:25.080> also

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
down the SmartStart itself also

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.950 
down the SmartStart itself also
incorporates<00:03:26.550> GPS<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.610> using<00:03:29.610> this<00:03:29.960> hopefully

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
incorporates GPS so using this hopefully

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.120 
incorporates GPS so using this hopefully
it<00:03:31.110> should<00:03:31.350> zoom<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.010> second<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.550> focus

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
it should zoom in in a second and focus

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.430 
it should zoom in in a second and focus
you<00:03:35.130> can
