00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.210

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 tragedy some media broadcast their 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.720
 photo identifying the wrong thing as 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.760
 the captain of the ship miguel pérez soto 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 when in reality it was not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.070
 his name is jacob he lives in houston and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.830
 I had never spoken before the cameras of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.560
 television so far in that gets the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.750
 interview that you will only see here in red 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.820
 alive 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.820
 since the English is a crack 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.940
 yesterday he is a pilot 55 years ago he lives in 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.920
 houston and during his long career 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.920
 has flown all types of aircraft 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.360
 although his 78-year -old is more alive 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.280
 that never a year ago many did not 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.250
 for dead in water and they called my 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.379
 happen to me was black and white 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.930
 mexico when he received the news that the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.939
 daily 25 that he had flown during 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.860
 many years had rushed to 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.890
 land and its six occupants on board 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.159
 had passed away he knew very well the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.050
 route from monterrey to toluca 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.450
 I have flown that route many times 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:30.220
 although he did not know the pilot if he had 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:32.200
 traveled with the co-pilot but he gave me 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.240
 a lot of grief because I met one of the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.819
 pilots I have flown that plane here in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.010
 houston for 10 or 15 years 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:42.270
 he knew that plane very well 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.640
 he had flown with the co-pilot 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.460
 alessandro towers just days before the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.460
 tragedy how was he as a copilot 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.360
 like having a good young man and with many 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.460
 willing to learn to help 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.720
 although he was very young as he assures 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.300
 Alessandro had the knowledge 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.010
 necessary to be a co-pilot was 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.410
 alessandro fifth our photograph of 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.280
 both for then he says publish it in his 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.869
 facebook ate him many times for 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.850
 his surprise the morning after the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.730
 accident began to receive messages from 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.600
 his friends asking him if he was alive 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.520
 Here is the genius, I called my wife 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.860
 because she knew the number of plates 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.340
 of the plane and she knew that I was in 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.050
 my house I called her and I told her it was not me 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.000
 the media already circulated 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.220
 his picture under the captain's name 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.230
 miguel perez soto who lives piloting the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.450
 ship by assuring that it was he who 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.220
 had passed away and talking about the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 possibility of a heart attack 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.060
 many people mistakenly saw my picture 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.849
 as if they had died from the plane 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.770
 According to Jr what most annoys him was that 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.150
 his wife started receiving calls from 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.020
 people who asked him about the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.640
 accident and if her husband had died 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.670
 his wife was very upset with everything 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.280
 this if she had not spoken right 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.610
 with me on the phone I would have thought that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.769
 maybe it was the notification of my death 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.500
 10 after the accident his picture was 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.470
 everywhere I could not believe it was 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.620
 such a serious error and that they will continue it 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.299
 showing by trend where is a 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.730
 year after the accident in iturbide 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.380
 mexico york / ap is still being chased 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.810
 by the ghost of Jenny's plane 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.489
 rivera ensures her photo appears every time 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.489
 who seeks information about this 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:38.630
 tragedy I'm still upset 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.510
 especially when he hears a lot but they go 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.940
 to happen again at Christmas time and I 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.790
 bothers even more that they will see something like 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.470
 If I had died in an accident today 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.810
 speak for the first time to tell 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.940
 all that is well also counts 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.710
 details never before revealed about the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.500
 me and the 25 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.470
 lotus wolf not for almost 15 years as 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.180
 ensures I got to know the ship better than anyone 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.920
 you were completely sure that the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.580
 plane that you were flying was in 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.580
 perfect state 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.890
 the family of the pilot who died not 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.959
 intervenes neither the prisoner all gave to 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.610

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.410
 press conference last month of 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.669
 march in chicago where they announced that 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.500
 they were filing a lawsuit 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.479
 related to the accident that was the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.000
 the first time the world spread the 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.090
 photo of the captain and the prisoner is at peace 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.699

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.919

 of that demand of the family pérez soto 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.690
 the conditions in which the plane was 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.210
 in which Jenni Rivera died including her 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.030
 maintenance since he for many 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.979
