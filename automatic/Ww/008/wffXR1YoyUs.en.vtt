hey<00:00:01.949> guys<00:00:02.129> I'm<00:00:02.520> Ronnie<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.149> today<00:00:03.540> I'm<00:00:04.140> going

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hey guys I'm Ronnie and today I'm going

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.110 
hey guys I'm Ronnie and today I'm going
to<00:00:04.410> be<00:00:04.560> showing<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:05.009> how<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.220> build<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.819> video

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
to be showing you how to build a video

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.620 
to be showing you how to build a video
editing<00:00:06.480> computer<00:00:06.509> or<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.950> mean<00:00:08.490> an<00:00:08.820> gaming

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
editing computer or I mean an gaming

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.249 
editing computer or I mean an gaming
computer<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.440> I'm<00:00:10.910> most<00:00:11.910> likely<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.780> most<00:00:13.170> of

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
computer so I'm most likely and most of

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.720 
computer so I'm most likely and most of
the<00:00:13.440> time<00:00:13.650> I'm<00:00:13.860> going<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> be<00:00:14.219> using<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.610> as

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the time I'm going to be using it as

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.210 
the time I'm going to be using it as
video<00:00:15.150> editing<00:00:15.509> computer<00:00:15.590> so<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.920> chose<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
video editing computer so I chose a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.300 
video editing computer so I chose a
powerful<00:00:17.820> CPU<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.350> powerful<00:00:19.890> graphics

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
powerful CPU and a powerful graphics

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.220 
powerful CPU and a powerful graphics
card<00:00:20.850> which<00:00:21.510> i'm<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> show<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.050> later

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
card which i'm going to show you later

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.210 
card which i'm going to show you later
so<00:00:22.650> now<00:00:22.890> let's<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.490> go<00:00:23.670> over<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.029> pots<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.859> we

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
so now let's just go over the pots so we

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.429 
so now let's just go over the pots so we
chose<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> case<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.570> chose<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.990> cosmos

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
chose for the case we chose the cosmos

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.540 
chose for the case we chose the cosmos
SE<00:00:28.949> ATX<00:00:29.490> power<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.720> huge<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.439> full<00:00:32.219> tower

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
SE ATX power this is huge a full tower

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
SE ATX power this is huge a full tower
that<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.030> provide<00:00:33.420> enough<00:00:33.780> airflow<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.680> us

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that will provide enough airflow for us

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.610 
that will provide enough airflow for us
and<00:00:35.160> enough<00:00:35.670> hard<00:00:36.059> drive<00:00:36.149> base<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.290> future

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and enough hard drive base in the future

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.729 
and enough hard drive base in the future
so<00:00:38.989> cpu<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> intel<00:00:41.550> i7<00:00:42.050> 59<00:00:43.050> 30k

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
so cpu with one of the intel i7 59 30k

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.080 
so cpu with one of the intel i7 59 30k
this<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.760> new<00:00:45.239> haswell-e<00:00:46.200> serious<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:47.670> intel

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
this is new haswell-e serious from intel

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.799 
this is new haswell-e serious from intel
and<00:00:48.360> runs<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> LGA<00:00:49.920> 2011<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.760> free<00:00:51.270> socket

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and runs on the LGA 2011 we free socket

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
and runs on the LGA 2011 we free socket
which<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.800> bad<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.280> comparable<00:00:53.789> over

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
which is not bad it's comparable over

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.869 
which is not bad it's comparable over
the<00:00:54.180> LGA<00:00:54.480> 2011<00:00:54.649> when<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> sandy<00:00:56.160> bridge-e<00:00:56.430> or

the LGA 2011 when the sandy bridge-e or
ivy<00:00:57.600> bridge-e<00:00:58.050> model<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.340> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> least

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
ivy bridge-e model so this is the least

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.969 
ivy bridge-e model so this is the least
expensive<00:01:01.949> six<00:01:02.579> core<00:01:02.879> processor<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:04.589> Intel

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
expensive six core processor from Intel

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.210 
expensive six core processor from Intel
that<00:01:05.189> supports<00:01:05.850> 40pc<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.780> lanes<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.380> there's<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that supports 40pc I lanes and there's a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
that supports 40pc I lanes and there's a
cheaper<00:01:08.610> version<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:09.119> six<00:01:09.479> core<00:01:09.720> processes

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
cheaper version of six core processes

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.370 
cheaper version of six core processes
which<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.670> 15<00:01:12.119> 8<00:01:12.299> 20<00:01:12.720> k<00:01:12.930> which<00:01:13.170> only

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
which is the 15 8 20 k which only

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.600 
which is the 15 8 20 k which only
supports<00:01:13.890> 28<00:01:14.549> pcie<00:01:15.409> three-point<00:01:16.409> line<00:01:16.680> this

supports 28 pcie three-point line this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.560 
supports 28 pcie three-point line this
supports<00:01:18.030> 14<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.780> went<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.380> step<00:01:19.680> up

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
supports 14 so we went to one step up

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
supports 14 so we went to one step up
DVD<00:01:21.570> drives<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.170> went<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.680> two<00:01:23.630> asus<00:01:25.460> asus

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

DVD 24x DVD drives ah and for the SSD

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
DVD 24x DVD drives ah and for the SSD
because<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.729> cheap<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.990> went<00:01:34.140> with

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
because they are cheap so we went with

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.490 
because they are cheap so we went with
two<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> SSD<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> Intel<00:01:36.869> 530

backup<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.470> yeah<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.340> rate<00:02:23.670> 5<00:02:24.030> um<00:02:24.360> so

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
backup so yeah that is a rate 5 um so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.440 
backup so yeah that is a rate 5 um so
I'm<00:02:25.350> going<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.190> doing<00:02:26.550> daily

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
I'm going to do it be doing daily

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.960 
I'm going to do it be doing daily
backups<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:29.100> not<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.640> worry<00:02:29.910> about

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
backups so I'm not going to worry about

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.960 
backups so I'm not going to worry about
that<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.530> case<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.010> here<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.460> actually

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
that for a case is here and actually

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.350 
that for a case is here and actually
remove<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.660> out<00:02:33.870> for<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.320> time<00:02:34.530> being<00:02:34.860> and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
remove that out for the time being and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.550 
remove that out for the time being and
this<00:02:36.360> should<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> clear<00:02:36.930> window<00:02:37.260> when<00:02:37.500> I

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
this should have a clear window when I

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.220 
this should have a clear window when I
remove<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.100> as<00:02:38.280> well<00:02:38.820> it's<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.960> box

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
remove that as well it's in this box

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.270 
remove that as well it's in this box
right<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.640> for<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> power<00:02:42.870> supply<00:02:43.080> we<00:02:44.010> went

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
right now so for a power supply we went

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.560 
right now so for a power supply we went
to<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.700> FSP<00:02:45.710> 750<00:02:46.710> watt<00:02:46.890> power<00:02:47.190> supply<00:02:47.570> this

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
to of the FSP 750 watt power supply this

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.200 
to of the FSP 750 watt power supply this
is<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.040> rmc<00:02:50.040> m750<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:52.770> has<00:02:53.220> 80<00:02:53.730> plus<00:02:54.180> gold

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
is the rmc m750 and it has 80 plus gold

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.660 
is the rmc m750 and it has 80 plus gold
efficiency<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.410> that's<00:02:55.620> why<00:02:55.830> we<00:02:55.980> chose<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.460> and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
efficiency so that's why we chose it and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.420 
efficiency so that's why we chose it and
it<00:02:57.150> has<00:02:57.300> 8<00:02:57.570> SATA<00:02:58.020> ports<00:02:58.440> which<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> good<00:02:59.400> for

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
it has 8 SATA ports which is good for

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.860 
it has 8 SATA ports which is good for
future<00:03:00.330> expandability<00:03:00.840> um<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:02.520> has<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:03.270> USD

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
future expandability um it has a USD

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.370 
future expandability um it has a USD

mount them on a radiator so at last sort
of<00:05:01.710> graphics<00:05:02.100> card<00:05:02.400> we<00:05:02.910> went<00:05:03.060> with<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.450> GTX

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
of graphics card we went with the GTX

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.990 
of graphics card we went with the GTX
970<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:06.030> we<00:05:06.540> intended<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.320> buy<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:08.000> 770

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
970 this we intended to buy the 770

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.600 
970 this we intended to buy the 770
before<00:05:09.390> but<00:05:11.360> 970<00:05:12.360> came<00:05:12.810> out<00:05:12.960> days<00:05:13.320> ago<00:05:13.680> about<00:05:14.550> a

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
before but 970 came out days ago about a

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.690 
before but 970 came out days ago about a
week<00:05:14.820> ago<00:05:14.910> actually<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:16.160> it's<00:05:17.160> much<00:05:17.460> more

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
week ago actually and it's much more

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.960 
week ago actually and it's much more
faster<00:05:18.000> than<00:05:18.630> 770<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:20.010> is<00:05:20.130> extreme<00:05:20.610> over

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
faster than 770 this is extreme over

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.790 
faster than 770 this is extreme over
plucked<00:05:21.210> from<00:05:21.950> gallup's<00:05:22.950> not<00:05:23.280> galaxy<00:05:24.560> so<00:05:25.560> this

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
plucked from gallup's not galaxy so this

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.170 
plucked from gallup's not galaxy so this
have<00:05:26.040> 4<00:05:26.490> gigabytes<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.180> gddr5<00:05:28.460> 6<00:05:29.460> plus<00:05:29.669> 8<00:05:29.880> pin

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
have 4 gigabytes of gddr5 6 plus 8 pin

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.670 
have 4 gigabytes of gddr5 6 plus 8 pin
so<00:05:30.750> this<00:05:31.050> has<00:05:31.380> this<00:05:32.280> is<00:05:32.550> actually<00:05:33.440> based<00:05:34.440> on<00:05:34.620> a

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
so this has this is actually based on a

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.610 
so this has this is actually based on a
Maxwell<00:05:35.490> architecture<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:36.570> it's<00:05:36.750> a<00:05:37.020> much<00:05:37.590> more

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
Maxwell architecture so it's a much more

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.040 
Maxwell architecture so it's a much more
power<00:05:38.100> efficient<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:39.470> yeah<00:05:41.750> so<00:05:42.750> this<00:05:42.900> is<00:05:42.930> the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
power efficient and yeah so this is the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.640 
power efficient and yeah so this is the
