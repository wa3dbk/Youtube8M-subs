to<00:00:47.770> begin<00:00:47.920> tuning<00:00:48.399> I<00:00:48.460> usually<00:00:48.820> start<00:00:49.059> with<00:00:49.149> a

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
to begin tuning I usually start with a

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.970 
to begin tuning I usually start with a
resonating<00:00:49.870> head<00:00:51.989> lightly<00:00:52.989> I<00:00:53.200> tighten<00:00:53.739> each

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
resonating head lightly I tighten each

the shell
if<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:58.930> do<00:00:59.079> more<00:00:59.379> than<00:00:59.590> quarter<00:00:59.890> turns<00:01:00.309> you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
if you do more than quarter turns you

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.460 
if you do more than quarter turns you
may<00:01:01.120> offset<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.570> placement<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.170> head<00:01:02.350> on

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.830 

next<00:01:13.700> I'll<00:01:13.820> flip<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.150> over<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:14.450> do<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:14.720> same

next I'll flip it over and do the same

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.149

when you buy new heads stretching is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.090 
when you buy new heads stretching is
usually<00:02:29.690> helpful<00:02:29.900> because<00:02:30.440> new<00:02:30.680> heads<00:02:30.920> get

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
usually helpful because new heads get

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:48.720 
usually helpful because new heads get

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.520 

you'll<00:02:49.330> need<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.540> repeat<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.930> process<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.500> few

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
you'll need to repeat this process a few

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.080 
you'll need to repeat this process a few
times<00:02:50.739> as<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.340> stretch<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.790> head<00:02:51.909> out<00:02:51.940> of

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.640 

usually<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.420> tune<00:03:34.690> my<00:03:34.720> resonant<00:03:35.260> head<00:03:35.290> a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
usually I tune my resonant head a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.120 
usually I tune my resonant head a
perfect<00:03:36.070> fourth<00:03:36.310> above<00:03:36.760> my<00:03:37.240> batter<00:03:37.480> side<00:03:37.780> head
