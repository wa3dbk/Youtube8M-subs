00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and I wouldn't pick me up there's a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.619 
and I wouldn't pick me up there's a
picture<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.579> least<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
picture of it at least I can see what it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.029 
picture of it at least I can see what it
is

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
is

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.200 
is
so<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.399> mini<00:01:02.670> bulb<00:01:02.940> says<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
so just a little mini bulb says it's a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
so just a little mini bulb says it's a
brightness<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.360> 600<00:01:06.840> lumens<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.920> 10

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
brightness at 600 lumens is just 10

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:17.600 
brightness at 600 lumens is just 10
watts<00:01:13.460> self<00:01:14.460> awakes<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> doesn't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
watts self awakes so if that doesn't

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890 
watts self awakes so if that doesn't
work<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.119> we'll<00:01:18.299> probably<00:01:18.420> upgrade

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
work you know we'll probably upgrade

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.870 
work you know we'll probably upgrade
this<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> big<00:01:20.400> fluorescent<00:01:20.670> bulb<00:01:22.610> but

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.179 

pretty<00:01:26.880> excited<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:28.470> need<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> pick<00:01:29.009> up

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.550 
pretty excited I just need to pick up
maybe<00:01:29.369> another<00:01:29.909> 45<00:01:30.479> degree<00:01:30.840> angle<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> here

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
maybe another 45 degree angle in here

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.660 
maybe another 45 degree angle in here
and<00:01:31.970> drop<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:34.009> overflow<00:01:35.009> return<00:01:35.400> pipe

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and drop my overflow return pipe

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.980 
and drop my overflow return pipe
straight<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:38.360> think<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.720> be

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
heater the heater I have looks like a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.880 
heater the heater I have looks like a
cheap<00:01:52.619> phone<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.659> thing<00:01:54.659> other<00:01:55.140> than<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
cheap phone so thing other than that

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.209 
cheap phone so thing other than that
just<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.689> aqua<00:01:58.649> monitoring

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
just one of those aqua monitoring

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.109 
just one of those aqua monitoring

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
systems and that should be about it

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
systems and that should be about it
maybe<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.829> ro/di<00:02:04.829> system<00:02:05.119> probably<00:02:06.119> helped<00:02:06.390> me

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
maybe a ro/di system probably helped me

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
maybe a ro/di system probably helped me
other<00:02:06.630> than<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.170> got<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.890> grip<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.250> buckets

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
all that stuff maybe I got it maybe I'll

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.899 
all that stuff maybe I got it maybe I'll
probably<00:04:05.930> go<00:04:06.109> get<00:04:06.229> a<00:04:06.290> timer<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:06.979> I'm<00:04:07.579> not<00:04:07.729> too

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
probably go get a timer but I'm not too

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.009 
probably go get a timer but I'm not too
worried<00:04:08.180> about<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.449> through<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.810> psycho

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
worried about it through the psycho

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.309 
worried about it through the psycho
stage<00:04:09.409> at<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.739> point<00:04:10.099> I<00:04:10.430> think<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.989> least<00:04:12.169> of

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
stage at this point I think the least of

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.869 
stage at this point I think the least of
my<00:04:12.349> worries

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
my worries

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.810 
my worries
and<00:04:13.879> they're<00:04:14.209> cheap<00:04:14.239> enough<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.579> yeah<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.609> throw

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and they're cheap enough so yeah I throw

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.159 
and they're cheap enough so yeah I throw
the<00:04:16.940> next<00:04:17.090> check<00:04:17.419> will<00:04:17.599> probably<00:04:17.959> get<00:04:18.019> this

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
the next check will probably get this

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.789 
the next check will probably get this
thing<00:04:18.409> up<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.159> running<00:04:19.219> and<00:04:20.529> maybe<00:04:21.529> I'll<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:21.769> a

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
thing up and running and maybe I'll do a

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:22.810 
thing up and running and maybe I'll do a
walkthrough<00:04:22.070> on

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820
