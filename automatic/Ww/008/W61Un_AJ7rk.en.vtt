00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.680 
setting up here I'm excited chapter 2
rolls<00:02:56.010> around<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.640> we're<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> more<00:02:57.270> modern

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
rolls around and we're in a more modern

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.870 
rolls around and we're in a more modern
setting<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.290> then<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.489> how<00:02:59.520> he's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
setting and then I see like how he's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.510 
setting and then I see like how he's
structuring<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.420> novel<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.170> first

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
structuring the novel so the first

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.690 
structuring the novel so the first
chapter<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.650> letter<00:03:04.860> which<00:03:05.370> is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
chapter is is the letter which is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.820 
chapter is is the letter which is
written<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.060> 1933<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.080> then<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.500> second

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
written in 1933 and then the second

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.210 
written in 1933 and then the second
chapter<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.310> more<00:03:08.580> modern<00:03:09.380> storyline<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.190> I

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
chapter is more modern storyline so I

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.400 
chapter is more modern storyline so I
expected<00:03:11.760> chapter<00:03:12.150> 3<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> letter<00:03:13.140> which

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
expected chapter 3 to be a letter which

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.710 
expected chapter 3 to be a letter which
it<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.550> thought<00:03:14.610> chapter<00:03:15.270> 4<00:03:15.540> we'd

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it is and then I thought chapter 4 we'd

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.960 
it is and then I thought chapter 4 we'd
be<00:03:15.930> returning<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.530> storyline<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
be returning to that storyline but you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.970 
be returning to that storyline but you
don't<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:19.049> don't<00:03:19.230> return<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.680> same

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
don't you don't return to that same

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.090 
don't you don't return to that same
storyline<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:21.080> return<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.380> another<00:03:22.739> modern

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
storyline you return to another modern

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.789 
storyline you return to another modern
storyline<00:03:23.760> which<00:03:24.690> has<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.930> character<00:03:25.560> from<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
storyline which has a character from the

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.610 
storyline which has a character from the
first<00:03:26.070> storyline<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.470> not

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
wasn't a terrible first novel but I

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.090 
wasn't a terrible first novel but I
didn't<00:06:10.340> enjoy<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.940> really<00:06:11.810> I<00:06:12.020> didn't<00:06:12.620> enjoy<00:06:12.860> my

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
didn't enjoy it really I didn't enjoy my

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.430 
didn't enjoy it really I didn't enjoy my
time<00:06:13.310> with<00:06:13.700> it<00:06:13.910> and<00:06:14.360> it<00:06:14.720> felt<00:06:14.990> more<00:06:15.200> like<00:06:15.260> a

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
time with it and it felt more like a

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.050 
time with it and it felt more like a
burden<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:16.010> read<00:06:16.220> then<00:06:16.490> like<00:06:16.640> something<00:06:16.880> I<00:06:16.940> was

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
burden to read then like something I was

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.030 
burden to read then like something I was
excited<00:06:17.420> to<00:06:17.480> get<00:06:17.540> back<00:06:17.690> to<00:06:17.960> so<00:06:18.770> that's<00:06:18.950> really

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
excited to get back to so that's really

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.110 
excited to get back to so that's really
too<00:06:19.250> bad<00:06:19.280> for<00:06:19.640> me<00:06:19.700> and<00:06:20.540> for<00:06:20.720> him<00:06:20.870> I<00:06:20.990> guess<00:06:22.090> so<00:06:23.090> I

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
too bad for me and for him I guess so I

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.580 
too bad for me and for him I guess so I
give<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.420> two<00:06:23.540> out<00:06:23.690> of<00:06:23.720> five<00:06:23.900> stars<00:06:23.960> on

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
give it two out of five stars on

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.420 
give it two out of five stars on
Goodreads<00:06:24.680> and<00:06:25.960> I<00:06:26.960> guess<00:06:27.860> more<00:06:28.160> than<00:06:28.220> anything

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
Goodreads and I guess more than anything

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.580 
Goodreads and I guess more than anything
