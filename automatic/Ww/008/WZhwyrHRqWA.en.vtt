this<00:00:06.399> is<00:00:06.550> a<00:00:06.580> sparring<00:00:07.029> program<00:00:07.240> similar<00:00:07.740> to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
this is a sparring program similar to

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.340 
this is a sparring program similar to
the<00:00:08.890> programmed<00:00:08.980> reality<00:00:09.910> of<00:00:10.000> the<00:00:10.120> matrix<00:00:10.480> it

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
the programmed reality of the matrix it

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.020 
the programmed reality of the matrix it
has<00:00:11.410> the<00:00:11.620> same<00:00:11.770> basic<00:00:11.830> rules<00:00:12.400> rules<00:00:12.850> like

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030 
has the same basic rules rules like

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.970 
has the same basic rules rules like
gravity<00:00:13.480> what<00:00:14.020> you<00:00:14.170> must<00:00:14.410> learn<00:00:14.620> is<00:00:14.680> that

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
gravity what you must learn is that

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.199 
gravity what you must learn is that
these<00:00:15.130> rules<00:00:15.310> are<00:00:15.519> no<00:00:15.640> different<00:00:16.000> than<00:00:16.090> the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
these rules are no different than the

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.329 
these rules are no different than the
rules<00:00:16.359> of<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.630> computer<00:00:17.080> system<00:00:17.260> some<00:00:18.099> of<00:00:18.220> them

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:18.339 
rules of a computer system some of them

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:23.419 
rules of a computer system some of them
can<00:00:18.550> be<00:00:18.669> bent<00:00:18.990> others<00:00:19.990> can<00:00:20.769> be<00:00:20.919> broken<00:00:22.140> tank
