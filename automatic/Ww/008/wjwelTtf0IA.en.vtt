00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello everyone in this iphone story 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.240
 they will see how to close their messages 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.510
 texts all the history of your messages 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.190
 and texts on iphone are basically going 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.190
 to enter messages that is here 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 and then they have several messages 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.090
 let's say I want to erase all the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.090
 messages from this person 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.660
 instead of putting up here 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.060
 and click on each 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.580
 the circle here and hence pressure to 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.220
 of the limit we are always going to press 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.920
 cancel by now and we will delete 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.780
 all the history we're going to go to 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.180
 message is here above 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.700
 let's click on edith 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.100
 and they're going to serve us circles they only have 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.620
 to give and cover the circle from here to 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 side and they will leave the crime this is going 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.970
 to erase all your history that you have 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.790
 been talking to this person lying 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.990
 if they want to start from scratch they go to 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.830
 put the int 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.450
 and I already deleted them completely 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.079
 they impress you only in dan 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.939
 and this is like erasing a message because 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.040
 they ended up doing that they press their 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.730
 fight from below 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.340
 and already minimized its application if it is 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.840
 they want to close their application well because 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.020
 now we minimize you just like 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.670
 any other we are going to double click 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.670
 over the fight here 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.040
 when they make that double tap the top 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.380
 of the button they are going to give they are going to bump this go 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.360
 to hold all the applications of such 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.830
 time three will see enough 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.260
 applications down here if they have not closed 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.780
 no one ever like I 'm going to 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.430
 closing then I only have this one that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.250
 I just opened or a little while ago 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.430
 hold my finger on top of application 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.570
 until I get this out and there I have to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.570
 just hit this circle here and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.270
 this is how the application was closed in earnest 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.040
 if they have them open and if they see 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.020
 enough down here means that you do not 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.370
 they have closed and that is simply going to 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.190
 finish the battery of your iphone more 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.380
 fast and at the same time makes them a little bit 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.210
 slower since your iphone is loaded 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.680
 too many applications the most 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.690
 important that they always want to have 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.510
 open I advise you never close them 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.800
 as your mail or maybe phone or 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.960
 any application they use 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.390
 it is not necessary to close him 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.850
 always me in xian i just have 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.190
 without anything like they can 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.390
 but you can have it with 5 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.750
 applications is not going to be the great 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.280
 difference if you have any questions 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.760
 comment do not forget beit and put 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.480
 like 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.480
 Thank you 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.720
 and
