 of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.279
 start now 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.579
 by the first opening scene of this evil 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.710
 have counties that do not count 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 behind coritiba half 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.210
 the digital future 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.580
 rarely 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.550
 It's favela goals 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 the opening ceremony 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200
 people thought lula 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.600
 if they can still change a little 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.570
 the exercise 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.210
 do this again 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 during ball 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.990
 my intention of this trip 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.830
 is to pass on to them 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.800
