every<00:00:22.439> year<00:00:22.710> check<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.580> mothership<00:00:24.119> do

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
every year check out this mothership do

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.750 
every year check out this mothership do
you<00:00:24.359> see<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> yet<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.099> area<00:00:26.640> right

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you see it yet it's in this area right

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.540 
you see it yet it's in this area right
here<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:27.119> circling<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.859> this<00:00:28.859> mothership

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
here I'm circling it this mothership

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.420 
here I'm circling it this mothership
isn't<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.300> created<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.869> solar<00:00:31.199> explosion<00:00:31.859> when

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
isn't it created a solar explosion when

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
isn't it created a solar explosion when
it<00:00:32.520> came<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> Sun<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.020> see

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it came out of the Sun you can see

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.400 
it came out of the Sun you can see
trails<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.090> surface<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> Sun<00:00:36.930> still

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
trails of the surface of the Sun still

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.400 
trails of the surface of the Sun still
trailing<00:00:38.010> off<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.640> craft<00:00:39.000> some<00:00:39.750> massive

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
trailing off of this craft some massive

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.889 
trailing off of this craft some massive
triangle<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> here's<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
triangle here it is here's the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
triangle here it is here's the
mothership<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:44.100> ship<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> basically<00:00:44.789> about

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
mothership this ship is basically about

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.549 
mothership this ship is basically about
the<00:00:45.450> size<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.989> our<00:00:46.110> moon<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.469> huge<00:00:48.350> there<00:00:49.350> must

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the size of our moon is huge there must

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.080 
the size of our moon is huge there must
have<00:00:49.620> been<00:00:49.710> another<00:00:50.039> camera<00:00:50.430> besides<00:00:50.730> NASA

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
have been another camera besides NASA

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
have been another camera besides NASA
that<00:00:51.420> noticed<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.170> okay<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.010> look<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that noticed this okay so look at that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
that noticed this okay so look at that
here<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.690> here's<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> angles<00:00:55.590> here's<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
here it is here's the angles here's the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.080 
here it is here's the angles here's the
angles<00:00:57.680> okay<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> massive<00:00:59.520> triangle

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
angles okay so it's a massive triangle

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.290 
angles okay so it's a massive triangle
some<00:01:00.570> massive<00:01:01.050> triangle<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
some massive triangle really is I

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.179 
some massive triangle really is I
altered<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> contrast<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
altered the contrast on this one on the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.730 
altered the contrast on this one on the
close-up<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> better

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
close-up so you can see it better

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.109 
close-up so you can see it better
because<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.250> too<00:01:08.549> much<00:01:08.700> light

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
because there was just too much light

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.570 
because there was just too much light
you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.020> well<00:01:10.290> enough<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.130> put

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you can see it well enough so if I put

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.289 
you can see it well enough so if I put
it<00:01:11.700> back<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.119> normal<00:01:12.479> mode<00:01:12.869> okay<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.010> is

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
it back in normal mode okay here it is

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
it back in normal mode okay here it is
we're<00:01:15.299> back<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.750> normal<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.710> normal<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
we're back to normal this is normal so I

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
we're back to normal this is normal so I
just<00:01:17.939> alter<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> contrast<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
just alter the contrast a little bit to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310 
just alter the contrast a little bit to
see<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.759> better<00:01:21.140> look<00:01:22.140> at<00:01:22.290> that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
see a little bit better look at that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.740 
see a little bit better look at that
look<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> writing

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
look at that so right not a writing

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.679 
look at that so right not a writing
course<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.400> 45<00:01:26.400> degree<00:01:26.520> angle<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.150> look<00:01:27.600> at

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
course a 45 degree angle here look at

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.590 
course a 45 degree angle here look at
that<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.320> amazing<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> wanted<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> share

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that very amazing so I wanted to share

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.830 
that very amazing so I wanted to share
that<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.049> let<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.680> zoom<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.720> let<00:01:33.720> me
