00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
just going to go out and you know one

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
just going to go out and you know one
thing<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.060> was

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
thing I was just that I think was

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.550 
thing I was just that I think was
missing<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.659> game<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> wasn't<00:01:31.290> attacking

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
missing for my game I wasn't attacking

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.270 
missing for my game I wasn't attacking
and<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.409> passive<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> that's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and you know a little passive and that's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
and you know a little passive and that's
why<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.659> less<00:01:36.659> missing<00:01:36.960> shots<00:01:37.140> such<00:01:37.439> an

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
why I think less missing shots such an

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.230 
why I think less missing shots such an
ego<00:01:37.799> either<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.100> attack<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> play<00:01:38.759> my<00:01:39.030> game

against<00:03:53.860> texas<00:03:54.250> i<00:03:54.459> think<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:55.860> little<00:03:56.860> bit<00:03:57.069> of<00:03:57.220> us

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
against texas i think a little bit of us

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.949 
against texas i think a little bit of us
might<00:03:57.580> have<00:03:57.670> been<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:57.819> little<00:03:58.030> satisfied<00:03:58.660> or

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
might have been a little satisfied or

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.260 
might have been a little satisfied or
just<00:03:59.230> felt<00:04:00.070> like<00:04:00.280> we<00:04:00.520> were<00:04:00.610> supposed<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.060> win

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
just felt like we were supposed to win

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.850 
just felt like we were supposed to win
and<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.940> know<00:04:04.030> not<00:04:04.209> not<00:04:04.600> perfect<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.380> course

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
and you know not not perfect of course
