00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.569
 [Music] 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:11.190
 [Applause] 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.840
 We ask you to stay at the desk 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.740
 now always a picture with many 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.170
 Christmas motives exactly one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.350
 So only one motive comes in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.750
 identical shape twice before exactly 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 This would tell me who pushes has 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.080
 five seconds time moment one me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 to give an answer if one immediately 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.770
 example, this is like memory or what you do 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.040
 you see many motives in one picture 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 and only one is there twice 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.710
 this mystery mines has five 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
 seconds to give his answer 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.430
 is she right there is a point 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.899
 the wrong gets the opponent one 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.969
 point and the picture is from the game who 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.860
 the first six points wins 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.120
 play stefan pay cut or you guys 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.949
 both examples 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.230
 then that explains everything by itself 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:03.899
 Here is the picture which motif comes in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:06.090
 identical shape twice in front of the drum 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.970
 but understood how it works 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.049
 he expects the name sage before 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.020
 one of you gives an answer 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.720
 truly called that now 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.670
 yes that will be clear so trump 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.900
 or boots would not matter or boots here 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.250
 This case does not matter much 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.500
 clearly recognizable what comes then 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.720
 motiv always comes twice for a motive 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 'image' in twice before as a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740
 question it is always this composition 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 or if more can all 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.340
 So, we're already ok three now 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.770
 how much do I have to score six points 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.950
 find couples and start with this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.950
 picture which motive there are two make 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:52.690
 because I thought the sick gaal thought 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.070
 the wreath is not critical 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.820
 replied show you what motive 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.710
 is twice the sled first us 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.840
 trust because the process is the wreath 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.340
 so not with this wreath because of 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.200
 different is the very white 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 what are different are the size 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.759
 it's about what it actually is 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.320
 behind in the first place nachrodter 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.700
 cut is exactly what he completely 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.850
 exactly the same as identical color size 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 put together 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:28.410
 1 0 for stefan which motive comes in 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:31.800
 identical shape twice the boot 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.800
 solve 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.280
 [Music] 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.280
 it is the two to zero boot 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.750
 new game new luck which motive 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.770
 [Music] 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.419
 [Music] 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.970
 [Music] 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.970
 please rest in the studio 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.240
 what motivates me on this front 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.930
 because those little animals are down there on the left 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.360
 the factual that is relative so 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.790
 that's right, I'll let that apply now 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.260
 but it is a moose or a higher one 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.070
 smuggler so the teacher at one 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.760
 hard or 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.010
 I thought because if all individually then 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.440
 first point so that only 2 2 1 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.690
 leadership for stefan new image which 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.959
 motiv comes twice in identical form 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.959
 in front 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.719
 [Music] 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:47.970
 the gyro and it is the journey 31 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.970
 both already new picture which motiv 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.700
 [Music] 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 yes I would take you but is the 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.630
 is another mother wrote 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.580
 these are three stables with different ones 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.840
 benefit there is directly that is true because 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.640
 In this case, you teach 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.640
 been Christmas haase 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:22.670
 January 32 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:25.620
 [Applause] 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.540
 a new picture which motif comes in 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.540
 identical shape twice before 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.950
 [Music] 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.800
 the christmas the christmas balls and 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:02.180
 we solve and it is correct 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.490
 33 at half-time six, so to speak 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.840
 points and win 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.970
 we have more pictures even more 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.479
 motive but there is only in the next picture 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.630
 one identical and twice 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:17.810
 events 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.889
 what is this snow globe made of 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.260
 the water glass 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:26.289
 I do not know where that was seen so fast 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.289
 But you have determined how fast google 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.539
 in the lead 4 to 3 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.330
 [Music] 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:39.220
 full concentration which motivator comes 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.220
 in identical form twice before 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:55.580
 jenna gingerbread man gingerbread or 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.250
 Girl is right up to three with it 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.110
 the leadership 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.660
 my radio has generally you decide 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:06.490
 this game is also new for you 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.490
 picture which motive 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.170
 [Music] 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.600
 because the remains, the two bell the 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.690
 both bells and that would be the sixth 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.640
 location 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.100
 [Music] 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.720
 [Applause] 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:37.670
 [Music] 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.800
 my and jenna dax back you still have 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.050
 reversed won important points for 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.710
 We look at the total number of points 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.360
 once on 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:53.270
 China is building its leaders a bit 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:57.490
 Up to 14 means knocking out candles 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.490
 ready, Set, Go 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.670
 So how well have the core business 

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.980
 is that good already is very good 

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.600
 On the way raab is great on the way 

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.990
 had he I say but then quickly 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.990
 won
