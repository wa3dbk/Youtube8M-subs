was<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.059> progression<00:00:28.570> you<00:00:28.869> know<00:00:29.020> was<00:00:29.349> the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
was the progression you know was the

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.960 
was the progression you know was the
thing<00:00:29.739> to<00:00:29.770> do<00:00:32.130> start<00:00:33.130> with<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.399> Hollies<00:00:33.790> and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
thing to do start with the Hollies and

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.090 
thing to do start with the Hollies and
switch<00:00:34.120> ollies<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:34.540> then<00:00:34.870> frontside<00:00:35.770> shove

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
switch ollies and then frontside shove

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.970

act is actually the land fakie on the
landing<00:00:42.040> and<00:00:42.130> then<00:00:42.280> hit<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.520> quarter<00:00:42.820> switch

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
landing and then hit the quarter switch

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.290 
landing and then hit the quarter switch
is<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:44.350> little<00:00:44.680> bit<00:00:44.800> scarier<00:00:45.280> than<00:00:45.490> dropping<00:00:45.940> in

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
is a little bit scarier than dropping in

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.510 
is a little bit scarier than dropping in
switch<00:00:46.630> and<00:00:46.990> doing<00:00:47.560> a<00:00:47.620> switchback<00:00:47.830> than<00:00:48.250> 180

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
switch and doing a switchback than 180

ollie<00:00:48.730> where<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.090> land<00:00:49.300> forward<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:49.960> when<00:00:50.740> I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
ollie where you land forward so when I

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.800 
ollie where you land forward so when I
learned<00:00:51.010> backside<00:00:51.550> 180<00:00:51.790> Ollie's<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.480> was<00:00:52.600> like

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
learned backside 180 Ollie's it was like

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.710 
learned backside 180 Ollie's it was like
okay<00:00:53.320> this<00:00:53.350> is<00:00:53.590> rad<00:00:54.160> i<00:00:54.190> mean<00:00:54.579> that's<00:00:54.760> like<00:00:54.880> the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
okay this is rad i mean that's like the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.360 
okay this is rad i mean that's like the
feeling<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.320> i<00:00:56.350> never<00:00:56.680> thought<00:00:56.950> i'd<00:00:57.130> have

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
feeling that i never thought i'd have

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.119 
feeling that i never thought i'd have
going<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.000> fast<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:58.600> far

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.920 

things<00:01:04.790> just<00:01:04.850> start<00:01:05.149> progressing<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:05.899> I

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
things just start progressing then I

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.170 
things just start progressing then I
just<00:01:06.200> started<00:01:06.469> try<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.829> kick<00:01:07.039> flips<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.610> I

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
just started try and kick flips and I

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.469 
just started try and kick flips and I
think<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.049> first<00:01:09.549> complex<00:01:10.549> flip<00:01:11.090> trick<00:01:11.299> on

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
think the first complex flip trick on

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.990 
think the first complex flip trick on
there's<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.930> switch<00:01:12.170> backside<00:01:12.380> flip<00:01:12.970> over<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
there's a switch backside flip over the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.779 
there's a switch backside flip over the
gap<00:01:16.899> eventually<00:01:17.979> after<00:01:18.979> i<00:01:19.189> had<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.429> backside

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
gap eventually after i had the backside

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.399 
gap eventually after i had the backside
180<00:01:20.030> ollie<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.390> wanted<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.750> learn<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.020> backside

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
180 ollie I wanted to learn the backside

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.740 
180 ollie I wanted to learn the backside
flip<00:01:21.679> I<00:01:21.829> mean<00:01:22.039> dollars<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.490> next<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:23.450> you

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
flip I mean dollars the next one you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.690 
flip I mean dollars the next one you
know<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:24.110> learned<00:01:24.350> frontside<00:01:24.890> flips<00:01:25.220> for

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
know and I learned frontside flips for

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.029 
know and I learned frontside flips for
the<00:01:25.759> foot<00:01:26.030> video<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.569> I<00:01:26.840> never<00:01:27.649> thought<00:01:27.740> that

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
the foot video and I never thought that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.499 
the foot video and I never thought that
was<00:01:28.310> going<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.460> be<00:01:28.520> possible<00:01:28.970> just<00:01:29.060> because<00:01:29.390> of

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
was going to be possible just because of

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.210 
was going to be possible just because of
the<00:01:29.539> way<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.869> board<00:01:30.110> spins<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:30.740> flips<00:01:30.860> and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
the way the board spins and flips and

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.249 
the way the board spins and flips and
the<00:01:31.340> wind<00:01:31.549> catches<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.479> know<00:01:32.600> going

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
the wind catches and you know going

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.109 
the wind catches and you know going
frontside<00:01:33.799> 180<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.310> lot<00:01:34.520> harder<00:01:34.670> than<00:01:34.850> going

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
frontside 180 is a lot harder than going

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.660 
frontside 180 is a lot harder than going
switch<00:01:35.450> back<00:01:35.659> 780<00:01:36.140> just<00:01:36.979> cuz<00:01:37.099> the<00:01:37.220> Wayne<00:01:37.399> kind

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
switch back 780 just cuz the Wayne kind

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.260 
switch back 780 just cuz the Wayne kind
of<00:01:37.759> holds<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.119> board<00:01:38.330> onto<00:01:38.509> your<00:01:38.720> feet<00:01:38.899> but

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
of holds the board onto your feet but

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.249 
of holds the board onto your feet but
able<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.299> figure<00:01:41.509> out<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.750> way<00:01:41.929> we're<00:01:42.170> actually

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
able to figure out a way we're actually

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.620 
able to figure out a way we're actually
flicked<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.280> then<00:01:43.399> held<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.970> with<00:01:44.119> one<00:01:44.330> foot

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
flicked and then held it with one foot

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.179 
flicked and then held it with one foot
with<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.869> wind<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.470> know<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:45.770> kind<00:01:46.159> of

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
with the wind you know I just kind of

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.559 
with the wind you know I just kind of
like<00:01:46.399> turning<00:01:46.700> around<00:01:46.789> was<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.270> one<00:01:47.420> way

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
like turning around was like the one way

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.929 
like turning around was like the one way
that<00:01:47.720> i<00:01:47.780> found<00:01:48.049> out<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:48.229> worked<00:01:48.819> and<00:01:49.819> it

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
that i found out that worked and it

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.039 
that i found out that worked and it
worked<00:01:50.119> for<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.299> frontside<00:01:50.630> flip<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.020> I

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
worked for the frontside flip and I

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.510 
worked for the frontside flip and I
figure<00:01:51.319> while<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.530> should<00:01:51.979> be<00:01:52.130> able<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.399> do<00:01:52.490> a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
figure while I should be able to do a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.490 
figure while I should be able to do a
backside<00:01:52.909> flip<00:01:58.329> it<00:01:59.329> ends<00:01:59.479> up<00:01:59.630> being<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.200> lot

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
backside flip it ends up being a lot
