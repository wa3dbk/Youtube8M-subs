00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.860
 in this module of the course we are going to talk 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.100
 of the menu engineering remember that 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.030
 this concept has to do with how 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.830
 we are modifying the menu to 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.680
 experiment and try things that we 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.530
 lead to more profits with the menu 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.390
 that is, to arrive at a menu that is 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.359
 profitable 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.030
 as we said are a series of techniques 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.129
 to design a menu that generates more 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.220
 earnings the menu is changing 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.590
 constantly as we go 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.410
 evolving there is a curve of 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.150
 learning one is learning things going 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.600
 removing some products that do not 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.989
 they sell by injecting other products that 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.430
 yes they are sold when we have a product 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.530
 that it sells very well 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.570
 we could draw other versions a 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.000
 example of this would be if the cappuccino 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.730
 it sells me very well why not do ten 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.740
 varieties of cappuccino flavored if the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.990
 Martini sells us very well because it does not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 make 15 varieties of kingfisher and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.520
 flavored so these are the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.490
 techniques that can lead us to 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.940
 also increase our profits 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.119
 let's take it step by step step 1 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.410
 we have to review our menu 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.410
 Daily has to be done 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.899
 obviously at first what 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.479
 we do is list everything that 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.670
 we want we do not want a menu too 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.020
 complex we do not want a menu either 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.740
 too simple 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.500
 about 20 to 30 items on the menu is more 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.990
 that's enough because because in the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.610
 Insofar as we expand to 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.039
 menu to the client we do it more 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.540
 complicated the purchase and many of the 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.380
 customers despair and leave 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.660
 then that's the first two since what 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.450
 let's review let's see what elements are 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.060
 profitable and not profitable when 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.920
 we did the excel process you 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.060
 he realized that there were products that we 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.700
 gave a 30% profit as the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.820
 beer and wine in that case beer 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.760
 and the wine will see that they consume them 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.310
 too much then there would be several 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.830
 options to increase profits are 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.450
 could increase the price and so on 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.170
 what I was saying at that moment is that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.420
 try to get to 50 percent 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.880
 of utility for those products that are 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.530
 so simple however in the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.740
 products that already have preparation 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.730
 we have to look for a margin of 70% 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.160
 if there are products that are not profitable 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.230
 It would be worth taking them out of the menu and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.739
 products that are profitable where 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.989
 you win very well let's try to 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.870
 beat them a little more happens with the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.980
 express passes with the Americans passes 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.370
 with the martins 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.980
 and the cocktails 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.560
 then what we want to do in 13 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.420
 is that daily our barista 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.000
 our bartender waiters 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.610
 promote those products that are 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.890
 profitable if you discover that the pies 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.800
 they are very profitable and they sell very well 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.990
 they have a very good margin we are going to 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.350
 promote that 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.840
 4 must be eliminated as much as possible 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.940
 as possible what is not profitable and 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.240
 you will find out why I make a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.070
 Remove from the menu experiment something not 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.260
 be profitable, suppose that the 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.660
 cakes are not profitable in their 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.170
 food business we're going to take away some 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.620
 three days let's see what happens if the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 people are asking for it and asking and asking and asking 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.130
 then it means that we can not 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.340
 remove and we would have to apply another 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.220
 technique but if people do not ask for it and 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.580
 spend more means we did something 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.240
 better another thing that can be done is in 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.070
 instead of selling them a cake is to tell them 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.390
 well we do not have in this 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.820
 moment cakes we have croissants or 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.130
 chords and promote what yes 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.549
 profitable to change the client a little 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.400
 its forms its methods in a little bit what 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.519
 that you want for something similar is also 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.240
 timely 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.190
 analyze several menus and several menus 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.069
 I see what we are going to leave and what 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.590
 we remove what are the elements of the 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:35.259
 menu that may be for you more 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.539
 profitable in the first place are the 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.180
 non-alcoholic drinks you already realized 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.580
 that the coffees are highly profitable 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.460
 the sodas the Italian sodas and the 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.129
 tea and really have very little 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.590
 preparation are quick any 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.319
 person including waiters could 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.620
 enter and help make them in second 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.620
 place
