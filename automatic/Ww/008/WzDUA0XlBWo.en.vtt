00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
careful you can see that it's not

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.480 
careful you can see that it's not
remotely<00:00:25.480> aligned<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:27.170> beautiful<00:00:27.710> 1920<00:00:28.400> x

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
remotely aligned the beautiful 1920 x

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.379 
remotely aligned the beautiful 1920 x
1080<00:00:28.699> screen<00:00:29.060> with<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:33.460> desktop<00:00:34.460> which<00:00:35.239> is

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:35.389 
1080 screen with the desktop which is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:38.439 
1080 screen with the desktop which is
also<00:00:35.539> 1920<00:00:36.229> 1080<00:00:36.769> you<00:00:37.639> see<00:00:37.789> this<00:00:37.940> nice<00:00:38.120> inch

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
also 1920 1080 you see this nice inch

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.479 
also 1920 1080 you see this nice inch
thick<00:00:38.719> border<00:00:39.139> presumably<00:00:40.100> because<00:00:40.280> the

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
thick border presumably because the

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.239 
thick border presumably because the
operating<00:00:41.059> system<00:00:41.389> thinks<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:42.319> is<00:00:42.379> a<00:00:42.530> TV<00:00:43.039> or

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
operating system thinks this is a TV or

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:44.439 
operating system thinks this is a TV or
something<00:00:43.519> maybe<00:00:43.789> or<00:00:44.089> something<00:00:44.120> with

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
something maybe or something with

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.750 
something maybe or something with
overscan<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.139> anyway<00:00:45.440> that's<00:00:46.339> not<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.549> issue

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
overscan but anyway that's not the issue

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.819 
overscan but anyway that's not the issue
so<00:00:47.149> another<00:00:47.539> monitor<00:00:47.809> here<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.289> how<00:00:48.409> I<00:00:48.440> switch

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
so another monitor here is how I switch

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.919 
so another monitor here is how I switch
there<00:00:49.729> you<00:00:49.789> go<00:00:49.909> that'd<00:00:50.149> be<00:00:50.299> the<00:00:50.389> button<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:50.690> push

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
there you go that'd be the button I push

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.079 
there you go that'd be the button I push
and<00:00:51.260> it<00:00:51.319> would<00:00:51.409> change<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:51.799> input<00:00:51.920> how<00:00:52.850> do<00:00:52.909> we

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
and it would change the input how do we

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.459 
and it would change the input how do we
do<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.299> over<00:00:53.600> here<00:00:53.629> tell<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.139> what<00:00:54.289> let's

it's<00:01:40.340> having<00:01:40.520> difficulty<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.179> notice<00:01:41.450> that

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
it's having difficulty you notice that

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.270 
it's having difficulty you notice that
the<00:01:41.659> login<00:01:42.020> screen<00:01:42.049> isn't<00:01:42.770> on<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.100> macbook

the login screen isn't on the macbook

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.219 
the login screen isn't on the macbook
which<00:01:43.700> means<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.240> thinks<00:01:44.600> it's<00:01:44.749> on<00:01:44.990> this

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
which means it thinks it's on this

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.770 
which means it thinks it's on this
screen<00:01:45.439> over<00:01:45.770> here<00:01:45.850> not<00:01:46.850> doing<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:47.359> well<00:01:47.390> so

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
screen over here not doing so well so

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.230 
screen over here not doing so well so
far<00:01:47.859> let's<00:01:48.859> have<00:01:49.100> another<00:01:49.219> go<00:01:49.460> maybe<00:01:50.030> it's

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
far let's have another go maybe it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.340 
far let's have another go maybe it's
because<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.539> mac<00:01:50.719> had<00:01:50.899> gone<00:01:51.079> to<00:01:51.229> sleep

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
because the mac had gone to sleep

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.989 
because the mac had gone to sleep
because<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.859> can't<00:01:52.039> find<00:01:52.249> the<00:01:52.429> screen<00:01:52.670> perhaps

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
because it can't find the screen perhaps

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.209 
because it can't find the screen perhaps
or<00:01:53.149> because<00:01:53.299> i'm<00:01:53.390> logged<00:01:53.600> out<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.740> do<00:01:54.950> menu

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
or because i'm logged out so do menu

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.179 
or because i'm logged out so do menu
again<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.840> then<00:01:56.840> we'll<00:01:56.929> get<00:01:57.020> menu<00:01:57.319> again<00:01:57.409> this

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
again and then we'll get menu again this

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.919 
again and then we'll get menu again this
time<00:01:58.490> we'll<00:01:58.700> wait<00:01:58.880> until<00:01:59.210> I've<00:01:59.329> made<00:01:59.569> sure<00:01:59.600> the

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
time we'll wait until I've made sure the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.219 
time we'll wait until I've made sure the
screen<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.409> awake<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.729> there<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:01.969> go<00:02:02.139> and<00:02:03.139> then

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
screen is awake so there we go and then
