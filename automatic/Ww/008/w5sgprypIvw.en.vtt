00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
shoulder injury it's nothing lifting

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.020 
shoulder injury it's nothing lifting
related<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> partially<00:01:29.790> torn

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.620 
labrum and a partially torn
supraspinatus<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> those<00:01:33.270> overhead

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
supraspinatus so those overhead

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.170 
supraspinatus so those overhead
movements<00:01:34.380> might<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> best<00:01:36.030> choice

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
movements might not be the best choice

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.569 
movements might not be the best choice
down<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> road<00:01:37.290> though<00:01:37.530> possibly<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.460> I'm

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
down the road though possibly if I'm

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.920 
down the road though possibly if I'm
able<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> without<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.900> risking

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
able to do it without you know risking

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.609 
able to do it without you know risking
injury<00:01:40.470> sure<00:01:41.570> next<00:01:42.570> question<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
injury sure next question is what is the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
injury sure next question is what is the
lowest<00:01:43.890> body<00:01:44.100> fat<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.970> myself<00:01:45.180> getting<00:01:45.659> two

and that's that's the tough one it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
and that's that's the tough one it
depends<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.680> any<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.189> shows<00:01:50.490> any

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
listed here but I would say in general

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.310

just<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.610> gram<00:04:28.849> per<00:04:29.090> pound<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.720> body<00:04:30.050> weight

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
just a gram per pound of body weight

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.990 
just a gram per pound of body weight
would<00:04:30.650> be<00:04:30.680> fine<00:04:35.440> next<00:04:36.440> question<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.610> how<00:04:37.789> did<00:04:37.970> I

would be fine next question is how did I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.270 
would be fine next question is how did I
overcome<00:04:38.419> squat<00:04:39.020> plateaus<00:04:39.500> if<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:39.949> ever<00:04:40.070> had

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
overcome squat plateaus if I ever had

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.129 
overcome squat plateaus if I ever had
this<00:04:40.400> issue<00:04:40.610> I've<00:04:41.210> never<00:04:41.479> really<00:04:41.750> had<00:04:41.900> this

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
this issue I've never really had this

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.740 
this issue I've never really had this
issue<00:04:42.349> just<00:04:42.740> because<00:04:42.860> I'm<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:44.330> new<00:04:44.570> to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
issue just because I'm so new to

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.200 
issue just because I'm so new to
squatting<00:04:45.729> competitively<00:04:46.729> like<00:04:46.910> in<00:04:47.150> a

never<00:04:50.240> really<00:04:50.599> stalled<00:04:51.110> per<00:04:51.440> se<00:04:51.680> just<00:04:52.009> because

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
never really stalled per se just because

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.219 
never really stalled per se just because
my<00:04:52.610> technique<00:04:53.210> at<00:04:53.419> this<00:04:53.570> point<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:53.990> still

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
my technique at this point is still

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.560 
my technique at this point is still
improved<00:04:54.650> pretty<00:04:54.979> consistently<00:04:55.669> so<00:04:56.539> I

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
improved pretty consistently so I

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.029 
improved pretty consistently so I
haven't<00:04:56.810> really<00:04:57.080> had<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.229> issue<00:04:57.530> ah<00:05:00.039> next

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
haven't really had that issue ah next

haven't really had that issue ah next
question<00:05:01.550> my<00:05:01.849> girlfriend<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.509> new<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.960> lifting

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
question my girlfriend is new to lifting

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.499 
question my girlfriend is new to lifting
but<00:05:03.530> she<00:05:03.710> lacks<00:05:03.919> confidence<00:05:04.340> in<00:05:04.849> herself<00:05:05.150> and

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
but she lacks confidence in herself and

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.659 
but she lacks confidence in herself and
her<00:05:05.659> ability<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.320> do<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.800> any<00:05:06.949> advice<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:07.310> can

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
her ability to do it any advice you can

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.879 
her ability to do it any advice you can
pass<00:05:07.880> on<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.389> would<00:05:09.139> say<00:05:09.259> the<00:05:09.409> biggest<00:05:09.590> thing

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
pass on I would say the biggest thing

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.920 
pass on I would say the biggest thing
for<00:05:09.919> you<00:05:10.159> would<00:05:10.310> be<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.460> lift<00:05:10.820> with<00:05:11.090> her<00:05:11.330> to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
for you would be to lift with her to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.689 
for you would be to lift with her to
guide<00:05:12.110> her<00:05:12.259> along<00:05:12.320> I'm<00:05:12.889> not<00:05:13.099> sure<00:05:13.280> what<00:05:13.520> she

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
guide her along I'm not sure what she

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.240 
guide her along I'm not sure what she
would<00:05:13.820> be<00:05:13.970> necessarily<00:05:15.250> self-conscious

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
would be necessarily self-conscious

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.830 
would be necessarily self-conscious
about<00:05:16.550> but<00:05:16.759> I<00:05:16.789> think<00:05:17.030> if<00:05:17.150> you're<00:05:17.300> supportive

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
about but I think if you're supportive

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.480 
about but I think if you're supportive
that's<00:05:18.050> really<00:05:18.320> all<00:05:18.500> she<00:05:18.770> should<00:05:18.800> need<00:05:19.009> I

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
that's really all she should need I

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.040 
that's really all she should need I
think<00:05:19.849> it's<00:05:20.150> more<00:05:20.300> of<00:05:20.449> you<00:05:20.659> being<00:05:20.870> there

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
think it's more of you being there

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.439 
think it's more of you being there
versus<00:05:21.590> actually<00:05:22.130> giving<00:05:22.460> her<00:05:22.610> advice<00:05:22.699> if<00:05:23.240> you

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
versus actually giving her advice if you

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.980 
versus actually giving her advice if you
can<00:05:23.690> be<00:05:23.900> there<00:05:24.639> next<00:05:25.639> question<00:05:26.330> how<00:05:26.509> much<00:05:26.659> time

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
can be there next question how much time

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.670 
can be there next question how much time
eat<00:05:27.500> okay

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
eat okay

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.659 
eat okay
what<00:05:30.680> are<00:05:30.770> my<00:05:30.860> thoughts<00:05:31.099> on<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.520> recent

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
what are my thoughts on the recent

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.520 
what are my thoughts on the recent
increase<00:05:32.360> in<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.719> number<00:05:32.990> of<00:05:33.080> females

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
increase in the number of females

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.080 
increase in the number of females
participating<00:05:34.340> in<00:05:34.460> strength<00:05:34.820> training

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
participating in strength training

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.620 
participating in strength training
physique<00:05:35.780> training<00:05:36.289> etc<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.240> think<00:05:38.330> there

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
physique training etc so I think there

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.719 
physique training etc so I think there
are<00:05:38.719> enough<00:05:38.900> positive<00:05:39.500> female<00:05:39.710> influences<00:05:40.520> in

are enough positive female influences in
the<00:05:40.880> sport<00:05:41.240> I<00:05:41.479> want<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.169> say<00:05:42.320> there<00:05:42.530> enough<00:05:42.860> yet

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
the sport I want to say there enough yet

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.610 
the sport I want to say there enough yet

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210

more<00:06:27.620> than<00:06:28.159> about<00:06:28.789> training<00:06:29.180> and<00:06:29.449> about

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
more than about training and about

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:31.320 
more than about training and about
nutrition<00:06:30.229> than<00:06:30.379> I<00:06:30.409> would<00:06:30.710> have<00:06:30.740> otherwise

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
doesn't tend to give this that I

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.890

get a job anywhere because I'm

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:42.550 
get a job anywhere because I'm
self-employed<00:06:40.669> so<00:06:41.659> I<00:06:41.690> I<00:06:41.750> definitely<00:06:42.319> wouldn't
