00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
this one I was thinking would I be able

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
this one I was thinking would I be able
to<00:01:23.280> actually<00:01:23.520> promote<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.810> starting

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
to actually promote like you're starting

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
to actually promote like you're starting
to<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.350> down<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> wire<00:01:26.040> would<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.549> just

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
to get down to the wire would be just

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.730 
to get down to the wire would be just
losing<00:01:27.360> too<00:01:27.479> many<00:01:27.659> stupid<00:01:27.990> games<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> was
