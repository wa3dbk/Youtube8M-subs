00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:12.719
 Good day to all today, March 8 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:15.650
 almost 4 o'clock in the afternoon I set out rather 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.960
 gathered in this place all last year 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.960
 August layers connected 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.000
 put the heaters 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.449
 every challenge chick finished mounting 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.550
 connection 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:39.120
 heating here I have 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.420
 thermostat means at the beginning when 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.760
 put a thermal sensor 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.329
 thermal sensor will show by this 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.850
 evidence 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.520
 it means now on the street plus 6 degrees 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 strong wind don't know how visible 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.730
 you can see + 6 when before connecting was 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.729
 temperature 16 is the top bracket under 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.640
 polyethylene and now for half an hour now 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.510
 work 20 and a half degrees 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680
 hesitates 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.119
 120 and a half that 21, I have set 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.570
 here's the temperature at 25 degrees yet 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.170
 I will overclock more 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.750
 so that the families would be buried now 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.570
 keep control 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.100
 look at the condensate like this 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.380
 I do so that the rain did not fall well 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 simply 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 from improvised means but in this way 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.119
 everything is under connected so i 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.759
 I help everyone from vodka which is very 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:58.590
 little let's say out of wintering here on 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.130
 like no matter what the wind is just 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.100
 much I will not open it practically 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.810
 he is not visible under the dressing somewhere more 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:19.470
 somewhere less this one is a little bigger 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:20.250
 here we will show here they are more active here 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.280
 bees 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:28.440
 well now the heat has gone already cover 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:32.910
 opened much warmer but so 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.599
 way we will observe here with us 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:45.600
 thermal sensor now try to show 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:46.850
 if only he had not popped the thermal sensor out 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:03:00.450
 it costs 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:03:01.110
 the bees are more active in the bottom now 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.330
 teach 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:13.500
 the case below this situation there plenochka 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:16.230
 the bees walk on it calmly with 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.980
 film temperature will not rise 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:27.060
 above 30 35 degrees well, who cares 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.690
 write explain what why but from 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:35.250
 experience shows that families are developing 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:38.239
 let's say 30 percent 50 percent faster all 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.250
