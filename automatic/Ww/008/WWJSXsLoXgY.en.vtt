 are also standard 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.770

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.250
 sportstar base means that we are talking about 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.869
 what a moment the sportster 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 1200 1200 kubik has 96 newton meters so 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.570
 already strong bike for the likewise 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.210
 said sportster series relatively 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.520
 build compact space 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.530
 the motorcycle is even below 300 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.439
 kilo if you only 270 5 gang 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.790
 I can do it now if I am to 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.110
 to have even more protection for Vienna, for example 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.540
 would like a higher one higher 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.820

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.930
