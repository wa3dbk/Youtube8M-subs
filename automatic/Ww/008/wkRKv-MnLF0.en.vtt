00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.350
 ok hi everyone this is the review 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.240
 of the brown gun so the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 my polis caliber 8 mm as you can 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.780
 see from the writing also called 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:21.779
 walter ppk s or that this is the box 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:25.170
 in which, despite the gun, he ordered it 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.939
 bought on airsoft target san marino al 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.490
 price of 50 euros plus shipping 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.099
 stola ok 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.739
 this is the gun of course we put 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.480
 aside inside the box 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.160
 we find toothbrush to clean the barrel 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.219
 very helpful 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 yes it should be cleaned after each use 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:53.449
 a gun and instructions in Italian e 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.530
 in other languages 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.329
 behind the education there are all the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.489
 gun parts because interested 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.470
 in short, to take it apart with precision 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.799
 let's now look at the specific 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.799
 gun 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.439
 here it is not yet unfortunately here 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.450
 under the blows however before buying 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.670
 this gun or buy the average 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.720
 these three caliber 9 shells 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.720
 this 6-gauge case 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 we'll see later the casings and what has to do with it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 this video we see the gun in the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.479
 specific under the football of course there is 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.420
 the eight-body charger I think so 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.119
 very realistic very very realistic 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.100
 all the iron included the gun 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.590
 the gun weighs 600 25 grams with 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:02.360
 charger inserted ok this way 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.360
 we find the manual safety 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.659
 what it does practically when 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.230
 assigned to the safe you see that the dog 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.290
 ours is a little back if you see 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:17.500
 What makes something around inside 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.480
 it doesn't make the percussor beat ok 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.150
 so if we omit the dog on football 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.810
 very nice this very useful grid 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.690
 for the handle of the pulsating gun 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.310
 for extraction of the symbol loader 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:44.250
 of the milling browns and let's say so for 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.250
 the trigger handle and under guard 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.069
 qua bruni my policy caliber 8 mm k made 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.540
 in italy 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.780
 the rest of the shell is like this 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.030
 clean between a few lines we turn the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.709
 part other parts of the same kick does not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.680
 he has secured it for us then 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.410
 ambidextrous norm is however possible 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.810
 see the actual extractor on 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.400
 outside the body of the gun 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:19.260
 the barrel with the hole for the exit of the 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.579
 fire during the shooting sights 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.069
 absolutely useless for a gun a 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.829
 hi, why don't you shoot? 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.480
 but the target does not hit him because 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.620
 does not have a real bullet 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.380
 inside it just makes a lot of noise though 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.069
 beautiful aesthetically ok we go to see 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.780
 now the loader and we put these 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.730
 9 caliber new shots you'll be wondering 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.359
 how do 9 caliber go into a 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.810
 8 gauge 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.549
 honestly I am not, but I have 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.889
 the fact is that they come in with some 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:56.290
 difficulty however we see of course that 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:59.049
 as soon as it is unloaded the shot does not enter 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.120
 calm because obviously not his 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.959
 caliber 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.959
 if instead we put 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:19.780
 this 6 mm case obviously 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.780
 they come into the barrel and look for a moment 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.010
 we see those structures working at 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.010
 perfection 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.500
 obviously when the blows are not there 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.730
 cart remains backward and 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.700
 the shutter open when you go to 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.120
 remove the charger the cart will go 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.760
 forward 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.090
 now let's remove the gun by pulling the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.450
 under guard down and the cart 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.810
 behind at the same time 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.610
 ok now we have the three main parts 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.610
 of the gun 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:59.060
 ie the real gun body and its 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:01.160
 a little load the trolley and then ok 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.050
 you can still mount the gun 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.300
 but I honestly never did and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.460
 I don't even know if I intend to do it but yes 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.070
 can remove this spring 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.100
 here putting the load back on the trolley 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.150
 in the same way as before, ie below 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.190
 guard down ok 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:25.850
 we will see that it does not go on because 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:30.200
 obviously there is no spring to dismantle 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:38.229
 and we try again the charger and the 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:41.870
 sorry sorry I'm always confused 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:47.930
 we see in front that the cane is clogged 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:51.530
 with a red cap and a nice model of 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.780
 hello gun I would like so much 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.289
 try it because the shots don't 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.000
 still bought but I think it does 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.070
 really a nice bang so there 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.160
 I recommend an excellent gun is a lot 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.139
 faithful well thank you for today is everything 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.979
 thanks for watching the video 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.979
 see you soon. Bye
