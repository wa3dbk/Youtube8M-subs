three different recommendations
first<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.449> job<00:01:03.750> when<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.409> fuel

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
first of all do this job when your fuel

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
first of all do this job when your fuel
tank<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.610> empty<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.150> case

something goes wrong it would minimize

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.789 
something goes wrong it would minimize
the<00:01:08.490> size<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> spill<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.320> second<00:01:10.680> thing

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the size of the spill the second thing

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
the size of the spill the second thing
you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.400> refer<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.909> Bentley

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you can do is refer to your Bentley

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.410 
you can do is refer to your Bentley
manual<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.810> find<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:13.350> fuse<00:01:14.420> controls

manual and find out which fuse controls

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.010 
manual and find out which fuse controls
the<00:01:15.750> fuel<00:01:16.170> pump<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.060> remove<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.630> let

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the fuel pump and remove that and let

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
the fuel pump and remove that and let
your<00:01:19.170> motor<00:01:19.350> run<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.189> couple<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.640> seconds

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
your motor run for a couple of seconds

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
your motor run for a couple of seconds
it<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.299> die<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.500> might<00:01:22.680> reduce

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it will die out and that might reduce

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.510 
it will die out and that might reduce
the<00:01:23.700> pressure<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.590> fuel<00:01:25.920> pump<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the pressure to the fuel pump to the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.030 
the pressure to the fuel pump to the
fuel<00:01:26.790> filter<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> last<00:01:28.320> thing<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
fuel filter and then the last thing is

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
fuel filter and then the last thing is
to<00:01:29.280> make<00:01:30.030> sure<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.509> car<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.869> completely

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

to make sure that the car is completely
cooled<00:01:31.740> off<00:01:32.060> before<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.479> job<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
cooled off before you do this job you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.330 
cooled off before you do this job you
wouldn't<00:01:34.140> want<00:01:34.409> any<00:01:34.619> heat<00:01:35.250> igniting<00:01:35.939> fuel<00:01:37.340> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
plug and here's the front toward and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.370 
plug and here's the front toward and
this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.310> toward<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.579> rear<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> shield

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
this is toward the rear this is a shield

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.980 
this is toward the rear this is a shield
that's<00:01:55.890> covering<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.119> fuel<00:01:57.390> filter<00:01:57.780> that's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that's covering the fuel filter that's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.370 
that's covering the fuel filter that's
right<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.500> I've<00:01:59.280> already<00:01:59.640> removed<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.719> screw

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
right here I've already removed a screw

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.300 
right here I've already removed a screw
here<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.700> another<00:02:03.500> attachment<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:05.009> this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
here there is another attachment up this

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.370 
here there is another attachment up this
direction<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.329> cut<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.469> zip<00:02:07.829> tie

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
direction and then I cut a zip tie

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.370 
direction and then I cut a zip tie
was<00:02:08.560> there<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.120> I'm<00:02:10.240> going<00:02:10.480> to<00:02:10.570> remove<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
was there and so I'm going to remove the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.230 
was there and so I'm going to remove the
two<00:02:14.650> remaining<00:02:15.990> pieces<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.760> them<00:02:18.940> this

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
two remaining pieces one of them this

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.910 
two remaining pieces one of them this
one's<00:02:19.450> kind<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.870> funky<00:02:20.350> looking<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:22.830> hope<00:02:23.830> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
one's kind of a funky looking I hope you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.500 
one's kind of a funky looking I hope you
call<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> bolt<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:24.910> kind<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.150> funky

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
call it a bolt but it's kind of funky

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.860 
call it a bolt but it's kind of funky
looking<00:02:25.840> then<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:27.070> one<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:28.180> hex<00:02:28.570> headed

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
looking then this one is a hex headed

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.940 
looking then this one is a hex headed
screw<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:32.140> I'm<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.380> start<00:02:32.710> them<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
screw so I'm going to start them with a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.980 
screw so I'm going to start them with a
ratchet<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.640> actually<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.600> might<00:02:34.750> want<00:02:34.930> to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
ratchet and actually you might want to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.330 
ratchet and actually you might want to
put<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.320> tool<00:02:35.650> list<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.690> nut<00:02:37.690> driver

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
put on your tool list a nut driver

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.140 
put on your tool list a nut driver
because<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.550> will<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:41.470> very<00:02:41.500> helpful<00:02:42.150> in

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
because that will be very helpful in

00:02:43.150 --> 00:03:02.010 
because that will be very helpful in
getting<00:02:43.360> these<00:02:43.660> rest<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.680> way<00:02:44.830> off<00:03:01.020> so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
getting these rest of the way off so

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.130 
getting these rest of the way off so
here<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.320> see<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> fuel<00:03:02.830> filter<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:05.080> is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
here you see the fuel filter and this is

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.170 
here you see the fuel filter and this is
a<00:03:05.290> clamp<00:03:05.710> that<00:03:06.010> clamp<00:03:06.550> will<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.060> be

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
a clamp that clamp will have to be

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.510 
a clamp that clamp will have to be
removed<00:03:07.510> there's<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> little<00:03:08.710> nut<00:03:08.950> there<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
removed there's a little nut there and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.540 
removed there's a little nut there and
then<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.870> side<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.440> hose<00:03:11.920> will<00:03:12.220> need<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.460> be

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
then this side this hose will need to be

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.000 
then this side this hose will need to be
clamped<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.210> this<00:03:14.080> hose<00:03:14.350> will<00:03:14.650> need<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.890> be

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
clamped and this hose will need to be

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.980 
clamped and this hose will need to be
clamped

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
clamped

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.440 
clamped
okay<00:03:16.990> so<00:03:17.050> I've<00:03:17.320> clamped<00:03:17.680> off<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.670> hose<00:03:18.940> and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
okay so I've clamped off this hose and

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.280 
okay so I've clamped off this hose and
this<00:03:20.380> hose<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.980> then<00:03:21.340> I've<00:03:21.930> removed<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
this hose and then I've removed the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.400 
this hose and then I've removed the
clamp<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.830> holds<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.600> fuel<00:03:25.870> filter<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.710> I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
clamp that holds in the fuel filter so I

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.430 
clamp that holds in the fuel filter so I
put<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> pan<00:03:30.040> underneath<00:03:30.580> here<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.440> sometimes

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
put a pan underneath here and sometimes

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.930 
put a pan underneath here and sometimes
the<00:03:32.950> fuel<00:03:33.220> filter<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:34.080> little<00:03:35.080> bit<00:03:35.200> sticky

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
the fuel filter is a little bit sticky

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.130 
the fuel filter is a little bit sticky
with<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.090> hose<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.630> been<00:03:37.780> there<00:03:37.930> for<00:03:38.110> a

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
with the hose and it's been there for a

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.700 
with the hose and it's been there for a
long<00:03:38.320> time<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.850> some<00:03:40.600> people<00:03:40.870> recommend<00:03:41.050> that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
long time so some people recommend that

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.190 
long time so some people recommend that
you<00:03:42.040> can<00:03:42.190> remove<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.760> clamps<00:03:43.240> and<00:03:43.420> then<00:03:43.540> make

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
you can remove the clamps and then make

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.270 
you can remove the clamps and then make
a<00:03:44.230> very<00:03:44.680> very<00:03:45.310> small<00:03:45.790> cut<00:03:46.210> in<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:47.440> hose<00:03:47.680> just<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
a very very small cut in the hose just a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.240 
a very very small cut in the hose just a
very<00:03:48.490> small<00:03:48.880> one<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:50.260> help<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.590> maybe<00:03:50.770> release

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
very small one to help it maybe release

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.390 
very small one to help it maybe release
from<00:03:51.790> sticking<00:03:52.120> on<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.470> fuel<00:03:53.740> filter<00:03:54.190> but

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
from sticking on the fuel filter but

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.230 
from sticking on the fuel filter but
that<00:03:55.090> was<00:03:55.240> not<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.570> case<00:03:55.810> here<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:57.640> I'm<00:03:58.090> going

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
that was not the case here so I'm going

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.850 
that was not the case here so I'm going
to<00:03:58.590> try<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.620> take<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.010> front<00:04:00.250> off<00:04:00.400> first

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.050 

see<00:04:06.730> some<00:04:07.000> fuel<00:04:07.780> spilling<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:11.290> car<00:04:11.560> only<00:04:11.740> has

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
see some fuel spilling this car only has

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.550 
see some fuel spilling this car only has
78,000<00:04:13.060> miles<00:04:13.210> on<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.570> but<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.930> is<00:04:14.050> 13<00:04:14.530> years

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
78,000 miles on it but it is 13 years

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.110 
78,000 miles on it but it is 13 years
old<00:04:14.980> so<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.640> replaced<00:04:16.570> some<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.110> the<00:04:17.820> fuel<00:04:18.820> hoses

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
old so I replaced some of the fuel hoses

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.120 
old so I replaced some of the fuel hoses
actually<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:19.810> replaced<00:04:20.230> three<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.680> them<00:04:20.860> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
actually I replaced three of them and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.380 
actually I replaced three of them and
all<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.790> related<00:04:22.120> clamps<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:25.210> might

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
all the related clamps and so you might

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.210 
all the related clamps and so you might
want<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.600> do<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.870> same<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.350> up<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.650> you<00:04:26.800> and

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
want to do the same it's up to you and

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.970 
want to do the same it's up to you and
the<00:04:27.400> next<00:04:27.550> step<00:04:27.880> is<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.300> install<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.110> new<00:04:29.350> fuel

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
the next step is to install the new fuel

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.790 
the next step is to install the new fuel
filter<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:31.110> recommend<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.260> first<00:04:32.500> put

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
filter I recommend that you first put

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.000 
filter I recommend that you first put

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
the this clamp and there's these hooks

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.340 
the this clamp and there's these hooks
here<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.520> go<00:04:36.700> in<00:04:36.910> up<00:04:37.630> there<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.200> lot

here that go in up there it's a lot

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.550 
here that go in up there it's a lot
easier<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.770> get<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.160> clamp<00:04:39.490> in<00:04:40.260> for<00:04:41.260> if<00:04:41.410> you

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560
