JACOB SOBOROFF: What's up, guys?

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.123
This is Jacob.

00:00:01.123 --> 00:00:03.167
Every day we bring you
the best videos around,

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:04.750
and today we have
got the biggest bike

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.520
jump in history, a high
schooler crushing his post game

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.020

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.320

JACOB SOBOROFF: Today more
than 120 world leaders

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.140
gathered in New York City
for a United Nations summit

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.099
on climate change.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.390
They were asked to come with
bold, game-changing ideas,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.931
and the meeting started with a
few words from Morgan Freeman.

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.660
-We have never faced
a crisis this big,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.366
but we have never had a better
opportunity to solve it.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.836
We have everything
we need to wake up

00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:41.306
to a different kind of world.

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:44.256
What is needed is
a concerted effort.

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:46.130
JACOB SOBOROFF: In
anticipation of the event,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.560
nearly 400,000 people filled
the streets of Manhattan

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.280
on Sunday for the
largest climate

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.480
change rally in history.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.800
It wasn't just New York.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.750
More than 2,700
rallies took place

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.334
in more than 150
countries worldwide.

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:00.250
Obviously, climate change
is a global problem,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.230
and we all have to
contribute to solve it.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.930
We put together a great playlist
for you about what's going on,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.300

Thankfully, Homemade
Modern is here to show you

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.750
how to make a pretty
adorable cement

stool at home using a bucket.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.030
How very sparse and
Scandinavian of them.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.212
-First cut the dowel into
three 16-inch pieces.

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:27.842
Shake and tap the bucket
to get the bubbles out.

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:33.250
LIZZIE: We went to
Home Depot, and then I

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.791
got to lift an
80-pound concrete bag.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:35.900
That was very exciting.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.852
It's so easy.

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:38.760
Anyone can do it.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.889
Mixing the concrete is
nowhere near as easy

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:41.930
as it looks in the video.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.724
If you don't have
a saw that's OK.

00:01:43.724 --> 00:01:45.640
You can go to a hardware
store and usually you

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.360
find somebody who
will help you cut it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.390
I did it, guys!

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.450

I want to see yours, so
take a photo or a video,

00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:55.600
and then tweet it at YouTube

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.450
chances are Travis
Pastrana has mastered it,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.550
but now the undisputed
king of motocross

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.210
is trying his hand
at filmmaking.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.220
-We started from
scratch, and came up

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.720
with this 20-foot-tall
take-off, which

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.070
is the absolutely
biggest, most insane jump

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.270
ever even thought of.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.260
JACOB SOBOROFF: Travis
has been posting

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.300
these insane behind the
scenes clips in the lead

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.880

his new film, "Action Figures."

Go over to the Nitro
Circus channel,

But now, there's
a cure-- Horizon.

The app was originally
released in January,

00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:39.750
but the latest version came
out a couple weeks back,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.140
and this short film perfectly
illustrates what most of us

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.440
have wished for for years.

this thing?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.251
-All right, well, at
first we started slow.

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:09.220
We started really slow.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.180
And you know, that's all right.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.971
That's OK, because
sometimes in life you're

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:12.860
going to start slow.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.630
That's OK.

senior Apollos Hester

and his football team in
Texas just won by one point

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.330
after being down by 14, and
he's feeling pretty good.

-But it took guts.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.990
It took an attitude.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.182
That's all it takes.

That's all it takes to be
successful, is an attitude.

It's an awesome feeling.

feeling when you truly

going to be successful.

Regardless of the situation,
regardless of the scoreboard,

00:03:33.662 --> 00:03:35.370
you're going to be
successful because you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.134
put in all the time, all the
effort, all the hard work.
