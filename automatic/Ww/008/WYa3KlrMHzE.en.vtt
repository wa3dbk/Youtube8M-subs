00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
them and I found a strategy that worked

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.080 
them and I found a strategy that worked
with<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.950> well<00:00:11.099> which<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.370> basically<00:00:11.670> once<00:00:11.910> they

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
with a well which is basically once they

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.879 
with a well which is basically once they
pull<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.450> under<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> run<00:00:13.200> away<00:00:13.290> that's

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
pull you under and you run away that's

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.589 
pull you under and you run away that's
when<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> easy<00:00:14.400> your<00:00:14.759> thresholds<00:00:15.269> cuz<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> know

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
when I easy your thresholds cuz you know

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.580 
when I easy your thresholds cuz you know
that<00:00:15.630> they're<00:00:15.809> not<00:00:15.839> gonna<00:00:16.020> pull<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.440> right

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
that they're not gonna pull you in right

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.420 
and then basically all you got to do is
you<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> teleport<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.950> bits<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.220> so

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you got a teleport a little bits out so

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.920 
you got a teleport a little bits out so
you<00:01:23.520> run<00:01:23.700> south<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.180> five<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.570> six<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.900> be

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you run south like five or six will be

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.030 
you run south like five or six will be
levels<00:01:25.259> depending<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.590> where<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.799> killing

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
levels depending on where you're killing

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950 
levels depending on where you're killing
them<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.390> teleport<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.840> your

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
them and then you teleport with your

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.539 
them and then you teleport with your
glory<00:01:28.110> back<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> Edgeville<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.070> easy<00:01:29.310> as

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
glory back to Edgeville and it's easy as

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
glory back to Edgeville and it's easy as
that<00:01:30.229> alright<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.470> let's<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:31.799> everything

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

eight mil and then the 114 ashes now the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.749 
eight mil and then the 114 ashes now the
thing<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> ashes<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.860> their<00:01:50.430> guide

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
thing about the ashes is their guide

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
thing about the ashes is their guide
price<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> GE<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.659> some<00:01:51.899> reason<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.380> only<00:01:52.530> one

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
price and GE for some reason is only one

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
price and GE for some reason is only one
point<00:01:52.920> seven<00:01:53.250> K<00:01:53.399> even<00:01:54.119> though<00:01:54.450> they're<00:01:54.810> going

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
point seven K even though they're going

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.359 
point seven K even though they're going
for<00:01:55.140> about<00:01:55.229> eight<00:01:55.500> K<00:01:55.710> right<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> they're

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
for about eight K right now and they're

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.620 
for about eight K right now and they're
probably<00:01:56.549> gonna<00:01:56.790> stay<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.119> way<00:01:57.299> just

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
probably gonna stay that way just

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.940 
probably gonna stay that way just
because<00:01:57.689> they're<00:01:57.990> very<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.439> good<00:01:58.680> for

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
because they're very very good for

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.399 
because they're very very good for
prayer<00:01:59.460> training<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.780> basically<00:02:01.079> that's

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
prayer training so basically that's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
prayer training so basically that's
another<00:02:01.920> 900<00:02:02.490> K<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> gets<00:02:02.939> added<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
another 900 K that gets added to the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
another 900 K that gets added to the
price<00:02:03.630> check<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.770> quite<00:02:04.979> good<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.369> was

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
price check so that's quite good it was

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
price check so that's quite good it was
about<00:02:05.610> 2.5<00:02:06.329> million<00:02:06.689> our<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.110> would<00:02:07.350> say<00:02:07.560> but

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
about 2.5 million our I would say but

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.619

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
like I said before it totally depends on

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.180 
like I said before it totally depends on
how<00:02:09.780> many

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
how many

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.730
