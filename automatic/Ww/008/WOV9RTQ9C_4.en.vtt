consideration<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.849> because

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
consideration with this is because

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
consideration with this is because
you'll<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.630> how<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.840> goes<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you'll see how this goes is the way the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.610 
you'll see how this goes is the way the
way<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.420> pre<00:00:33.420> passes<00:00:33.899> through<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.410> that

way the pre passes through the not that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.650 
way the pre passes through the not that
it's<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.860> place<00:00:35.300> compatible<00:00:36.300> maybe<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it's not place compatible maybe with a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
it's not place compatible maybe with a
lure<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:37.800> trouble<00:00:38.250> hooks<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.670> several

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
overhand knot which is kind of the first

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.069

over<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.070> way<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> then

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
over here not that way see that and then

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
over here not that way see that and then
what<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.070> extra<00:01:05.489> loop

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
what you do is you have this extra loop

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.330 
what you do is you have this extra loop
piece<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.180> sticking<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.189> do

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
piece that's sticking out and all you do

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.109 
piece that's sticking out and all you do
is<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> feed<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> lure<00:01:11.159> back<00:01:11.640> through<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
is you feed the lure back through the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.109 
is you feed the lure back through the
through<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.540> loop<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
through that loop and then you can you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.440 
through that loop and then you can you
pull<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> close<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:17.000> used<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.180> left<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
pull it close like this I used I left a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
pull it close like this I used I left a
lot<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> tail<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.650> bone<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.979> again

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
lot of tail on this one bone just again

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
lot of tail on this one bone just again
just<00:01:20.369> demonstrating<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.330> even<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
just demonstrating it to you I even this

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.800 
just demonstrating it to you I even this
knot<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.979> tied<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.430> cord<00:01:24.060> which<00:01:24.330> doesn't

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
knot on tied up this cord which doesn't

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
knot on tied up this cord which doesn't
vary<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.340> mono<00:01:26.580> film<00:01:26.820> or

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
vary it's not like mono film or

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.340 
vary it's not like mono film or
monofilament<00:01:27.299> tends<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.840> slide<00:01:28.140> together

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
monofilament tends to slide together

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
monofilament tends to slide together
really<00:01:28.650> quickly<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.570> cord<00:01:30.900> even

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
really quickly this this this cord even

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.950 
really quickly this this this cord even
still<00:01:31.500> wants<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.920> slide<00:01:32.430> together<00:01:32.670> nicely<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
still wants to slide together nicely and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
still wants to slide together nicely and
so<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.259> left<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.590> you'll<00:01:34.710> turn<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.040> trim

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so it's left as you'll turn you trim

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.240 
so it's left as you'll turn you trim
this<00:01:35.549> tale<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.070> there

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this tale here you know that out there

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
this tale here you know that out there
and<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> Palomar<00:01:39.570> knot<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.900> very

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and that's a Palomar knot now is very

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.810 
and that's a Palomar knot now is very
easy<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> tie<00:01:41.570> extremely<00:01:42.570> strong<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
easy not to tie extremely strong but the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
easy not to tie extremely strong but the
big<00:01:45.000> limitation<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> tune<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> two<00:01:46.409> dings

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
big limitation is the tune the two dings

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.740 
big limitation is the tune the two dings
against<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> uses<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.570> lines

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
against it is it uses up a lot of lines

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.679 
against it is it uses up a lot of lines
ty<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> certain<00:01:50.340> standpoint<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
ty you know for a certain standpoint and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.300 
ty you know for a certain standpoint and
then<00:01:51.869> also<00:01:52.020> there's<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.530> moment<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
then also there's that moment when you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.709 
then also there's that moment when you
have<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.020> feed<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.259> hook<00:01:55.530> back<00:01:56.009> through<00:01:56.719> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
have to feed the hook back through the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.340 
have to feed the hook back through the
not<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:59.570> can<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.750> dicey<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.259> we

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
not that can get a little dicey if we

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
not that can get a little dicey if we
use<00:02:01.469> its<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.549> treble<00:02:03.000> hooks<00:02:03.180> or

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
use its up with you know treble hooks or

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
use its up with you know treble hooks or

to do we'll do it account backing

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.580 
to do we'll do it account backing
one<00:02:11.200> more<00:02:11.320> time<00:02:11.470> for<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.770> all<00:02:12.370> right<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> look

at one more time you get my loop and put

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.880 
at one more time you get my loop and put
it<00:02:18.670> through<00:02:19.230> time<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.350> overhand<00:02:22.470> end<00:02:23.470> up<00:02:23.680> back
