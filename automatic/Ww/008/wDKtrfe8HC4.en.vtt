time<00:03:14.540> significantly<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.769> probably<00:03:16.250> will

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
time significantly but it probably will

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.189 
time significantly but it probably will
make<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.909> more<00:03:17.150> appealing<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.599> adults<00:03:17.900> who

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199 
make it more appealing to adults who

will probably be viable so this might

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.950 
will probably be viable so this might
just<00:05:05.000> have<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.180> be<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.510> pinnacle<00:05:05.720> of
