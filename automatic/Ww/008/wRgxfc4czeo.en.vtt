shades<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.930> particular<00:01:28.439> would<00:01:28.770> work<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.550 
many people so pigmented like not at all
chalky<00:01:32.549> looking<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> little

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
chalky looking that you know a little

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
chalky looking that you know a little
bit<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.159> shades<00:01:35.520> could<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:36.030> good<00:01:36.240> on

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
bit of these shades could look good on

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.109 
bit of these shades could look good on
more<00:01:36.810> fair<00:01:37.140> skin<00:01:37.560> tones<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.060> think

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
more fair skin tones but then I think

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600 
more fair skin tones but then I think
they<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.659> rich<00:01:39.960> enough<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> stand<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.460> on

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
they are rich enough to stand out on

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670 
they are rich enough to stand out on
some<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.000> even<00:01:42.270> deeper<00:01:42.600> tan<00:01:42.840> skin<00:01:43.380> touch

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
some with even deeper tan skin touch

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
some with even deeper tan skin touch
