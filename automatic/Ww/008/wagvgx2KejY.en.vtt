00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
thought of trying her method since she

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.380 
thought of trying her method since she
actually<00:02:53.569> liked<00:02:54.569> helped<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.620> clumps<00:02:56.329> along

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
sulfate wash because she said that hope

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.120

to clarify your hair if you weren't sure

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.379 
to clarify your hair if you weren't sure
like<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:39.550> had<00:05:39.700> pot<00:05:39.910> if<00:05:40.060> they're<00:05:40.240> here<00:05:40.330> because

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
like you had pot if they're here because

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.180 
like you had pot if they're here because

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.520 
this doesn't mix well with a lot of
stuff<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:43.210> I<00:05:43.300> didn't<00:05:43.539> want<00:05:43.720> to<00:05:43.810> leave<00:05:44.169> like

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530

section<00:06:12.550> by<00:06:12.699> section<00:06:12.729> and<00:06:14.010> this<00:06:15.010> is<00:06:15.220> pretty

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
section by section and this is pretty

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.760 
section by section and this is pretty
