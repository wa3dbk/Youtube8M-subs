but it's a drop from that I've got a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.110 
but it's a drop from that I've got a
nebula<00:00:56.540> armor<00:00:56.900> in<00:00:56.990> a<00:00:57.050> couple<00:00:57.380> of<00:00:57.500> year<00:00:58.130> on<00:00:58.250> 63

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
magic damage so I have a feeling of the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.039
