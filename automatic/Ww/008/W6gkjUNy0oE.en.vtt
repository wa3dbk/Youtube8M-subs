together spending two or three weeks on
the<00:03:25.450> road<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.230> way<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.709> industry<00:03:26.980> is

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
the road the way that the industry is

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.819 
the road the way that the industry is
going<00:03:27.579> right<00:03:27.910> now<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.180> mean<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:28.780> it's<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.290> said

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
going right now I mean it's it's it said

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.970 
going right now I mean it's it's it said
the<00:03:30.310> highest<00:03:30.700> point<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.180> think<00:03:31.420> it's<00:03:31.570> ever<00:03:31.780> been

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
the highest point I think it's ever been

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.110 
the highest point I think it's ever been
eventually<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.010> think<00:03:33.430> things<00:03:33.790> are<00:03:33.880> going<00:03:34.030> to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
eventually I think things are going to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.970 
eventually I think things are going to
start<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.510> peter<00:03:34.780> out<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.049> little<00:03:35.380> bit<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.739> mean

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
start to peter out a little bit I mean

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.530 
start to peter out a little bit I mean
there's<00:03:36.340> always<00:03:36.579> going<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.760> be<00:03:36.820> great<00:03:37.060> quality

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540

little<00:04:00.440> bit<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.940> mean<00:04:01.940> still<00:04:02.870> probably<00:04:03.140> going

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
little bit I mean still probably going

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.290 
little bit I mean still probably going
to<00:04:03.410> stay<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.860> know<00:04:04.010> much<00:04:04.370> bigger<00:04:04.670> than<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.090> has

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
to stay you know much bigger than it has

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.410 
to stay you know much bigger than it has
he'll<00:04:05.690> in<00:04:05.870> past<00:04:06.140> years<00:04:06.560> but<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:08.270> high

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
he'll in past years but the the high

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.080 
he'll in past years but the the high
point<00:04:08.810> is<00:04:08.959> he's<00:04:09.440> going<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.709> start<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.250> drop

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090

laughs<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.600> little<00:04:11.750> bit<00:04:12.080> and<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.680> think<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:13.100> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
laughs a little bit and I think that the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.580 
laughs a little bit and I think that the
next<00:04:13.520> big<00:04:13.730> thing<00:04:13.760> here<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.540> invest<00:04:14.930> in<00:04:15.350> is

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590
