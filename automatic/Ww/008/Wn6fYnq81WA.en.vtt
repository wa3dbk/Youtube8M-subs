00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 if you don't know how to resist the thousand 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.109
 more cream- based preparations but 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.450
 you are lactose intolerant can 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.880
 you have simply decided on a diet 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.490
 strictly vegan and de martis coi 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.509
 little ad hoc solution that could do 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.460
 for you 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.740
 in fact today we will learn to realize 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 together the homemade vegetable cream 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.670
 which I guarantee that the preparation is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.420
 much, much simpler than that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.910
 that seems 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.640
 what we need if instead only two 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 ingredients or soy milk 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.540
 better if self-produced and seed oil than 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.700
 corn or soy 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.820
 turn on the timer give me three minutes of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 time and I will prepare a band 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.480
 stunning to prepare about 250 g 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.840
 one vegetable cream is needed 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.620
 part of self-produced soy milk 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.949
 then 100 grams and two parts of oil of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.469
 corn seeds or soybeans the two parts 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.609
 what I told you correspond in weight to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.990
 about 175 180 g 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.760
 you have turned on the timer we start the back e 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.760
 we pour soy milk 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.229
 and then the oil I used here oil of 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 corn seeds but as I told you before 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.640
 Soybean oil is fine too 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.830
 we simulate an immersion mixer e 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.830
 we whip it intermittently 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.759
 after a few smoothies you see that the landslide 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.860
 it is already thinking but I want it 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:46.060
 still cautious then what we do 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:48.820
 we still operate our miserable one 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.020
 it is the consistency that I desire for the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.720
 my vegetable cream 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.390
 if you plan to use vegetable cream 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.700
 for the preparation of a sweet I vi 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.720
 I also recommend mixing everything with 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.520
 a little sugar 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.210
 instead if the used you noticed for 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.950
 add flavor to the pasta this way 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.440
 now we can also transfer it to a 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.640
 container let cool for goods 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.560
 fridge 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.209
 in this way it grew still 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.040
 more anyway if you want you can too 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.070
 use it as it is because the cream 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.230
 would be ready for use 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.780
 to what came in real fast timer 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.630
 almost more than the light I show you a 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.900
 the consistency after an hour of 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.850
 cooling you see how beautiful I am 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.370
 I recommend using this cream 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.140
 vegetable to prepare maybe ice cream 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.840
 vegans and I recommend my recipe of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.790
 chocolate ice cream prepared with 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.709
 soy milk and why not also for 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.709
 flavor the pasta you will feel that goodness 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.550
