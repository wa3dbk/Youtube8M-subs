00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.610 
I don't know I'm I might yeah that would
be<00:03:44.000> kinda<00:03:44.270> cool<00:03:44.330> cuz<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.900> could<00:03:45.080> stream<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
be kinda cool cuz I could stream and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.170 
be kinda cool cuz I could stream and
grow<00:03:45.800> YouTube<00:03:46.220> channel<00:03:46.550> at<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.730> same<00:03:46.910> time<00:03:47.150> I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
grow YouTube channel at the same time I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.700 
grow YouTube channel at the same time I
think<00:03:47.360> that<00:03:47.600> would<00:03:47.690> be<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.780> badass<00:03:47.990> idea

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
think that would be a badass idea

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.520 
think that would be a badass idea
so<00:03:49.370> that's<00:03:49.880> possibility<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.810> don't<00:03:51.170> know<00:03:51.260> leave

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
so that's possibility I don't know leave

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.780 
so that's possibility I don't know leave

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
side I'll be working with so that gives

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.240 
side I'll be working with so that gives
our<00:05:04.930> commentators<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:06.400> chance<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:07.479> grow

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
our commentators the chance to grow

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.499 
our commentators the chance to grow
faster<00:05:09.250> because<00:05:09.639> they'll<00:05:09.819> be<00:05:09.849> commentating
