either<00:01:26.790> snivy<00:01:27.390> without<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> seeing<00:01:27.930> them

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
either snivy without you seeing them

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.050 
either snivy without you seeing them
which<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.259> very<00:01:28.590> rarely<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.729> happen<00:01:29.970> if

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
which is very rarely going to happen if

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.249 
which is very rarely going to happen if
you're<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.420> shot<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:30.960> aim<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you're a good shot and you aim down the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.560 
you're a good shot and you aim down the
sights<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.759> throw<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.299> sort<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
sights a lot or they throw some sort of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.810 
sights a lot or they throw some sort of
explosive<00:01:33.930> which<00:01:34.259> surprisingly<00:01:34.740> enough<00:01:35.100> no

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
explosive which surprisingly enough no

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.190 
explosive which surprisingly enough no
one<00:01:35.970> did<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> usually<00:01:36.720> happens<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> me<00:01:37.110> all

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
one did that usually happens to me all

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780 
one did that usually happens to me all
the<00:01:37.229> time<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.710> expecting<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> catch<00:01:38.340> c4<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the time I was expecting to catch c4 to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
the time I was expecting to catch c4 to
the<00:01:38.880> face<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.420> by<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> way<00:01:39.750> fuck<00:01:40.170> c4<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> hate

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the face and by the way fuck c4 I hate

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.700 
the face and by the way fuck c4 I hate
see<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> ton<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:42.840> my<00:01:43.020> opinion<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.439> really

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
see for a ton in my opinion they really

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
see for a ton in my opinion they really
do<00:01:43.799> need<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> nerf<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> blast<00:01:44.759> radius<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.240> see

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
do need to nerf the blast radius to see

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
do need to nerf the blast radius to see
for<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.930> absolutely<00:01:46.350> ridiculous<00:01:46.850> but

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
for it is absolutely ridiculous but

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850 
for it is absolutely ridiculous but
that's<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.060> personal<00:01:48.329> opinion<00:01:48.860> yeah

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that's my personal opinion yeah

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
that's my personal opinion yeah
basically<00:01:50.070> explosives<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.090> way

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
basically explosives are the only way

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.700 
basically explosives are the only way
they're<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> dislodge<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
they're going to dislodge you from the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.980 
they're going to dislodge you from the
spot<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.610> very<00:01:53.880> easy<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.240> hold<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.659> here

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
spot it's very easy to hold out here

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.660 
spot it's very easy to hold out here
because<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.070> look<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.340> front<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.610> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
because if you look in front of you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.859 
because if you look in front of you
there's<00:01:56.939> three<00:01:57.210> different<00:01:57.299> ways<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> actually

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
there's three different ways to actually

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.539 
there's three different ways to actually
get<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.409> choke<00:01:58.649> hold<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.369> look

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
get to this choke hold and if you look

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.219 
get to this choke hold and if you look
behind<00:01:59.729> me<00:02:00.000> there's<00:02:00.930> three<00:02:01.140> different

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
behind me there's three different

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
behind me there's three different
doorways<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> lead<00:02:02.100> into<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.369> room<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
doorways to lead into a room to get this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
doorways to lead into a room to get this
chokehold<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.960> basically<00:02:04.110> means<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
chokehold but that basically means you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.280 
chokehold but that basically means you
only<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.950> two<00:02:05.130> ways<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.369> worry<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.290> if

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
only have two ways to worry about and if

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.020 
only have two ways to worry about and if
I<00:02:07.500> look<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.770> my<00:02:07.890> mini<00:02:08.039> map<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.640> my<00:02:08.789> whole

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
I look on my mini map and I see my whole

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.600 
I look on my mini map and I see my whole
team<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.390> behind<00:02:09.509> me<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:11.190> nothing<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
team is behind me I have nothing to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.770 
team is behind me I have nothing to
worry<00:02:11.790> about<00:02:11.849> behind<00:02:12.270> me<00:02:12.390> I'm<00:02:12.480> gonna<00:02:12.569> keep

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

looking forward to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.199 
looking forward to
to<00:02:13.709> me<00:02:13.860> because<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.340> enemy<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:14.760> smart

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
to me because the enemy is not smart

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.850 
to me because the enemy is not smart
enough<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.510> realize<00:02:15.690> hey<00:02:16.379> I'm<00:02:16.560> gonna<00:02:16.709> keep

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
enough to realize hey I'm gonna keep

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.190 
enough to realize hey I'm gonna keep
dying<00:02:17.160> if<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.400> keep<00:02:17.580> charging<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.180> way<00:02:18.360> why

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
dying if I keep charging in this way why

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.990 
dying if I keep charging in this way why
not<00:02:19.410> go<00:02:19.560> around<00:02:19.680> they<00:02:20.370> won't<00:02:20.550> learn<00:02:20.760> that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
not go around they won't learn that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.220 
not go around they won't learn that
they're<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.300> gonna<00:02:21.390> keep<00:02:21.480> charging<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.080> your

they're just gonna keep charging in your

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.449 
they're just gonna keep charging in your
bullets<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.680> letting<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.129> your<00:02:23.280> kill

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
streets which ended up happening so I

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.320

did<00:02:25.560> actually<00:02:25.709> get<00:02:26.069> also<00:02:26.580> my<00:02:26.700> killstreaks<00:02:26.970> in

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
did actually get also my killstreaks in

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.890 
did actually get also my killstreaks in
this<00:02:27.480> game<00:02:27.690> my<00:02:28.290> killstreaks<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.950> asset<00:02:29.400> or<00:02:29.640> a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.470 
this game my killstreaks I asset or a
orbital<00:02:30.900> vsat<00:02:31.049> which<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:32.099> kind<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.090> didn't

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
orbital vsat which I kind of didn't

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.210 
orbital vsat which I kind of didn't
actually<00:02:33.690> need<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.590> did<00:02:34.709> help<00:02:34.860> me<00:02:34.980> get

actually need but it did help me get

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.710 
actually need but it did help me get
further<00:02:35.549> killstreaks<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.330> does<00:02:36.450> help<00:02:36.629> a

the swarm and the k-9 unit holy shit it
is<00:02:46.110> ridiculous<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.099> is<00:02:47.250> absolutely

is ridiculous it is absolutely

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.690 
is ridiculous it is absolutely

combination<00:04:14.880> if<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.359> can<00:04:15.480> actually<00:04:15.630> get<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
combination if you can actually get that

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.050 
combination if you can actually get that
high<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.349> a<00:04:16.410> kill<00:04:16.560> streak<00:04:16.650> which<00:04:16.979> if<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.910> play

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
high of a kill streak which if you play

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.000 
high of a kill streak which if you play
conservatively<00:04:18.359> like<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:19.049> do<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.349> not<00:04:19.500> too

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
conservatively like I do it's not too

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.640 
conservatively like I do it's not too
difficult<00:04:20.639> as<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.750> see<00:04:21.900> here<00:04:22.109> I'm<00:04:22.229> being<00:04:22.409> I'm

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
them as they're coming at you and try to

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.570 
them as they're coming at you and try to
overtake<00:04:34.169> their<00:04:34.409> spawn<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.159> that<00:04:35.310> they'll<00:04:35.430> end

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
overtake their spawn so that they'll end

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.980 
overtake their spawn so that they'll end
up<00:04:35.639> spawning<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.150> those<00:04:36.240> on<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.659> other<00:04:36.780> side

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
up spawning of those on the other side

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.210 
up spawning of those on the other side
of<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.169> map<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.470> then<00:04:37.560> do<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.800> same<00:04:37.830> thing

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
of the map and then do the same thing

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.909 
of the map and then do the same thing
but<00:04:38.810> alternatively<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.229> can<00:04:40.349> do<00:04:40.470> what<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.650> did

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
but alternatively you can do what I did

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.439 
but alternatively you can do what I did
and<00:04:41.039> basically<00:04:41.310> sit<00:04:41.639> there<00:04:41.819> and<00:04:41.909> let<00:04:42.060> them<00:04:42.210> run

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
and basically sit there and let them run

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.629 
and basically sit there and let them run
to<00:04:42.569> their<00:04:42.659> death<00:04:42.840> over<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.319> over<00:04:43.409> so<00:04:44.069> I<00:04:44.490> can

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
to their death over and over so I can

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.159 
to their death over and over so I can
almost<00:04:44.849> guarantee<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.360> if<00:04:45.629> you're<00:04:45.810> using<00:04:45.990> an
