annoying kind of exercise but it's a
really<00:01:02.760> important<00:01:03.449> key<00:01:03.920> now<00:01:04.920> faster<00:01:05.519> within

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
really important key now faster within

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.469 
really important key now faster within
that<00:01:06.119> footprint<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.890> squeeze<00:01:08.310> yeah<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
that footprint and squeeze yeah good and

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
that footprint and squeeze yeah good and
whatever<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.750> Ranger<00:01:13.229> ranges<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
whatever is Ranger ranges the more you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
whatever is Ranger ranges the more you
Patterson<00:01:15.030> some<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.750> you'll<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> bigger

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
Patterson some more you'll get a bigger

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
Patterson some more you'll get a bigger
range<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:17.689> really<00:01:18.689> good<00:01:18.900> range<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.590> really

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
range a really good range and really

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
range a really good range and really
good<00:01:20.580> 120<00:01:21.299> beats<00:01:21.479> per<00:01:21.630> minute<00:01:22.020> difference

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
good 120 beats per minute difference

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.030 
good 120 beats per minute difference
where<00:01:22.979> he<00:01:23.070> goes<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:23.939> say<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.990> say<00:01:25.619> 50

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
where he goes you know say from say 50

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.580 
where he goes you know say from say 50
right<00:01:26.520> down<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> 40<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> 60<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.170> even<00:01:28.350> up

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
right down to 40 and up to 60 or even up

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.580 
right down to 40 and up to 60 or even up
to<00:01:28.710> 65<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> 45<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> range

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to 65 and down to 45 that kind of range

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.569 
to 65 and down to 45 that kind of range
of<00:01:31.799> 20<00:01:32.040> meters<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:33.740> ideal<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:34.799> their<00:01:35.130> size

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
of 20 meters really ideal for their size

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.880 
of 20 meters really ideal for their size
most<00:01:36.150> people<00:01:36.570> can't<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.320> range<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
most people can't do that range and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.149 
most people can't do that range and
that's<00:01:38.070> why<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> say<00:01:38.520> we'll<00:01:39.210> try<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.829> that's<00:01:40.829> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's why I say we'll try it that's it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.980 
that's why I say we'll try it that's it
and<00:01:41.310> that's<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:42.060> good<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> next

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and that's really good now the next

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.389 
and that's really good now the next
stage<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.409> dressage<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:45.290> all<00:01:46.290> within<00:01:46.590> its<00:01:46.890> top

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
stage of dressage is all within its top

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.240 
stage of dressage is all within its top
it's<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.659> valuable<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.040> in

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it's really really valuable you know in

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.710 
it's really really valuable you know in
the<00:01:50.340> German<00:01:50.759> system<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.240> call<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the German system they call it the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.609 
the German system they call it the
classical<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.600> interpreters<00:01:54.619> or

the American dressage Federation is when

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.620 
the American dressage Federation is when
the<00:02:08.850> rain<00:02:09.090> aids

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
the rain aids

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.530 
the rain aids
flow<00:02:09.960> through<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.530> back<00:02:10.740> leg<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
flow through to the back leg and what it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.410 
flow through to the back leg and what it
means<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.990> when<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.440> from<00:02:13.650> trot<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> hold

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
means is when you go from trot to hold

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.940 
means is when you go from trot to hold
that<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> back<00:02:15.750> legs<00:02:16.080> actually<00:02:16.620> give<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
that the back legs actually give the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.400 
that the back legs actually give the
right<00:02:17.130> answer<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.730> when<00:02:18.660> you're<00:02:18.810> ready<00:02:18.990> and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
right answer and when you're ready and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.800 
right answer and when you're ready and
back<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> halt

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
back to a halt

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.210 
back to a halt
whoops<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.050> was<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.730> whoops<00:02:23.730> that's<00:02:24.630> it

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
whoops that was a whoops that's it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.900 
whoops that was a whoops that's it
that's<00:02:26.220> good

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
that's good

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.410 
that's good
and<00:02:27.330> why<00:02:27.750> even<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.459> top<00:02:29.459> from<00:02:29.730> hop<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.150> really

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and why even the top from hop is really

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.760 
and why even the top from hop is really
good<00:02:30.570> for<00:02:31.130> six<00:02:32.130> hand<00:02:32.520> with<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:32.970> right<00:02:33.030> rein

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
good for six hand with your right rein

top is giving up use your right now do a
transition<00:03:15.450> back<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.630> halt<00:03:15.930> again<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.830> watch

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
transition back to halt again you watch

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.910 
transition back to halt again you watch
the<00:03:17.130> back<00:03:17.160> lady<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:18.290> nothing<00:03:19.290> left<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:19.830> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
the back lady do nothing left on the

the back lady do nothing left on the
world<00:03:20.130> right<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.660> just<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.890> bit<00:03:23.010> faster

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
world right as well so just a bit faster

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.140 
world right as well so just a bit faster
that's<00:03:23.700> good

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
that's good

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.970 
that's good
now<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.570> arrange<00:03:25.019> slower<00:03:25.970> whoo<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.739> feel

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
now we arrange slower whoo and you feel

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.250 
now we arrange slower whoo and you feel
it<00:03:29.040> it'll<00:03:29.700> be<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> little<00:03:30.090> bit<00:03:30.330> slow<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
it it'll be a little bit slow to the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.650 
it it'll be a little bit slow to the
angel<00:03:31.650> heavy<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.820> just<00:03:33.090> keep<00:03:33.299> doing<00:03:33.600> it

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
angel heavy so you just keep doing it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.890 
angel heavy so you just keep doing it
till<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:33.989> not<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.709> faster<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.420> so

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
till it's not and faster and it's so

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.160 
till it's not and faster and it's so
you're<00:03:37.019> just<00:03:37.140> asking<00:03:37.410> simple<00:03:38.040> questions

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
you're just asking simple questions

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.259 
you're just asking simple questions
sensitive<00:03:40.170> horses<00:03:40.670> really<00:03:41.670> need<00:03:41.850> simple

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
sensitive horses really need simple

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:53.449 
sensitive horses really need simple
questions<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:44.540> slower

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.599 

that's<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.390> human<00:03:55.079> if<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.500> hope<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:56.010> like

faster and ten steps lower and then you

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.940 
faster and ten steps lower and then you
get<00:04:08.069> slow<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.730> soft<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.379> check<00:04:10.739> with

tap<00:05:01.949> tap<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.760> might<00:05:03.690> catch<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.139> next

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
tap tap you might catch the next

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.870 
tap tap you might catch the next
diagonal<00:05:04.680> clear<00:05:05.039> but<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.250> might<00:05:05.520> not<00:05:05.669> give

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
diagonal clear but you might not give

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.240 
diagonal clear but you might not give
him<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.030> chance<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.449> express<00:05:06.810> but<00:05:07.710> he<00:05:08.039> might

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
when he's already doing it so the best

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.820 
when he's already doing it so the best
way<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.860> do<00:05:14.159> this<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.639> found<00:05:15.419> is<00:05:15.960> simply<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.590> tap

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
way to do this I found is simply to tap

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.620 
way to do this I found is simply to tap
in<00:05:17.039> with<00:05:17.250> your<00:05:17.370> leg<00:05:17.550> every<00:05:17.940> third<00:05:18.240> step

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
in with your leg every third step

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.520 
in with your leg every third step
because<00:05:19.620> every<00:05:20.280> first<00:05:21.210> step<00:05:21.479> well<00:05:22.080> it'll<00:05:22.409> be

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
because every first step well it'll be

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.399 
because every first step well it'll be
the<00:05:22.800> two<00:05:23.610> quick<00:05:23.849> every<00:05:24.539> second<00:05:24.930> step<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.320> the

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
the two quick every second step is the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.960 
the two quick every second step is the
same<00:05:25.620> time<00:05:25.830> okay<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.400> don't<00:05:26.550> want<00:05:26.669> to<00:05:26.729> do<00:05:26.789> that

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
same time okay you don't want to do that

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.749 
same time okay you don't want to do that
so<00:05:27.720> because<00:05:28.110> it's<00:05:28.409> so<00:05:28.620> it's<00:05:28.740> like<00:05:28.919> so<00:05:29.580> if<00:05:29.639> you

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
so because it's so it's like so if you
