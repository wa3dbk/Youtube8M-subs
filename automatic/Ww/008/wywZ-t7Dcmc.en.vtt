 Our men are back in class. 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.619
 opening of school year 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.619
 it is always a feast of joy of faith and hope 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.859
 It is with this feeling that I greet the students and their parents and 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.069
 especially 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.489
 all Brazilian teachers 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:28.480
 was here 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 to reaffirm my commitment to improving education 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.520
 and summon all Brazilians and Brazilians to fight together for a 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.370

 brazil rises with vigor to a new level of nation 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.360
 we therefore have the conditions 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.390
 this need to make a great leap in the quality of our teaching 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.220
 a challenge will only be overcome 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.370
 second day and society to unite in fact in this fight with full force 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.440
 courage and conviction 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.700
 no area 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.170
 can better bring society together 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.370
 that education 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.090
 no tool is more decisive than it is 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.850
 to overcome poverty and misery 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.950
 no space can accomplish the present better and project with more hope 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 in the future 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.230
 than a classroom 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.590
 well equipped 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.259
 where teachers can teach well 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.440
 and students 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.360
 the action to learn better and better 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.630
 You are on this path that we have to keep moving forward.

 pedro steps rabbit 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.220
 had time to invest even more in the training and remuneration of 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.400
 teachers 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.710
 to expand the number of kindergartens and pre-schools throughout the country 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.890
 to create study conditions 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.120
 and stay in school to overcome evasion 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.560
 and repetition 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.869
 and especially to end this tragic illusion 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.890
 to see students go through the year without learning almost anything 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.009
 had time to do more technical schools to extend the courses 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.040
 vocational training to improve secondary education at universities and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.040
 scientific and technological centers of higher education 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:19.849
 had time 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.229
 to accelerate digital inclusion 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.399
 because the Brazilian youth must incorporate 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:29.009
 even more quickly the new ways of thinking 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.749
 inform and produce 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.159
 which today spread all over the planet

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.569
 this is the great victory of Brazilian education 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.480
 all this will only be possible 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.469
 if each parent is each student 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.829
 every 'teacher' every mayor 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.729
 every governor every businessman every worker 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.349

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.899
 propose and build new avenues for our education 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.089

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.279
 I have some things to advertise in education 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.019

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.299
 the national program of access to the technical school 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.729
 the pronatec 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:25.259
 had other advantages lead to technical education to successful 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.679
 prouni experience 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:32.189
 we are also accelerating the implementation of the national band plan 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.299
 long 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.409
 not only for what? 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.689
 all public schools have access to the internet 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:38.769
 you are too 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.269
 so that in the medium and long term the poor population 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.489
 can have internet and your home in your small business 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.869
 at a price compatible with your daughter 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:52.719
 I also report that the government is taking steps to correct 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.469
 and avoid failures in enem and sisu 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.069
 improving and increasing the credibility of 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.499
 these instruments and are very important 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.969
 in the evaluation of the student and the school 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.559
 in improving the quality of 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.659
 to conclude I reaffirm that the most obstinate struggle of my government 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.400
 will be the fight against misery 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.779
 this means 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.689
 strengthen economies 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:24.639
 increase employment and improve social policies 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.560
 all this means 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.719
 Special' 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.199

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.500
 out of poverty if they do not have access to continuous free education and 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:37.680
 quality 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.780
 no country can also develop without educating your youngster well 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.629
 say 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.999
 and fully empower them 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:50.299
 employment and the new needs created by the 

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:51.659
 knowledge 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.590
 the neighboring country without poverty 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.819
 this was the motto of my government 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.990
 he is going 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.430
 to permanently alert 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.949

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.930
 - we know of no action 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.389
 to realize the maximum organism 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.749
 so that the only hunger in this country 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.669
 be the hunger for knowledge 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.550
 hunger for greatness in the sea 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.900
 hunger for solidarity and equality 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.900
 of all Brazilians can make education 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.219
