00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
another great feature of the Korg z3 is

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.230 
another great feature of the Korg z3 is
its<00:00:02.669> ability<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.330> be<00:00:03.570> used<00:00:03.959> as<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> standalone

its ability to be used as a standalone
FM<00:00:06.240> sound<00:00:06.690> module<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.440> as<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.069> mentioned<00:00:08.460> it

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
FM sound module and as I mentioned it

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.120 
FM sound module and as I mentioned it
has<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.880> same<00:00:09.090> chip<00:00:09.450> same<00:00:10.230> sound<00:00:10.559> engine<00:00:11.010> as

the Yamaha DX 11 or t x8 1z and if I
want<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> use<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.609> as<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> cell<00:00:18.119> module<00:00:18.480> I'll

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
want to use it as a cell module I'll

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.880 
want to use it as a cell module I'll
have<00:00:18.630> two<00:00:18.810> options<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.500> either<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.830> it

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
have two options I can either have it

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.560 
have two options I can either have it
respond<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> different<00:00:20.789> sound<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.420> each

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
respond to a different sound on each

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.570 
respond to a different sound on each
MIDI<00:00:21.869> channel<00:00:22.289> or<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.890> all<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.369> voices

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
MIDI channel or have all the voices

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.120 
MIDI channel or have all the voices
assigned<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.779> MIDI<00:00:24.990> Channel<00:00:25.410> well<00:00:25.980> let's

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
assigned to one MIDI Channel well let's

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.849 
assigned to one MIDI Channel well let's
do<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> first<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> Korg<00:00:28.109> z3

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
do that first to have the Korg z3

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
do that first to have the Korg z3
transmit<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.460> receive<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.599> MIDI

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
transmit and receive just on one MIDI

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
transmit and receive just on one MIDI
Channel<00:00:31.230> hold<00:00:31.740> down<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> function<00:00:32.340> switch

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
Channel hold down the function switch

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.569 
Channel hold down the function switch
and<00:00:33.329> press<00:00:33.630> -<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.399> see

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and press - and we do that we can see

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.330 
and press - and we do that we can see
all<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.110> string<00:00:37.110> lights<00:00:37.350> light<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> same

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
all the string lights light up the same

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 
all the string lights light up the same
if<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.120> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.300> check<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.050> channel

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
if we want to check to see what channel

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
if we want to check to see what channel
we're<00:00:40.620> transmitting<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.340> receiving<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:42.030> press

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we're transmitting or receiving on press

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.000 
we're transmitting or receiving on press
sent<00:00:43.290> off<00:00:44.000> function<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.149> 6:00<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.079> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
sent off function and 6:00 and that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.600 
sent off function and 6:00 and that
shows<00:00:47.340> channel<00:00:48.149> 1<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.870> use<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
shows channel 1 and we can use the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.040 
shows channel 1 and we can use the
increment<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> decrement<00:00:51.300> keys<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.809> change

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
increment and decrement keys to change

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.520 
increment and decrement keys to change
that<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> different<00:00:53.219> channel<00:00:54.110> well<00:00:55.110> exit

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that to a different channel well exit

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.150 
that to a different channel well exit
that<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.640> want<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> use<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.300> only<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
that and now we want to use it only as a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.790 
that and now we want to use it only as a
standalone<00:00:59.160> FM<00:00:59.690> sound<00:01:00.690> generator<00:01:01.230> module<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
standalone FM sound generator module so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.110 
standalone FM sound generator module so
we're<00:01:01.890> gonna<00:01:01.980> hold<00:01:02.129> down<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> function<00:01:02.609> key

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
we're gonna hold down the function key

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.800 
we're gonna hold down the function key
and<00:01:03.840> press<00:01:04.199> since<00:01:04.710> off<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> when<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and press since off and when we do that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.679 
and press since off and when we do that
we<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> display<00:01:07.770> changes<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.689> gen4

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we can see the display changes to gen4

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.359 
we can see the display changes to gen4
sound<00:01:09.960> generator<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:10.830> we'll<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.159> play

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
sound generator and now we'll just play

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.330 
sound generator and now we'll just play
a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:12.330> sequence<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.220> hear

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
a little sequence here so you can hear

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
a little sequence here so you can hear
what<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> sounds<00:01:14.850> like
