00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
circulation in a way is if you have

very sort of controversial thing which

very sort of controversial thing which
some<00:00:57.719> people<00:00:57.840> think<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> rubbish<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.739> it

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
some people think is a rubbish but it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.560 
some people think is a rubbish but it
isn't<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.340> loping<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.120> lot<00:01:00.510> of

it<00:01:04.110> moves<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.189> rivers<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.030> naturally

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
it moves if you in rivers it naturally

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
it moves if you in rivers it naturally
meanders<00:01:07.700> because<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> water<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.360> only

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
meanders because the water is not only

it<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:27.150> people<00:01:27.390> say<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.659> does<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.810> mean

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it now people say what does that mean

us briefly what sick building syndrome

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.840 
us briefly what sick building syndrome
is<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.680> mean<00:03:16.950> there<00:03:17.190> are<00:03:17.280> many<00:03:17.520> actuations

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
is well I mean there are many actuations

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.190 
is well I mean there are many actuations
okay<00:03:18.240> one<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.570> things<00:03:18.720> they<00:03:18.840> say<00:03:19.020> what

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
okay one of the things they say what

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.780 
okay one of the things they say what
happened<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.740> sick<00:03:19.950> building<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.610> get

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
happened in a sick building is you get

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.930 
happened in a sick building is you get
very<00:03:21.060> high<00:03:21.959> degrees<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> positive<00:03:23.370> ionization

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
very high degrees of positive ionization

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.280 
very high degrees of positive ionization
and<00:03:24.660> what<00:03:25.170> does<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.290> mean<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:26.580> sense

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
and what does that mean in a sense

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.440 
and what does that mean in a sense
positive<00:03:28.290> ionization<00:03:28.740> is<00:03:29.310> when<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:30.090> strip

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
positive ionization is when you strip

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.790 
positive ionization is when you strip
away<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:31.400> enclosing<00:03:33.530> integrity<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.560> the

electron around in making the sphere and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.310 
electron around in making the sphere and
you<00:03:40.980> open<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.370> out<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.300> energy<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.840> taken

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
you open it out and the energy is taken

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.650 
you open it out and the energy is taken
out<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:44.250> also<00:03:44.550> do<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.880> acid<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.450> base

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
out it's like also do the acid and base

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.380 
out it's like also do the acid and base
when<00:03:46.020> you're<00:03:46.140> in<00:03:46.610> negative<00:03:47.610> ionization<00:03:47.760> your

invade and sick building citroen
syndrome<00:04:09.480> tends<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.530> open<00:04:11.489> your<00:04:11.610> out<00:04:11.850> it

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
syndrome tends to open your out it

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.780 
syndrome tends to open your out it
uncovers<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.989> in<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.260> wrong<00:04:13.380> way<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.860> you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
uncovers you in the wrong way and you

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.820 
uncovers you in the wrong way and you
know<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.330> depletes<00:04:15.660> your<00:04:15.810> energy<00:04:16.230> who<00:04:16.739> is

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
know it depletes your energy who is

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.920 
know it depletes your energy who is
taking<00:04:17.070> your<00:04:17.400> energy<00:04:17.790> from<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.209> whereas

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
taking your energy from you whereas

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.599 
taking your energy from you whereas
after<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.230> thunderstorm<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.950> very<00:04:20.220> heavy

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
after a thunderstorm is very heavy

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.909 
after a thunderstorm is very heavy
negative<00:04:21.419> ionization<00:04:21.630> that's<00:04:22.590> why<00:04:22.770> after

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
negative ionization that's why after

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.440 
negative ionization that's why after
thunderstorms<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:23.760> feel<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.030> often<00:04:24.330> this

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
thunderstorms you feel this often this

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.420 
thunderstorms you feel this often this
wonderful<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.080> bracing<00:04:25.740> energy

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
wonderful for bracing energy

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.550 
wonderful for bracing energy
you<00:04:26.699> know<00:04:26.820> so<00:04:27.030> all<00:04:27.240> your<00:04:27.570> water<00:04:27.720> falls<00:04:28.110> as<00:04:28.350> let

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
you know so all your water falls as let

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.480 
you know so all your water falls as let
negative<00:04:29.070> ionization<00:04:29.449> you<00:04:30.449> know<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.490> that's

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
negative ionization you know so that's

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.890 
negative ionization you know so that's
one<00:04:32.729> of<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:32.910> things<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.150> yeah<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.690> it's<00:04:33.810> to

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
one of the things that yeah and it's to

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.330 
one of the things that yeah and it's to
do<00:04:34.020> with<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.169> movement<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.650> air<00:04:34.830> excess

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
do with the movement of the air excess

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.860 
do with the movement of the air excess
carbon<00:04:35.729> dioxide<00:04:36.240> those<00:04:36.449> are<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.630> sort<00:04:36.840> of

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
carbon dioxide those are the sort of

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.729 
carbon dioxide those are the sort of
external<00:04:37.830> reasons<00:04:38.250> why
