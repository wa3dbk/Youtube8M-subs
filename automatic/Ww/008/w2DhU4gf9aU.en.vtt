I'm<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.449> coiling<00:00:30.840> today<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.470> I've

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
I'm going to be coiling today just I've

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410 
I'm going to be coiling today just I've
got<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> couple<00:00:32.099> feet<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.759> 22<00:00:33.390> gauge

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
got a couple feet here of 22 gauge

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.350 
got a couple feet here of 22 gauge
copper<00:00:34.200> wire<00:00:34.460> it's<00:00:35.460> great<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> practice<00:00:36.210> with

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
copper wire it's great to practice with

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.299 
copper wire it's great to practice with
copper<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.260> easy<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> find<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.280> your

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
copper because it's easy to find at your

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
copper because it's easy to find at your
neighborhood<00:00:38.700> hardware<00:00:39.090> store<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.690> it's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
neighborhood hardware store and it's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
neighborhood hardware store and it's
cheap<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.430> perfect<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> process

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
cheap so you can perfect the process

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.590 
cheap so you can perfect the process
with<00:00:42.629> copper<00:00:43.399> for<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> core<00:00:44.730> wire<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.360> going

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
with copper for the core wire I'm going

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
with copper for the core wire I'm going
to<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> piece<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> sterling<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.309> it's

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
to use a piece of sterling because it's

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.270 
to use a piece of sterling because it's
harder<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.079> more<00:00:49.230> stable<00:00:49.530> for

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
harder and it's a little more stable for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.869 
harder and it's a little more stable for

my core wire now remember when coiling

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
my core wire now remember when coiling
you<00:01:04.949> want<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> make<00:01:05.430> sure<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.760> coil<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.299> thinner

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you want to make sure you coil a thinner

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.500 
you want to make sure you coil a thinner
wire<00:01:06.960> over<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.560> thicker<00:01:08.010> wire<00:01:08.280> obviously<00:01:08.820> if

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
wire over a thicker wire obviously if

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
wire over a thicker wire obviously if
you<00:01:09.600> try<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.900> other<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.770> would<00:01:10.950> not

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you try the other way you would not

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.969 
you try the other way you would not
succeed<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.970> can't<00:01:12.299> put<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.840> 18<00:01:13.049> gauge<00:01:13.439> over<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
succeed you can't put an 18 gauge over a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.340 
succeed you can't put an 18 gauge over a
20<00:01:14.490> gauge<00:01:14.720> sometimes<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> same

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
20 gauge sometimes you can do the same

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
20 gauge sometimes you can do the same
gauge<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> top<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> same<00:01:17.280> gauge<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.030> you're

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
gauge on top the same gauge but you're

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.640 
gauge on top the same gauge but you're
going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> succeed<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.750> lot<00:01:18.990> more<00:01:19.170> by<00:01:19.320> doing<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
going to succeed a lot more by doing a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.740 
going to succeed a lot more by doing a
smaller<00:01:19.979> gauge<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.610> top<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.270> thicker<00:01:21.479> gauge

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
smaller gauge on top of a thicker gauge

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
smaller gauge on top of a thicker gauge
so<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.320> coiling<00:01:22.740> wire<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.189> thinner

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
so your coiling wire will be thinner

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.170 
so your coiling wire will be thinner
than<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.750> core<00:01:25.049> wire<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
than your core wire so I'm just going to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700 
than your core wire so I'm just going to
go<00:01:27.299> ahead<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.689> started<00:01:28.110> make<00:01:28.380> sure<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
go ahead and get started make sure that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.670 
go ahead and get started make sure that
your<00:01:28.829> coil<00:01:29.159> core<00:01:29.729> wire<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.390> nice<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> straight

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
your coil core wire is nice and straight

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.590 
your coil core wire is nice and straight
so<00:01:32.280> straighten<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.060> need<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> with

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so straighten it if you need to with

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
so straighten it if you need to with
your<00:01:33.750> fingers<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.470> perhaps<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.490> nylon

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
your fingers or perhaps with your nylon

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
your fingers or perhaps with your nylon
jaw<00:01:36.119> pliers<00:01:37.189> just<00:01:38.189> get<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.460> nice<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.640> straight

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
jaw pliers just get it nice and straight

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
jaw pliers just get it nice and straight
this<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.869> even<00:01:40.079> hardens<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> little

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this actually even hardens it a little

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.910 
this actually even hardens it a little
bit<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.570> stay<00:01:42.990> straight<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.740> get

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
bit so it will stay straight and not get

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.109 
bit so it will stay straight and not get
all<00:01:44.009> mangled<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.610> your<00:01:44.729> hand

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
all mangled up in your hand

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.219 
all mangled up in your hand
now<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.079> my<00:01:46.229> coiling<00:01:46.950> wire<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.869> start<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.020> any

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
now for my coiling wire I start with any

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
now for my coiling wire I start with any
given<00:01:49.619> piece<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.070> manageable<00:01:50.610> piece<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.090> wire

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
given piece a manageable piece of wire

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.510 
given piece a manageable piece of wire
this<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.689> about<00:01:51.899> 2<00:01:52.110> feet<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> start

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
this is about 2 feet I'm going to start

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
this is about 2 feet I'm going to start
in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> middle<00:01:54.180> because<00:01:54.689> then<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.049> only<00:01:55.170> have

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in the middle because then I only have

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.620 
in the middle because then I only have
this<00:01:55.619> much<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.070> work<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.850> once<00:01:57.479> I'm

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
this much to work with and once I'm

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.420 
this much to work with and once I'm
finished<00:01:57.659> coiling<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.860> I'm<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
finished coiling this down I'm going to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.139 
finished coiling this down I'm going to
flip<00:01:59.610> over<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.939> coil<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> other<00:02:00.750> side<00:02:01.110> down

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
flip over and coil the other side down

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.609 
flip over and coil the other side down
so<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.420> couple<00:02:03.600> mistakes<00:02:03.810> people<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.320> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so a couple mistakes people make is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.200 
so a couple mistakes people make is
they'll<00:02:04.770> start<00:02:04.890> coiling<00:02:05.430> way<00:02:05.670> back<00:02:05.909> here

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
they'll start coiling way back here

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.429 
they'll start coiling way back here
because<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:06.509> figure<00:02:06.840> they're<00:02:07.049> building

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
because they figure they're building

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.600 
because they figure they're building
this<00:02:07.560> way<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:07.860> they're<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.310> need<00:02:08.489> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
this way so they're going to need that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.999 
this way so they're going to need that
space<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.500> while<00:02:10.860> you're

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
space but if you do that while you're

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.229 
space but if you do that while you're
coiling<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.000> poke

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
coiling you're just going to poke

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.290 
coiling you're just going to poke
yourself<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> arm

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
yourself in the arm

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900 
yourself in the arm
with<00:02:13.660> your<00:02:13.810> core<00:02:13.990> wire<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.950> start<00:02:15.700> down<00:02:15.880> here

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
with your core wire so start down here

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.820 
with your core wire so start down here
towards<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.660> end<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.260> as<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.530> need<00:02:17.680> more

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
towards the end and as you need more

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.160 
towards the end and as you need more
space<00:02:18.100> scoot<00:02:18.760> your<00:02:18.880> coil<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.930> you're<00:02:20.050> not

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
space scoot your coil and if you're not

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.480 
space scoot your coil and if you're not
able<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.500> scoot<00:02:20.800> your<00:02:20.920> coil<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.340> means

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
able to scoot your coil that means

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.040 
able to scoot your coil that means
you're<00:02:21.640> coiling<00:02:22.000> too<00:02:22.180> tight<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.480> you're<00:02:22.930> going

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
you're coiling too tight so you're going

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.440 
you're coiling too tight so you're going
to<00:02:23.080> need<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.440> problem-solve<00:02:24.130> there<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.240> fold

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
to need to problem-solve there so I fold

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.890 
to need to problem-solve there so I fold
it<00:02:25.570> in<00:02:25.720> half<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:27.640> enough<00:02:27.940> wire<00:02:28.240> over<00:02:28.540> here

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
it in half I have enough wire over here

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.140 
it in half I have enough wire over here
to<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.260> hold<00:02:29.590> still<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.220> my<00:02:30.400> left<00:02:30.640> hand<00:02:30.880> this

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
to just hold still in my left hand this

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.930 
to just hold still in my left hand this
is<00:02:31.300> my<00:02:31.450> stabilizing<00:02:31.930> hand<00:02:32.350> I'm<00:02:32.560> right-handed

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
is my stabilizing hand I'm right-handed

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.310 
is my stabilizing hand I'm right-handed
somebody<00:02:33.940> do<00:02:34.000> most<00:02:34.210> of<00:02:34.330> motion<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:34.900> my<00:02:34.930> right

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
somebody do most of motion with my right

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.600 
somebody do most of motion with my right
hand<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.640> out<00:02:36.970> here<00:02:37.450> on<00:02:38.200> my<00:02:38.920> coiling<00:02:39.280> wire<00:02:39.430> I

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
hand so out here on my coiling wire I

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610 
hand so out here on my coiling wire I
hold<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:39.940> about<00:02:40.150> three<00:02:40.510> inches<00:02:40.780> out<00:02:40.960> sort<00:02:41.590> of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
hold it about three inches out sort of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.740 
hold it about three inches out sort of
turn<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:42.100> little<00:02:42.130> bit<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.880> rotates<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.630> my

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
turn it a little bit so it rotates in my

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.620 
turn it a little bit so it rotates in my
fingers<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.860> handle<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:46.330> don't<00:02:46.510> want

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
fingers like a handle but you don't want

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.390 
fingers like a handle but you don't want
to<00:02:46.690> hold<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.440> doesn't<00:02:47.770> turn<00:02:48.160> you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
to hold it so that it doesn't turn you

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.360 
to hold it so that it doesn't turn you
need<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.850> rotate<00:02:50.010> again<00:02:51.010> you're<00:02:51.160> not<00:02:51.250> gonna

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
need it to rotate again you're not gonna

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.740 
need it to rotate again you're not gonna
be<00:02:51.460> able<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.670> see<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.940> coil<00:02:52.150> build<00:02:52.450> up<00:02:52.600> right

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
be able to see the coil build up right

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.420 
be able to see the coil build up right
now<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.050> mainly<00:02:53.530> want<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:53.770> show<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:53.980> the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
now I just mainly want to show you the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.310 
now I just mainly want to show you the
motion<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.820> my<00:02:54.940> hands<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:55.840> I'm<00:02:55.930> holding<00:02:56.140> it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
motion of my hands so I'm holding it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.690 
motion of my hands so I'm holding it
still<00:02:56.560> here<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:56.920> my<00:02:56.950> left<00:02:57.220> hand

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
still here in my left hand

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.700 
still here in my left hand
if<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.300> wire<00:02:58.540> was<00:02:58.840> shorter<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.260> would<00:02:59.530> maybe

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
if this wire was shorter I would maybe

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.980 
if this wire was shorter I would maybe
wrap<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.160> around<00:03:00.250> my<00:03:00.430> finger<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:01.240> stabilize<00:03:01.780> it

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
wrap it around my finger to stabilize it

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.570 
wrap it around my finger to stabilize it
and<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:03.730> coil<00:03:04.060> away<00:03:04.570> from<00:03:04.870> myself<00:03:05.460> trying<00:03:06.460> to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
and I coil away from myself trying to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.510 
and I coil away from myself trying to
get<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.450> wraps<00:03:07.690> right<00:03:08.440> next<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.160> each<00:03:09.280> other

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
get the wraps right next to each other

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.550 
get the wraps right next to each other
you<00:03:10.450> want<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.780> coil<00:03:10.990> away<00:03:11.200> from<00:03:11.410> yourself

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
you want to coil away from yourself

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.890 
you want to coil away from yourself
because<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.430> get<00:03:12.640> much<00:03:13.000> more<00:03:13.030> power<00:03:13.570> that

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
because you can get much more power that

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.330 
because you can get much more power that
way<00:03:13.960> rather<00:03:14.500> than<00:03:14.620> coming<00:03:14.890> towards<00:03:15.220> yourself

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
way rather than coming towards yourself

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.980 
way rather than coming towards yourself
and<00:03:15.700> punching<00:03:16.150> yourself<00:03:16.240> in<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.570> face<00:03:16.630> each

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
and punching yourself in the face each

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.160 
and punching yourself in the face each
time<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:18.040> away<00:03:18.610> from<00:03:18.850> yourself<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.510> more

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
time so away from yourself and more

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.110 
time so away from yourself and more
power<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.709> more<00:03:20.920> speed<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.520> well<00:03:21.790> and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
power and more speed as well and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.040 
power and more speed as well and
ergonomically<00:03:22.780> it's<00:03:23.200> better<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:25.050> so

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
ergonomically it's better for you so

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.390 
ergonomically it's better for you so
again<00:03:26.080> you<00:03:26.500> want<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.739> be<00:03:26.830> able<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.040> move<00:03:27.220> your

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
again you want to be able to move your

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.370 
again you want to be able to move your
coil<00:03:27.700> on<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.030> wire<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:31.959> see<00:03:32.170> the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
coil on the wire and you can see the

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.790 
coil on the wire and you can see the
motion<00:03:32.590> here<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:35.200> I'm<00:03:35.290> going<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.530> bring<00:03:35.650> the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
motion here now I'm going to bring the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.290 
motion here now I'm going to bring the
camera<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> little<00:03:36.489> tighter<00:03:36.700> now<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.209> you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
camera in a little tighter now so you

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.250 
camera in a little tighter now so you
can<00:03:37.420> see<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.690> coil<00:03:37.930> actually<00:03:38.380> being<00:03:39.070> built<00:03:39.250> up

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.350 

here's<00:03:46.260> my<00:03:46.440> coil<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.950> far<00:03:47.190> from<00:03:47.489> what<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.849> saw

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
here's my coil so far from what you saw

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.960 
here's my coil so far from what you saw
me<00:03:48.599> doing<00:03:48.930> from<00:03:49.410> back<00:03:49.590> off<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> little<00:03:50.069> bit<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
me doing from back off a little bit the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.640 
me doing from back off a little bit the
camera<00:03:51.239> doesn't<00:03:51.420> want<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:51.660> totally<00:03:52.170> focus<00:03:52.349> on

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
camera doesn't want to totally focus on

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.860 
camera doesn't want to totally focus on
that<00:03:52.800> small<00:03:53.280> coils<00:03:53.849> come<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> little<00:03:54.540> closer

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
that small coils come a little closer

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.449 
that small coils come a little closer
you<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.200> at<00:03:55.319> least<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:56.010> they're<00:03:56.190> tight

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
you can at least see that they're tight

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.270 
you can at least see that they're tight
and<00:03:56.819> again<00:03:57.690> I've<00:03:57.840> got<00:03:58.050> this<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.530> my<00:03:58.739> left<00:03:59.040> hand

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and again I've got this in my left hand

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.790 
and again I've got this in my left hand
here<00:03:59.610> nice<00:03:59.849> and<00:03:59.880> stable<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.720> out<00:04:00.900> here<00:04:01.380> I'm

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
here nice and stable and out here I'm

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.330 
here nice and stable and out here I'm
going<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.099> continue<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.700> coil<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:04.200> watch<00:04:04.980> as

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
going to continue to coil so watch as

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.640 
going to continue to coil so watch as
they<00:04:05.849> line<00:04:06.209> up<00:04:10.310> coiling<00:04:11.310> away<00:04:11.549> from<00:04:11.730> myself

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
they line up coiling away from myself

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.849 
they line up coiling away from myself
shifting<00:04:13.650> as<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.890> need<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:18.470> now<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.500> want<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.709> show

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
shifting as I need to now I want to show

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.979 
shifting as I need to now I want to show
you<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.040> couple<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.459> tricks<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.540> total

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
you a couple of tricks this is a total

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.030 
you a couple of tricks this is a total
over<00:04:22.350> exaggeration<00:04:23.070> but<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.669> want<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.540> show<00:04:24.720> you

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
over exaggeration but I want to show you

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.750 
over exaggeration but I want to show you
that<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.070> almost<00:04:26.430> go<00:04:27.120> like<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:28.460> see<00:04:29.460> how<00:04:29.639> I'm

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
that I almost go like this see how I'm

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.379 
that I almost go like this see how I'm
kind<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:30.180> almost<00:04:30.360> overlapping<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.500> there<00:04:32.389> by

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
kind of almost overlapping it there by

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.180 
kind of almost overlapping it there by
doing<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:33.930> because<00:04:34.139> this<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.620> round<00:04:34.860> wire

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
doing that because this is round wire

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.280 
doing that because this is round wire
it'll<00:04:35.669> take<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.120> wire<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.600> but<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.900> right<00:04:37.169> up

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
it'll take this wire and but it right up

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.200 
it'll take this wire and but it right up
against<00:04:37.590> those<00:04:37.830> existing<00:04:38.430> coils<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.000> lay

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
against those existing coils and lay

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.450 
against those existing coils and lay
right<00:04:39.479> down<00:04:39.510> next<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.200> so<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:40.919> don't<00:04:41.190> do<00:04:41.340> it

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
right down next to it so I don't do it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.340 
right down next to it so I don't do it
that<00:04:41.850> drastic<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.540> just<00:04:42.750> did<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.169> way<00:04:43.290> to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
that drastic I just did it that way to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.110 
that drastic I just did it that way to
show<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.680> but<00:04:44.220> if<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.460> keep<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.820> in<00:04:44.850> mind

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
show you but if you keep that in mind

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.460 
show you but if you keep that in mind
that<00:04:45.300> little<00:04:45.540> trick<00:04:45.750> it'll<00:04:45.960> get<00:04:46.110> them<00:04:46.290> nice

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
that little trick it'll get them nice

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.840 
that little trick it'll get them nice
and<00:04:46.500> tight<00:04:48.830> got<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> couple<00:04:50.100> gaps<00:04:50.400> there<00:04:50.639> but

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
and tight got a couple gaps there but

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.140 
and tight got a couple gaps there but
that's<00:04:50.970> okay

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
that's okay

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.850 
that's okay
now<00:04:54.150> instead<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.570> continuing<00:04:55.320> with<00:04:55.350> this<00:04:55.590> coil

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
now instead of continuing with this coil

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.170 
now instead of continuing with this coil
I'm<00:04:55.979> going<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.160> pretend<00:04:56.430> like<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.760> piece<00:04:57.000> is

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
I'm going to pretend like this piece is

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.810 
I'm going to pretend like this piece is
done<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:59.010> I'm<00:04:59.130> going<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.310> show<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.550> now<00:04:59.789> how

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
done and I'm going to show you now how

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.610 
done and I'm going to show you now how
to<00:05:00.120> flip<00:05:00.419> it<00:05:00.539> over<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:01.050> work<00:05:01.289> on<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.590> other

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
to flip it over and work on the other

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.070 
to flip it over and work on the other
side
