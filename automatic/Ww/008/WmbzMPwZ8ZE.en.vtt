00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
welcome back in this tutorial I want to

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.679 
welcome back in this tutorial I want to
talk<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> create<00:00:03.480> a

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
talk about how to create a

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.360 
talk about how to create a
two-dimensional<00:00:04.020> drawing<00:00:04.650> from<00:00:04.859> your<00:00:05.040> 3d

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
two-dimensional drawing from your 3d

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.490 
two-dimensional drawing from your 3d
part<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.879> have<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> part<00:00:06.870> open<00:00:06.960> here<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.410> we

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
part I have a part open here that we

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.610 
part I have a part open here that we
modeled<00:00:07.859> earlier<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> class<00:00:09.469> what<00:00:10.469> we

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
modeled earlier in the class what we

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.379 
modeled earlier in the class what we
want<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:10.980> able<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.190> do<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.580> communicate<00:00:11.820> on

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
want to be able to do is communicate on

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.330 
want to be able to do is communicate on
paper<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.230> part<00:00:13.500> would<00:00:13.679> look<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
paper what this part would look like and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.740 
paper what this part would look like and
so<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:15.030> want<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> be<00:00:15.389> able<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
so to do that we want to be able to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.439 
so to do that we want to be able to
create<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.650> front<00:00:17.010> view<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.670> top<00:00:17.880> view<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.210> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
create a front view and a top view and a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.720 
create a front view and a top view and a
side<00:00:18.660> view<00:00:18.690> drawing<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.250> glimpses<00:00:20.520> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
side view drawing we can get glimpses of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
side view drawing we can get glimpses of
what<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.150> will<00:00:21.270> look<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.480> by<00:00:21.900> changing<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
what that will look like by changing the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140 
what that will look like by changing the
view<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.830> heads-up<00:00:23.430> display

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
view in the heads-up display

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.689 
view in the heads-up display
there's<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> top<00:00:25.470> view<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.430> look<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
there's a top view and then we look and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.460 
there's a top view and then we look and
there's<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.119> view<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:28.050> sometimes

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
there's a right view and then sometimes

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.200 
there's a right view and then sometimes
drawings<00:00:28.949> include<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:31.070> three<00:00:32.070> view<00:00:32.340> now

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
drawings include a three view now

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.180 
drawings include a three view now
industry<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.020> changing<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> move<00:00:35.070> away

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
industry is really changing to move away

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.310 
industry is really changing to move away
from<00:00:35.370> drawings<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.090> move<00:00:36.239> more<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> 3d<00:00:37.050> part

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
from drawings and move more to 3d part

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.900 
from drawings and move more to 3d part
models<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.250> send<00:00:38.730> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
models so you would actually send this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
models so you would actually send this
to<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> manufacturer<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> 3d<00:00:40.410> model<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to the manufacturer as a 3d model if you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920 
to the manufacturer as a 3d model if you
wanted<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> build<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.719> at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> same

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
wanted them to build it but at the same

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.990 
wanted them to build it but at the same
time<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.559> record-keeping<00:00:44.250> purposes<00:00:44.489> it's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
time for record-keeping purposes it's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
time for record-keeping purposes it's
always<00:00:45.270> nice<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> drawing<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
always nice to have a drawing so to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
always nice to have a drawing so to
create<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> drawing<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.879> part<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> go

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
create a drawing from a part if you go

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.180

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
now we'll go ahead and choose a which is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.009 
now we'll go ahead and choose a which is
just<00:01:00.960> fine<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> does<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> it

a top view and if you drag over kind of
diagonal<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> creates<00:01:27.420> an<00:01:27.509> isometric<00:01:28.140> view

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
diagonal it creates an isometric view

right click I automatically exit out of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960 
right click I automatically exit out of
that<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:38.070> guys<00:01:38.280> aren't<00:01:38.490> laid<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.820> exactly

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that these guys aren't laid out exactly

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.730 
that these guys aren't laid out exactly
like<00:01:39.329> I'd<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> drag<00:01:40.470> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
like I'd like so I'm going to drag this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
like I'd like so I'm going to drag this
view<00:01:41.070> over<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.909> by<00:01:42.090> clicking<00:01:42.570> in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
view over and I do that by clicking in

view over and I do that by clicking in
the<00:01:43.020> view<00:01:43.229> area<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.829> see<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> dashed

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the view area you can see the dashed

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.440 
the view area you can see the dashed
blue<00:01:44.579> line<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.299> dragging<00:01:46.280> ok<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> turns

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
blue line and dragging ok and it turns

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.359 
blue line and dragging ok and it turns
out<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.439> using<00:01:49.860> first-angle

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
out actually this is using first-angle

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.039 
out actually this is using first-angle
projection<00:01:50.450> there's<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> difference<00:01:51.899> between

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
projection there's a difference between

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
projection there's a difference between
first<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> third<00:01:52.799> angle<00:01:53.340> projection<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.119> I'd

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
first and third angle projection and I'd

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.910 
first and third angle projection and I'd
like<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> change<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> third<00:01:55.619> angle

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
like to change it to a third angle

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.469 
like to change it to a third angle
projection<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> standard<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.420> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
nice drawing but what I really want to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.690 
nice drawing but what I really want to
do<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.379> I<00:02:18.470> want<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.769> start<00:02:18.980> dimensioning<00:02:19.579> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
do is I want to start dimensioning the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.309 
do is I want to start dimensioning the
part<00:02:19.939> and<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.269> can<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.599> that<00:02:20.720> by<00:02:20.900> clicking<00:02:20.959> on

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
part and I can do that by clicking on

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.770 
part and I can do that by clicking on
the<00:02:21.439> annotation<00:02:21.620> tab<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.790> my<00:02:23.450> smart

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the annotation tab and my smart

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.410 
the annotation tab and my smart
dimension<00:02:24.290> tool<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.829> here<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:25.879> like<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.239> was

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
dimension tool is here just like it was

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.410 
dimension tool is here just like it was
when<00:02:27.049> I<00:02:27.110> was<00:02:27.290> creating<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.920> part<00:02:28.159> and<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:29.239> can

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
when I was creating the part and I can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.330 
when I was creating the part and I can
go<00:02:29.540> ahead<00:02:29.659> and<00:02:30.109> make<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.349> smart<00:02:30.769> dimension

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
go ahead and make a smart dimension

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.970 
go ahead and make a smart dimension
you'll<00:02:32.120> notice<00:02:32.569> though<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.349> dimension

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
you'll notice though that that dimension

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.160 
you'll notice though that that dimension
let<00:02:34.670> me<00:02:34.760> get<00:02:34.909> it<00:02:35.000> unselected<00:02:35.299> shows<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.140> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
let me get it unselected shows up is a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.380 
let me get it unselected shows up is a
light<00:02:36.470> gray<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.670> dimension<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.209> what's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
light gray this dimension is what's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.970 
light gray this dimension is what's
called<00:02:38.629> a<00:02:38.750> reference<00:02:39.230> dimension<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.890> it's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
called a reference dimension and it's

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.679 
called a reference dimension and it's
not<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.370> actual<00:02:40.519> type<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.180> dimension<00:02:41.569> we

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
not the actual type of dimension we

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.380 
not the actual type of dimension we
should<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.989> making<00:02:42.170> most<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.829> time<00:02:43.390> what

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
should be making most of the time what

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.759 
should be making most of the time what
we<00:02:44.480> really<00:02:44.780> want<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.049> use<00:02:45.109> it<00:02:45.260> are<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
we really want to use it are the

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.339 
we really want to use it are the
dimensions<00:02:46.040> we<00:02:46.400> use<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.329> create<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.900> part<00:02:48.170> and

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
dimensions we use to create the part and

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.640 
dimensions we use to create the part and
so<00:02:48.739> we<00:02:48.889> click<00:02:49.099> on<00:02:49.220> model<00:02:49.700> items<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.470> then<00:02:51.470> we

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
so we click on model items and then we

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.250 
so we click on model items and then we
can<00:02:51.799> say<00:02:52.040> source<00:02:52.519> or<00:02:52.790> dash<00:02:53.079> destination<00:02:54.079> and

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
can say source or dash destination and

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.369 
can say source or dash destination and
we<00:02:54.379> choose<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.920> entire<00:02:55.280> model<00:02:55.639> and<00:02:56.230> we<00:02:57.230> can

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
we choose the entire model and we can

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.280 
we choose the entire model and we can
under<00:02:57.889> dimensions<00:02:58.189> we<00:02:58.760> can<00:02:58.790> check<00:02:59.599> marked<00:03:00.079> for

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
under dimensions we can check marked for

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.890 
under dimensions we can check marked for
drawing<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.889> we<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:01.879> check<00:03:02.060> not<00:03:02.359> marked<00:03:02.720> for

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
drawing and we can check not marked for

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.420 
drawing and we can check not marked for
drawing<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.379> this<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.709> going<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:03.920> import<00:03:04.250> all

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
drawing so this is going to import all

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.869 
drawing so this is going to import all
the<00:03:04.459> dimensions<00:03:05.000> we<00:03:05.150> put<00:03:05.359> on<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.659> part<00:03:05.900> and

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
the dimensions we put on the part and

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.910 
the dimensions we put on the part and
lastly<00:03:07.879> I<00:03:07.909> think<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:08.299> can<00:03:08.480> choose<00:03:08.780> we'll<00:03:09.739> just

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
lastly I think we can choose we'll just

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.339 
lastly I think we can choose we'll just
go<00:03:10.040> ahead<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.400> click<00:03:10.879> on<00:03:11.030> check<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:11.659> what

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
go ahead and click on check and what

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.869 
go ahead and click on check and what
this<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.650> going<00:03:12.829> to<00:03:12.889> do<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.099> it<00:03:13.220> automatically

part when it was created you can click

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.449 
part when it was created you can click
on<00:03:19.280> dimensions<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.940> move<00:03:20.060> them<00:03:20.269> around<00:03:21.459> as

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
on dimensions and move them around as

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
you like you'll notice SolidWorks 2010

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.369 
you like you'll notice SolidWorks 2010
has<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:25.970> new<00:03:26.209> feature<00:03:26.389> when<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.959> click<00:03:27.199> on<00:03:27.319> a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
dimension it opens up a context manager

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.530 
dimension it opens up a context manager

where you can edit the text right in

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.589 
where you can edit the text right in
this<00:03:32.780> spot<00:03:33.049> so<00:03:33.109> I<00:03:33.319> could<00:03:33.500> say<00:03:33.680> typ<00:03:34.519> for<00:03:35.090> typical

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
this spot so I could say typ for typical

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.229 
this spot so I could say typ for typical
here<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.799> will<00:03:36.980> make<00:03:37.609> it<00:03:37.790> known<00:03:37.940> that

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
here and that will make it known that

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.960 
here and that will make it known that
this<00:03:38.389> if<00:03:39.079> i<00:03:39.199> zoom<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.040> dimensioning

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
this if i zoom in this is dimensioning

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.479 
this if i zoom in this is dimensioning
the<00:03:41.209> fill<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.810> right<00:03:41.989> here<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.470> by<00:03:42.739> adding<00:03:42.949> typ

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
the fill it right here and by adding typ

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.670 
the fill it right here and by adding typ
we<00:03:43.909> know<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:44.750> typical<00:03:45.379> so<00:03:45.530> where

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
we know that that's typical so where

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.050 
we know that that's typical so where
there's<00:03:45.829> other<00:03:46.010> fill<00:03:46.310> it's<00:03:46.489> we<00:03:46.609> can<00:03:46.639> do<00:03:46.879> that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
there's other fill it's we can do that

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.629 
there's other fill it's we can do that
it's<00:03:47.959> always<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:48.349> good<00:03:48.620> practice<00:03:48.889> to<00:03:49.310> make<00:03:49.459> sure

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
it's always a good practice to make sure

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.069 
it's always a good practice to make sure
that<00:03:49.819> your<00:03:49.970> dimensions<00:03:50.479> are<00:03:50.599> off<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.780> a

overlapping the dimensions let me move
this<00:03:59.120> bottom<00:03:59.540> one<00:03:59.569> down<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.079> can<00:04:00.199> see<00:04:00.349> it<00:04:00.470> kind

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
this bottom one down you can see it kind

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.699 
this bottom one down you can see it kind
of<00:04:00.680> moves<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.760> other<00:04:02.329> two<00:04:03.109> views<00:04:03.379> and<00:04:03.560> if<00:04:03.620> i

zoom<00:04:03.739> in<00:04:04.069> on<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.400> what's<00:04:05.329> unique<00:04:05.720> about

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
zoom in on this what's unique about

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.469 
zoom in on this what's unique about
these<00:04:06.530> drawing<00:04:07.010> these<00:04:07.430> dimensions<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:08.359> you

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479 
these drawing these dimensions is you

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.659 
these drawing these dimensions is you
see<00:04:08.629> that<00:04:08.780> they're<00:04:08.900> black<00:04:09.229> and<00:04:09.560> what<00:04:10.159> happens

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
see that they're black and what happens

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.210 
see that they're black and what happens
is<00:04:10.909> that<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.299> can<00:04:11.569> now<00:04:11.750> modify<00:04:12.229> my<00:04:12.560> part<00:04:12.829> by<00:04:13.010> just

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
is that I can now modify my part by just

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.250 
is that I can now modify my part by just
double-clicking<00:04:13.579> on<00:04:13.940> dimension<00:04:14.900> right<00:04:15.049> here

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
double-clicking on dimension right here

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.629 
double-clicking on dimension right here
so<00:04:15.440> say<00:04:15.650> I<00:04:15.680> want<00:04:15.979> to<00:04:16.039> make<00:04:16.190> this<00:04:16.340> three

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
so say I want to make this three

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.120 
so say I want to make this three
quarters<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.000> an<00:04:17.239> inch<00:04:17.329> instead<00:04:18.130> now

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
quarters of an inch instead now

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.250 
quarters of an inch instead now
everything<00:04:20.030> goes<00:04:20.060> gray<00:04:20.630> because<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:21.019> needs<00:04:21.169> to

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
everything goes gray because it needs to

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.350 
everything goes gray because it needs to
be<00:04:21.409> rebuilt<00:04:21.889> so<00:04:22.219> if<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.490> click<00:04:22.700> on<00:04:22.789> my<00:04:22.969> rebuild

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
be rebuilt so if I click on my rebuild

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.750 
be rebuilt so if I click on my rebuild
button<00:04:23.860> it's<00:04:24.860> going<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:25.070> work<00:04:25.219> on<00:04:25.400> rebuilding

button it's going to work on rebuilding
that<00:04:26.060> Gian

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
that Gian

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.080 
that Gian
with<00:04:26.949> that<00:04:27.070> dimension<00:04:27.520> at<00:04:27.610> three<00:04:27.880> quarters

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
with that dimension at three quarters

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.620 
with that dimension at three quarters
and<00:04:28.570> now<00:04:29.169> if<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.470> go<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.710> my<00:04:29.889> window<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.790> go<00:04:31.419> back

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
and now if I go to my window and go back

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.620 
and now if I go to my window and go back
over<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:31.960> example<00:04:32.440> five<00:04:32.940> my<00:04:33.940> geometry<00:04:34.240> has

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
over to example five my geometry has

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.350 
over to example five my geometry has
changed<00:04:35.050> here<00:04:35.560> as<00:04:35.740> well<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.850> that's<00:04:37.090> why<00:04:37.300> you

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
changed here as well so that's why you

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.450 
changed here as well so that's why you
want<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.810> use<00:04:37.840> dimensions<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:38.949> are<00:04:39.070> black

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
want to use dimensions that are black

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.640 
want to use dimensions that are black
because<00:04:39.940> by<00:04:40.330> doing<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.410> can<00:04:41.620> actually

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
because by doing that you can actually

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.370 
because by doing that you can actually
edit<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.610> part<00:04:42.880> directly<00:04:43.479> from<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.050> drawing

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
edit the part directly from the drawing

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.960 
edit the part directly from the drawing
if<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.710> had<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:44.919> reference<00:04:45.370> dimension<00:04:45.550> you

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
if you had a reference dimension you

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120 
if you had a reference dimension you
wouldn't<00:04:46.240> be<00:04:46.360> able<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.630> do<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.919> make<00:04:48.100> a

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
wouldn't be able to do that so make a

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.500 
wouldn't be able to do that so make a
good<00:04:48.370> drawing<00:04:48.639> make<00:04:48.880> sure<00:04:49.030> that<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.300> pull

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
good drawing make sure that you pull

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.450 
good drawing make sure that you pull
your<00:04:49.660> dimensions<00:04:50.139> far<00:04:50.380> enough<00:04:50.560> away<00:04:50.740> make

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
your dimensions far enough away make

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.010 
your dimensions far enough away make
sure<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.760> they're<00:04:51.940> all<00:04:51.970> readable<00:04:52.600> so

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
sure that they're all readable so

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.780 
sure that they're all readable so
SolidWorks<00:04:53.560> isn't<00:04:53.830> super<00:04:54.130> smart<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.580> still

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
SolidWorks isn't super smart you still

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.790 
SolidWorks isn't super smart you still
have<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.120> go<00:04:55.270> in<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.690> edit<00:04:55.930> dimensions

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
have to go in and edit dimensions

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.500 
have to go in and edit dimensions
I<00:04:56.830> like<00:04:57.400> this<00:04:57.550> angle<00:04:57.729> dimension<00:04:58.000> we<00:04:58.360> should

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
I like this angle dimension we should

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.939 
I like this angle dimension we should
probably<00:04:58.630> move<00:04:58.960> out<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.229> little<00:04:59.560> bit<00:04:59.770> so<00:04:59.919> that

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
probably move out a little bit so that

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.000 
probably move out a little bit so that
