00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
little little bits of yarn that I've

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.480 
little little bits of yarn that I've
been<00:01:37.079> collecting<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:38.100> want<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> use

Columbia<00:01:42.659> Dona<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.500> sorry<00:01:43.860> about<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.600> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
Columbia Dona I'm sorry about that so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.999 
Columbia Dona I'm sorry about that so
anyway<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> thought<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.619> make<00:01:46.799> more

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
anyway I thought it would make more

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.090 
anyway I thought it would make more
sense<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.360> moved<00:01:48.810> everything

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
sense if I moved everything

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.700 
sense if I moved everything
here<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.159> let's<00:01:53.909> say<00:01:54.530> let's<00:01:55.530> say

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
here so that I could let's say let's say

here so that I could let's say let's say
I<00:01:55.740> wanted<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> use<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.820> yarn<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.360> I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I wanted to use up this yarn but I

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.910 
I wanted to use up this yarn but I
didn't<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.810> anything<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.259> would<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.710> with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
didn't have anything that would go with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
didn't have anything that would go with
it

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
it

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.670 
it
I<00:01:59.970> would<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.509> able<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.840> pull<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.440> one<00:02:01.650> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
I would be able to pull out from one of

I would be able to pull out from one of
my<00:02:01.830> main<00:02:02.070> yarn<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.890> stash<00:02:05.280> something<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
use you know to put with it so I can

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.820 
use you know to put with it so I can
make<00:02:08.250> good<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:09.840> why<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:10.649> up

called for 800 yards and according to my

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.920 
called for 800 yards and according to my
calculations<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.100> had<00:02:56.519> enough<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.720> did

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
calculations I had enough but it did

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.780 
calculations I had enough but it did
call<00:02:58.200> for<00:02:58.230> more<00:02:58.680> than<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.280> had<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.670> go

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
call for more than that so I had to go

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.130 
call for more than that so I had to go
back<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.329> little<00:03:00.510> bit<00:03:00.660> more<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.019> this

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
vanna's choice Barling and it was a

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.770 
vanna's choice Barling and it was a
little<00:03:06.750> bit<00:03:06.900> off<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.260> wasn't<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.769> same<00:03:08.040> lot<00:03:08.780> so

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
little bit off it wasn't the same lot so

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.660 
little bit off it wasn't the same lot so
it's<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.989> little<00:03:10.200> bit<00:03:10.350> off<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:11.340> doesn't

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
