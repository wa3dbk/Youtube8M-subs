past

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.950 

there<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> future<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:19.300> participants<00:02:20.300> they

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
there is a future for participants they

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.200 
there is a future for participants they
can<00:02:21.140> go<00:02:21.290> quite<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> long<00:02:22.250> way<00:02:22.400> up<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.670> chain<00:02:22.700> and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
can go quite a long way up the chain and

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.090 
can go quite a long way up the chain and
obviously<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.080> they<00:02:24.170> then<00:02:24.320> move<00:02:24.560> into<00:02:24.740> cars

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
obviously if they then move into cars

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.000 
obviously if they then move into cars
they<00:02:25.790> can<00:02:25.970> get<00:02:26.150> into<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.570> senior<00:02:27.080> formula<00:02:27.590> in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
they can get into the senior formula in

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.770
