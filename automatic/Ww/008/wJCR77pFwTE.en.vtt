thing<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.789> do<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:11.120> make<00:02:11.270> sure<00:02:11.480> you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
thing to do is just make sure you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.720 
thing to do is just make sure you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
like seating by skill goes i guess that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.970 
like seating by skill goes i guess that
is<00:02:35.000> subjective<00:02:35.600> but<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.320> could<00:02:36.470> basically<00:02:36.709> i

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
is subjective but you could basically i

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.090 
is subjective but you could basically i
just<00:02:37.190> take<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.640> look<00:02:37.850> at<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.360> know<00:02:39.100> recent

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
just take a look at like you know recent

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.280 
just take a look at like you know recent
performances<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.910> bigger<00:02:41.900> tournaments

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
performances in bigger tournaments

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.740 
performances in bigger tournaments
whether<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.580> on<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.970> west<00:02:44.180> coast<00:02:44.269> or

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
whether it's like on the west coast or

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.750 
whether it's like on the west coast or
worldwide<00:02:45.200> yeah<00:02:45.890> there<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.160> no<00:02:46.280> real<00:02:46.430> science

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
worldwide yeah there is no real science

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.699 
worldwide yeah there is no real science
to<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.030> i<00:02:47.150> would<00:02:47.330> say<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:48.140> would<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.350> awesome<00:02:48.500> if

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
to it i would say it would be awesome if

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.170 
to it i would say it would be awesome if
it<00:02:48.800> was<00:02:48.950> like<00:02:49.010> MLG<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.850> know<00:02:49.940> there<00:02:50.060> was<00:02:50.120> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
it was like MLG and you know there was a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.150 
it was like MLG and you know there was a
real<00:02:50.330> league<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.350> know<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.980> play

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
real league and you know you play

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.979 
real league and you know you play
throughout<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.489> season<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.570> accumulated

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
throughout a season and you accumulated

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.990 
throughout a season and you accumulated
these<00:02:54.170> points<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.130> reality<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:55.670> you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
these points but the reality is that you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.979 
these points but the reality is that you
know<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.300> said<00:02:56.330> it's<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> grassroots

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
know like you said it's a grassroots

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.009 
know like you said it's a grassroots
tournament<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:59.300> just<00:02:59.480> have<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.750> look<00:02:59.870> at

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
tournament so you just have to look at

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.400 
tournament so you just have to look at
each<00:03:00.230> player's<00:03:00.530> individual<00:03:01.340> performances

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
each player's individual performances

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.479 
each player's individual performances
seating<00:03:03.410> by<00:03:03.530> region<00:03:03.860> though<00:03:03.980> that's<00:03:04.190> easy<00:03:04.370> I

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
seating by region though that's easy I

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.670 
seating by region though that's easy I
just<00:03:04.820> break<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.060> down<00:03:05.390> by<00:03:05.810> States<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.380> then

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
just break it down by States and then

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.620 
just break it down by States and then
you<00:03:06.769> know<00:03:06.890> cities<00:03:07.220> or<00:03:07.400> whatever<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.940> feel<00:03:08.420> like

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
you know cities or whatever I feel like

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.120 
you know cities or whatever I feel like
with<00:03:08.810> random<00:03:09.170> seating<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> problem<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.100> that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
with random seating the problem is that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.130 
with random seating the problem is that
although<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.329> do<00:03:11.600> want<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:13.959> absolutely<00:03:14.959> no

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
although you do want like absolutely no

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.319 
although you do want like absolutely no
bias<00:03:15.579> that's<00:03:16.579> what<00:03:16.700> you're<00:03:16.820> looking<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:17.180> when

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
bias that's what you're looking for when

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.460 
bias that's what you're looking for when
you<00:03:17.450> when<00:03:17.780> you're<00:03:17.900> looking<00:03:18.079> when<00:03:18.350> you're

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
you when you're looking when you're

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.289 
you when you're looking when you're
doing<00:03:18.680> random<00:03:18.950> seating<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.430> feel<00:03:20.030> like<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.269> just

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
doing random seating I feel like it just

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.789 
doing random seating I feel like it just
hurts<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.750> tournament<00:03:21.170> more<00:03:21.470> than<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.709> helps

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
hurts the tournament more than it helps

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.710 
hurts the tournament more than it helps
as<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:23.570> like<00:03:24.250> sometimes<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.489> lot<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:26.690> know

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
as in like sometimes a lot of you know

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.530 
as in like sometimes a lot of you know
top<00:03:27.290> players<00:03:27.590> or<00:03:28.220> whatever<00:03:28.459> are<00:03:28.760> fooled<00:03:29.360> into

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
top players or whatever are fooled into

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.670 
top players or whatever are fooled into
you<00:03:30.530> know<00:03:30.650> one<00:03:30.799> bracket<00:03:31.010> early<00:03:31.640> on<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.030> then<00:03:32.810> I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
you know one bracket early on and then I

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.580 
you know one bracket early on and then I
feel<00:03:33.950> like<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:35.450> skill<00:03:35.840> levels<00:03:36.170> like<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.440> feel

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
feel like the skill levels like I feel

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.960 
feel like the skill levels like I feel
like<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.920> doesn't<00:03:37.190> properly<00:03:37.519> represent<00:03:37.940> a

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
like it doesn't properly represent a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.080 
like it doesn't properly represent a

started with so I'm just really fond of
it<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:09.110> gotta<00:04:10.110> say<00:04:10.319> like<00:04:10.640> I'm<00:04:11.640> not<00:04:11.879> old<00:04:12.090> school

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.199 
I think CBS 2 is like the perfect game
from<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.560> generation<00:04:19.970> like<00:04:20.970> during<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
from that generation like during the

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.640 
from that generation like during the
Dark<00:04:21.419> Ages<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:21.810> everything<00:04:22.139> third<00:04:22.350> strike

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
Dark Ages and everything third strike

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.219 
Dark Ages and everything third strike
