 we now have a big 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.370
 pan 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.739
 in Frankfurt the rigor will drop 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.469
 canola oil by haguenau tiles 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.179
 Seasoned noted paul salt and pepper 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 super important to make sure of well 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.129
 seasoned all the sides of our as 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 when you start to smoke 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.950
 slightly cetad drop a piece of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.890
 meat the important cbl we really want 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
 well colored each of the sides of no 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.170
 do not reject to create a beautiful hollow 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.509
 what is it going to prevent the juice triggered 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.909
 during cooking in a beautiful little 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.399
 tasty guy once our senses good 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.800
 browned we're just going to drop two 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.270
 leaks and in the same pan one 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.119
 will add our union 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.910
 we are a little salt the pepper of the mill 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.800
 I throw myself which shows you there are you 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.780
 so hot it takes 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.910
 really progress with notation 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.280
 that before his g au lait have little sugar 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.590
 and threw a little bit of brown sugar as well 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.800
 that the apartment is given a good taste 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.229
 sweetened with walnut we will buy our leaves 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.050
 laurel and white goes ice is 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.569
 nice mix there with a copper beer and 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.640
 it will remain almost anyone 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.080
 what color beer flavor for 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.459
 our team today but 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.379
 personally I found that the 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.670
 coppery it married perfectly 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:08.399
 with the taste of sport 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.679
 if I had a big rating the crucible 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.239
 at home it's really the ideal because 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.879
 that we can leave from our shoulder of 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.250
 pork on both supports and send it 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.349
 directly same corner in the fake 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.239
 unfortunately we have none in the archi 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.050
 culinary so we decided to go there 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.090
 with the skillet and the broiler pan 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.650
 used brown sugar for the abuser 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.030
 of today but if you prefer 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.370
 make a variety of 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.980
 registered honey stop excellent 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.810
 or even better to keep that good of 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.880
 with us maple syrup 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.490
 as soon as it starts to simmer we go 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.680
 pour on our tool we will throw 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.020
 some branches of thyme we will cover 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.350
 of aluminum foil to send that 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.510
 in an oven preheated to 250 degrees 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.340
 fahrenheit for long cooking 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.340
 about 4 to 5 hours 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.909
 once we have removed our room from 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.000
 paul dufour it's very important to 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.489
 leave a good rest for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.190
 and that you'll stay warm and more 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.970
 will allow the juice to stay well in 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.190
 the meat 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.930
 so as we say so often to 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.349
 Culinary anarchy is now the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.150
 time to unveil the beast 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.730
 it was not my house but it smells 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.579
 good in cursed in kitchen here we 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 take care and a little piece we see here 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.650
 like a perfect cooking it is still 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.940
 slightly pink in the center we go 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.250
 simply serve it on a plate with 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.750
 some echoes when the price time of 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.659
 blanch with boiling water 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.730
 about 4 to 5 minutes after we got them 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.040
 drop down at the bar with a little bit of 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.739
 sel we will buy a little bit of our 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.060
 juice and that's a nice traditional dish 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.870
 Quebec 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.870
