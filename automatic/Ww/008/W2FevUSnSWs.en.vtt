it's going to be a hot-button issue and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
it's going to be a hot-button issue and
I<00:01:09.450> think<00:01:09.690> that<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.069> part<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
I think that you know that was part of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.410 
I think that you know that was part of
the<00:01:11.399> challenge<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.910> going<00:01:12.119> into<00:01:12.240> this

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the challenge and going into this

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.740 
the challenge and going into this
reporting<00:01:12.959> what<00:01:13.709> I<00:01:13.849> found<00:01:14.849> though<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.599> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
reporting what I found though in the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.540 
reporting what I found though in the
response<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.440> this<00:01:16.590> story<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.429> it

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
response to this story was that it

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.910 
response to this story was that it
wasn't<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.179> controversial<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.560> had<00:01:19.679> thought

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
wasn't as controversial as I had thought

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
wasn't as controversial as I had thought
I<00:01:20.190> mean<00:01:20.459> you<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.849> kind<00:01:21.209> of<00:01:21.300> their<00:01:21.479> knee-jerk

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
I mean you have kind of their knee-jerk

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.169 
I mean you have kind of their knee-jerk
reactions<00:01:22.800> of<00:01:23.099> like<00:01:23.399> this<00:01:23.550> is<00:01:23.700> population

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
reactions of like this is population

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.949 
reactions of like this is population

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
nations but what I really saw was a was

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.370 
nations but what I really saw was a was
was<00:01:38.970> more<00:01:39.209> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> dialogue<00:01:39.569> that<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.110> starting

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
was more of a dialogue that was starting

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.660 
was more of a dialogue that was starting
to<00:01:40.500> begin<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:40.920> people<00:01:41.190> are<00:01:41.280> seeing<00:01:41.459> that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
to begin where people are seeing that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
to begin where people are seeing that
these<00:01:41.849> problems<00:01:42.179> are<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:44.539> being<00:01:45.539> people

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
these problems are really being people

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
these problems are really being people
are<00:01:46.440> experiencing<00:01:47.039> these<00:01:47.160> problems<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
are experiencing these problems of

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.120 
are experiencing these problems of
resource<00:01:48.090> scarcity<00:01:48.179> of<00:01:48.690> lack<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> access<00:01:49.739> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
resource scarcity of lack of access to

collapse<00:01:52.709> and<00:01:53.340> decline<00:01:53.849> in<00:01:54.330> ways<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
collapse and decline in ways that that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.139 
collapse and decline in ways that that
are<00:01:55.619> affecting<00:01:56.009> their<00:01:56.130> lives<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:59.149> think

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
are affecting their lives and so I think

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.389 
are affecting their lives and so I think
in<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.690> context<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.319> that<00:02:01.440> population<00:02:02.280> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
in the context of that population is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.850 
in the context of that population is
becoming<00:02:02.550> a<00:02:03.060> less<00:02:03.239> controversial<00:02:03.860> element

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
becoming a less controversial element

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.660 
becoming a less controversial element
and<00:02:06.229> population<00:02:07.229> health<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.560> environment<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and population health and environment I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.369 
and population health and environment I
think<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.420> why<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.840> getting<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.229> much

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
think this is why it's getting so much

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.140 
think this is why it's getting so much
traction<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.160> why<00:02:11.400> people<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.819> starting<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
traction and why people are starting to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.560 
traction and why people are starting to
