00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
chicken coop did you get a lot of teams

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.620 
chicken coop did you get a lot of teams
I<00:00:30.840> got<00:00:30.930> about<00:00:31.320> 20<00:00:31.590> chickens<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.390> these<00:00:33.390> are

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I got about 20 chickens here these are

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.660 
I got about 20 chickens here these are
all<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.960> different<00:00:34.080> stages<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.340> three

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
all in different stages I have three

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
all in different stages I have three
different<00:00:35.850> generations<00:00:36.600> three<00:00:36.870> different

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
different generations three different

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
different generations three different
years<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.530> chickens<00:00:37.920> chickens<00:00:38.790> typically<00:00:39.239> lay

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
years of chickens chickens typically lay

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
years of chickens chickens typically lay
eggs<00:00:39.720> for<00:00:40.140> two<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.470> three<00:00:40.530> years<00:00:40.710> when<00:00:41.190> they

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
eggs for two to three years when they

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580 
eggs for two to three years when they
stop<00:00:41.550> producing<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.690> every<00:00:42.989> year<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.230> need<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
stop producing so every year I need to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
stop producing so every year I need to
get<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:43.980> chicken<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.850> can

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
get more chicken so that I can

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.720 
get more chicken so that I can
continually<00:00:45.720> have<00:00:45.960> eggs<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.860> now<00:00:47.040> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
continually have eggs right now the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
continually have eggs right now the
chickens<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.480> produce<00:00:48.900> about<00:00:49.170> five

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
chickens that I have produce about five

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
chickens that I have produce about five
to<00:00:50.460> six<00:00:50.640> eggs<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> day<00:00:51.409> I<00:00:52.409> eat<00:00:53.400> them<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.390> produce

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to six eggs a day I eat them I produce

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.399 
to six eggs a day I eat them I produce
eggs<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:56.129> also<00:00:56.309> sell<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.909> eggs<00:00:57.080> and<00:00:58.080> the

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
eggs and I also sell my eggs and the

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.250 
eggs and I also sell my eggs and the
reason<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> sell<00:00:59.790> my<00:00:59.820> exes<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.750> don't

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
reason I like to sell my exes I don't

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.820 
reason I like to sell my exes I don't
nearly<00:01:01.500> eat<00:01:02.339> 5x<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> day<00:01:03.269> or<00:01:03.900> at<00:01:04.140> times<00:01:04.409> I've<00:01:04.680> had

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
nearly eat 5x a day or at times I've had

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.710 
nearly eat 5x a day or at times I've had
a<00:01:04.890> dozen<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.670> chickens<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.690> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
a dozen or more chickens and you get a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
a dozen or more chickens and you get a
dozen<00:01:06.990> eggs<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.470> day<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.030> what<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.300> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
dozen eggs a day and so what I do is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.149 
dozen eggs a day and so what I do is
sell<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.330> locals<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.010> friends<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
sell them to locals and friends and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.460 
sell them to locals and friends and
family<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.940> therefore<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.720> offsets<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.440> cost

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
family and therefore it offsets the cost

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.340 
family and therefore it offsets the cost
and<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.970> idea<00:01:18.270> behind<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and so the idea behind all of that is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
and so the idea behind all of that is
that<00:01:19.650> these<00:01:20.190> guys<00:01:20.430> pay<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.700> themselves

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that these guys pay for themselves

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.630 
that these guys pay for themselves
they're<00:01:21.930> self-sustaining<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:23.190> provide

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
they're self-sustaining they provide

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
they're self-sustaining they provide
protein<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.810> provide<00:01:25.200> food<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:26.130> provide<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
protein they provide food they provide a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.330 
protein they provide food they provide a
resource<00:01:26.910> that<00:01:27.260> that<00:01:28.260> is<00:01:28.470> really<00:01:28.920> easy<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
resource that that is really easy to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.550 
resource that that is really easy to
maintain<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:30.120> care<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.510> now<00:01:30.900> chicken

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
maintain and take care of now chicken

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.680 
maintain and take care of now chicken
coop<00:01:31.740> setup<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.250> much<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.940> mean<00:01:33.390> yours<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
coop setup how much I mean yours is

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.860 
coop setup how much I mean yours is
pretty<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.950> thorough<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.550> mean<00:01:36.000> how<00:01:36.570> much<00:01:36.690> did

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
pretty very thorough I mean how much did

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.410 
pretty very thorough I mean how much did
it<00:01:36.900> cost<00:01:37.020> roughly<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.950> set<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.940> up

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it cost roughly to set this up

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.770 
it cost roughly to set this up
how<00:01:39.570> were<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> winter<00:01:41.780> wintertime

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
how were they in the winter wintertime

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.290 
how were they in the winter wintertime
we<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> heat<00:01:43.320> lamp<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.670> hang<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.120> heat

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
we have the heat lamp so I hang a heat

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.790 
we have the heat lamp so I hang a heat
lamp<00:01:45.330> over<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.900> roof<00:01:46.080> this<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.440> where<00:01:46.680> they

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
lamp over the roof this is where they

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.010 
lamp over the roof this is where they
sleep<00:01:47.100> at<00:01:47.310> night<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> roost

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
sleep at night it is on the roost

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.920 
sleep at night it is on the roost
and<00:01:49.310> typically<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.700> lay<00:01:50.909> eggs<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.450> domestic

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and typically they lay eggs in domestic

and typically they lay eggs in domestic
boxes<00:01:52.439> occasionally<00:01:53.430> you'll<00:01:53.579> find<00:01:53.610> them

boxes occasionally you'll find them
elsewhere<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.720> they're<00:01:55.259> pretty<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.680> about

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
pecking order that is a real thing

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.930 
pecking order that is a real thing
basically<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.230> alphas<00:02:25.739> on<00:02:26.459> top<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.880> the

tend<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> get<00:02:30.690> picked<00:02:30.959> up<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.560> does<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.340> mean

production slows down in the winter time

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.819

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
due to the cold months but they still

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.830 
due to the cold months but they still
produce<00:02:56.010> all<00:02:56.549> year<00:02:56.850> long<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.780> said

produce all year long and like I said
they<00:02:58.109> typically<00:02:58.440> produce<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:59.100> two<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.340> three

they typically produce for two to three
years<00:02:59.820> well<00:03:00.299> how<00:03:00.600> could<00:03:00.810> someone<00:03:01.079> get<00:03:01.410> started

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
years well how could someone get started

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.530 
years well how could someone get started
I<00:03:02.010> mean<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:02.609> do<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.730> recommend<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.420> get

have a horse stall that I can dedicate
towards<00:03:09.829> chicken<00:03:10.829> coop<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.730> don't<00:03:11.910> need

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
towards chicken coop but you don't need

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.699 
towards chicken coop but you don't need
that<00:03:12.180> at<00:03:12.329> all<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.720> could<00:03:13.079> do<00:03:13.170> something<00:03:13.440> as

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
that at all you could do something as

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.920 
that at all you could do something as
simple<00:03:13.890> as<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.190> small<00:03:14.670> building<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:15.810> an

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
simple as a small building with an

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.080 
simple as a small building with an
extension<00:03:16.260> cord<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.829> runs<00:03:16.890> out<00:03:17.340> with<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
extension cord that runs out with a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.990 
extension cord that runs out with a
small<00:03:19.049> heater<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.950> want<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.220> use<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.370> red<00:03:20.730> heat

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
small heater you want to use a red heat

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.030 
small heater you want to use a red heat
lamp<00:03:21.299> because<00:03:22.230> especially<00:03:22.769> when<00:03:22.920> they're

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
lamp because especially when they're

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.640 
lamp because especially when they're
young<00:03:23.069> if<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.730> use<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.850> white<00:03:24.209> heat<00:03:24.540> bulb<00:03:24.840> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
young if you use a white heat bulb the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.580 
young if you use a white heat bulb the
chickens<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.160> go<00:03:26.280> blind<00:03:26.519> actually<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.660> that's

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
chickens can go blind actually so that's

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.920 
chickens can go blind actually so that's
an<00:03:28.769> important<00:03:29.220> factor<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.569> could<00:03:30.780> do

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
an important factor but you could do

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 
an important factor but you could do
something<00:03:31.140> with<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.500> dog<00:03:31.799> run<00:03:32.100> okay

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
something with a dog run okay

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.809 
something with a dog run okay
and<00:03:33.299> what<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.079> would<00:03:34.230> what<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.829> would<00:03:35.100> advise<00:03:35.400> is

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
and what I would what I would advise is

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.030 
and what I would what I would advise is
to<00:03:35.850> use<00:03:36.359> like<00:03:36.750> an<00:03:36.870> eight-foot<00:03:37.260> fence<00:03:37.500> that

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
to use like an eight-foot fence that

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.949 
to use like an eight-foot fence that
even<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.489> have<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.670> roof<00:03:38.970> over<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.660> don't

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
even to have a roof over it you don't

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.330 
even to have a roof over it you don't
want<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.200> lose<00:03:40.319> any<00:03:40.530> chickens<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.069> wild

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
want to lose any chickens to wild

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.550 
want to lose any chickens to wild
animals<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.420> better<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.989> take<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
animals it's better to take the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.680 
animals it's better to take the
precaution<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.639> do<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.420> want<00:03:45.630> a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
precaution and do that if you want a

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.539 
precaution and do that if you want a
free-range<00:03:46.049> chicken<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.829> do<00:03:46.889> you<00:03:47.220> have<00:03:47.250> to

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
free-range chicken like I do you have to

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.490 
free-range chicken like I do you have to
be<00:03:47.700> willing<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.209> lose<00:03:48.600> some<00:03:48.930> chickens<00:03:49.290> here

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
be willing to lose some chickens here

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.250 
be willing to lose some chickens here
and<00:03:49.620> there<00:03:49.769> so

and there so
-<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.629> mean<00:03:52.800> sometimes<00:03:53.800> when<00:03:54.250> you<00:03:54.340> get<00:03:54.489> it<00:03:54.580> from

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
- I mean sometimes when you get it from

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.490 
- I mean sometimes when you get it from
the<00:03:54.790> feed<00:03:55.030> store<00:03:55.330> they're<00:03:55.569> typically<00:03:56.019> five

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
stores they tend to be a little

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.860 
stores they tend to be a little
healthier<00:04:03.010> I've<00:04:03.519> gotten<00:04:03.879> some<00:04:04.090> via<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.690> mail
