00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
called the extreme metal pedal because

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.609 
called the extreme metal pedal because
it'll<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.750> extreme<00:01:37.110> metal<00:01:37.350> there's<00:01:37.500> no

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
question but it definitely can do

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.320 
question but it definitely can do
classic<00:01:40.200> rock<00:01:40.380> tones<00:01:40.619> -<00:01:40.970> anything<00:01:41.970> kind<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.240> in

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
classic rock tones - anything kind of in

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.370 
between a medium gain to a very high
gain<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.179> not<00:01:45.270> limited<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.690> just<00:01:45.780> metal

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
gain so it's not limited to just metal

gain so it's not limited to just metal
absolutely<00:01:47.009> man<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.550> anything<00:01:47.970> cool
