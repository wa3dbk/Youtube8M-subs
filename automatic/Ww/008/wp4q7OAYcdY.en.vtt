00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.219 
the first thing is something I've been
wanting<00:05:22.639> for<00:05:22.939> a<00:05:22.969> long<00:05:23.000> time<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.659> it's

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
wanting for a long time and it's

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.709 
wanting for a long time and it's
basically<00:05:24.439> a<00:05:25.009> coat<00:05:25.430> that<00:05:25.699> fits<00:05:26.029> in<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.389> really

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
basically a coat that fits in a really

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.809 
basically a coat that fits in a really
small<00:05:26.930> bag<00:05:27.139> so<00:05:27.560> it's<00:05:27.680> sort<00:05:27.830> of<00:05:28.009> like<00:05:28.159> a<00:05:28.370> nice

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
small bag so it's sort of like a nice

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.059 
small bag so it's sort of like a nice
Packer<00:05:29.210> Mac<00:05:29.539> I<00:05:29.810> guess<00:05:30.259> and<00:05:30.529> it's<00:05:30.800> called<00:05:30.979> the

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
Packer Mac I guess and it's called the

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.309 
Packer Mac I guess and it's called the
ultralight<00:05:31.639> down<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.810> just<00:05:33.020> looks<00:05:33.229> like

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
ultralight down and it just looks like

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.290 
ultralight down and it just looks like
this<00:05:33.740> it's<00:05:34.129> sort<00:05:34.490> of<00:05:34.639> like<00:05:34.789> your<00:05:35.060> standard

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
this it's sort of like your standard

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.300 
this it's sort of like your standard
double<00:05:35.900> coat<00:05:36.080> but<00:05:36.289> it's<00:05:36.409> really<00:05:36.740> really

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
double coat but it's really really

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.760 
double coat but it's really really
really<00:05:37.610> lightweight<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.509> obviously<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.500> can

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
really lightweight and obviously it can

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.309 
really lightweight and obviously it can
be<00:05:39.949> condensed<00:05:40.789> into<00:05:41.210> a<00:05:41.240> really<00:05:41.599> small<00:05:41.960> space

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
be condensed into a really small space

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.200 
be condensed into a really small space
so<00:05:42.830> just<00:05:42.919> think<00:05:43.250> how<00:05:43.310> gets<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:43.759> much<00:05:43.909> wear<00:05:44.180> out

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
so just think how gets so much wear out

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.999 
so just think how gets so much wear out
of<00:05:44.479> this<00:05:44.629> because<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:45.110> fits<00:05:45.409> really<00:05:45.650> nicely

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
of this because it fits really nicely

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.189 
of this because it fits really nicely
without<00:05:46.339> looking<00:05:46.879> sort<00:05:47.180> of<00:05:47.270> too<00:05:47.509> bulky<00:05:47.870> and

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
without looking sort of too bulky and

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.559 
without looking sort of too bulky and
like<00:05:48.830> when<00:05:49.400> you're<00:05:49.580> going<00:05:49.729> skiing<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.330> guess

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
like when you're going skiing I guess

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.990 
like when you're going skiing I guess
but<00:05:50.839> it<00:05:51.139> keeps<00:05:51.949> you<00:05:52.069> really<00:05:52.339> warm<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:52.789> it's

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
but it keeps you really warm and it's

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.790 
but it keeps you really warm and it's
shower<00:05:53.210> proof<00:05:53.539> so<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:53.930> know<00:05:54.050> gonna<00:05:54.409> get<00:05:54.589> loads

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
shower proof so I know gonna get loads

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.290 
shower proof so I know gonna get loads
of<00:05:54.919> use<00:05:55.099> out<00:05:55.250> of<00:05:55.310> this<00:05:55.520> because<00:05:55.849> I<00:05:55.939> definitely

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
of use out of this because I definitely

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.909 
of use out of this because I definitely
just<00:05:56.449> slip<00:05:56.839> it<00:05:56.960> in<00:05:57.050> my<00:05:57.169> bag<00:05:57.349> when<00:05:57.500> I'm<00:05:57.620> going<00:05:57.800> to

just slip it in my bag when I'm going to

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.920 
just slip it in my bag when I'm going to
the<00:05:58.039> city<00:05:58.250> center<00:05:58.699> or<00:05:58.789> something<00:05:59.210> then<00:05:59.779> the

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
the city center or something then the

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.689

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
something very plain and it's just this

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.519 
something very plain and it's just this
plain<00:06:04.250> black<00:06:04.819> scar<00:06:05.360> I<00:06:05.629> believe<00:06:06.169> this<00:06:06.379> was

plain black scar I believe this was

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.350
