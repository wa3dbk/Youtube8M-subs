markers in the back as you can see so we

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.310 
markers in the back as you can see so we
knit<00:00:19.599> the<00:00:19.810> first<00:00:20.170> three<00:00:21.160> stitches<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:23.140> were

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
we place the first stitch marker so we

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.710 
we place the first stitch marker so we
