they off obviously thanks as the tank
empties<00:02:38.130> out<00:02:38.250> you've<00:02:38.460> got<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.670> level<00:02:39.120> Aarthi

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
empties out you've got to level Aarthi

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.680 
empties out you've got to level Aarthi
yeah<00:02:40.730> what<00:02:41.730> you've<00:02:41.880> got<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.240> thing<00:02:42.450> called<00:02:42.570> a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
yeah what you've got is a thing called a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.490 
yeah what you've got is a thing called a
proportional<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.530> each<00:02:43.730> tank<00:02:44.730> group<00:02:45.320> right<00:02:46.320> on

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
proportional in each tank group right on

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.620 
proportional in each tank group right on
the<00:02:46.560> left<00:02:46.740> hand<00:02:46.950> side<00:02:47.160> there<00:02:47.490> we've<00:02:48.390> got<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
the left hand side there we've got to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.850 
the left hand side there we've got to
read<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> range<00:02:49.020> with<00:02:49.200> all<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> other<00:02:49.709> wing

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
read the range with all the other wing

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.190 
read the range with all the other wing
pumps<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:51.570> you've<00:02:51.690> got<00:02:51.840> several<00:02:52.140> different

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
pumps so you've got several different

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.770 
pumps so you've got several different
cells<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.190> didn't<00:02:53.430> contaminate<00:02:53.670> pump<00:02:54.390> each<00:02:54.600> to

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
cells so didn't contaminate pump each to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.220 
cells so didn't contaminate pump each to
each<00:02:54.930> tank<00:02:55.230> rather<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.250> you've<00:02:56.370> got<00:02:56.550> x<00:02:56.880> 1a<00:02:57.150> 1b<00:02:57.540> 3

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
each tank rather so you've got x 1a 1b 3

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.960 
each tank rather so you've got x 1a 1b 3
4<00:02:58.410> 5<00:02:58.620> 6<00:02:58.920> &amp;<00:02:59.280> 6<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.640> b<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.910> c<00:03:01.700> there's<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.820> thing

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
4 5 6 &amp; 6 a b and c there's a thing

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.640 
4 5 6 &amp; 6 a b and c there's a thing
called<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.180> proportional<00:03:03.690> which<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> pump<00:03:04.290> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
called a proportional which is a pump it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.210 
called a proportional which is a pump it
set<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:06.000> draws<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:07.220> proportionate

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
set up so it draws a proportionate

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.610 
set up so it draws a proportionate
amount<00:03:08.250> out<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.850> each<00:03:08.970> tank<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.660> they<00:03:09.810> all<00:03:09.989> live

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
amount out of each tank so they all live

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.979 
amount out of each tank so they all live
locally<00:03:11.340> at<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> same<00:03:12.330> time<00:03:12.600> i<00:03:12.630> thought<00:03:12.930> i

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
locally at the same time i thought i

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.890 
locally at the same time i thought i
went<00:03:13.320> at<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> same<00:03:13.860> time<00:03:14.160> or<00:03:15.120> enter<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.690> same

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
went at the same time or enter the same

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.530 
went at the same time or enter the same
rate<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.950> idea<00:03:17.220> being<00:03:17.459> then<00:03:18.000> go<00:03:18.150> individually

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
rate the idea being then go individually

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.490 
rate the idea being then go individually
manage<00:03:19.230> every<00:03:19.500> single<00:03:19.920> tank<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:22.019> takes<00:03:22.380> a

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
manage every single tank so it takes a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.590 
manage every single tank so it takes a
lot<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.860> work<00:03:23.340> out<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.760> managing<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.330> fuel

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
lot of the work out of managing the fuel

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.870 
lot of the work out of managing the fuel
usage<00:03:25.140> if<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.620> like<00:03:25.800> but<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> still<00:03:26.700> got<00:03:26.850> to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
usage if you like but you still got to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.670 
usage if you like but you still got to
keep<00:03:27.060> an<00:03:27.239> eye<00:03:27.390> on<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.989> fuel<00:03:28.200> load<00:03:28.440> by<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
keep an eye on the fuel load by the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.470 
keep an eye on the fuel load by the
gauges<00:03:29.220> at<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> top<00:03:29.700> as<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.970> where<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> fuel

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
gauges at the top as to where the fuel

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
gauges at the top as to where the fuel
is<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.930> eat<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.560> center<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.920> gravity<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.310> the

yeah<00:04:20.590> let's<00:04:20.949> fuel<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:21.970> should<00:04:22.180> chose<00:04:22.449> you

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
yeah let's fuel so it should chose you

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.780 
yeah let's fuel so it should chose you
away<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:22.900> owe<00:04:23.290> your<00:04:23.560> galleries<00:04:24.040> so<00:04:24.490> if<00:04:24.639> this

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
away you owe your galleries so if this

away you owe your galleries so if this
never<00:04:25.030> process<00:04:25.630> if<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.229> aircraft<00:04:26.680> was<00:04:27.010> set

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
never process if the aircraft was set

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.189 
never process if the aircraft was set
for<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:27.580> bomber<00:04:27.880> configurations<00:04:28.810> would<00:04:29.020> not

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
for but bomber configurations would not

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.870 
for but bomber configurations would not

gas to the locking mechanism unlocks the

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.550 
gas to the locking mechanism unlocks the
hatch<00:07:10.279> and<00:07:10.669> then<00:07:11.539> the<00:07:11.690> gas<00:07:11.870> goes<00:07:12.110> down<00:07:12.349> these

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
hatch and then the gas goes down these

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.409 
hatch and then the gas goes down these
pipes<00:07:12.860> to<00:07:13.069> these<00:07:13.279> checks<00:07:13.610> which<00:07:13.880> blows<00:07:14.150> the

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.730 
front of the canopy up into the air flow
and<00:07:16.759> then<00:07:17.270> the<00:07:17.630> fo<00:07:17.870> catches<00:07:18.229> it<00:07:18.349> and<00:07:18.409> takes<00:07:18.590> it

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
and then the fo catches it and takes it

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.099 
and then the fo catches it and takes it
off<00:07:19.930> so<00:07:20.930> it<00:07:21.110> leaves<00:07:21.590> the<00:07:21.740> aircraft
