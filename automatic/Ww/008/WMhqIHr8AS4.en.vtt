00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.980
 she is closed friends farmer hello welcome on con side 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.250
 the measure voted but why a new takeoff of the Belgians who will 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.409
 bring on the day on the world knows mps 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.389
 honzik this 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.439
 the last one lie to spend more than the same lasalle mark 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.839
 a cooler cpu who are we ultra performing with a specific design 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.900
 how to get out of his box 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.109
 slowly 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.330
 without a net 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.509
 as always as you know this business 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.100
 and on the farm we like to take risks 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 especially on unpacking 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.680
 fight time to go around the camera 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.890
 to power bring the box is so feed 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.320
 listen to you unveil the other 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 considering the behavior 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.890
 as often in amateurs on the stage a troop all the necessary 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.190
 for mounting 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.310
 to know the bacterium the compatible cpu 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.070
 with all the processors on the market 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 the small module that allows to lower the speed of the fan the dough 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 thermal 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.190
 the visit to mounting lens and the different ap mounting tracks 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.020
 COURBEVOIE 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 master on the base since this summer 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.920
 Yes 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.630
 we also have a small assembly instructions 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.630
 very complete 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.840
 as always before hitting the ventirad we will go around the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 box story to know a little about the specifications 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.680
 of the last 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.159
 so we have a base for his part in copper of the club executives at the same time 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.320
 my biggest concern 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.150
 but the net 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.680
 in aluminium 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.660
 a weight of 600 grams which is not deceived him one of the dimensions of 130 2 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.690
 by 4 against 64 thousand meters 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.140
 we do not have a fan of 120 millimeters no blues that will fall 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.480
 2000 to 1950 turn August 2000 among the first four rounds with the small 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.020
 module 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 average level 17h33 of the bearn pau 17 apam 3 db with the small module that allows 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.540
 to lower the speed 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 to convince you all 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.210
 the technical characteristics 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.119
 on your mind 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.450
 its recovery is countered we can still know this concept is simple 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.909
 few things are not so small that it's going to take control of the match 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.909
 we're going to get the head out of the department 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.489
 his arrival so always there a little bit difficult to unpack 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.489
 almost live by 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.409
 and here is the 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.359
 11 5 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 but we know that this is the novelty c the new provision 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.089
 fins very fin very thin 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.819
 not very spaced with a shape 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.679
 see must 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.839
 auclair enters and springs on each side 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:47.799
 with here 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 a splitter bar how much divided the flow 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.889
 on the right flank a plastic cover a little too suicide with m 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.589
 the cnps it is said that it 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.509
 in the front the fan no doubt 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:02.499
 below 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.790
 the base that as you can see and in absolutely treatment 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.599
 as always at the same no trace of his age his own records 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.379
 own 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.620
 and for once counted heat pipes ap 2 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.840
 3 4 five more heat pipes that leave in each the two groupings danette 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.510
 parma that's what we could say about this is a plague in a room 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.989
 new critters of chelsea same 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.310
 we'll see you soon before that for you to test it at 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.799
 full 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:30.980
 people11 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.999
 see you soon 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.159
 especially side 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.079
 story of seeing a new take-off 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.129
 on our products 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.379
 we do not know which one will see soon
