 quick video I'll show you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.750
 how to check ip ip 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.969
 their network cards yours if you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 have more than one clear is what 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.090
 usually happens when you have a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.480
 notebook that you have a network card 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 on a wired network card 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 so I'll show you how 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.510
 check the ip of your boards 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.510
 using the command and pp with fig 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 I'm going to run here for those who do not know 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 just press the key combination one 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 gay that would be the one with the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.559
 control-side windows alt + a 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.370
 r mouse button and type the command 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.930
 1cm of what is already typed here 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 on the black screen that would be the prompt 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.750
 you are going to dictate the following 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.649
 ip config command and press the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.510
 enter 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.790
 you have here the internet adapter 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.350
 local connection would be the wired network 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 daniel specific connection suffix ta 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.140
 blank ipv4 address this is here 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:20.340
 very important is 192 168 points 10,151 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.040
 subnet mask 255 255 255 00 and default 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.159
 1926 8.0 point 10 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.110
 this is the address of your 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.740
 machine from your computer 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.100
 in 1926 8.0 point 155 so if anyone 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.409
 request that address from a 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.270
 network anything like any 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.340
 person 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.079
 You will pass this address here. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.979
 complete 19 2008 10.151 is usually the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.659
 that the staff asks for the mask and the cat and 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.460
 no staff does not ask to access 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.259
 something like that just for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.110
 check the setting if access to 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.820
 microphone is not available but when 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.600
 I 'll upload your network, you 'll see in another video 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.960
 that here would be part of the red network 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.860
 red and the last rouch part only 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.660
 I will not explain in this video. 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.020
 The cat and pattern in detail is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.630
 important it would be your router in the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.610
 jack and the cat is the way for you 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.020
 always on the internet 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.800
 in this case on this virtual machine 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.800
 using being in 1926 8.0 point 10 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.390
 personal beauty 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.700
 these tunnels here in some tits you 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.870
 will see two or three shifts or even 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.990
 you have a machine 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.240
 virtual machine on real machine 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.100
 you will have some network adapters 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.710
 more for example vehemence and adds 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.420
 some adapters two adapters is 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.040
 which would be for the creation of networks 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.810
 virtual innate bridge other modes 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.600
 available for this 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.340
 if you had a network card 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.550
 wireless in the case of a notebook 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.290
 You would have another copy of this here. 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.990
 only instead of local internet connection 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.400
 beating wireless network or them some 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.500
 thing but would have the same data 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.010
 They are like day but here, give and trust. 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.330
 baal he will show you in more detail 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.330
 some information here 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.250
 from up there would be the first command 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.620
 and from here down, according to the bass 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.900
 to get the baal host name already shows 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.570
 the machine name some information to 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.030
 plus it's primary is blank and 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.430
 ask in the hybrid and have other miscellaneous 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.680
 information on the card directly on the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.150
 connection network in place I have to 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.300
 description of the board so I know 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.910
 I have an intel pramil mt network 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.840
 connection and I 'll show you here the 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.670
 of the plate 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.760
 in this case he is showing pro 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.720
 because the model used in hair sell 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.180
 the mac address if you have any idea of ​​cp 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.920
 ipv4 address again here it shows 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.690
 shows several other 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.700
 information will not show much 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.500
 in detail because there is no focus 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.840
 This video is personal, I wanted to make a 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.190
 video quick just to show you 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.300
 how to verify ip 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.720
 in case someone requests access 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.900
 remote to the technician asks you the ip 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.919
 of your machine you already know how to see 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.240
 basically resuming here fast and p 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.889
 config 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.190
 This address is fine, people, beauty. 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.740
 This video was short there only. 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.330
 really to show ipê and this is the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.250
 objective of the next videos that I will 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.220
 staff always short videos and 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.819
 beauty goals until the next video up
