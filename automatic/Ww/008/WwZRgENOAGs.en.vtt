00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.739

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.910
 optional if you want to paint your cookies 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.320
 of colors in a bowl you will place your 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.600
 butter or sugar egg 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.400
 in the amount of vanilla you want 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.130
 now beat all the ingredients up 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.110
 that are well mixed do not stop 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.110
 beat and add your flour slowly 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.789
 [Music] 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.189
 when your mix reached a 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.049
 consistency so stop beating 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.180
 now on a clean surface with 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.979
 wheat flour that is to help me 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.590
 more soul and mix and do not stick 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.049
 Now more to your mix for 5 minutes 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.920
 so you can manipulate it and do the 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.920
 figures you want 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.230
 [Music] 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 When you finish kneading it will not be done in 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.400
 mind that it is a mixture is shiny and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.110
 they are not going to stick to their hands 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.910
 [Applause] 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.190
 and all paint your colorful cookies 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.320
 Separate your dough into balls depending on 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.540
 how many colors are you going to use in this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.760
 case I'm going to paint four and one I'm going to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.980
 leave the natural I will paint my little table 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.810
 with your hands but so you do not paint yourself 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.440
 I recommend you use a glove 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 let's make an ojito here in our 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.710
 mass and let's put droplets of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.110
 coloring what you consider necessary 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.600
 to paint your dough and I go as 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.260
 stirring this up trying not to 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.260
 leave the color 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.340
 this on a surface that can be 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.739
 clean because the coloring is very 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 strong and can penetrate to paint the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:24.599
 table or what you use 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.599
 [Music] 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.920
 you have not finished painting your dough looks 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.920
 making little balls 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.530
 and you put them in a tray with paper 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.569
 waxed then with a lid or something 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 circular you're going to press it to give it the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.480
 shape of a button 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:49.050
 [Applause] 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:50.820
 [Music] 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.930
 when it ends, it should be left 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.390
 well your buttons 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.090
 then with a slightly pointed stick 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.040
 are you going to make the cock of the button the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.920
 objective of this is to press it hard 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.050
 so that the eyes are made well 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.180
 when you finish mind your cookies at 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.459
 oven for 10 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.469
 When 10 minutes have passed, take them out 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.160
 of the oven take off the cookies from the 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:18.349
 tray and put them where a plate 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.349
 [Music] 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.280
 To decorate them I will use strips of 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.200
 Mullah gummies gummies with weave 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:36.730
 button as if it were the thread 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:37.730
 [Music] 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:46.040
 [Applause] 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:48.290
 [Music] 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.760
 When finished, serve your delicious 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.760

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.299
 [Applause] 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.950
 It's super easy to do apart from the 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.170
 ingredients are not that difficult to 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.329
