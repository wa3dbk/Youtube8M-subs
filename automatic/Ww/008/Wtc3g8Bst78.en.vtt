00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.319 
again Shazam stopwatch and so it's
really<00:01:46.890> kind<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> taking<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> guess<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.149> what

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
really kind of taking a guess of what

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.730 
really kind of taking a guess of what
you<00:01:48.450> might<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.630> looking<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.320> top<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you might be looking for but top of the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.170 
you might be looking for but top of the
list<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> gallery<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.880> starts<00:01:51.119> with

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
list is gallery because it starts with

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.300 
list is gallery because it starts with
the<00:01:51.299> ga<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.590> want<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.799> delete<00:01:52.920> anything

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the ga and if we want to delete anything

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
the ga and if we want to delete anything
as<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.700> saw<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.509> kind<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> make<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> line

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
as you saw you just kind of make a line

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
as you saw you just kind of make a line
backwards<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.850> pretty<00:01:57.030> cool

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
backwards like that and it's pretty cool

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.330 
backwards like that and it's pretty cool
that's<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> application<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> an

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that's the application if you have an

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.450 
that's the application if you have an
Android<00:01:59.430> go<00:02:00.030> check<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> out
