that coveted preamp and all it is is an

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.819 
that coveted preamp and all it is is an

f EG system that has a simple gain of
only<00:00:38.010> 11<00:00:38.430> DB<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.809> adds<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.379> lot<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.920> just

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
only 11 DB but it adds a lot of just

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.180 
only 11 DB but it adds a lot of just
charm<00:00:41.579> warmth<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:43.260> bit<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> natural

interaction between the preamp and the
power<00:00:48.030> supply<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.530> an

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
power supply it's kind of like an

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.000 
power supply it's kind of like an
enhancer<00:00:50.750> conditioner<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.800> we

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

just<00:00:53.370> pointed<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> magic<00:00:54.539> sauce<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.110> things

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
just pointed the magic sauce of things

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
just pointed the magic sauce of things
but<00:00:56.010> anyway<00:00:56.460> once<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.760> give<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> listen<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
but anyway once you give a listen this

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.090 
but anyway once you give a listen this
is<00:00:57.629> amplifier<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.770> ready<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
is amplifier that's just about ready to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.569 
is amplifier that's just about ready to
go<00:00:59.250> over<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> top<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
go over the top and then with it on it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.270 
go over the top and then with it on it
just<00:01:02.789> gives<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.170 

Meenakshi<00:01:09.280> changed<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.640> little<00:01:09.820> bit<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
Meenakshi changed a little bit of the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.020 
Meenakshi changed a little bit of the
dynamic<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.050> peck<00:01:11.290> attack

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
dynamic so the peck attack

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.510 
dynamic so the peck attack
or<00:01:13.690> suppressed<00:01:14.140> well<00:01:14.560> right<00:01:14.740> after<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.159> gets

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
or suppressed well right after it gets

this<00:03:31.380> takes<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.070> little<00:03:32.370> bit<00:03:32.580> more<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.120> a

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
this takes a little bit more of a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.690 
this takes a little bit more of a
variation<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.390> far<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> tone<00:03:37.080> control

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
variation as far as the tone control

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.450 
variation as far as the tone control
actually<00:03:38.700> has<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.820> lot<00:03:39.090> more<00:03:39.120> dimension

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
actually has a lot more dimension

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.070 
actually has a lot more dimension
whereas<00:03:41.460> you<00:03:41.580> can<00:03:41.730> really<00:03:42.060> round<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.660> off<00:03:42.810> and

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
whereas you can really round it off and

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.650 
whereas you can really round it off and
make<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.350> soaring<00:03:43.740> legato<00:03:44.100> or<00:03:44.490> nice<00:03:44.880> brisk<00:03:45.450> and

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
make it soaring legato or nice brisk and

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.530 
make it soaring legato or nice brisk and
bright<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:47.130> also<00:03:47.370> has<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.760> really<00:03:48.000> hot<00:03:48.270> what

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
bright and it also has a really hot what

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.560 
bright and it also has a really hot what
I<00:03:48.570> think<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.050> really<00:03:49.080> nice<00:03:49.470> drawing<00:03:49.920> of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
I think is really nice drawing of

the tweaker and you can also find in
here<00:06:27.120> which<00:06:27.330> is<00:06:27.479> very<00:06:27.690> coveted<00:06:28.280> inductors

here which is very coveted inductors
called<00:06:29.520> a<00:06:29.610> halo<00:06:29.940> inductor<00:06:30.389> we've

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
called a halo inductor we've

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.200 
called a halo inductor we've
reintroduced<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:32.070> and<00:06:32.250> it's<00:06:32.759> got<00:06:32.850> some<00:06:33.090> really

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
reintroduced it and it's got some really

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.670 
reintroduced it and it's got some really
nice<00:06:33.449> great<00:06:33.750> artifacts<00:06:34.260> a<00:06:34.410> little<00:06:34.590> mechanical

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
nice great artifacts a little mechanical

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.620 
nice great artifacts a little mechanical
noise<00:06:35.340> which<00:06:35.639> actually<00:06:35.820> adds<00:06:36.180> to<00:06:36.510> the

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
noise which actually adds to the

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.870 
noise which actually adds to the
breathing<00:06:37.139> of<00:06:37.260> it<00:06:37.410> and<00:06:37.830> almost<00:06:38.039> the<00:06:38.370> harmonic

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
breathing of it and almost the harmonic

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.659 
breathing of it and almost the harmonic
howl<00:06:39.270> which<00:06:39.630> is<00:06:39.780> really<00:06:40.020> nice<00:06:40.229> and<00:06:40.580> but<00:06:41.580> it's

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
howl which is really nice and but it's

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.159 
howl which is really nice and but it's
very<00:06:41.789> straightforward<00:06:42.120> also<00:06:42.900> it<00:06:42.990> doesn't

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
very straightforward also it doesn't

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.590 
very straightforward also it doesn't
have<00:06:43.410> a<00:06:43.440> buffer<00:06:43.770> so<00:06:44.460> it<00:06:44.789> actually<00:06:44.970> the<00:06:45.270> guitar

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
have a buffer so it actually the guitar

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.500 
have a buffer so it actually the guitar
sees<00:06:45.960> the<00:06:46.169> old<00:06:46.350> school<00:06:46.910> amplifier<00:06:47.910> loading

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
sees the old school amplifier loading

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.300 
sees the old school amplifier loading
which<00:06:48.990> actually<00:06:49.169> kind<00:06:49.440> of<00:06:49.500> warms<00:06:49.860> up<00:06:50.010> the<00:06:50.039> tone

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
which actually kind of warms up the tone

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.430 
which actually kind of warms up the tone
a<00:06:50.340> bit<00:06:50.460> so<00:06:51.000> that<00:06:51.030> attitude<00:06:51.870> with<00:06:51.990> the<00:06:52.080> halo

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
a bit so that attitude with the halo

00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:03.749 
a bit so that attitude with the halo
magic<00:06:52.949> it<00:06:53.370> sounds<00:06:53.820> a<00:06:53.910> little<00:06:54.210> like

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.219 

doesn't<00:07:04.759> that<00:07:04.819> buffers<00:07:05.270> not<00:07:05.479> there<00:07:05.750> the<00:07:05.960> boys

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
doesn't that buffers not there the boys

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:20.879 
doesn't that buffers not there the boys
are<00:07:06.620> balanced<00:07:18.310> very<00:07:19.310> nice<00:07:19.580> and<00:07:19.789> local<00:07:20.210> like

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
are balanced very nice and local like

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:25.900 
are balanced very nice and local like
just<00:07:21.889> remote<00:07:22.430> areas<00:07:22.970> highly<00:07:23.870> feasible<00:07:24.910> so

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
just remote areas highly feasible so

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.540 
just remote areas highly feasible so
that's<00:07:26.120> what<00:07:26.360> i<00:07:26.389> meant<00:07:26.599> 4<00:07:26.810> 2014<00:07:27.440> guitar<00:07:28.340> will

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
that's what i meant 4 2014 guitar will

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.820 
that's what i meant 4 2014 guitar will
