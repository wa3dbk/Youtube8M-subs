de racing so what I did was you know I

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.240 
de racing so what I did was you know I
ended<00:02:17.370> up<00:02:17.550> getting<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.360> wheels<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.560> my<00:02:19.800> much

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
ended up getting the wheels for my much

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.440 
ended up getting the wheels for my much
smaller<00:02:20.760> RC<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.530> acquired<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:24.000> bigger

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
smaller RC and I acquired the bigger

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.980 
smaller RC and I acquired the bigger
wheels<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.920> me<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.220> set<00:02:26.460> my<00:02:26.840> calibrations<00:02:27.840> on

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
wheels for me to set my calibrations on

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.410 
wheels for me to set my calibrations on
my<00:02:28.110> wheels<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> law

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
my wheels and this is the law

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.170 
my wheels and this is the law
we'll<00:02:30.750> set<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.800> here's<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.849> difference

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
we'll set up now here's the difference

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.130 
we'll set up now here's the difference
between<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.690> two<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.739> both<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.489> them<00:02:36.140> are

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
between the two now both of them are

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.790 
between the two now both of them are
Universal<00:02:37.950> adapters<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.480> ended<00:02:40.050> up<00:02:40.200> getting

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
Universal adapters so I ended up getting

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.059 
Universal adapters so I ended up getting
the<00:02:41.280> 17<00:02:42.150> millimeter<00:02:43.050> adapter<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:43.950> just

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
the 17 millimeter adapter but it's just

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.150 
the 17 millimeter adapter but it's just
too<00:02:44.370> big<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.239> RC<00:02:45.599> because<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.110> am<00:02:46.560> running

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
too big for this RC because I am running

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.780 
too big for this RC because I am running
a<00:02:47.370> 12<00:02:47.670> millimeter<00:02:47.910> adapter<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.810> thank<00:02:49.790> thank

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
a 12 millimeter adapter so thank thank

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.300 
a 12 millimeter adapter so thank thank
goodness<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.720> de<00:02:52.200> racing<00:02:52.770> they<00:02:52.890> were<00:02:52.980> able<00:02:53.130> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
goodness for de racing they were able to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.150 
goodness for de racing they were able to
make<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:54.330> type<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:55.130> setup<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:57.000> their<00:02:58.160> short

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
make this type of setup for their short

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.620 
make this type of setup for their short
course<00:02:59.430> version<00:02:59.910> or<00:03:00.090> their<00:03:00.269> buggy<00:03:00.510> version

course version or their buggy version
and<00:03:01.170> all<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.340> take<00:03:02.580> off<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.880> 17

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
and all I have to do is take off the 17

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.020 
and all I have to do is take off the 17
millimeter<00:03:03.750> adapters<00:03:04.230> off<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.819> put

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
millimeter adapters off this one and put

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.630 
millimeter adapters off this one and put
the<00:03:06.120> larger<00:03:06.480> wheelbase<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.739> wheels<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.370> there

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the larger wheelbase the wheels on there

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.240 
the larger wheelbase the wheels on there
for<00:03:08.850> me<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.060> set<00:03:09.239> up<00:03:09.269> my<00:03:09.360> calibrations<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.380> my

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
for me to set up my calibrations on my

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.949 
for me to set up my calibrations on my
Canberra<00:03:11.670> links<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.060> everything<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.480> that

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
Canberra links and everything like that

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.289 
Canberra links and everything like that
so<00:03:13.410> I'm<00:03:14.010> gonna<00:03:14.220> start<00:03:14.459> fiddling<00:03:14.970> around<00:03:15.090> with

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
so I'm gonna start fiddling around with

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.800 
so I'm gonna start fiddling around with
this<00:03:15.510> RC<00:03:16.250> once<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.370> get<00:03:17.549> my<00:03:17.730> calibrations<00:03:18.600> all

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
this RC once I get my calibrations all

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.350 
this RC once I get my calibrations all
set<00:03:19.049> up<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.799> know<00:03:19.920> what<00:03:20.100> I'm<00:03:20.250> I'm<00:03:20.730> interested

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
set up you know what I'm I'm interested

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.780 
set up you know what I'm I'm interested
in<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.959> final<00:03:22.230> product<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.890> see<00:03:23.220> what<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> RC

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
in the final product and see what the RC

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.470 
in the final product and see what the RC
looks<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.390> we<00:03:24.569> should<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.840> good<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.019> go

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
looks like and we should be good to go

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.030 
looks like and we should be good to go
alrighty<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.959> now<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.140> just<00:03:28.530> missed<00:03:28.709> all<00:03:28.920> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
alrighty so now I just missed all the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
alrighty so now I just missed all the
wheels<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:31.220> primarily<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.430> way<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.670> came<00:03:32.819> out

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
wheels and primarily the way it came out

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.240 
wheels and primarily the way it came out
just<00:03:34.130> like<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.160> said<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.630> just<00:03:36.660> pops

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
just like I said it just it just pops

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.819 
just like I said it just it just pops
just<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.400> lot<00:03:38.609> more<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.120> know<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:40.590> know<00:03:40.680> it

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
just a lot more you know and you know it

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.170 
just a lot more you know and you know it
definitely<00:03:41.250> gives<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.609> little<00:03:41.850> bit<00:03:41.970> more

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
definitely gives you a little bit more

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.170 
definitely gives you a little bit more
of<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.570> custom<00:03:43.079> field<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.560> your<00:03:43.620> RC<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.280> ended<00:03:45.120> up

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
of a custom field to your RC I ended up

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
of a custom field to your RC I ended up
going<00:03:45.359> green<00:03:45.810> with<00:03:46.320> my<00:03:46.530> grave<00:03:46.769> digger<00:03:47.130> because

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
going green with my grave digger because

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.550 
going green with my grave digger because
it's<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.640> green<00:03:47.880> RC<00:03:48.299> but<00:03:48.870> like<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.140> said<00:03:49.200> there's

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
it's a green RC but like I said there's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.500 
it's a green RC but like I said there's
a<00:03:49.620> lot<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.920> people<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.549> slash

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
a lot of people that have slash

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.860 
a lot of people that have slash
two-wheel<00:03:52.049> drives<00:03:53.390> bandits<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:55.160> and

rustlers and grave diggers and stampedes
to<00:04:01.140> where<00:04:01.290> they<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.620> utilize<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:02.250> know<00:04:02.370> and

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
slashes to where they can we utilize

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.449 
slashes to where they can we utilize

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
these links for their RC themselves now

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.599 
these links for their RC themselves now
they<00:04:08.850> do<00:04:08.910> make<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.269> shorter<00:04:09.780> version<00:04:09.989> for<00:04:10.950> other

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
they do make a shorter version for other

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.220 
they do make a shorter version for other
different<00:04:11.880> applications<00:04:12.630> for<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.019> throw

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
different applications for you to throw

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.440 
different applications for you to throw
on<00:04:13.380> your<00:04:13.620> ear<00:04:13.799> Evo<00:04:14.220> or<00:04:14.250> your<00:04:14.640> Emacs<00:04:15.060> or<00:04:15.299> your

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.599 
on your ear Evo or your Emacs or your
summit<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.350> know<00:04:16.500> on<00:04:16.709> those<00:04:16.979> type<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.370> Link's

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
summit you know on those type of Link's

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.550 
summit you know on those type of Link's
so<00:04:17.760> definitely<00:04:18.510> check<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.750> out<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:18.989> think<00:04:19.140> it's

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
so definitely check it out I think it's

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.099 
so definitely check it out I think it's
