the s3 that it actually launched and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.820 
the s3 that it actually launched and
booted<00:02:17.430> up<00:02:17.520> slightly<00:02:17.880> faster<00:02:18.270> by<00:02:18.750> 12<00:02:19.410> seconds

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.040 
booted up slightly faster by 12 seconds
than<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> s4<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:21.060> today's<00:02:21.300> case<00:02:21.510> however<00:02:21.750> we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
than the s4 in today's case however we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.590 
than the s4 in today's case however we
saw<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.440> samsung<00:02:22.980> galaxy<00:02:23.250> s4<00:02:24.210> launched

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
saw that the samsung galaxy s4 launched

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.110 
saw that the samsung galaxy s4 launched
again<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.020> few<00:02:25.260> seconds<00:02:25.740> before<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.460> LG<00:02:26.730> Nexus

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
again a few seconds before the LG Nexus

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.050 
again a few seconds before the LG Nexus
but<00:02:27.510> again<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:27.930> something<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.470> really

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
but again this is something that really

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.130 
but again this is something that really
seems<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.210> be<00:02:30.330> something<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> people<00:02:31.050> are

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
seems to be something that people are

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050 
seems to be something that people are
put<00:02:31.350> into<00:02:31.650> competition<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.580> really<00:02:32.760> doesn't

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
put into competition but really doesn't

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
put into competition but really doesn't
bother<00:02:33.090> me<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.570> be<00:02:33.660> honest<00:02:33.980> now<00:02:34.980> I'm<00:02:35.100> going<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
bother me to be honest now I'm going to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.190 
bother me to be honest now I'm going to
put<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.610> full<00:02:35.850> benchmark<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.750> us<00:02:36.990> as<00:02:37.170> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
put the full benchmark on us as a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.170 
put the full benchmark on us as a
separate<00:02:37.560> video<00:02:37.680> as<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.100> does<00:02:38.250> take<00:02:38.460> about<00:02:38.580> 3-4

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
separate video as it does take about 3-4

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.640 
separate video as it does take about 3-4
minutes<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.630> complete<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> full<00:02:40.200> bench<00:02:40.440> one

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
minutes to complete the full bench one

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
minutes to complete the full bench one
but<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.730> i'm<00:02:42.000> using<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> antutu<00:02:42.660> benchmark

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
but this i'm using the antutu benchmark

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.620 
but this i'm using the antutu benchmark
version<00:02:43.710> 3.3<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.490> really<00:02:44.670> tests<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.150> cpu

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
version 3.3 and it really tests the cpu

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.990 
version 3.3 and it really tests the cpu
GPU<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:46.410> well<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.070> some<00:02:47.190> other<00:02:47.310> tests<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
GPU as well as some other tests that the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.520 
GPU as well as some other tests that the
benchmark<00:02:48.360> performs<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.230> gives<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
benchmark performs and it gives you a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.890 
benchmark performs and it gives you a
score<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.000> case<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.570> today's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
score so in this case in today's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.210 
score so in this case in today's
benchmark<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:52.950> got<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.160> score<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.700> 20<00:02:54.560> 3842<00:02:55.560> for

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
benchmark we got a score of 20 3842 for

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.400 
benchmark we got a score of 20 3842 for
the<00:02:56.310> samsung<00:02:56.670> galaxy<00:02:57.030> s4<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:58.020> score<00:02:58.290> of
