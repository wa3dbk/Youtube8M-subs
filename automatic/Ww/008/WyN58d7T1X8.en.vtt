00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.130
 new and good guys today we are in a 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.040
 tutorial on how to put particles in the 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.230
 vp and good guards first thing 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.269
 they must choose is a poster after they should 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.450
 to put different names like 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.859
 they just saw me I put the avai and we're going 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.260
 to put some lava so that at 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.689
 final show them how are we going to 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.130
 put this here here and here on 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.599
 theme of the sea, but I 'm not going to do it 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.820
 for now it will be in the next one 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.610
 game that I entered and we're going to put another 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.560
 thing like that would be to see what we have 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.030
 network are we are going to put the particles of 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.530
 network are and for that we have to write 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.720
 in a network poster are when I finish 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.220
 because the time the posters are going to 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.780
 convert into particles so no 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.360
 worry you can put can you put 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.700
 the posters and there's going to be nothing going 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.470
 to put water and we will put the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.020
 bubble particles that I think is 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.380
 google google I do not remember 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.240
 had let me see buggles I do not know if not 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.940
 it comes out in the chat something is that they are not 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.590
 doing well so they go back to repeating 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.980
 so I put google and when it says 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.490
 added particle 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.830
 and even the particle was going to come out soon 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.230
 after that we have to also put 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:21.370

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.370
