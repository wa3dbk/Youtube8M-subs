00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.020
 the main part of the resident evil and it seems not 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.390
 has resident evil 2 headers 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.010
 : there is still a bit of evil around 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.020
 it's mostly just dry 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.940
 numbering which if you think also 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.390
 sums up what is shown on the box 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.800

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.280
 resident 4 is the only good part 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.230
 because this is the only part 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.730
 which turned out to be 100 just knowing 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.079
 how stupid is the idea that dissolution 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.550
 giant babies slippery monsters 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.780

 teeth close friends of your mutation 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.559
 against the will of a relative because you 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.239
 marketing needs and we are kind of blind zones 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.820
 homeless you just drop bombs 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.680
 everything perishes I would make close money 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.240
 resident evil 6 returns to something 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.979
 sort of a tradition sat down with a few 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.570
 simultaneous storylines

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.289
 he is trying to reason with one 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.149
 which is going to him to get slapped on 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.039
 yourself an apron with a picture of the brain then 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.780

 new backstory in which lost 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.969
 his people became angry wino so 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.189
 they could replace 2 returning 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.259
 heroes on the throat and brilliance of hardy and it would be 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.969
 just as big a problem resident 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.100
 is that he completely shouted himself 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.929
 himself he was about fighting a corporation 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.550
 umbrella which had a kind of nomoli 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.840
 existence as a pharmaceutical 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.550
 a company that was suddenly 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.830
 create thawed who gave all his 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.720
 resources for destruction 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.550
 because he is a dick and now ambrella as 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.620
 would not and CEO albert 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.240
 Barber Satan with you were born at the end of 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.310
 the fifth part and what's next 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.050
 about with this game of revan and now now 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.370
 taught that the world has inexhaustible 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.230
 stock cartoon evil assholes 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.120
 inexplicably enormous power which 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.380
 I think that the zombie apocalypse report 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.600
 lower method to avoid possibility 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.950
 intelligence and neither take into account errors 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.630
 predecessors and isn't it 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.310
 shows all confrontation with 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.290
 previous cavity games meaningless 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.270
 if I were a cross doctor I would give 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.980
 fuck it up I would say okay 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.720
 guess the human race is just 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.160
 decided to destroy herself let's 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.990
 collect all the other residents all 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.490
 heroes and built brother on the moon but you 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.959
 Do you know if he will insist on 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.910
 taking with you your rich friend 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.680
 Vasya pupkin who forget to file it 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.450
 tax return for the year and tries 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.570
 so to speak through the challenge 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.340
 zombie apocalypse 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.050
 saying meaningless struggle when i 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.700
 I was winning myself keenly I want him 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.020
 the character had a habit for example 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.790
 jump on the trail before leaving 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.680
 room to avoid the surprise that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.120
 the product returns two minutes later I 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.430
 I swear that we have to go through this 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.510
 charade seven or eight times each boss 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.430
 and you can't just continue 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.680
 dissolve this garbage without weakening it 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.690
 look i know what to do 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.190
 never had a good plot somewhere 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.260
 who has copies of a huge book 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.610
 conversational only with the remaining bindings 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.320
 but it all gets so boring 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.760
 like a kid's war game when your 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.410
 Opponent continues to come up with all 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.060
 bullshit 100 but there is not won until you 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.380
 drag him off for a penny to see 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.120
 how well does it protect at all 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.980
 reflective shield when you kill the muse would 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.930
 bike chain in the game is always small 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.850
 ammo and it would be nice to know this 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.830
 boss fight which bus fight or is it me 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.360
 must run or hold for 10 seconds 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.709
 until the next cut scene because if 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.540
 this last one I will not spend 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.730
 maitri precious field for macawan 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.560
 this is this horror on her organic design and 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.390
 infinitely unfair picts cops 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.950
 add what they always add 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 the same as laser mines add 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.150
 romantic walks by the river and 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.070
 so cooperative resident evil 6 this 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.840
 fussy mother from the suburbs insisting 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.820
 to the invitation of that strange letting 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.650
 drool baby on your birthday so 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.510
 from time to time on the boot screen you 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.160
 watch them randomly asshole which 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.540
 appears to explain why you will not 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.489
 enjoy the next few 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.780
 levels and thank god it's a cooperative 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.000
 because otherwise I could 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.470
 think that alverno and partner came 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.390
 something like a stroke that makes 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.919
 break up look while i 'm waiting at the exit of 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.720
 level defending from monsters who 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.120
 already as if made of spirit sausage 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.890
 sauce wide philosophical question per hour 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.210
 cape multiplayer chatting with others 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.250
 people that vein 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.840
 why hate it and storage 2 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 intellectuals on hand who helped 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.380
 would collect and trials what when 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.030
 you cannot communicate with yours by chance 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.979
 I know my partner and you need to knock 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.389
 just praises that do not use 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.860
 because that too is a geyskoy 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.120
 difficulty level contributes to doing 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.560
 at least something along with 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.210
 mate need to do pharmacies in one and 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.680
 same time then what is the advantage 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.509
 partner no artificial diode a 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.460
 in addition to force you to reboot 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.050
 deaths that i should take for 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.819
 the mirror of the universe 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.500
 political correctness fortunately from this 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.419
 all you can refuse if you do it 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.490
 realize then you will refuse with 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.380
 such a force that break your fingers however 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.729
 I kind of liked another online 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.349
 mode where you need to take control 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.669
 Monsters someone else's game that gives 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.470
 great opportunity to avenge 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.389
 fingers I was a little satisfied 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.160
 stabbing us without some strangers 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.570
 which perhaps did not deserve it he 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.729
 it was the only 10 attempts 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.530
 the rest are either not connected if I 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.270
 joined five seconds before 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.340
 the guy killed is usually unaware 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.229
 the monster is disappointing to realize that 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.729
 your work can be done equally 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.130
 well without you could have been a plow not 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.930
 controlled by asshole what if you think 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.909
 might be resident evil motto 6 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.530
 the game doesn't want the player to be linear 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.210
 motley quicktime and in this flog 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.039
 meaningless chatter and she wants 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.050
 small drakes which can protect 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.030
 leash show him a bunch of shiny 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.039
 lights and then drinking when it seems that he 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.990
 not impressed resident evil 6 is not 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.610
 thus the coolest and fresh continuation 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.229
 for a series that is not too worn out 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.699
 my greeting as if spent 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.199
 most of my ride ride on 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.009
 ass leaves length trail shit on 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.009
 corridor on the carpet 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.080
 my second novel jim is now out 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.000
 You can order it to your loved ones 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.650
 literary distributive resource and 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.810
 while you wait why don't you download 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.370
 audio version of gordon aytyuns and audible 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.080
 now you can listen to my voice in 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.289
 for 13 hours without the cost of how they 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.289
 for me
