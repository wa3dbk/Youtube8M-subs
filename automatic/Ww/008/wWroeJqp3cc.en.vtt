articulation black with this head can
look<00:03:42.600> up<00:03:42.840> really<00:03:43.680> good<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.310> neck<00:03:44.459> joint

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
is a separate joint even though it's

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.110 
is a separate joint even though it's
covered<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.739> rubber<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.220> hard<00:03:47.459> ank<00:03:47.700> look<00:03:47.910> down

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
covered in rubber is hard ank look down

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.530 
covered in rubber is hard ank look down
really<00:03:48.780> good<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.380> head<00:03:49.620> can<00:03:50.130> fully<00:03:50.400> rotate<00:03:51.090> it

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
really good the head can fully rotate it

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.479 
really good the head can fully rotate it
can<00:03:51.690> also<00:03:51.810> pivot<00:03:52.440> form<00:03:52.830> back<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.280> could<00:03:53.370> do

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
can also pivot form back so you could do

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.880 
can also pivot form back so you could do
a<00:03:53.520> lot<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.850> range<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.239> motion<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:55.080> arms<00:03:55.320> can

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
a lot of range of motion the arms can

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.860 
a lot of range of motion the arms can
actually<00:03:56.459> fully<00:03:56.940> rotate<00:03:57.420> but<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.600> costume

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
actually fully rotate but the costume

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.780 
actually fully rotate but the costume
does<00:03:58.560> bundle<00:03:58.920> up<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.160> little<00:03:59.310> bit<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.640> just

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
does bundle up a little bit so you just

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.520 
does bundle up a little bit so you just
have<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.150> very<00:04:00.180> careful<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.290> can

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
have to be very careful that you can

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.770 
have to be very careful that you can
move<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.520> up<00:04:02.580> pretty<00:04:02.850> high<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.630> to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
move it up pretty high you just have to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.420 
move it up pretty high you just have to
work<00:04:04.020> with<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.410> costume<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.010> make<00:04:05.130> sure<00:04:05.250> not

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
work with the costume and make sure not

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
to damage it it does go in and out that

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280 
to damage it it does go in and out that
much<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.730> has<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> little<00:04:09.300> bit<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.480> armpit<00:04:09.810> joint

yeah you can move their round a little
bit<00:04:26.400> even<00:04:26.520> though<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.910> rubber<00:04:27.150> body<00:04:27.360> does

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
bit even though the rubber body does

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600 
bit even though the rubber body does
hinder<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.050> little<00:04:28.200> bit<00:04:28.320> more<00:04:28.470> leagues<00:04:29.070> do

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
hinder it a little bit more leagues do

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.970 
hinder it a little bit more leagues do
you<00:04:29.700> go<00:04:29.850> forward<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:31.110> much<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.470> costume

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
you go forward that much the costume

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.850 
you go forward that much the costume
does<00:04:32.640> hinder<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.150> quite<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> bit<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:34.170> goes<00:04:34.590> back

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
does hinder it quite a bit but goes back

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.520 
does hinder it quite a bit but goes back
and<00:04:35.220> her<00:04:35.580> legs<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:36.090> almost<00:04:36.630> do<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.230> splits

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
and her legs can almost do the splits

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.120 
and her legs can almost do the splits
like<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.550> belt<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:38.940> nice<00:04:39.330> loose<00:04:39.630> enough<00:04:39.900> to

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
like the belt is a nice loose enough to

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.130 
like the belt is a nice loose enough to
allow<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.190> leg<00:04:41.730> so<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.000> rotate<00:04:42.420> up<00:04:42.540> our<00:04:42.780> lake

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
allow that leg so you rotate up our lake

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.470 
allow that leg so you rotate up our lake
she's<00:04:43.440> been<00:04:43.770> at<00:04:43.920> 2<00:04:44.040> points<00:04:44.250> at<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.820> knee<00:04:45.000> her

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
she's been at 2 points at the knee her

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.380 
she's been at 2 points at the knee her
ankles<00:04:45.900> do<00:04:46.110> pivot<00:04:46.770> forward<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.430> back<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.180> she

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
ankles do pivot forward and back and she

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.030 
ankles do pivot forward and back and she
does<00:04:48.540> have<00:04:48.690> an<00:04:48.840> ankle<00:04:49.110> pivot<00:04:49.560> in<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.830> boots

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
does have an ankle pivot in the boots

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.820 
does have an ankle pivot in the boots
rotate<00:04:50.540> so<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.960> won't<00:04:52.110> really<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.470> that

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
rotate so you won't really have that

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.920 
rotate so you won't really have that
pivot<00:04:53.190> but<00:04:53.340> because<00:04:53.670> of<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.970> boots<00:04:54.300> they<00:04:54.870> do

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
pivot but because of the boots they do

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.680 
pivot but because of the boots they do
allow<00:04:55.350> some<00:04:55.380> whites<00:04:55.920> than<00:04:56.160> poses<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.480> it's

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
allow some whites than poses and so it's
