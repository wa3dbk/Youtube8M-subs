00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.130
 hello to all this is still on the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.120
 sony stand with the table xperia z is 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.360
 so who comes to succeed z1 then at 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.330
 level of improvements we have 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.099
 greater finesse 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 office than that right now 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.830
 the tablet I'm only 6 4 mm 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.880
 thick 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.160
 so we always have an aluminum frame 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.059
 if we could see the 3.5 mm jack 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 the dock connector on the left side 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.519
 we can see the button against the volume 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.519
 and the power button here 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.250
 above for proof the sensor 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.250
 infrared circulates the microsd port 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.180
 and finally absolutely nothing is the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 last france 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.149
 in the back we have a softouch material to 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.210
 it is no longer the glass version 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.930
 white mark forgiveness for the fingers 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.670
 plus the case of the rare on black and finally 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.670
 the 8 megapixel sensor without flash 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 but 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.680
 in front in sum a front camera 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 2 megapixels 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.740
 and so I fear a 10.1 screen 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.960
 inches with a resolution of 1981 by 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.190
 1200 pixels 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.040
 look very bright technology or 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.200
 saunier still improve the display 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.280
 and as for the specs to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.910
 inside the tablet we have a 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.070
 803 giga snapdragon qualcomm processor 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.070
 of ram and 16GB of storage 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.060
 we are interested in the interface so good 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.660
 nothing very new 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.150
 it runs under android 4.4 the 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.090
 sony apps have been improved for 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.330
 opportunity 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.220
 we think in particular of the album application 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.220
 which is really very well done 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.090
 with a ranking on the sides 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.320
 that's what you took with the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.250
 camera your folders your favorites the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.250
 places where you took the pictures 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.430
 we just have to sign like that and the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.430
 girls are resizing 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.210
 trout it's very aesthetic 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.040
 and 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.010
 the wheel without that sony really cared 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.599
 its software 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.850
 same thing for the brockmann app 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.870
 which is very visual 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.870
 with the big album cover 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.110
 yes that white just below 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.370
 like the menu on the left side 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.340
 of course the movie application is very 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.920
 nice to watch a movie about this 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.130
 planet hockey the screen is really 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.130
 magnificent 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.970
 galea lightly the 4 126 g sursee for 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.640
 version 4g there is a wi fi version and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.770
 which is a little bit lighter 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.640
 as for christopher we really have a 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.640
 sheet of paper in the hand 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.129
 that's what 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.599
 visually and at the design level 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.620
 it's true that the changes are not 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.860
 flagrant compared to the version 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.260
 Previous but have powerful 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.159
 applications that are always more 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.379
 push at the camera level 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.739
 found the same type of options as this 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.629
 that there is on the z2 then the sensor I 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.970
 do not have a megapixel vaccine like 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.830
 this is the case according to g2 but we have when 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.420
 even 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.660
 at the software level of things that 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.680
 come back from the rear effect 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.680
 the augmented reality app 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.540
 the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.350
 lectra 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.129
 and some dinosaur devices to 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.960
 it's something we already know 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.130
 on the zelda 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.530
 I'm back on the hurdles of and 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.190
 and out of 7 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.190
 his new tablet 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.480
 less than 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.330
 then here you can access all 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.920
 apps for bad guys 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.560
 it's always the same thing we stay 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.260
 pressed on it and that proposes to us the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.280
 different offices 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.500
 we can scroll through this 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.140
 way add widgets and 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.500
 applications change the wallpaper and 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.500
 the theme 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.030
 so this is an interface that has made its 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.520
 evidence 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.640
 if you like sony products you 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.130
 will not really be lost for what is 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.710
 price we have not yet but side 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.060
 institute roughly at the same level of 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.460
 did the first team arrive from 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.080
 tablets 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.330
 or at the sony 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.180
 improves its products by small 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.009
 keys and 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.350
 and that it is at the hardware level in this 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.759
 meaning at the software level common sense that the 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.370
 constructor is more and more his 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.050
 topic 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.699
 but here it was the recovery in hand of 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.560
 Biscay asep tablets 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.000
 If you have any questions do not hesitate 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.600
 to ask them and we find ourselves very quickly 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.600
 on android
