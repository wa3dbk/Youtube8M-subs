almost full by the way when

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.369 
almost full by the way when
I<00:02:09.929> got<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.439> so<00:02:10.970> yeah<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.299> was<00:02:12.540> actually<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> gift

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
I got it so yeah it was actually a gift

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.789 
I got it so yeah it was actually a gift
so<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:14.159> I<00:02:14.280> had<00:02:14.579> it<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.540> received<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.319> as<00:02:16.439> a<00:02:16.470> gift

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
so if I had it I received it as a gift

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.830 
so if I had it I received it as a gift
and<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.159> I<00:02:17.370> were<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.819> buy<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:18.420> saw<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.659> in

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and if I were to buy it if I saw it in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.929 
and if I were to buy it if I saw it in
the<00:02:18.959> store<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.560> definitely<00:02:20.220> would<00:02:20.459> not<00:02:20.489> have

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
the store I definitely would not have

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.509 
the store I definitely would not have
purchased<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.720> just<00:02:22.230> because<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.709> $70

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
purchased it just because it's $70

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.089 
purchased it just because it's $70
Canadian<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.510> checked<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.200> up<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.530> different

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
Canadian I checked it up on different

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.270 
Canadian I checked it up on different
link<00:02:26.280> department<00:02:26.760> stores<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.680> also<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:28.950> sure

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
link department stores and also I'm sure

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.050 
link department stores and also I'm sure
Mora<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.480> Japanese<00:02:31.230> cosmetics<00:02:31.799> brand<00:02:32.489> so

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
Mora is a Japanese cosmetics brand so

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.679 
Mora is a Japanese cosmetics brand so
it's<00:02:33.780> hard<00:02:34.439> to<00:02:34.650> find<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.790> lot<00:02:35.939> of<00:02:36.150> stores<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
it's hard to find in a lot of stores I

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.599 
it's hard to find in a lot of stores I
can't<00:02:36.959> get<00:02:37.109> it<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.379> Sephora<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.519> don't

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
can't get it in Sephora and I don't

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.550 
can't get it in Sephora and I don't
think<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.030> BAE<00:02:39.180> has<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.689> either<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.439> only

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
think the BAE has it either the only

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.649 
think the BAE has it either the only
place<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.099> could<00:02:41.159> get<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:41.730> near<00:02:42.060> my<00:02:42.180> house<00:02:42.389> would

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
place I could get it near my house would

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.080 
place I could get it near my house would
probably<00:02:43.139> be<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.920> Holt<00:02:44.129> Renfrew<00:02:44.280> department

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
probably be the Holt Renfrew department

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.349 
probably be the Holt Renfrew department
store<00:02:45.269> which<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.750> where<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.019> get<00:02:46.440> some<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.739> my

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
store which is where I get some of my

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.539 
store which is where I get some of my
makeup<00:02:48.359> from<00:02:48.540> because<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.379> mom<00:02:49.560> buys<00:02:50.010> most<00:02:50.370> of

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
makeup from because my mom buys most of

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.220 
makeup from because my mom buys most of
her<00:02:50.700> stuff<00:02:51.389> there<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:51.750> she<00:02:51.870> goes<00:02:52.019> there

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
her stuff there and she goes there

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.470 
her stuff there and she goes there
pretty<00:02:52.409> often<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.760> whole<00:02:53.940> run<00:02:54.150> through

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
pretty often so the whole run through

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.509 
pretty often so the whole run through
department<00:02:55.409> store<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.680> probably<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:56.250> only

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
department store is probably the only

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.250 
department store is probably the only
place<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.939> could<00:02:57.150> get<00:02:57.299> this<00:02:57.540> other<00:02:57.840> than<00:02:58.109> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
place I could get this other than the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.699 
place I could get this other than the
airport<00:02:59.389> so<00:03:00.389> on<00:03:00.569> that<00:03:00.780> note<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.049> could<00:03:01.439> probably

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
airport so on that note I could probably

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.830 
airport so on that note I could probably
ask<00:03:02.069> my<00:03:02.340> dad<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:02.879> it<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.150> me<00:03:03.269> because<00:03:03.510> he's

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
ask my dad to get it for me because he's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.140 
ask my dad to get it for me because he's
in<00:03:04.230> Korea<00:03:04.769> right<00:03:04.859> now<00:03:05.069> so<00:03:05.430> when<00:03:05.579> he's<00:03:05.760> coming

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
in Korea right now so when he's coming

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.479 
in Korea right now so when he's coming
home<00:03:06.359> he<00:03:06.930> could<00:03:07.109> probably<00:03:07.620> purchase<00:03:08.099> one<00:03:08.280> for

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
home he could probably purchase one for

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.000 
home he could probably purchase one for
me<00:03:08.639> but<00:03:09.420> yeah<00:03:10.019> it's<00:03:10.200> definitely<00:03:10.409> on<00:03:10.859> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
me but yeah it's definitely on the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.800 
me but yeah it's definitely on the
pricier<00:03:11.879> side<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:12.680> usually<00:03:13.680> would<00:03:14.810> probably

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
pricier side I usually would probably

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.449 
pricier side I usually would probably
reach<00:03:16.139> for<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.889> drugstore<00:03:17.810> cleansing<00:03:19.459> product

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
reach for a drugstore cleansing product

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.479 
reach for a drugstore cleansing product
I<00:03:21.419> don't<00:03:21.959> think<00:03:22.199> they<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> lot<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:23.069> oils

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
I don't think they have a lot of oils

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.899 
I don't think they have a lot of oils
though<00:03:23.879> in<00:03:24.180> drugstores<00:03:24.569> on<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.919> Shelf<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.579> I

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
though in drugstores on the Shelf so I

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.140 
though in drugstores on the Shelf so I
usually<00:03:27.900> use<00:03:28.169> like<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.949> makeup<00:03:29.250> removers<00:03:29.699> but

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
usually use like the makeup removers but

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.449 
usually use like the makeup removers but
definitely<00:03:30.659> a<00:03:30.690> cleansing<00:03:31.319> oil<00:03:31.590> makes<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.280> big

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
definitely a cleansing oil makes a big

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.490 
definitely a cleansing oil makes a big
difference<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.090> those<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.900> who<00:03:34.139> are<00:03:34.470> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
difference and those of you who are a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.180 
difference and those of you who are a
little<00:03:34.949> bit<00:03:35.190> skeptical<00:03:36.060> about<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.980> about<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
little bit skeptical about the about the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.550 
little bit skeptical about the about the
idea<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.729> using<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.419> applying<00:03:39.810> an<00:03:39.989> oil<00:03:40.319> to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
idea of using like applying an oil to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.349 
idea of using like applying an oil to
your<00:03:40.620> face<00:03:40.859> through<00:03:41.159> your<00:03:41.400> makeup<00:03:41.729> don't

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
your face through your makeup don't

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.089 
your face through your makeup don't
worry<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.750> doesn't<00:03:42.780> make<00:03:43.109> your<00:03:43.290> face<00:03:43.530> oily<00:03:43.979> at

all it actually I felt like it cleared
