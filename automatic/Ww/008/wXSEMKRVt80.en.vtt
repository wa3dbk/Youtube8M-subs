00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.100
 vegetable oil and sprinkled with brand 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.100
 take our dough 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:50.340
 we put the form a little more than half of these 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.340

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:10.850

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.540

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.540

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.580
 when you are not in the line especially 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.790
 which I had in glasses 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.810
 when bake like this with mako 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.690
 face put skill and then when they 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.500
 almost cool you can easily pull them out 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.530
 they have me a little bit up the cap 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.700
 well a little bit more dough was it 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:51.860
 I was very easily pulled out but very 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 soft won kulich now I have already started 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.190
 I took for the glaze 2 squirrels and 250 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.320
 grams of powdered sugar 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.830
 then add a little sugar 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.860
 powder and a teaspoon lemon lemon you 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.120
 squeezed lemon juice and teaspoon 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.980
 I added all this, I knocked it down 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.980
 must be so thick let the mass 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.840
 so that it is not sticky 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:31.550
 so that it does not stick here you need to add 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.340
 more powdered sugar is better and superfluous 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.420
 add what it lacks try here 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.770
 so here to smear one if you have it 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:51.410
 watery you need to add here yet 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:53.890
 powdered sugar and lubricate them and sprinkle 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.890
 then 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.010
 millet colored 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.280
 here it is thickly smeared it already means that 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.030
 it will be dry to dry it will be dry 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.030

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.819
 kulichiki ready 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.819

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:52.579
 if you love a lot sweet in dough 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:59.590
 can add more sugar for me as 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:02.450
