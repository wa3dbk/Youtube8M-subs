to come to I'm gonna smooth it up a

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.540 
to come to I'm gonna smooth it up a
little<00:03:07.610> bit<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.890> should<00:03:10.190> take<00:03:10.340> care<00:03:10.400> of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.100 
little bit and that should take care of
the<00:03:10.640> problem<00:03:10.970> but<00:03:11.150> if<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.420> doesn't<00:03:11.660> see<00:03:12.080> I

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
the problem but if it doesn't see I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.479 
the problem but if it doesn't see I
still<00:03:12.500> have<00:03:12.620> orange<00:03:12.890> down<00:03:13.040> there<00:03:13.190> then<00:03:13.370> you're

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
still have orange down there then you're

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.250 
still have orange down there then you're
going<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.670> want<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.910> come<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.330> Center<00:03:15.050> down

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
going to want to come to Center down

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.199 
going to want to come to Center down
here<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.220> you're<00:03:16.400> basically<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:17.000> wanting

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
here and you're basically just wanting

here and you're basically just wanting
to<00:03:17.360> toy<00:03:17.900> with<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.320> until<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.800> get<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.340> way

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
to toy with it until you get it the way

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.740 
to toy with it until you get it the way
you<00:03:19.520> like<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:22.330> let's<00:03:23.330> go<00:03:25.330> one<00:03:26.330> 10.8

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
you like it so let's go one 10.8

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.380 
you like it so let's go one 10.8
and<00:03:28.900> all<00:03:29.830> right<00:03:29.950> we'll<00:03:30.070> try<00:03:30.840> 112<00:03:33.240> okay<00:03:34.240> that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
and all right we'll try 112 okay that

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.350 
and all right we'll try 112 okay that
looks<00:03:34.420> pretty<00:03:34.720> good<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:34.930> what<00:03:35.380> now<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.070> also

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
looks pretty good so what now you also

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.430 
looks pretty good so what now you also
can<00:03:37.360> bring<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.660> smoothing<00:03:38.050> all<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.260> way<00:03:38.350> up

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
can bring the smoothing all the way up

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.800 
can bring the smoothing all the way up
on<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:38.650> one<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.270> it<00:03:40.270> will<00:03:40.450> base<00:03:40.630> it

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
on this one and it will base it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.300 
on this one and it will base it
basically<00:03:41.140> just<00:03:41.260> blend<00:03:41.740> it<00:03:41.920> makes<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.220> look

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
basically just blend it makes it look

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.300 
basically just blend it makes it look
nicer<00:03:42.670> um<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.870> as<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.560> see<00:03:44.800> if<00:03:45.010> we<00:03:45.160> go

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
nicer um so as you can see if we go

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.870 
nicer um so as you can see if we go
through<00:03:45.490> this<00:03:45.610> clip<00:03:46.170> for<00:03:47.170> long<00:03:47.320> oh<00:03:47.740> it<00:03:48.490> would

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
through this clip for long oh it would

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.670 
through this clip for long oh it would
