Microsoft did have an emergency offline
update<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.900> believe<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.260> was<00:02:27.350> called<00:02:27.680> but<00:02:28.400> for

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
update I believe it was called but for

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.910 
update I believe it was called but for
some<00:02:28.970> reason<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> first<00:02:29.480> couple<00:02:30.410> days<00:02:30.440> that

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
some reason the first couple days that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.020 
some reason the first couple days that
they<00:02:31.010> had<00:02:31.130> on<00:02:31.250> their<00:02:31.370> website<00:02:31.610> they<00:02:31.700> removed

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
they had on their website they removed

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.840 
they had on their website they removed
it<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.450> don't<00:02:33.050> know<00:02:33.200> why<00:02:33.920> they<00:02:34.190> removed<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.730> was

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
it I don't know why they removed it was

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.580 
it I don't know why they removed it was
never<00:02:35.060> stated<00:02:35.390> Microsoft<00:02:36.110> really<00:02:36.440> hasn't

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
never stated Microsoft really hasn't

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.290 
never stated Microsoft really hasn't
made<00:02:36.770> any<00:02:36.950> comments<00:02:37.490> on<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.730> green<00:02:37.940> screen<00:02:38.180> of

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
made any comments on the green screen of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.930 
made any comments on the green screen of
that<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.600> people<00:02:38.630> are<00:02:38.990> suffering<00:02:39.170> from<00:02:39.590> and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
that that people are suffering from and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.790 
that that people are suffering from and
um<00:02:40.940> but<00:02:41.510> they<00:02:41.660> did<00:02:41.870> have<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.560> worked

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
um but they did have that and it worked

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.000 
um but they did have that and it worked
for<00:02:42.980> some<00:02:43.190> users<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.760> then<00:02:43.850> they<00:02:43.970> removed<00:02:44.360> it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
for some users and then they removed it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.220 
for some users and then they removed it
so<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:46.340> yeah<00:02:47.180> if<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.420> pretty<00:02:47.690> much<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:48.019> this

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
so now yeah if you pretty much have this

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.500 
so now yeah if you pretty much have this
you<00:02:48.350> pretty<00:02:48.530> much<00:02:48.680> screwed<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:50.239> leaves

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
you pretty much screwed and this leaves

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.530 
you pretty much screwed and this leaves
your<00:02:50.720> console<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.220> brick<00:02:52.580> like<00:02:53.330> you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
your console just as a brick like you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.150 
your console just as a brick like you
just<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> break<00:02:54.200> there<00:02:54.410> basically<00:02:54.860> and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
just have a break there basically and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.710 
just have a break there basically and
it's<00:02:55.310> unfortunate<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:55.940> this<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.600> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
it's unfortunate because this is the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.090 
it's unfortunate because this is the
second<00:02:57.170> one<00:02:57.290> already<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.739> getting<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> little

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
second one already it's getting a little

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.949 
second one already it's getting a little
bit<00:02:58.280> ridiculous<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.060> at<00:02:59.570> least<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.870> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
bit ridiculous and at least with the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.020 
bit ridiculous and at least with the
other<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.620> Kinect<00:03:01.160> may<00:03:01.310> not<00:03:01.580> have<00:03:01.730> worked

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
other one the Kinect may not have worked

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.460 
other one the Kinect may not have worked
but<00:03:02.269> at<00:03:02.420> least<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.660> was<00:03:02.780> able<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:03.050> play<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
but at least I was able to play the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.140 
but at least I was able to play the
games<00:03:03.769> until<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.250> was<00:03:04.340> time<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.670> get<00:03:04.790> another

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
games until it was time to get another

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.570 
games until it was time to get another
console<00:03:05.900> at<00:03:06.709> least<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.100> able<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.430> know<00:03:07.459> to
