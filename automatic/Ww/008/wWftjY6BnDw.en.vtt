00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 yes people today treated a little 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.560
 theme and a leaking cooling system 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.450
 where you are not necessarily your leak 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.769
 which can be localized , for example 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.110
 on a small rockfall or 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.849
 like is the cool due 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 So if you are a little one in small 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 you have loss of cooling water then you can 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.660
 before any parts exchanges big 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.050
 first such a cool sealant 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
 use this sealant dense 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.670
 small hairline cracks or leaks 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.980
 seals such as between 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.430
 two pieces or between thermostats 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.200
 housing and engine block if there 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.329
 a bit tired 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 It is definitely one first 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.520
 cheaper version and how we 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.430
 on the walls, we now see this first 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.969
 shake the sealant well that I have the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.190
 whole substances in it then mix nicely 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.100
 the engine must be warm and warm 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.609
 then you open your balancing container 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.949
 For the coolant check first 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.180
 the stand if the stand of course 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.369
 again canceled a bit 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.070
 due to a leak then missing 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.630
 you like this about that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.640
 but still 150 milliliters 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 without it then too much over 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.520
 is maximum and fills the whole now 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.520
 purely 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.729
 Now he just screws your student 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.860
 Cover it again and let the engine 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.960
 now at least ten minutes in the state 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.479
 to run 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 make sure that the thermostat 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.310
 opens that could check by her 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.860
 then down here at the big coolant 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.630
 Circulation hose feels like this 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.630
 a thermostat has opened warm 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.060
 is also important during the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.970
 ten-minute mixing phase with the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.580
 coolant the air conditioning in the interior 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.400
 to the maximum temperature 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.470
 and at the lowest level 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.700
 so that all the means through the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.350
 heat exchanger of the air conditioning pumped 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.390
 because it could be possible 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.070
 that there he follows a leak people 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.800
 if you dare now at least ten 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.360
 minutes have run then opens 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.489
 Be careful again the cooler lid 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.140
 because here it can be you 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.000
 water against 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.310
 splashes and exists here 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.410
 Danger of burns and controlled 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 Now again your coolant 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.660
 This one is definitely too 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.400
 high 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.400
 So, who cares a bit now 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.750
 if the caring stand fits now 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.570
 you close everything again and then 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.150
 is really only important that you 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.090
 all the same over the time anyway 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.310
 continues to watch but small 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.300
 Leakage should definitely now 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.700
 be resolved 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.080
 yes people like you see no big again 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.930
 history and it is above all things 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.580
 the inexpensive thing is small leaks 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.490
 to be sealed in the cooling system 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.290
 without now big expensive parts 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.810
 to have to exchange like for example 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.420
 new cooler due to a little 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.890
 Hair has just become leaky now 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.050
 push those up here if you like the whole thing 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.940
 liked the subscribe button links 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.830
 Look at our last one now 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.470
 video to universal ax cuff 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.150
 install and right you can yours 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.740
 Carry out oil change yourself 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.050
 to all spare parts you need 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.030
 Here's where we're coming down now 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.810
 the brake disc clicks until the next one 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.810
 wait and see
