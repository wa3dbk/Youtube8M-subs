fantastic you know I hope he makes it to
the<00:02:44.739> top<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.270> I'm<00:02:46.270> pretty<00:02:46.510> sure<00:02:46.690> he<00:02:46.840> will<00:02:46.989> do<00:02:47.170> I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the top and I'm pretty sure he will do I

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.080 
the top and I'm pretty sure he will do I
think<00:02:48.400> he<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.670> very<00:02:50.069> strong<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.819> winds

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
think he is very strong and the winds

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.470 
think he is very strong and the winds
very<00:02:55.360> heavy<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.280> think<00:02:57.280> he<00:02:57.489> can<00:02:57.700> make<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.269> but

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
very heavy I think he can make it but

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.440 
very heavy I think he can make it but
I'm<00:02:58.660> not<00:02:58.900> sure<00:02:58.980> actually<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.310> did<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:01.000> six

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
I'm not sure actually I did it in six

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.289 
I'm not sure actually I did it in six
hour<00:03:01.709> 30<00:03:02.709> minutes<00:03:03.420> 55<00:03:04.420> seconds<00:03:04.900> yeah<00:03:05.349> yeah

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.850 

which<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> fastest<00:03:11.110> cell<00:03:11.590> from<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
which is the fastest cell from the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.449 
which is the fastest cell from the
outside<00:03:12.340> because<00:03:12.850> there's<00:03:13.180> only<00:03:13.299> one<00:03:16.140> feeling

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
outside because there's only one feeling

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.160 
outside because there's only one feeling
especially<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.519> know<00:03:18.700> when<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:18.970> was<00:03:19.180> climbing

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
especially you know when I was climbing

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.699 
especially you know when I was climbing
on<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.500> last<00:03:20.970> spiral<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.330> was<00:03:23.049> seeing<00:03:23.319> that<00:03:23.530> the

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
on the last spiral I was seeing that the

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.320 
on the last spiral I was seeing that the
top<00:03:23.950> was<00:03:24.190> not<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.549> powerful<00:03:24.760> even<00:03:25.180> though<00:03:25.269> it

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
top was not that powerful even though it

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.229 
top was not that powerful even though it
was<00:03:25.480> far<00:03:25.690> away<00:03:25.930> because<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:26.709> over<00:03:27.370> hundred

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
was far away because it's over hundred

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.800 
was far away because it's over hundred
meters<00:03:28.599> but<00:03:28.870> still<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:30.130> knew<00:03:30.580> that<00:03:30.849> okay<00:03:31.269> this

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
meters but still I knew that okay this

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.320 
meters but still I knew that okay this
is<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.140> last<00:03:32.319> part<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.670> peoria<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
is the last part of the peoria the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.780 
is the last part of the peoria the
impression<00:03:34.989> once<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.860> are<00:03:36.010> reaching<00:03:36.160> at<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
impression once you are reaching at the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.930 
impression once you are reaching at the
top<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.299> been<00:03:38.070> amazing<00:03:39.070> it's<00:03:39.250> quite<00:03:39.489> no<00:03:39.670> joke

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
top is been amazing it's quite no joke

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.060 
top is been amazing it's quite no joke
because<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.769> thousand<00:03:41.769> six<00:03:41.980> hundred

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
because this is a thousand six hundred

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.810 
because this is a thousand six hundred
meters<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:43.930> tiring<00:03:44.459> when<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.489> get

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
meters so it is tiring when I get

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.680 
meters so it is tiring when I get
climbed<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:47.140> first<00:03:48.060> four<00:03:49.060> hundred<00:03:49.329> meters

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
climbed the first four hundred meters

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.660 
climbed the first four hundred meters
maybe<00:03:49.989> even<00:03:50.350> more<00:03:50.530> maybe<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.010> first<00:03:51.280> 500

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
maybe even more maybe the first 500

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.910 
maybe even more maybe the first 500
meters<00:03:52.030> yeah<00:03:52.359> that<00:03:52.959> was<00:03:53.170> starts<00:03:53.560> because

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
meters yeah that was starts because

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.170 
meters yeah that was starts because
actually<00:03:54.790> there<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.870> there<00:03:56.739> is<00:03:56.859> some<00:03:57.180> grooves

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
actually there is there is some grooves

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.050 
actually there is there is some grooves
but<00:03:58.569> there<00:03:59.230> are<00:03:59.350> sometimes<00:03:59.709> they<00:04:00.519> are<00:04:00.609> not<00:04:00.910> too

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
but there are sometimes they are not too

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.479 
but there are sometimes they are not too

was<00:04:03.670> difficult<00:04:03.910> for<00:04:04.239> me<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.720> join<00:04:04.959> my<00:04:05.200> fingers

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
was difficult for me to join my fingers

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.259 
was difficult for me to join my fingers
so<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.760> was<00:04:07.060> really<00:04:08.010> suffering<00:04:09.010> all<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:10.090> these

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
so I was really suffering all of these

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.210 
so I was really suffering all of these
people<00:04:10.630> were<00:04:10.810> filming<00:04:11.260> me<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.650> taking<00:04:12.010> some

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
people were filming me and taking some

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.059 
people were filming me and taking some
pictures<00:04:12.639> they<00:04:12.790> could<00:04:12.970> see<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.410> my<00:04:14.410> face<00:04:14.769> I

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
pictures they could see that my face I

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.740 
pictures they could see that my face I
was<00:04:15.250> not<00:04:15.430> really<00:04:15.579> smiling

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
was not really smiling

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.759 
was not really smiling
I<00:04:16.930> was<00:04:17.200> really<00:04:17.410> fighting<00:04:18.310> very<00:04:18.609> hard<00:04:19.769> actually

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
I was really fighting very hard actually

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.390 
I was really fighting very hard actually
this<00:04:20.979> particular<00:04:21.370> burning<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.570> bit

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
this particular burning is a bit

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.450 
this particular burning is a bit
complicated<00:04:24.400> because<00:04:24.940> there<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.810> some

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
complicated because there is some

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.400 
complicated because there is some
portion<00:04:27.460> which<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.300> will<00:04:28.630> be<00:04:28.780> able<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.200> climb

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
portion which I will be able to climb

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.040 
portion which I will be able to climb
without<00:04:29.770> safety<00:04:30.100> but<00:04:30.669> there<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.389> some<00:04:31.570> section

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
without safety but there is some section

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.029 
without safety but there is some section
which<00:04:32.260> it's<00:04:32.830> totally<00:04:33.280> impossible<00:04:35.039> so

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
which it's totally impossible so

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.529 
which it's totally impossible so
actually<00:04:36.460> do<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.639> know<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.910> way<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.090> did<00:04:37.419> it

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
actually do you know the way I did it

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.310 
actually do you know the way I did it
maybe<00:04:38.289> it<00:04:39.100> is<00:04:39.310> not<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.970> smartest<00:04:40.479> way<00:04:40.720> but<00:04:41.110> at

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
maybe it is not the smartest way but at

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.740 
maybe it is not the smartest way but at
least<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:42.280> did<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:44.260> hope<00:04:45.099> that<00:04:45.159> I<00:04:45.610> will

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
least I did it and I hope that I will

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.230 
least I did it and I hope that I will
to<00:04:46.990> do<00:04:47.139> it<00:04:47.260> again<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.860> will<00:04:48.550> be<00:04:48.669> climbing<00:04:48.940> the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
to do it again I will be climbing the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.280 
to do it again I will be climbing the
next<00:04:49.660> tallest<00:04:50.350> building<00:04:51.930> I'm<00:04:52.930> sure<00:04:53.110> there<00:04:53.260> is

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
next tallest building I'm sure there is

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.380 
next tallest building I'm sure there is
guys<00:04:53.620> in<00:04:53.889> Dubai<00:04:54.190> want<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.729> make<00:04:54.910> another<00:04:55.150> one

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.500
