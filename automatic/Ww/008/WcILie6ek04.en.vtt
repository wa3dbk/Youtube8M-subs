00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
in there close that up and let's take a

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.710 
in there close that up and let's take a
look<00:02:15.840> at<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.200> main<00:02:17.239> attractions<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.480> this

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
look at the main attractions of this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.320 
look at the main attractions of this
video<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:20.160> includes<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.760> iPod<00:02:21.090> touch

video that includes the iPod touch

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.339 
video that includes the iPod touch
itself<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.280> let's<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.900> try<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.959> take<00:02:25.200> this

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
itself so let's here try to take this

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.690 
itself so let's here try to take this
off<00:02:25.590> let's<00:02:25.860> see<00:02:25.920> how<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.099> works<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.459> pull

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
off let's see how this works we pull

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.920 
off let's see how this works we pull
this<00:02:26.849> tab<00:02:27.090> right<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:28.459> okay<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:30.030> looks<00:02:30.239> nice

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
this tab right here okay that looks nice

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.089 
this tab right here okay that looks nice
and<00:02:31.019> we<00:02:31.830> leave<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.190> back<00:02:32.400> there<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.030> guess

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
and we leave that back there and I guess

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.910 
and we leave that back there and I guess
we<00:02:35.099> pull<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.060> off<00:02:36.299> there<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.349> go<00:02:37.500> Wow<00:02:39.290> Wow

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
we pull that off there we go Wow Wow

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.780 
we pull that off there we go Wow Wow
that's<00:02:41.370> very<00:02:42.500> dramatic<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:44.099> actually<00:02:44.489> looks

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that's very dramatic it actually looks

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
that's very dramatic it actually looks
very<00:02:44.910> nice<00:02:45.660> on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> back<00:02:45.959> I'm<00:02:46.680> pretty<00:02:47.190> sure

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
very nice on the back I'm pretty sure

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.610 
very nice on the back I'm pretty sure
you<00:02:47.459> can<00:02:47.579> see<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.879> really<00:02:48.420> nice<00:02:48.599> even<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
you can see that really nice even the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.229 
you can see that really nice even the
Apple<00:02:49.890> logo<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.220> color<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.670> guess<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.060> all

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
Apple logo is color so I guess in all

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.509 
Apple logo is color so I guess in all
the<00:02:51.420> iPod<00:02:51.750> touches<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.709> Apple<00:02:52.980> logo<00:02:53.099> will<00:02:53.489> be

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
the iPod touches the Apple logo will be

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.380 
the iPod touches the Apple logo will be
themed<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> appropriate<00:02:55.650> color<00:02:56.299> we<00:02:57.299> have

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
themed to the appropriate color we have

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.789 
themed to the appropriate color we have
a<00:02:57.420> five<00:02:57.750> megapixel<00:02:57.930> camera<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.709> back

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
a five megapixel camera on the back

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.069 
a five megapixel camera on the back
along<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.250> flash<00:02:59.760> now<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:00.930> see

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
along with flash now and you can see

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.569 
along with flash now and you can see
that<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.379> camera<00:03:01.620> actually<00:03:02.220> sorry<00:03:02.489> about

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
that the camera actually sorry about

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.539 
that the camera actually sorry about
that<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.209> camera<00:03:03.500> actually<00:03:04.500> pops<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> bit

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
that the camera actually pops out a bit

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.089 
that the camera actually pops out a bit
which<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.940> unlike<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.660> iPhone<00:03:07.019> 5<00:03:07.260> here<00:03:07.530> which

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
which is unlike the iPhone 5 here which

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.680 
which is unlike the iPhone 5 here which
is<00:03:08.310> flush<00:03:08.640> with<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.940> device<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:09.420> weird<00:03:09.629> that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
is flush with the device it's weird that

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.349 
is flush with the device it's weird that
Apple<00:03:10.049> did<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.459> who<00:03:11.459> knows<00:03:11.639> why<00:03:11.880> maybe<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
Apple did that who knows why maybe the

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.559 
Apple did that who knows why maybe the
camera<00:03:12.720> sensor<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.230> actually<00:03:13.940> thicker<00:03:14.940> than

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
camera sensor is actually thicker than

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.920 
camera sensor is actually thicker than
the<00:03:15.690> iPod<00:03:15.959> touch<00:03:16.139> itself<00:03:16.560> who<00:03:17.099> knows

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
the iPod touch itself who knows

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.479 
the iPod touch itself who knows
obviously<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.709> great<00:03:20.099> thing<00:03:20.340> because

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
obviously it's not a great thing because

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.129 
obviously it's not a great thing because
when<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.910> scratch<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.599> table<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.019> going

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
when you scratch on a table it's going

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.159 
when you scratch on a table it's going
to<00:03:22.230> scratch<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.680> lens<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.810> actually

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
to scratch the lens but it actually

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.900 
to scratch the lens but it actually
doesn't<00:03:25.410> look<00:03:25.530> bad<00:03:25.859> like<00:03:25.889> that<00:03:26.099> looks<00:03:26.700> kind<00:03:26.880> of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
doesn't look bad like that looks kind of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.940 
doesn't look bad like that looks kind of
cool<00:03:27.079> but<00:03:28.079> just<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.470> can<00:03:28.590> see<00:03:28.769> there<00:03:28.919> a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
cool but just so you can see there a

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.710 
cool but just so you can see there a
comparison<00:03:30.859> Apple<00:03:31.859> logo<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.340> smaller<00:03:32.849> on<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
comparison Apple logo is smaller on the

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
it comes out just put the loop right in

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.490 
it comes out just put the loop right in
there<00:05:13.039> slide<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.340> on<00:05:14.490> there<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:16.410> you

there slide it on there and then you
pull<00:05:16.770> it<00:05:16.800> it'd<00:05:16.979> be<00:05:17.100> nice<00:05:17.250> if<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.430> could<00:05:17.550> press

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
it back in or something so I'd be more

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.390 
it back in or something so I'd be more
secure<00:05:21.259> but<00:05:22.259> yeah<00:05:22.470> now<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.710> can<00:05:22.889> just<00:05:23.009> fling

it I guess you wouldn't drop it very
nice<00:05:27.060> when<00:05:27.300> you're<00:05:27.419> using<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.960> take

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
nice when you're using it to take

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.409 
nice when you're using it to take
pictures<00:05:28.500> or<00:05:29.039> stills<00:05:31.970> but<00:05:32.970> yeah<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.150> mean<00:05:33.300> it

pictures or stills but yeah I mean it

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.210

holds<00:05:33.630> on<00:05:33.720> pretty<00:05:34.020> nicely<00:05:34.259> this<00:05:34.650> is<00:05:34.830> probably

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
holds on pretty nicely this is probably

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.360 
holds on pretty nicely this is probably
made<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:35.789> looks<00:05:36.030> like<00:05:36.150> it's<00:05:36.330> made<00:05:36.509> out<00:05:36.539> of<00:05:36.690> I
