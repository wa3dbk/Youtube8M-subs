00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that I thought maybe cranks would be

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
that I thought maybe cranks would be
kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:11.720> wild<00:01:12.720> card<00:01:12.960> game<00:01:13.020> mode<00:01:13.350> of

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
into a really awkward situation where

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.100 
into a really awkward situation where
the<00:06:35.819> enemy<00:06:36.029> team<00:06:36.209> was<00:06:36.330> holding<00:06:36.629> down<00:06:36.659> the<00:06:36.899> care

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110
