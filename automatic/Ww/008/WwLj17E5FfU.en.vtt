compare<00:01:57.670> these<00:01:57.819> two<00:01:57.909> cameras<00:01:58.359> hair<00:01:58.600> but<00:01:59.109> I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
compare these two cameras hair but I

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.109 
compare these two cameras hair but I
never<00:01:59.319> tried<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.679> at<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.159> same<00:02:00.310> time<00:02:00.549> Karis

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
never tried it at the same time Karis

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.630 
never tried it at the same time Karis
they're<00:02:01.509> here<00:02:01.840> they're<00:02:02.319> all<00:02:02.380> kinky<00:02:03.130> whatever

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
they're here they're all kinky whatever

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.730 
they're here they're all kinky whatever
here<00:02:03.849> it's<00:02:04.119> thicker<00:02:04.840> at<00:02:05.079> then<00:02:05.259> fill<00:02:05.469> up<00:02:05.560> then

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
here it's thicker at then fill up then

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.729 
here it's thicker at then fill up then
but<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.310> preferred<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.759> like<00:02:06.969> this<00:02:07.149> because<00:02:07.739> it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
but I preferred it like this because it

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.529 
but I preferred it like this because it
was<00:02:09.009> on<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.519> looks<00:02:09.789> more<00:02:09.940> natural<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.420> I

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
was on it looks more natural and I

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.930 
was on it looks more natural and I
actually<00:02:10.720> pulled<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.200> lot<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.379> people<00:02:11.830> which<00:02:12.430> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
actually pulled a lot of people which I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.150 
actually pulled a lot of people which I
guess<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.569> trying<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.780> do<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.799> really

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160
