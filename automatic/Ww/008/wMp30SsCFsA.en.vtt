I painted mine orange I believe but I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.960 
I painted mine orange I believe but I
just<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.989> it<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:08.459> number<00:02:08.519> 4

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970

because I still I still think the

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.129 
because I still I still think the
smoking<00:02:44.940> chieftain<00:02:45.299> should<00:02:45.510> be<00:02:45.600> themed<00:02:45.870> but

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139

and<00:04:00.590> it's<00:04:01.340> also<00:04:01.610> quite<00:04:02.300> sentimental<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:03.140> was

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
and it's also quite sentimental this was

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.380 
and it's also quite sentimental this was
the<00:04:03.500> first<00:04:03.800> pyro<00:04:04.070> hat<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.580> went<00:04:04.820> after<00:04:04.970> I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
the first pyro hat that I went after I

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.660 
the first pyro hat that I went after I
think<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.020> vintage<00:04:06.440> Merryweather<00:04:06.980> or<00:04:07.220> sorry

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
think the vintage Merryweather or sorry

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.940 
think the vintage Merryweather or sorry
the<00:04:07.760> vintage<00:04:08.150> vintage<00:04:08.480> Merryweather<00:04:09.110> is<00:04:09.320> just

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
the vintage vintage Merryweather is just

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.130 
the vintage vintage Merryweather is just
like<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.220> epitome<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.790> pyro<00:04:11.420> it's<00:04:11.990> an

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
like the epitome of pyro it's an

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.560 
like the epitome of pyro it's an
old-school<00:04:12.440> pyro<00:04:12.920> hat<00:04:13.280> I've<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:14.030> last<00:04:14.270> breath

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
old-school pyro hat I've the last breath

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.720 
old-school pyro hat I've the last breath
and<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.990> bones<00:04:15.200> layer<00:04:15.440> on<00:04:15.650> there<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.580> me

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
and the bones layer on there and to me

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.690 
and the bones layer on there and to me
that's<00:04:16.940> like<00:04:17.270> the<00:04:17.330> epitome<00:04:17.840> of<00:04:18.049> my<00:04:18.950> pyro<00:04:19.340> I

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
that's like the epitome of my pyro I

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.300 
that's like the epitome of my pyro I
think<00:04:20.480> some<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.780> them<00:04:20.989> look<00:04:21.380> better<00:04:21.739> than<00:04:22.160> that

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
think some of them look better than that

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.850 
think some of them look better than that
so<00:04:22.670> I<00:04:23.030> usually<00:04:23.390> will<00:04:23.930> use<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.080> degreaser<00:04:24.290> not

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
so I usually will use a degreaser not

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.530 
so I usually will use a degreaser not
the<00:04:24.980> back<00:04:25.130> burner<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.880> is<00:04:26.030> like<00:04:26.150> my<00:04:26.300> go-to

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
the back burner this is like my go-to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.530 
the back burner this is like my go-to
last-ditch<00:04:27.530> effort<00:04:28.040> loadout<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:29.240> will<00:04:29.360> pop

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
last-ditch effort loadout and I will pop

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.820 
last-ditch effort loadout and I will pop
this<00:04:29.750> if<00:04:29.900> I'm<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.110> getting<00:04:30.530> totally

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
this if I'm just getting totally

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.920 
this if I'm just getting totally
destroyed<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.220> I<00:04:31.340> just<00:04:31.490> want<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.700> dick<00:04:31.880> around

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
destroyed and I just want to dick around

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.330 
destroyed and I just want to dick around
because<00:04:32.930> I'm<00:04:33.020> not<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.230> huge<00:04:33.320> fan<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.980> the<00:04:34.160> back

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
because I'm not a huge fan of the back

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.550 
because I'm not a huge fan of the back
burner<00:04:34.550> but<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.390> usually<00:04:35.600> have<00:04:35.930> each<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.380> my

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
burner but I usually have each of my

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.380 
burner but I usually have each of my
loadout<00:04:37.130> set<00:04:37.490> with<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.640> different<00:04:38.030> weapon<00:04:38.150> that

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
loadout set with a different weapon that

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.330 
loadout set with a different weapon that
I<00:04:38.419> like<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.750> use<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.500> just<00:04:39.830> keep<00:04:39.950> this<00:04:40.130> on

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
I like to use so I just keep this on

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.010 
I like to use so I just keep this on
there<00:04:40.580> for<00:04:41.090> old<00:04:41.270> times<00:04:41.540> sake

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
there for old times sake

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.960 
there for old times sake
also<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.830> vintage<00:04:43.130> Merryweather<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:43.850> a

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
also the vintage Merryweather it's a

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.510 
also the vintage Merryweather it's a
level<00:04:44.150> 69<00:04:44.810> which<00:04:45.140> I<00:04:45.410> didn't<00:04:45.980> know<00:04:46.190> at<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.400> time

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
level 69 which I didn't know at the time

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.940 
level 69 which I didn't know at the time
I<00:04:46.700> think<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.300> bought<00:04:47.780> it<00:04:47.990> off<00:04:48.140> somebody<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.740> while

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
I think I bought it off somebody a while

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.070 
I think I bought it off somebody a while
ago<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.610> could<00:04:49.760> actually<00:04:49.880> get<00:04:50.780> good

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
ago and you could actually get good

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.260 
ago and you could actually get good
deals<00:04:51.290> on<00:04:51.560> Team<00:04:51.890> Fortress<00:04:52.100> 2<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.060> think<00:04:53.210> it

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
deals on Team Fortress 2 and I think it

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.360 
deals on Team Fortress 2 and I think it
paid<00:04:53.480> like<00:04:53.690> three<00:04:53.930> bucks<00:04:54.680> for<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.040> Hat<00:04:55.190> or

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
paid like three bucks for the Hat or

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.270 
paid like three bucks for the Hat or
something<00:04:55.700> like<00:04:55.790> that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
something like that

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.550 
something like that
even<00:04:56.790> being<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:57.030> level<00:04:57.300> 69<00:04:57.660> before<00:04:58.020> people

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
even being a level 69 before people

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.260 
even being a level 69 before people
started<00:04:58.860> going<00:04:59.070> crazy<00:04:59.100> with<00:04:59.760> like<00:04:59.880> level
