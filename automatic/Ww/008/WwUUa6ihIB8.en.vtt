00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.650
 most recently at strike pro 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 there are new wide bodies and balancers 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.150
 series shifty shad 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 ice 30 40 despite its compact 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.829
 these bait sizes are pretty 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 decent weight and very large 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.820
 capabilities balance members of the shifty family 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.199
 shad 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.699
 ice have a length of 30 and 40 millimeters with 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:45.510
 this, their weight is respectively 9 and 3 and 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:48.420
 21.7 grams bait data highly 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.800
 wide bodies and and at the same time rather narrow 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.359
 if you look at them from the front 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.789
 very often in many bodies of water 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.840
 the main food for predatory fish is 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.430
 gusterka Karasik and bream undoubtedly 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.640
 balancers which are most accurate 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.860
 imitates the shape of the body of these fish 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.470
 and will be for local predators the most 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
 welcome 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.460
 balance shifter shad ice beautiful 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.690
 painted and and furnished very 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.690
 expressive eyes 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.160
 plastic tail is quite large 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:26.759
 square and has branded fluorescent 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.569
 the red color is wide with the balancers bodies 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.369
 it is very convenient to fish they are small and 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.860
 at the same time quite compact 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.830
 so they easily punch very 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.580
 managed and when we get out of the hole 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.229
 they are much simpler than body length and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.060
 balancers come out of the hole and not 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.929
 hook on the front hook for the bottom 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.110
 part of the hole bait shifty shad ice 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.430
 have a variety of color options in 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.369
 natural 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:01.930
 laris colored and glowing then on data 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.439
 balancers are pretty fast 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.009
 they are great for short 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.590
 medium and even relatively high 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.120
 the balances with the balancer very far 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.819
 jumps off the side and quickly 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.920
 turning around comes back for 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.040
 account wide and at the same time strongly 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.709
 laterally flattened body shifty shad 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.930
 ice on a sharp short flip 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.989
 moves not just straight in 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.269
 aside side and pony 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.750
 big arc 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.500
 this feature distinguishes it from all 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.930
 spindly balance bar 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.730
 which move exclusively on 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.660
 straight to catch fish is very important 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.870
 to bait 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.620
 did something special balancers series 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.959
 shifty shad 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.329
 ice is just such bait 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.230
 in their game there is a certain zest 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.500
 which other models have no balancers 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.720
 during fishing to attract fish 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.840
 applied wide sharp game almost 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.370
 without a pause while the balancer is far 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.810
 jumping in different directions 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.750
 sparkles tanks and produces strong 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.459
 hydrodynamic disturbances in water 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.709
 after the angler caught the attention 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.290
 fish need to drastically change the game 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.780
 the fact is that dramatically playing balancer 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.760
 for the fish is not so interesting and it is not his 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.560
 enough besides when balancers 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.900
 the baby jumps off to the side and the fish 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.670
 went to the bait then the balancer easily 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.280
 can hit the fish and startle you 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.280
 so be sure to change the chest 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.420
 game shifts is short and 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.630
 sharp tops balancers with pauses 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.670
 Here is directly on such a game fish 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.130
 already and takes and balance can 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.530
 play not only short toss me 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.340
 but literally like a mormyshka 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.860
 wiggle 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.540
 this can be done separately and can 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.060
 do short after throwing 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.020
 very often the fish at this very moment and 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.020
 lack of balancer 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.040
 angler must be able to be very clear 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.780
 determine the mood of the fish in this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.530
 moment very often 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.420
 fish is if she is active she immediately 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.340
 reacts to bait if we start 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.060
 make broad attracting fish mahi 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.769
 there and we can scare away such fish 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.169
 an experienced angler he will immediately feel it 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.570
 and he will start fishing narrow prints 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.210
 attracting strides and immediately with a neat 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.550
 delicate game and if suddenly after such 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.740
 games when we briefly play balance 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.639
 with pauses or even mormysh im balance 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.680
 no bites 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.620
 then we can already do a few 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.419
 3-4 max sweeps and max swings again 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.430
 go to the game which is best 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.979
 it is precisely fish they attract skill 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.200
 play bait varied and at the right 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.050
 moment to go sharply to the rhythmic 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.539
 monotonous just and leads to 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.970
 that each new hole is caught 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.970
 very carefully and as efficiently as possible 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.849
 shifty series balance weights shad ice 30 40 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.500
 showed their best side 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.830
 catching such fish as medium and large 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.840
 perch and pike and perch 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.750
 I especially want to mention shifty shad 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.009
 ah 40 this model can be said real 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.009
 sudak killer
