00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
gonna go kind of dudes like a jittery

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.940 
gonna go kind of dudes like a jittery
line<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:48.149> tennis<00:00:48.450> ball<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.079> quite<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
line the tennis ball it is quite is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.260 
line the tennis ball it is quite is
furry<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.590> it's<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.739> completely

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
furry but it's it's not completely

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.189 
furry but it's it's not completely
various<00:00:54.620> it's<00:00:55.620> still<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.370> know<00:00:56.750> quite<00:00:57.750> smooth

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
various it's still you know quite smooth

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
various it's still you know quite smooth
smoothly<00:00:58.829> very<00:01:00.949> round<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.840> then

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
smoothly very round like that and then

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.890 
smoothly very round like that and then
again<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:08.330> around<00:01:09.330> there

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
again to go around there

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
again to go around there
so<00:01:10.470> these<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.130> thinner<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so these kind of get thinner this

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
so these kind of get thinner this
longest<00:01:12.900> thinner<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.740> around<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
longest thinner as you get around to the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.770 
longest thinner as you get around to the
outside<00:01:14.960> then<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.530> kind<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
outside then you just want this kind of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.380 
outside then you just want this kind of
slightly<00:01:18.780> very<00:01:19.320> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> edge<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
slightly very kind of edge and then we

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
slightly very kind of edge and then we
can<00:01:23.000> give<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:25.460> modeling<00:01:26.460> 3d

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
can give it a bit of modeling 3d

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.450 
can give it a bit of modeling 3d
modeling<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.900> need<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:31.220> shading<00:01:32.220> in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
modeling but I just need some shading in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
modeling but I just need some shading in
like<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.119> put<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> bit<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> shading<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like that we can put a bit of shading in

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.640 
like that we can put a bit of shading in
across<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.930> bit<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.409> usually

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
across this bit because that is usually

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
across this bit because that is usually
darker<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.049> put<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
darker like that and then we can put it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
darker like that and then we can put it
on<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.280> table<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> course<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
on the table or on the course if you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.179 
on the table or on the course if you
like

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.230 

put<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.909> shading<00:01:50.390> like<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.719> asleep<00:01:51.200> put<00:01:51.380> some

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
put a shading like that asleep put some

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.219 
put a shading like that asleep put some
grass<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.600> there

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
grass in there

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.649 
grass in there
just<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.499> make<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.740> look<00:01:54.859> more<00:01:54.890> interesting

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659
