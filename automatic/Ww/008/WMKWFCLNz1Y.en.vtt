00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello my name is felipe scagliusi and this 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.810
 video for you who are looking like 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.240
 start studying the keyboard on the piano 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.000
 internet through google and youtube 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.130
 short of any tool whatsoever and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.029
 feels a little lost and confused with 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.070
 all kinds of guidelines and 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.949
 indications and everything that is there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.350
 whole salad that is at your disposal 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.380
 good in my point of view what we 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.630
 ends up finding it more frequent or 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.329
 a thing that goes to a theoretical side 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.120
 much is already intense from the beginning and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.640
 try to do this a lot 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 succinctly leaving students a little 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.690
 confusing or a practical thing to do. 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.300
 more and it does not fit 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.910
 none and simply wants to sell a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.719
 product and that the student has some 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.300
 result is even minimal but very 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 quick to be happy with then what? 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.370
 I wanted to propose something different to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.140
 Did you make a mini-course at no cost? 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.739
 none available on the internet and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.439
 this is thinking the following is is a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 learning scheme through my 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.460
 experience of several years teaching 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.140
 piano I call this scheme of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.020
 learning pyramid learning 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.110
 musical is right and this pyramid has 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.930
 two main bases the first base 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.759
 first part of the base is really the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 imitation really look at someone who knows 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.360
 listen to music listen to a lot of music and look 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.390
 someone who is already at the most 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.549
 and really seek to imitate the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.650
 people learn by imitation there is no way 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.500
 a child learns to speak by imitation 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.810
 does not learn from a grammar book, right? 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.240
 already making the abstractions there of the language and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.280
 then start talking start with 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 imitation music is a language of the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.899
 same way begins with imitation and this 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.939
 everything I'm saying is worth it if you want 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.920
 play classical music do not even touch 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.509
 popular music anyway 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 regardless of the musical style you 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.530
 want to play if you use this 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.049
 instrument will need this basis 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.659
 the other part of the stack of another 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.190
 basis of the pianistic technique 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.640
 in you to observe if all that was 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.340
 team 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.490
 giving is being reproduced from May one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.890
 appropriate manner and corresponds to the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.620
 reality music you wait then you 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.680
 will analyze your body your fingers 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.870
 the physical movement with which he comes back 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.670
 to observe who you fear also repairs 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.480
 how is it going on there? 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.240
 did not notice the strength of the fingers agility 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.920
 and if all this basic work imitates and 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.900
 develop your technique to develop the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.569
 your body to match this 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.660
 imitation you seek and then at the top 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.720
 of this pyramid is the most theoretical study 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.239
 which would be the study of reading writing 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.260
 musical style of the musical periods 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.510
 regardless of which period it is 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.580
 things that are happening today until 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.330
 things that happened here in 600 years 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.540
 behind 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.239
 all right then this pyramid is 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.660
 important and thinking about it is the 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.420
 agent made a mini course and okay 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.400
 available if you want to search only 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.230
 I do not know if it's lille to click 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 here below put some email address 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.070
 mail order but it sure has a 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 here in this video of how you 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.070
 makes to receive this resource that in 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.200
 four classes and there you will go through 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.940
 pri by one of these parts of the pyramid 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.150
 created imitation 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.850
 then there is imitation but with observations 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.739
 very accurate of what you should imitate 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.060
 of what you should think as a team 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.690
 trying to 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.700
 so this is a very 111 serves a lot 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.100
 well for the beginning of the piano at the beginning of 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.900
 keyboard in a lightweight way but that is 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.140
 based on something that 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.660
 It really works, it's okay, so this is it. 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.660
 thank you and even a tchan 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.160
 Hmm 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.199
 Hmm
