00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
their hearts put on and a bit more

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.360 
their hearts put on and a bit more
uncomfortable<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.750> not<00:02:28.709> really<00:02:29.069> really

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
uncomfortable and not really really

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.290 
uncomfortable and not really really
productive<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.670> these<00:02:32.790> ones<00:02:33.060> I

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
productive and then for these ones I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.660 
productive and then for these ones I
feel<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.350> they're<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.920> like<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.430> was

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
feel that if they're that like this was

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.260 
feel that if they're that like this was
a<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:35.970> bad<00:02:36.209> one<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:38.220> really<00:02:38.910> not

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
a really bad one so it's really not

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.790 
a really bad one so it's really not
productive<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.620> would

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
productive because I think this would

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.570 
productive because I think this would
really<00:02:40.980> break<00:02:41.430> easily<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.190> like

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
really break easily but if it is like

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.840 
really break easily but if it is like
something<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.660> which<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.850> double

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
something like this which is double

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.160 
something like this which is double
production<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.660> think<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.800> best<00:02:51.170> so

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
production I think this is the best so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.310 
production I think this is the best so
I'm<00:02:52.800> gonna<00:02:52.980> try<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.290> show
