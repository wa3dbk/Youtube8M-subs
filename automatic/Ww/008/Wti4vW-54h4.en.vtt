00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.599
 in this site we are going to escoma who is our desk clean of 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:15.389
 of accesses 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.389
 and for that we are going 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.249
 to create a folder 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.210
 and we're going to call it access 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.900
 in that folder we can create in turn 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.860
 more folders 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.609
 to organize by 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.810
 categories 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.810
 let's create an applications folder 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.160
 multimedia 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.970
 that as an example we are worth 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.080
 inside multimedia 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 let's put all the shortcuts to programs 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.620
 that are multimedia 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.110
 in this case on the desk time these two 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 with which I will track the and move them here 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
 to eliminate them from the writer 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.970
 in the applications folder 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.230
 I'm going to put 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.340
 a direct access to 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.329
 for example the notepad 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.540
 and I want I have here 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.370
 and we know that this is a shortcut 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.400
 he dragged it iveco copy 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.480
 as we see is a shortcut 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.640
 we can also put 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.460
 any other 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.460
 direct access 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 with these as an example we have enough 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.950
 in the root 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.180
 let's also put 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 for example a direct access to the calculator 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 and we are also going to put 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.860
 shortcuts 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.850
 records 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.890
 for it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.480
 we drag with the right button of the mouse that we say create icons of 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.409
 direct access 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.939
 we see that they are shortcuts 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.559
 and we will also create 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.519
 an access aha 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.769
 to a program 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.529
 in this case 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.189
 We are going to use 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.669
 august express 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.779
 this is the application that runs it therefore dragged it 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:36.869
 and create shortcut icons 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.179
 all these accesses we can be renamed 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.819
 buehrle a man 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.689
 identification 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.699
 and at the same time remove 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.119
 shortcut ap 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.119
 since we know that santa accesses 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.099
 masters to close this window 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.219
 and we are going to make this sale 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.149
 now we are going to 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.869
 place 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.049
 a toolbar to that folder in the taskbar 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:11.499
 for it 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.019
 with the right mouse button 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.459
 The first thing we have to do is unlock the toolbar that 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.889
 usually it is own 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.689
 we click again with the right button 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.539
 toolbars 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.019
 new toolbar 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.929
 and now we locate 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.529
 the folder that we created from accesses 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.529
 the selection of owners and affects 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.039
 we can see that he has placed it 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.419
 when taking off 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.449
 said bar 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.449
 we have all the shortcuts that we have created 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.269
 let's see how 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.239
 pass it to you here at the end 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.239
 here at the beginning next to the start button 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.539
 the first thing we have to do is to enlarge the taskbar 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.660
 then we click 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.420
 with the left mouse button 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.629
 over the bar 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.629
 and we spend it down 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.459
 we click with the right button 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 i uncheck show text 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.620
 we puncture it 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.620
 and we put it ahead 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.629
 now someone else / 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.069
 from separation 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.999
 we click 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.150
 i 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.439
 we shrink it to the maximum 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.439
 and these in turn 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.290
 once something has been configured 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.060
 we can see that if we click with the right button on accesses 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.879
 a menu opens 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.879
 what is different so we have the bar 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.710
 blocked up 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.960
 we are going to 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.589
 Put back the bar is size 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:08.430
 which comes by default 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.460
 that we use right button and that's what I love salar 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.559
 that the menu that is different 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.750
 when we want to add more shortcuts to this folder 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.330
 we can do it in a fast way 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
 using with the right button and open folder 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.710
 as we see 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.700
 it opens 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.969
 quickly 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.630
 now just drag and masters 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.249
 ee about 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:43.139
 this folder 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.139
 or about any your folder 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.719
 after tools that we would like 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.639
 This is a way to have a clean desk 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.669
 and have everything at your fingertips 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.020
 having all the accesses 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.630
 in this weird round that we get also is that if we have 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.419
 A window 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.870
 maximized and we want to open anything that we have mcafee deny mind 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.300
 when we place the accesses on the desk 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.639
 we should minimize 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.680
 to be able to cover this form 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.880
 if we have them all here it is not necessary to minimize it 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.719
 I hope that 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:47.399
 or be useful
