go crazy and get his first in form

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.540 
go crazy and get his first in form
because<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> barely<00:00:55.860> seems<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.340> any

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
because it barely seems to be any

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
because it barely seems to be any
incremental<00:00:57.030> difference<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.649> extra<00:00:59.280> no

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
wasn't worth it in the second in form

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
wasn't worth it in the second in form
again<00:01:03.090> there's<00:01:03.300> barely<00:01:03.480> any<00:01:03.719> change<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.170> like

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
again there's barely any change for like

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.929
