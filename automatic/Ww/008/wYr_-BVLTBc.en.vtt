00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
interested to know what you think you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
interested to know what you think you
know<00:01:44.009> who's<00:01:44.610> leading<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> close<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.049> I'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
know who's leading is it close one I'm

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.510 
know who's leading is it close one I'm
I've<00:01:46.409> got<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> feeling<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.159> head<00:01:47.340> this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I've got a feeling in my head this

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
I've got a feeling in my head this
really<00:01:48.060> close<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> moment<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.140> both

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
really close at the moment because both

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.060 
really close at the moment because both
players<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.369> been<00:01:50.990> performing<00:01:51.990> well

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
players have been performing well

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
players have been performing well
actually<00:01:53.070> feel<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.640> Linda<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:54.090> scored<00:01:54.360> more

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
actually feel like Linda has scored more

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.999 
actually feel like Linda has scored more
goals<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:55.200> he<00:01:55.290> seemed<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> one

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
goals because he seemed to be the one

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
goals because he seemed to be the one
that<00:01:56.520> goes<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.090> kickoff<00:01:57.450> run<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.899> by<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that goes on that kickoff run or by the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.389 
that goes on that kickoff run or by the
way<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.439> score<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> hat-trick<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.250> would

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
way we score a hat-trick there would

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.670 
way we score a hat-trick there would
Gary<00:01:59.610> Lineker<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> 30th<00:02:00.780> minute<00:02:00.840> nice<00:02:01.409> one

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
Gary Lineker in the 30th minute nice one

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.709 
Gary Lineker in the 30th minute nice one
indeed<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.610> yeah<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> feel<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.240> Lineker

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
indeed but yeah I feel like Lineker

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.899 
indeed but yeah I feel like Lineker
scored<00:02:04.049> more<00:02:04.259> goals<00:02:04.369> but<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.610> does<00:02:05.759> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
scored more goals but what does that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
scored more goals but what does that
mean<00:02:06.119> does<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.329> mean<00:02:06.630> Owens<00:02:07.020> provided<00:02:07.590> more

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
mean does that mean Owens provided more

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.029 
mean does that mean Owens provided more
