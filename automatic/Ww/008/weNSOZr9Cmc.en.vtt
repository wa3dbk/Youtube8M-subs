them party games instead of wager
matches<00:03:19.960> i<00:03:20.290> guess<00:03:20.500> they<00:03:20.650> just<00:03:20.680> wanted<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.100> take

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
matches i guess they just wanted to take

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.450 
matches i guess they just wanted to take
the<00:03:21.550> bedding<00:03:22.510> aspect<00:03:23.110> out<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:24.100> know

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
the bedding aspect out of it so you know

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.560 
the bedding aspect out of it so you know
we<00:03:24.550> got<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.670> lot<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.820> people<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.270> aren't

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
we got a lot of people that aren't

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.930 
we got a lot of people that aren't
really<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.020> old<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.650> betting<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.670> illegal

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
really that old and betting is illegal

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.700 
really that old and betting is illegal
it's<00:03:28.390> gambling<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.170> can't<00:03:29.350> do<00:03:29.530> that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
it's gambling and you can't do that

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.140 
it's gambling and you can't do that
unless<00:03:29.920> you're<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.250> certain<00:03:30.550> age<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:30.940> guess

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
unless you're a certain age so I guess

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.180 
unless you're a certain age so I guess
they<00:03:31.270> took<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.830> portion<00:03:32.830> out<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.070> game

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
they took that portion out of the game

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.410 
they took that portion out of the game
but<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.430> know<00:03:33.520> sticks<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:33.970> stones<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.300> all

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
but you know sticks and stones and all

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.700 
but you know sticks and stones and all
it<00:03:34.510> should<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:34.810> still<00:03:35.020> be<00:03:35.170> there<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.620> I'm

it should have still be there and I'm

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.580
