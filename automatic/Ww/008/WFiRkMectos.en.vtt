close<00:00:33.870> second<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.340> build<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
close second but for this build of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
Dominic Toretto's does charge I think

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.889

simple one because all that's left is to
respray<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> car<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.400> black<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:35.909> add<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> set

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
respray the car in black then add a set

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
respray the car in black then add a set
of<00:01:36.509> cracker<00:01:36.840> wheels<00:01:37.140> under<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> muscle

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of cracker wheels under the muscle

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.420 
of cracker wheels under the muscle
category<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.150> almost<00:01:39.420> perfect<00:01:40.049> match

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
category which are almost perfect match

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
category which are almost perfect match
now<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> first<00:01:41.939> built<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.360> car<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> game

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
now when I first built this car in game

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
now when I first built this car in game
I<00:01:43.079> did<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.590> from<00:01:43.829> memory<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> first<00:01:44.880> bus

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
I did so from memory of the first bus

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
I did so from memory of the first bus
and<00:01:45.420> furious<00:01:45.780> film<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:46.979> reference

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and furious film and a little reference

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
and furious film and a little reference
picture<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> car<00:01:48.180> chase<00:01:48.210> between<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the end of the 2001 movie but then I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.069 
the end of the 2001 movie but then I
realized<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.659> car<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:54.990> actually

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
realized that this car is actually

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.810 
realized that this car is actually
returned<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> The<00:01:56.399> Fast<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
returned in a lot of The Fast and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
returned in a lot of The Fast and
Furious<00:01:56.909> titles<00:01:57.780> since<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> matte

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
Furious titles since that with a matte

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.800 
Furious titles since that with a matte
black<00:01:59.189> core<00:01:59.549> scheme<00:01:59.880> which<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.180> hindsight<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
black core scheme which in hindsight is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690 
black core scheme which in hindsight is
a<00:02:00.840> much<00:02:01.049> better<00:02:01.259> replica<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.159> movie<00:02:02.490> car

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
a much better replica of the movie car

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.969 
a much better replica of the movie car
and<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.060> looked<00:02:03.180> much<00:02:03.329> more<00:02:03.390> badass<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.950> I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and it looked much more badass so I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.530 
and it looked much more badass so I
thought<00:02:05.159> I'd<00:02:05.250> leave<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> two<00:02:05.939> options<00:02:06.119> of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
thought I'd leave in the two options of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.389 
thought I'd leave in the two options of
the<00:02:06.659> two<00:02:06.840> different<00:02:07.200> blacks<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> respray

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the two different blacks in the respray

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.419 
the two different blacks in the respray
section<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
section I

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.099 
section I
notice<00:02:09.789> I've<00:02:09.939> got<00:02:10.090> clips<00:02:10.420> with<00:02:10.629> both<00:02:10.840> setups

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.109 
notice I've got clips with both setups

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.990 
notice I've got clips with both setups
because<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:11.829> had<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.129> go<00:02:12.250> back<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.879> try

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
because I just had to go back in and try

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.720 
because I just had to go back in and try
it<00:02:13.120> out<00:02:13.299> in<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.659> cool<00:02:13.930> matte<00:02:14.230> black<00:02:14.609> we<00:02:15.609> also

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
it out in that cool matte black we also

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.000 
it out in that cool matte black we also
spent<00:02:16.180> over<00:02:16.480> an<00:02:16.599> hour<00:02:16.750> trying<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.260> replicate

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
spent over an hour trying to replicate

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.130 
spent over an hour trying to replicate
the<00:02:18.310> end<00:02:18.579> of<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.909> car<00:02:19.180> chase<00:02:19.209> scene<00:02:19.870> where

the<00:03:08.379> first<00:03:08.620> movie<00:03:09.010> I've<00:03:09.489> tried<00:03:09.760> doing<00:03:09.909> both

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
the first movie I've tried doing both

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.050 
the first movie I've tried doing both
but<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.810> in-game<00:03:11.439> cars<00:03:11.829> of<00:03:12.219> the<00:03:12.400> Buffalo<00:03:12.879> and

but the in-game cars of the Buffalo and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.580 
but the in-game cars of the Buffalo and
the<00:03:13.150> Banshee<00:03:13.569> are<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.780> closest<00:03:14.139> match<00:03:14.349> but

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
the Banshee are the closest match but

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.080 
the Banshee are the closest match but
they<00:03:14.709> didn't<00:03:14.949> really<00:03:15.159> work<00:03:15.370> out<00:03:15.609> too<00:03:15.669> well

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
they didn't really work out too well

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.969 
they didn't really work out too well
they<00:03:16.299> basically<00:03:16.629> looked<00:03:16.989> like<00:03:17.199> a<00:03:17.229> silver<00:03:17.739> new

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:17.979
