00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.760 
interesting way they want to keep it a
poison<00:01:55.369> slashdot<00:01:56.090> spec<00:01:56.539> so<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.500> feel<00:01:57.679> like

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
poison slashdot spec so I feel like

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.749 
poison slashdot spec so I feel like
maybe<00:01:57.920> they'll<00:01:58.130> do<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> little<00:01:58.520> bit<00:01:58.670> more

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
maybe they'll do a little bit more

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.729 
maybe they'll do a little bit more
emphasis<00:01:59.209> on<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> dots<00:01:59.660> maybe<00:02:00.110> give<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:00.470> more

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
emphasis on the dots maybe give it more

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:02.979 
emphasis on the dots maybe give it more
types<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.209> damage<00:02:02.209> over<00:02:02.390> time<00:02:02.420> effects<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.929> the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
types of damage over time effects to the

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.419 
types of damage over time effects to the
assassination<00:02:03.530> which<00:02:04.069> will<00:02:04.250> be<00:02:04.340> an

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
assassination which will be an

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.589 
assassination which will be an
interesting<00:02:04.640> because<00:02:04.849> then<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.390> know<00:02:05.450> we

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
interesting because then you know we

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.150 
interesting because then you know we
would<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:05.899> one<00:02:06.170> row<00:02:06.349> expect<00:02:06.649> it's<00:02:06.830> all<00:02:06.950> about

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
would have one row expect it's all about

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.249 
would have one row expect it's all about
the<00:02:07.369> dog<00:02:07.610> damage<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.330> way<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.110> would

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
the dog damage and the way it would

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.830 
the dog damage and the way it would
scale<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.770> don't<00:02:10.550> know<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:10.729> like<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.120> i<00:02:11.450> like
