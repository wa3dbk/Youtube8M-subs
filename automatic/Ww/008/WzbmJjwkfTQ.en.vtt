riser mat pack and indeed you don't even
need<00:00:35.719> to<00:00:35.780> just<00:00:36.579> use<00:00:37.579> it<00:00:37.610> with<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.239> double<00:00:38.270> o

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
need to just use it with the double o

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.180 
need to just use it with the double o
rising<00:00:39.079> right<00:00:39.230> happening<00:00:39.559> you<00:00:39.739> can<00:00:39.890> use<00:00:40.040> it

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
rising right happening you can use it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.069 
rising right happening you can use it
with<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.340> double<00:00:40.430> o<00:00:40.730> Gundam<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:41.390> pretty<00:00:41.719> much

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
with the double o Gundam and pretty much

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
the Gundam double O series so that's a

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.399 
the Gundam double O series so that's a
pretty<00:00:52.190> cool<00:00:52.489> playability<00:00:53.480> factor<00:00:54.170> that<00:00:54.260> you

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
pretty cool playability factor that you

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.139 
pretty cool playability factor that you
have<00:00:54.620> there<00:00:54.920> if<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:55.219> have<00:00:55.429> all<00:00:55.640> those<00:00:55.789> are<00:00:55.999> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
have there if you have all those are the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.160 
have there if you have all those are the
high-grade<00:00:57.019> models<00:00:57.409> and<00:00:58.249> in<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:58.850> case<00:00:59.179> I've

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
high-grade models and in this case I've

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.309 
high-grade models and in this case I've
chosen<00:01:00.230> my<00:01:00.829> own<00:01:00.859> kind<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.579> yeah<00:01:02.300> this<00:01:02.989> is<00:01:03.109> how<00:01:03.289> I

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
chosen my own kind of yeah this is how I

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.770 
chosen my own kind of yeah this is how I
probably<00:01:03.920> will<00:01:04.400> wind<00:01:04.699> up<00:01:04.850> displaying<00:01:05.510> him<00:01:05.690> I

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
probably will wind up displaying him I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.370 
probably will wind up displaying him I
don't<00:01:05.960> know<00:01:06.110> yet<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:06.409> as<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.400> can<00:01:07.580> see<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:08.000> have

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
the X n sword separated out one in each

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.070 
the X n sword separated out one in each
hand<00:01:11.650> I've<00:01:12.650> got<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.240> extendable<00:01:14.240> arms<00:01:14.810> coming

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
out from the underneath of the X n riser

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.160 
out from the underneath of the X n riser
backpack<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.680> they<00:01:19.280> go<00:01:19.520> forward<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.479> just

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
backpack and they go forward and just

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.100 
backpack and they go forward and just
for<00:01:21.350> demo<00:01:21.560> purposes<00:01:22.189> I've<00:01:22.399> got<00:01:22.549> one<00:01:22.960> holding<00:01:23.960> a

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
for demo purposes I've got one holding a

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.709 
for demo purposes I've got one holding a
sword<00:01:24.979> Jian<00:01:25.369> sword<00:01:25.670> -<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.299> then<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.570> other

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
sword Jian sword - and then the other

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.350 
sword Jian sword - and then the other
one<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:27.140> kind<00:01:27.469> of<00:01:27.530> GN<00:01:27.860> rifle<00:01:28.399> but<00:01:29.060> I'll

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
one is a kind of GN rifle but I'll

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.929 
one is a kind of GN rifle but I'll
probably<00:01:29.659> have<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.320> double<00:01:30.770> sword<00:01:31.009> crust<00:01:31.460> so

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
probably have to double sword crust so

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.289 
probably have to double sword crust so
you'll<00:01:32.119> have<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.479> two<00:01:32.899> main<00:01:33.219> XM<00:01:34.219> blades<00:01:34.909> going

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
you'll have the two main XM blades going

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.139 
you'll have the two main XM blades going
downwards<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.110> then<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.610> plan<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.789> have<00:01:37.939> the

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
downwards and then the plan to have the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.080 
downwards and then the plan to have the
2<00:01:38.329> X<00:01:38.659> n<00:01:38.899> blade<00:01:39.439> tubes<00:01:39.829> going<00:01:40.340> upwards<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.060> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
2 X n blade tubes going upwards in the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.550 
2 X n blade tubes going upwards in the
crossed<00:01:41.450> earth<00:01:41.719> so<00:01:42.140> fashion<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:45.170> meant

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
crossed earth so fashion and you meant

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.440 
crossed earth so fashion and you meant
to<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:45.859> think<00:01:46.189> have<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.670> actual<00:01:47.000> double<00:01:47.329> O

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
to I think have the actual double O

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.569 
to I think have the actual double O
binders<00:01:48.399> you<00:01:49.399> know<00:01:49.490> kind<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.850> on<00:01:50.000> top<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.689> the

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
binders you know kind of on top of the

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.179 
binders you know kind of on top of the
the<00:01:52.579> GN<00:01:53.180> drives<00:01:53.570> but<00:01:54.259> I've<00:01:54.500> actually<00:01:54.740> pinned

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
the GN drives but I've actually pinned

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.349 
the GN drives but I've actually pinned
them<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.700> backpack<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.219> and<00:01:58.219> I've<00:01:59.060> left

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
them to the backpack and and I've left

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.109 
them to the backpack and and I've left
the<00:01:59.570> energy<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.200> daggers<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.369> shields<00:02:01.850> as<00:02:01.969> it

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
the energy and daggers the shields as it

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.050 
the energy and daggers the shields as it
were<00:02:02.439> in<00:02:03.439> place<00:02:03.859> of<00:02:04.189> where<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.609> binders

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
were in place of where the binders

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.050 
were in place of where the binders
should<00:02:05.240> normally<00:02:05.630> be<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:07.189> that's<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
should normally be so that's just the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.029 
should normally be so that's just the
kind<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.330> look<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.630> prefer<00:02:09.020> but<00:02:09.350> I'll<00:02:09.770> show<00:02:10.009> a

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
kind of look I prefer but I'll show a

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.180 
kind of look I prefer but I'll show a
few<00:02:10.340> more<00:02:10.429> variations<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.420> little<00:02:11.690> bit<00:02:12.190> so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
few more variations in a little bit so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.090 
few more variations in a little bit so
that's<00:02:13.910> pretty<00:02:14.630> much<00:02:14.720> how<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.050> looks<00:02:15.440> let's

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
that's pretty much how it looks let's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.589 
that's pretty much how it looks let's
just<00:02:16.400> show<00:02:16.580> you

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
just show you

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.390 
just show you
there's<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> little<00:02:18.230> bit<00:02:18.409> greater<00:02:18.650> detail<00:02:18.769> if<00:02:19.280> I

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
there's a little bit greater detail if I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.020 
there's a little bit greater detail if I
can<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.080> show<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.379> you<00:02:22.099> know<00:02:22.549> there's<00:02:22.970> a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
can just to show you you know there's a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.460 
can just to show you you know there's a
lot<00:02:23.299> of<00:02:25.090> spikes<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.510> bits<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.049> bobs<00:02:27.140> that

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
lot of spikes and bits and bobs that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.229 
lot of spikes and bits and bobs that
stick<00:02:27.890> out<00:02:28.010> all<00:02:28.189> over<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.459> place<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.849> this<00:02:28.970> kit

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
but as you can see that's the most

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.619 
but as you can see that's the most
notable<00:03:33.230> part<00:03:33.680> it's<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.129> plain<00:03:34.849> white<00:03:35.209> so

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
notable part it's just plain white so

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.080 
notable part it's just plain white so
it's<00:03:36.440> looking<00:03:36.769> pretty<00:03:37.160> horrible<00:03:37.760> at<00:03:37.970> the

it's looking pretty horrible at the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.360 
it's looking pretty horrible at the
moment<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:39.139> at<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.410> same<00:03:39.620> time<00:03:39.919> but<00:03:40.069> I<00:03:40.129> think

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
moment but at the same time but I think

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.099 
moment but at the same time but I think
once<00:03:40.609> we<00:03:40.699> get<00:03:40.879> those<00:03:41.030> painted<00:03:41.419> up<00:03:41.599> they<00:03:41.870> are

see the double O is missing a lot of

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.939 
see the double O is missing a lot of
details<00:03:54.410> because<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.129> it<00:03:55.370> comes<00:03:55.579> with

comes with a lot of clear parts but in
the<00:03:59.840> right<00:04:00.019> color<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.769> they<00:04:01.579> should<00:04:01.849> be<00:04:01.970> green

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
the right color and they should be green

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
there the code of the condensers in the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.469 
there the code of the condensers in the
all<00:04:30.509> joints<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.289> knees<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:32.009> the<00:04:32.479> the

forearms there well they should be green

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.909 
forearms there well they should be green
so<00:04:36.810> we'll<00:04:36.990> take<00:04:37.199> out<00:04:37.410> those<00:04:37.620> pretty<00:04:37.919> soon<00:04:39.919> more

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
so we'll take out those pretty soon more

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.920 
so we'll take out those pretty soon more
detail<00:04:41.340> that's<00:04:41.550> missing<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:42.090> on<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.419> whole<00:04:42.690> of

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
detail that's missing is on the whole of

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.020 
detail that's missing is on the whole of
this<00:04:43.080> X<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.530> backpack<00:04:43.979> itself<00:04:44.400> you'll<00:04:44.699> see

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
this X and backpack itself you'll see

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.740 
this X and backpack itself you'll see
there's<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.690> massive<00:04:46.259> load<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.680> white<00:04:47.750> all

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
there's just a massive load of white all

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.210 
there's just a massive load of white all
over<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.199> place<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:51.110> once<00:04:52.110> that's<00:04:52.410> in<00:04:52.620> colour

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
over the place and once that's in colour

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.100 
over the place and once that's in colour
I<00:04:53.250> think<00:04:53.789> that's<00:04:53.970> gonna<00:04:54.120> bring<00:04:54.389> out<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.750> lot<00:04:55.050> of

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
I think that's gonna bring out a lot of

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.600 
I think that's gonna bring out a lot of
detail<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:01.050> that's<00:05:01.199> how<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.440> X<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.130> double-o

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
detail so that's how the X and double-o

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.089 
detail so that's how the X and double-o
riser<00:05:02.910> looks<00:05:03.300> all<00:05:03.479> together<00:05:03.840> now<00:05:04.530> let's<00:05:04.770> have

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
riser looks all together now let's have

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.580 
riser looks all together now let's have
a<00:05:05.190> look<00:05:05.370> at<00:05:05.550> how<00:05:05.759> the<00:05:06.090> individual<00:05:06.750> parts<00:05:07.080> sort

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
a look at how the individual parts sort

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.550 
a look at how the individual parts sort
of<00:05:07.680> combine<00:05:08.099> and<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:09.599> intricacies<00:05:10.229> are

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
of combine and the intricacies are

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.430 
of combine and the intricacies are
putting<00:05:11.190> them<00:05:11.280> together
