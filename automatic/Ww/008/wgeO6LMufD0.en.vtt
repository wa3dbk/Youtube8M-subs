00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.360 

well<00:01:13.570> with<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.840> new<00:01:13.870> 8<00:01:14.200> passenger<00:01:14.830> gondola

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.190 
well with the new 8 passenger gondola
we've<00:01:15.580> doubled<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.030> capacity<00:01:16.150> there<00:01:16.840> was<00:01:17.050> it

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
we've doubled the capacity there was it

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.500 
we've doubled the capacity there was it
was<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.560> four<00:01:17.800> passenger<00:01:18.040> before<00:01:18.730> it<00:01:19.270> takes

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
was a four passenger before it takes

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.540 
was a four passenger before it takes
half<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.780> time<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.410> get<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.830> top<00:01:21.040> as<00:01:21.370> it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
half the time to get to the top as it

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.680 
half the time to get to the top as it
did<00:01:21.700> from<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.060> old<00:01:22.270> one

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
did from the old one

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.600 
did from the old one
so<00:01:22.930> there's<00:01:23.170> hardly<00:01:23.350> ever<00:01:23.590> any<00:01:23.890> lift<00:01:24.160> lines<00:01:24.400> at

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
so there's hardly ever any lift lines at

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
so there's hardly ever any lift lines at
the<00:01:24.760> gondola<00:01:25.270> much<00:01:25.840> bigger<00:01:26.110> much<00:01:26.320> smoother

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080 

capitan<00:01:32.560> chair<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.100> new<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.580> one<00:01:33.730> from<00:01:33.970> a

triple chair to a quad chair and chair

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.040 
triple chair to a quad chair and chair
too<00:01:39.130> has<00:01:39.310> also<00:01:39.610> been<00:01:39.940> replaced<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.840> went
