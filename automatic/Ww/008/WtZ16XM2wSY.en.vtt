this is a tricky spot because of all the
criss<00:01:39.270> crossing<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.840> tape<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.799> may<00:01:40.950> end

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
criss crossing of the tape you may end

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
criss crossing of the tape you may end
up<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.610> small<00:01:42.270> gap<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> tape<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.840 
back here so just keep an eye on that
it's<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> affect<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.520> the

from the handlebar there's a trick to
making<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.280> wrap<00:02:11.459> nice<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.150> tight<00:02:12.360> without

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
making the wrap nice and tight without

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.899 
making the wrap nice and tight without
pulling<00:02:13.290> back<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.129> brake<00:02:14.340> cable<00:02:14.730> making

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
pulling back on that brake cable making

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.900 
pulling back on that brake cable making
your<00:02:15.180> brakes<00:02:15.419> feel<00:02:15.659> spongy<00:02:16.049> do<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.769> wrap

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
your brakes feel spongy do you wrap

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.840 
your brakes feel spongy do you wrap
over<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:19.260> cable<00:02:19.650> until<00:02:19.830> you're<00:02:20.220> about<00:02:20.550> an

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
over the cable until you're about an

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.180 
over the cable until you're about an
inch<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> half<00:02:21.680> away<00:02:22.680> from<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.010> brake

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
inch and a half away from the brake

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.170 
inch and a half away from the brake
lever<00:02:23.900> then<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.460> be<00:02:26.550> tricky<00:02:26.820> with

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
lever then and this can be tricky with

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.270 
lever then and this can be tricky with
adhesive<00:02:27.810> tape<00:02:27.840> but<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.830> carefully

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
adhesive tape but if you carefully

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.460 
adhesive tape but if you carefully
thread<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.180> underneath<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.110> pull<00:02:34.380> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
thread it underneath you can pull it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.340 
thread it underneath you can pull it
tight<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:40.730> there<00:02:41.840> you've<00:02:42.840> got<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.080> nice<00:02:43.320> tight

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
tight and there you've got a nice tight

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.370 
tight and there you've got a nice tight
wrap<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:45.630> you're<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:45.840> affecting<00:02:46.290> your

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
wrap but you're not affecting your

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.060 
wrap but you're not affecting your
braking<00:02:46.770> at<00:02:46.860> all<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.970> point<00:02:48.830> we'll<00:02:49.830> trim

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
braking at all at this point we'll trim

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.979 
braking at all at this point we'll trim
the<00:02:50.190> tape<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> diagonal

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.709
