00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.730 
what it is it might be the keys they
have<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:44.180> not<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:46.290> wouldn't<00:01:46.619> say

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
have kind of a not really I wouldn't say

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.310 
have kind of a not really I wouldn't say
texture<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.520> feel<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.119> they've<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.720> don't

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
texture to feel but they've got I don't

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.660 
texture to feel but they've got I don't
know<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.890> did<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> feel<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
know what it is it did the feel of the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.399 
know what it is it did the feel of the
keys<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.329> nice<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.840> Griffey<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.229> well

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
keys really nice kind of Griffey as well

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.200 
keys really nice kind of Griffey as well
and<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:53.009> sounds<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> bit<00:01:53.399> silly<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> keyboard

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and it sounds a bit silly for a keyboard

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.370 
and it sounds a bit silly for a keyboard
but<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.540> fingers<00:01:54.869> aren't<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
but your fingers aren't really going to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.080 
but your fingers aren't really going to
slip<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:55.950> fit<00:01:56.189> nicely<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> keys

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
slip up this they fit nicely on the keys

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.480 
slip up this they fit nicely on the keys
and<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> backlight<00:01:58.890> behind<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> as

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and I think the backlight behind it as

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.920 
and I think the backlight behind it as
well<00:01:59.520> because<00:02:00.000> they're<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.299> individually

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
well because they're not individually

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.539 
well because they're not individually
backlit<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.560> it's<00:02:01.740> got<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> nice<00:02:02.130> strong

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
backlit but it's got a nice strong

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.730 
backlit but it's got a nice strong
backlight<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.719> back<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.530> kind

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
backlight on it so that back like kind

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.190 
backlight on it so that back like kind
of<00:02:04.860> them<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.600> runs<00:02:06.869> through<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.170> entire

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
of them it like runs through the entire

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.960 
of them it like runs through the entire
keyboard<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.129> only<00:02:08.340> place<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.789> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
keyboard and the only place it that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.119 
keyboard and the only place it that
doesn't<00:02:09.300> really<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.080> much<00:02:10.590> light<00:02:10.920> is

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
doesn't really have that much light is

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.980 
doesn't really have that much light is
the<00:02:11.489> Escape<00:02:11.910> key<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.480> still<00:02:12.750> it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
the Escape key but then still it

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.480 
the Escape key but then still it
still<00:02:13.140> has<00:02:13.320> enough<00:02:13.620> light<00:02:13.860> especially<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
still has enough light especially in the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.440 
still has enough light especially in the
dark<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.970> you're<00:02:15.030> gonna<00:02:15.240> need<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.660> as<00:02:15.870> well

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
dark when you're gonna need this as well

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.490 
dark when you're gonna need this as well

in my life so you know starcraft 2 up
there<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.580> probably<00:02:27.420> wouldn't<00:02:27.780> buy<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.140> my

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
there I probably wouldn't buy it with my

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.170 
there I probably wouldn't buy it with my
own<00:02:28.290> money<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.950> had<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.220> starcraft<00:02:29.670> 2<00:02:29.820> logo

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
own money if it had the starcraft 2 logo

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.160 
own money if it had the starcraft 2 logo
