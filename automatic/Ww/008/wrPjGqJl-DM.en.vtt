it's spectacular and do look back again
at<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.650> way<00:04:23.770> their<00:04:24.010> colors<00:04:24.400> seem<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.729> come<00:04:24.880> at

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
at the way their colors seem to come at

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:34.390 
at the way their colors seem to come at
once<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.510> down

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.670 

it's<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.730> great<00:04:34.970> pub<00:04:35.240> though<00:04:35.510> because<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:36.530> can

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
it's a great pub though because you can

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.360 
it's a great pub though because you can
manage<00:04:36.919> it<00:04:37.220> with<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.669> small<00:04:37.970> gun

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
manage it with just a small gun

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.540 
manage it with just a small gun
oh<00:04:39.400> yeah<00:04:40.180> this<00:04:40.660> is<00:04:40.870> not<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.139> very<00:04:41.410> large<00:04:41.830> area

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
oh yeah this is not a very large area

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.020 
oh yeah this is not a very large area
but<00:04:42.760> it's<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.389> big<00:04:44.110> statement

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.050 

and<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.260> think<00:04:50.320> it's<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.740> sharing<00:04:51.040> state<00:04:51.610> you

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
and I think it's a sharing state you

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.800 
and I think it's a sharing state you
know<00:04:52.210> your<00:04:52.540> neighbors<00:04:52.930> can<00:04:53.140> enjoy<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.820> you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
know your neighbors can enjoy it and you

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.350 
know your neighbors can enjoy it and you
don't<00:04:55.960> have<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.320> bend<00:04:56.470> over<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:58.180> is

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
don't have to bend over this is

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.090 
don't have to bend over this is
waist-high<00:04:58.870> it's<00:04:59.290> very<00:04:59.500> easy<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.860> maintain

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.770 

and<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:07.220> don't<00:05:07.400> waste<00:05:07.639> water<00:05:07.880> you<00:05:08.360> just<00:05:08.600> put

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
and you don't waste water you just put

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.330 
and you don't waste water you just put
your<00:05:08.870> drip<00:05:09.080> system<00:05:09.110> in<00:05:09.620> along<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.010> middle<00:05:10.190> of

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
your drip system in along the middle of

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.670

I do think you need to grow them from
the<00:06:33.360> beginning<00:06:33.919> for<00:06:34.919> them<00:06:35.039> to<00:06:35.190> be<00:06:35.310> strong

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.339 

this<00:06:42.819> has<00:06:42.969> been<00:06:43.119> a<00:06:43.179> wonderful<00:06:43.479> spring<00:06:44.019> for
