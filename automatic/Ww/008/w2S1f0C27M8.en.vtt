 Today, I am bringing you guys without kids 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.069
 I bring this tutorial 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.330
 this is the tutorial we are going to do 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.700
 today 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.770
 I hope you like it, you just need some 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.389
 tennis anyone 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.700
 the favorite colors in my case I am or 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.730
 do not paint them red they were red 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.430
 but two colors of preference that is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.119
 the black and another color and a brush 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.830
 thin iurix and since we see the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.190
 next I hope you like this day 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.650
 and walter edited above and subscribe if 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.390
 You are not going to weigh plastic on 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.879
 this part of the sole or I do not know if it's 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.710
 alone but the plastic part already with the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.080
 painting and your thinking thin you're going to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 make thick lines or triangles and 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.290
 thin from left to right and go 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.869
 interspersed or of 22 one and one like 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.020
 you see or do a whole complete 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:01.890
 can be guided in photos of this one 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.510
 of brain then normal and I think it is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.970
 the most basic is very easy but do it 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.250
 as long as they end up on tip 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.160
 longer than other shorter ones 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 that you do not see so much perfection for 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.570
 have one more style now yes in 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.850
 where the shoelaces goes is just a 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 fabrics as shown in the video nothing 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.530
 more join them and keep doing the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.750
 lines just like Ivan I like more than 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.900
 are neither so thick nor so thin 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.360
 Frei is as you want as you see 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.980
 the months are very much the same but so 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.650
 I like them 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.080
 and now in the part of the ankles go 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.220
 to continue doing so we will get 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.590
 a guide as such but they can 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.320
 keep on being thick thin I told them 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.450
 oh I think that means or at least these 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.190
 you have that they are very small socks is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.250
 so sorry for this image I did not see that 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.710
 I was not recording well 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.420
 but the next thing you want to see a little 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.630
 better is this way they will continue until 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 come to the end of the other side like 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.780
 following it from thin thick long 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.780
 short 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.579
 and well they will have something like 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:17.939
 super father I hope you like the 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:22.359
 video and see you in the next 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.810

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.810
