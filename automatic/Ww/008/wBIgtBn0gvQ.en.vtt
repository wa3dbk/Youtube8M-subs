anyways this is actually a very good
gaming<00:00:54.480> cpu<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:55.770> underrated<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
gaming cpu that is very underrated and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
gaming cpu that is very underrated and
really<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.870> its<00:00:57.989> price<00:00:58.140> point<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> beats<00:00:58.770> out

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
really for its price point in beats out

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.599 
really for its price point in beats out
the<00:00:59.010> FX<00:00:59.609> 6300<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.600> GT<00:01:01.020> 258<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the FX 6300 and GT 258 so this is a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.939 
the FX 6300 and GT 258 so this is a
great<00:01:02.940> gaming<00:01:03.270> processor<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.739> for

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
great gaming processor to go with so for

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.210 
great gaming processor to go with so for

this is a really good multiple for its
price<00:01:36.450> point<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.320> low

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
price point just because it's low

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.230 
price point just because it's low
doesn't<00:01:37.860> mean<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.130> necessarily<00:01:38.280> bad<00:01:38.939> or

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
doesn't mean it's necessarily bad or

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
doesn't mean it's necessarily bad or
anything<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.829> means<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
anything it really just means that it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.889 
anything it really just means that it
doesn't<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.030> many<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> nice<00:01:42.659> features

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
as you know a higher-end motherboard but

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120 
as you know a higher-end motherboard but
really<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.450> having<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> locked<00:01:46.140> processor<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
really for having a locked processor and

really<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.729> motherboard<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.360> quite<00:01:51.600> fine<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
really this motherboard is quite fine so

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950 
really this motherboard is quite fine so
for<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> Ramage<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> adata<00:01:53.640> xpg<00:01:53.960> v18

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
for the Ramage is the adata xpg v18

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.530 
for the Ramage is the adata xpg v18
gigabyte<00:01:55.439> ram<00:01:55.740> set<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> dual

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
gigabyte ram set so this is a dual

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.539 
gigabyte ram set so this is a dual
channel<00:01:57.780> ram<00:01:58.049> set<00:01:58.259> by<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.590> data<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> i<00:01:59.280> always

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
channel ram set by a data and i always

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
channel ram set by a data and i always
choose<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.360> ramp<00:02:00.600> set<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.530> i

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
choose this ramp set because one i

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
choose this ramp set because one i
always<00:02:02.219> recommend<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.149> its<00:02:03.299> price<00:02:03.450> point

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
always recommend it for its price point

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.740 
always recommend it for its price point
for<00:02:04.070> $73<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.820> solid<00:02:06.329> Rams<00:02:06.570> have

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
for $73 this is a very solid Rams have

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.059 
for $73 this is a very solid Rams have

also has you know
of<00:02:13.280> course<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.700> gigabytes<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.360> ddr3<00:02:14.900> RAM<00:02:15.380> which

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
of course a gigabytes of ddr3 RAM which

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.500 
of course a gigabytes of ddr3 RAM which
is<00:02:15.980> more<00:02:16.370> than<00:02:16.490> enough<00:02:16.760> for<00:02:16.910> gaming<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
is more than enough for gaming and

is more than enough for gaming and
lastly<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.830> ramp<00:02:19.160> set<00:02:19.340> also<00:02:19.520> runs<00:02:19.820> at<00:02:19.970> 1600

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
lastly this ramp set also runs at 1600

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.970 
lastly this ramp set also runs at 1600
megahertz<00:02:20.750> which<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.320> pretty<00:02:21.410> much<00:02:21.560> standard

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980

the<00:03:34.310> zotac<00:03:34.760> GPU<00:03:35.570> cooler<00:03:35.840> that's<00:03:36.020> all<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.440> and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
the zotac GPU cooler that's all this and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.220 
the zotac GPU cooler that's all this and
really<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.550> is<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.850> very<00:03:38.150> fast<00:03:38.480> graphics<00:03:38.960> card

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
really this is a very fast graphics card

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.050 
really this is a very fast graphics card
for<00:03:39.500> its<00:03:39.590> price<00:03:39.740> point<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.280> really<00:03:40.940> that's

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
for its price point and really that's

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.000 
for its price point and really that's
pretty<00:03:41.240> much<00:03:41.540> what<00:03:41.810> makes<00:03:42.050> this<00:03:42.260> gaming<00:03:42.620> PC

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
pretty much what makes this gaming PC

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.100 
pretty much what makes this gaming PC
very<00:03:43.490> good<00:03:43.730> for<00:03:43.910> 700<00:03:44.450> or<00:03:44.480> lower<00:03:44.630> price<00:03:44.840> point

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
very good for 700 or lower price point

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.200 
very good for 700 or lower price point
so<00:03:45.590> for<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:45.860> case<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.190> chose<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.490> antec<00:03:46.910> one

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
so for the case I chose the antec one

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.840 
so for the case I chose the antec one
ATX<00:03:47.780> mid<00:03:47.990> tower<00:03:48.020> computer<00:03:48.380> case<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.520> this<00:03:49.730> is

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
ATX mid tower computer case so this is

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.910

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
r is a minimum power supply requirement

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.490 
r is a minimum power supply requirement
of<00:04:28.880> 500<00:04:29.880> watts<00:04:30.090> which<00:04:30.389> is<00:04:30.539> good<00:04:30.840> even<00:04:31.050> better
