00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.889 
sure about it but anyway if he does i
can<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.790> him<00:01:59.909> pushing<00:02:00.210> straight<00:02:00.659> into<00:02:00.869> that

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899

straight<00:02:01.829> at<00:02:02.009> centre-back<00:02:02.399> role<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.790> i<00:02:02.850> think

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
straight at centre-back role and i think

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.690 
straight at centre-back role and i think
he<00:02:03.180> will<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.600> good<00:02:03.810> job<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> prem

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
he will do a very good job in the prem

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.389 
he will do a very good job in the prem
second<00:02:05.700> sent<00:02:05.880> back<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.649> gary<00:02:07.649> cahill<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.280> he's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
second sent back is gary cahill now he's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.160 
second sent back is gary cahill now he's
been<00:02:08.550> fantastic<00:02:09.119> since<00:02:09.300> signing<00:02:09.599> for<00:02:09.810> Chelsea

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
been fantastic since signing for Chelsea

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.540 
been fantastic since signing for Chelsea
and<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.379> think<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:10.800> will<00:02:11.009> definitely<00:02:11.400> be

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
and I think he will definitely be
staying<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.510> said<00:02:12.660> about<00:02:12.690> role<00:02:13.050> and

great job for them right back this
season<00:02:26.310> first<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.360> two<00:02:27.390> defensive<00:02:27.930> mid<00:02:28.110> is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
season first of the two defensive mid is

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.470 
season first of the two defensive mid is
at<00:02:28.500> David<00:02:28.860> Luiz<00:02:29.220> now<00:02:29.430> he<00:02:29.490> has<00:02:29.640> had<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> fantastic

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
at David Luiz now he has had a fantastic

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.750 
at David Luiz now he has had a fantastic
year<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.170> them<00:02:31.290> he's<00:02:31.920> been<00:02:32.070> very<00:02:32.280> very<00:02:32.520> good

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
year for them he's been very very good

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.490 
year for them he's been very very good
and<00:02:33.000> he's<00:02:33.330> scored<00:02:33.600> some<00:02:33.690> incredible<00:02:34.260> girls

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
and he's scored some incredible girls

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500 
and he's scored some incredible girls
but<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:35.010> seems<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.340> he<00:02:35.460> plays<00:02:35.670> his<00:02:35.820> best<00:02:35.850> when

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
but it seems that he plays his best when

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.060 
but it seems that he plays his best when
he<00:02:36.600> plays<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.960> defensive<00:02:37.350> mid<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.770> think

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
he plays in defensive mid and I think

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.710 
he plays in defensive mid and I think
that<00:02:38.250> would<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.460> where<00:02:38.820> he<00:02:39.150> will<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.480> playing

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that would be where he will be playing

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.840 
that would be where he will be playing
for<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> majority<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.920> next<00:02:41.430> season<00:02:41.760> now

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
for the majority of next season now

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.250 
for the majority of next season now
obviously<00:02:42.180> he's<00:02:42.300> been<00:02:42.450> incredible<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.990> send

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
obviously he's been incredible to send

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.540 
obviously he's been incredible to send
her<00:02:43.320> back<00:02:43.440> from<00:02:43.650> Brazil<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.520> a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
her back from Brazil but I have a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.010 
her back from Brazil but I have a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.520 
many other people are too many other
strikers<00:04:14.820> other<00:04:15.150> than<00:04:15.300> him<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.570> think<00:04:15.630> he<00:04:16.500> is

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
strikers other than him I think he is

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.860 
strikers other than him I think he is
their<00:04:16.950> main<00:04:17.160> at<00:04:17.400> striking<00:04:17.700> targets<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.480> that's

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
their main at striking targets so that's

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.270 
their main at striking targets so that's
why<00:04:19.019> I've<00:04:19.109> gone<00:04:19.260> for<00:04:19.410> him<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.680> team<00:04:19.919> but

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
why I've gone for him in this team but

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.070 
why I've gone for him in this team but
this<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.549> my<00:04:20.669> predicted<00:04:21.180> starting<00:04:21.660> eleven

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
this is my predicted starting eleven

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.690 
this is my predicted starting eleven
next<00:04:22.350> year<00:04:22.470> I'm<00:04:22.620> sure<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.950> may<00:04:23.130> disagree<00:04:23.460> but

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
next year I'm sure you may disagree but

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.580 
next year I'm sure you may disagree but
let's<00:04:24.660> go<00:04:24.780> on<00:04:24.840> some<00:04:24.960> gameplay<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.440> talk<00:04:25.560> a

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
let's go on some gameplay and talk a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.050 
let's go on some gameplay and talk a
tiny<00:04:25.830> bit<00:04:26.010> more<00:04:26.070> about<00:04:26.460> it

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
tiny bit more about it

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.730 
tiny bit more about it
now<00:04:27.570> as<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.810> mentioned<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:28.230> don't<00:04:28.410> want<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.590> rub

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
now as I mentioned I don't want to rub

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.290 
now as I mentioned I don't want to rub
it<00:04:28.860> on<00:04:28.950> about<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.220> for<00:04:29.520> too<00:04:29.700> much<00:04:29.820> longer<00:04:29.880> but

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
it on about it for too much longer but

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.210 
it on about it for too much longer but
that<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.660> my<00:04:30.840> opinion<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:31.380> what<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.620> style<00:04:31.860> 11

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
that is my opinion of what the style 11

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.830 
that is my opinion of what the style 11
will<00:04:32.370> be<00:04:32.520> as<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:32.880> said<00:04:33.090> guys<00:04:33.210> if<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.540> could<00:04:33.690> put

will be as I said guys if you could put

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.420 
will be as I said guys if you could put
