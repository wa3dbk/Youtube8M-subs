 for you in this tutorial how to change everything 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.050
 your audio and writing is for English in your 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.289

 so it's a very simple step that lots of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.609
 people complain and the Portuguese audio of the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.609
 of all configuration in Portuguese 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.779
 because he was already accustomed to the old 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.579
 English and everything else 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.520
 I eat group brazil they did not release 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.890
 this option to leave everything in English 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.950

 games live flesh from any of these folders 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.000
 so you go in the folder that you 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:07.890
 installed the game and here we will have four 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 folders you are going to stay on this radio rds and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.140
 You will be like this in the place of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.560
 United States English will be 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.189
 Brazilian Portuguese will exchange this pt 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.070
 pr in andrÃ© daniel s 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.070

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.649
 when you do this you will come back 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.829

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.930

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.989
 English setup will continue 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.619
 on the Brazilian server here and you can see 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.290
 that already changed 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.719
 news the law 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.359
 It's already changed everything we are going to give a player to 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:22.620
 see how it all changed in there 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.769
 remembering that for those who want to add 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.629
 to play if you do not have fixed team 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.950
 I 'm always accepting people to play 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.010
 together there because it is difficult if not 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.510
 the team knows the team fidel fidel da casa 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.230
 with an entire game and leaves the middle of the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.799
 match is tense here you can see the player 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.359
 level 22 I'm still starting but everything 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.639
 already in English including the voices of 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.319
 all the characters that for me are a 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:55.560
 of the main reasons for leaving everything 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:57.090
 this in English on my printout or 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.950
 It took a little longer for 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.489
 set things right 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.239
 the same thing here all in English as 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.980
 You can see that you have to know now. 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.989
 to administer this gives in English 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.120
 So if you do not want to, but that 's it. 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.040
 do the same schematic that will put pt 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 underline 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.540
 very simple this is another tutorial yes 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.220
 for you if you liked the measurement 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.150
 let me like it down here to help 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.099

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.959

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.599

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.579
 people asking me questions there 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:39.090
 including making videos on your question 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.430

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.260

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.479
