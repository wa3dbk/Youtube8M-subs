better than the usual WSI models and it

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.180 
better than the usual WSI models and it

movement the truck still rolls of that

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.259 
movement the truck still rolls of that
amount<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.160> steering<00:03:52.550> on<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:52.880> if<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.000> want<00:03:53.180> to

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
amount of steering on but if you want to

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.300 
amount of steering on but if you want to
any<00:03:53.420> tighter<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:54.230> can<00:03:54.260> force<00:03:54.769> it<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:54.980> bit<00:03:55.130> more

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
any tighter you can force it a bit more

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.490 
any tighter you can force it a bit more
but<00:03:55.970> then<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.269> won't<00:03:56.420> roll<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:56.840> that's

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
but then it won't roll and that's

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.900 
but then it won't roll and that's
because<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.950> tires<00:03:58.190> are<00:03:58.340> fouled<00:03:58.610> on<00:03:58.790> the

range of movement the other feature
underneath<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.580> landing<00:04:26.000> legs<00:04:26.180> which

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
underneath is the landing legs which

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.390 
underneath is the landing legs which
lower<00:04:26.630> by<00:04:26.840> unscrewing<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.650> they<00:04:28.190> allow<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
lower by unscrewing and they allow the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.159 
lower by unscrewing and they allow the

there<00:04:31.100> is<00:04:31.220> another<00:04:31.400> small<00:04:31.700> unusual<00:04:32.180> feature

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
there is another small unusual feature

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.670 
there is another small unusual feature
at<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.630> rear<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.050> trailer<00:04:33.260> which<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.650> a

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
at the rear of the trailer which is a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.440 
at the rear of the trailer which is a
cover<00:04:33.950> which<00:04:34.250> folds<00:04:34.610> down<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.000> protects<00:04:35.300> the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
cover which folds down and protects the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.870 
cover which folds down and protects the
lights<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:36.620> this<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.889> presumably<00:04:37.190> used<00:04:37.639> when

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
lights and this is presumably used when

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.140 
lights and this is presumably used when
the<00:04:37.970> trailer<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.300> unloading<00:04:38.810> bulk<00:04:39.050> materials

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
the trailer is unloading bulk materials

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.279 
the trailer is unloading bulk materials
so<00:04:41.150> with<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.419> run<00:04:41.570> fluid<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.960> features

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
so with the run fluid the features

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.170 
so with the run fluid the features
complete<00:04:42.650> we<00:04:42.800> can<00:04:42.950> move<00:04:43.070> on<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.580> join<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:44.030> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
complete we can move on to join up the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.360 
complete we can move on to join up the
tractor<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.539> trailer<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.950> model<00:04:46.220> has

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
tractor and trailer and this model has

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.980 
tractor and trailer and this model has
the<00:04:46.460> usual<00:04:46.610> simple<00:04:47.120> connection<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.750> the

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
the usual simple connection of the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.219 
the usual simple connection of the
kingpin<00:04:48.380> clipping<00:04:48.860> into<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.520> fifth<00:04:49.729> wheel

kingpin clipping into the fifth wheel

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.600 
kingpin clipping into the fifth wheel
once<00:04:51.229> that's<00:04:51.470> done<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.800> connection<00:04:52.039> is<00:04:52.310> solid

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
once that's done the connection is solid

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.190 
once that's done the connection is solid
and<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:52.910> can<00:04:53.060> drive<00:04:53.270> your<00:04:53.479> truck<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:53.870> trailer

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
and you can drive your truck and trailer

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.159 
and you can drive your truck and trailer
all<00:04:54.380> around<00:04:54.710> your<00:04:54.830> tabletop<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:56.720> scaling<00:04:57.110> is

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
all around your tabletop the scaling is

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.719 
all around your tabletop the scaling is
also<00:04:57.410> good<00:04:57.590> because<00:04:57.889> there's<00:04:58.070> no<00:04:58.190> fouling<00:04:58.639> of

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
also good because there's no fouling of

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.430 
also good because there's no fouling of
the<00:04:58.820> tractor<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.270> trailer<00:04:59.330> during<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.200> tight

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
the tractor and trailer during a tight

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.620 
the tractor and trailer during a tight
turn<00:05:00.800> so<00:05:01.669> I've<00:05:01.760> mentioned<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.240> truck<00:05:02.450> has<00:05:02.600> a

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
turn so I've mentioned this truck has a

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.300 
turn so I've mentioned this truck has a
walking<00:05:02.870> floor<00:05:03.229> so<00:05:03.410> how<00:05:03.560> does<00:05:03.620> that<00:05:03.740> work<00:05:04.010> and

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
walking floor so how does that work and

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.100 
walking floor so how does that work and
here<00:05:04.550> no<00:05:04.700> expense<00:05:05.060> is<00:05:05.240> spared<00:05:05.270> by<00:05:05.630> cranes<00:05:05.960> etc

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
here no expense is spared by cranes etc

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.409 
here no expense is spared by cranes etc
to<00:05:06.530> illustrate<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.700> slats<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.210> floor

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
to illustrate the slats on the floor

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.879 
to illustrate the slats on the floor
we'll<00:05:08.720> have<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> small<00:05:09.050> amount<00:05:09.410> of<00:05:09.530> backwards

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
we'll have a small amount of backwards

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.290 
we'll have a small amount of backwards
and<00:05:10.039> forwards<00:05:10.370> movement<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:10.910> when<00:05:11.060> they<00:05:11.180> all

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
and forwards movement and when they all

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.629 
and forwards movement and when they all
move<00:05:11.510> together<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:12.139> load<00:05:12.320> moves<00:05:12.590> forward<00:05:13.039> but

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
move together the load moves forward but

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.520 
move together the load moves forward but
if<00:05:13.789> they<00:05:13.940> are<00:05:14.060> retracted<00:05:14.539> one<00:05:14.870> at<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.050> time<00:05:15.260> then

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
if they are retracted one at a time then

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.589 
if they are retracted one at a time then
the<00:05:15.620> load<00:05:15.800> stays<00:05:16.039> where<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.400> is<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.880> by

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
the load stays where it is and by

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.330 
the load stays where it is and by
repeating<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.139> process<00:05:18.349> any<00:05:18.800> load<00:05:19.039> on<00:05:19.070> the

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
repeating this process any load on the

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.100 
repeating this process any load on the
trailer<00:05:19.490> floor<00:05:19.910> can<00:05:20.120> be<00:05:20.150> inched<00:05:20.539> forwards<00:05:20.960> or

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
trailer floor can be inched forwards or

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.140 
trailer floor can be inched forwards or
backwards<00:05:21.160> it<00:05:22.160> works<00:05:22.430> with<00:05:22.639> pallets<00:05:22.940> like

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
backwards it works with pallets like

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.000 
backwards it works with pallets like
this<00:05:23.300> box<00:05:23.539> but<00:05:23.900> it<00:05:23.990> also<00:05:24.110> works<00:05:24.440> with<00:05:24.710> bulk

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
this box but it also works with bulk

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.400 
this box but it also works with bulk
materials<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:26.479> that<00:05:26.510> means<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:26.930> trailer<00:05:27.169> can

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
materials so that means the trailer can

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.350 
materials so that means the trailer can
tip<00:05:27.620> its<00:05:27.770> load<00:05:27.979> without<00:05:28.190> having<00:05:28.669> to<00:05:28.910> tip<00:05:29.180> up

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
tip its load without having to tip up

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360 
tip its load without having to tip up
the<00:05:29.389> body<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.590> it's<00:05:30.740> very<00:05:30.830> good<00:05:31.070> wherever

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
the body so it's very good wherever

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.550 
the body so it's very good wherever
Headroom<00:05:31.760> is<00:05:31.880> tight<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:32.990> hopefully<00:05:33.260> that

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
Headroom is tight so hopefully that

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.140 
Headroom is tight so hopefully that
illustrates<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.130> principle<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.820> if<00:05:34.940> we<00:05:35.030> look

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
illustrates the principle and if we look

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.670 
illustrates the principle and if we look
again<00:05:35.360> inside<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.720> model<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.260> can<00:05:36.380> see<00:05:36.530> the

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
again inside the model you can see the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.400 
again inside the model you can see the
slats<00:05:37.300> anyway<00:05:38.300> after<00:05:38.570> that<00:05:38.599> tutorial<00:05:39.260> what

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
slats anyway after that tutorial what

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.800 
slats anyway after that tutorial what
the<00:05:39.500> hell's<00:05:39.710> going<00:05:40.039> on<00:05:40.160> here<00:05:40.720> surely<00:05:41.720> the

the hell's going on here surely the

the hell's going on here surely the
