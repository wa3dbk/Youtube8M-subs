such as YouTube audio using audacity

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.160 
such as YouTube audio using audacity
first<00:00:09.000> thing<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.269> need<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.929> download

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
first thing we need to do is download

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.140 
first thing we need to do is download
audacity<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.940> at

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
audacity and we can do that at

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.609 
audacity and we can do that at
audacity.sourceforge.net<00:00:14.570> slash<00:00:15.619> download

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
audacity.sourceforge.net slash download

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.890 
audacity.sourceforge.net slash download
and<00:00:17.430> then<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.730> need<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.910> start<00:00:18.359> loading<00:00:18.570> our

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
and then we need to start loading our

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.779 
and then we need to start loading our
video<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.740> want<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.010> pause<00:00:20.279> it

video we want to pause it

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.840 
video we want to pause it
so<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.230> fully<00:00:22.590> load<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.670> can

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so that it can fully load and we can

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
so that it can fully load and we can
play<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.359> without<00:00:24.810> any<00:00:25.289> buffering<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.920> want

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
play it without any buffering you want

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.390 
play it without any buffering you want
to<00:00:26.250> see<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.580> red<00:00:26.820> bar<00:00:27.090> completely<00:00:27.930> filled<00:00:28.650> up

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
to see that red bar completely filled up

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
to see that red bar completely filled up
well<00:00:30.210> that's<00:00:30.449> buffering<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.349> go<00:00:31.500> into

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
well that's buffering we can go into

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.970 
well that's buffering we can go into
audacity<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.759> make<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.420> changes<00:00:33.960> there<00:00:34.260> we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
audacity and make some changes there we

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.760 
audacity and make some changes there we
have<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> view<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.500> float

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
have to go to view and we have to float

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.400 
have to go to view and we have to float
the<00:00:38.010> mixer<00:00:38.370> toolbar<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> make<00:00:39.960> sure<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.350> our

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.959 
input is set to wave out mix this will
mean<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.290> wheel<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:43.770> capture<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.940> output

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
mean that wheel will capture the output

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.319 
mean that wheel will capture the output
