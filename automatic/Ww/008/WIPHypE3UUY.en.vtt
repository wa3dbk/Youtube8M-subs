people<00:01:57.200> were<00:01:57.470> complaining<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.310> beta<00:01:58.520> for

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
people were complaining in the beta for

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.000 
people were complaining in the beta for
hardline<00:01:59.180> how<00:01:59.540> it<00:01:59.690> was<00:01:59.780> buggy<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.620> looked

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
hardline how it was buggy it looked

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.399 
hardline how it was buggy it looked
identical<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.760> battlefield<00:02:02.420> 4<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:02.990> they<00:02:03.350> were

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
identical to battlefield 4 and they were

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.440 
identical to battlefield 4 and they were
just<00:02:03.500> bad-mouthing<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.730> way<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.880> look<00:02:05.330> at

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
just bad-mouthing it the way I look at

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.240 
just bad-mouthing it the way I look at
this<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.840> doing<00:02:06.170> something<00:02:06.500> different<00:02:06.920> yes<00:02:07.100> I

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
this is doing something different yes I

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.009 
this is doing something different yes I
know<00:02:07.310> we're<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:07.730> not<00:02:08.119> used<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.509> seeing<00:02:08.780> cops

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
know we're all not used to seeing cops

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.080 
know we're all not used to seeing cops
and<00:02:09.259> robbers<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.800> battlefield<00:02:10.159> game<00:02:10.550> but<00:02:11.060> I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
and robbers in a battlefield game but I

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.580 
and robbers in a battlefield game but I
honestly<00:02:11.510> think<00:02:11.659> we<00:02:11.840> should<00:02:12.019> give<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.260> another

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
honestly think we should give it another

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.130 
honestly think we should give it another
try<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.280> look<00:02:13.700> at<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:13.879> in<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.209> positive<00:02:14.420> mindset

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
try and look at it in a positive mindset

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140 
try and look at it in a positive mindset
the<00:02:15.500> sigh<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.890> relief<00:02:16.250> was<00:02:16.519> that<00:02:16.670> hard<00:02:16.940> line

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
the sigh of relief was that hard line

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.699 
the sigh of relief was that hard line
was<00:02:17.360> actually<00:02:17.720> pushed<00:02:17.989> all<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.290> way<00:02:18.409> till

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
was actually pushed all the way till

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.800 
was actually pushed all the way till
2015<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:19.790> did<00:02:20.090> not<00:02:20.239> want<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.659> the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
2015 now I did not want to see the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.869 
2015 now I did not want to see the
battlefield<00:02:21.260> series<00:02:21.439> become<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.010> yearly<00:02:22.519> game

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
battlefield series become a yearly game

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.250 
battlefield series become a yearly game
then<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.299> would<00:02:23.420> just<00:02:23.569> be<00:02:23.749> a<00:02:23.780> straight-up

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
then it would just be a straight-up

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.530 
then it would just be a straight-up
competition<00:02:25.010> for<00:02:25.219> call<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.400> duty<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.939> would<00:02:26.209> see

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
competition for call of duty I would see

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.509 
competition for call of duty I would see
franchise<00:02:27.049> collapsing<00:02:27.739> if<00:02:27.890> they<00:02:28.010> ever<00:02:28.189> made<00:02:28.489> a

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
franchise collapsing if they ever made a

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.309 
franchise collapsing if they ever made a
move<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.450> I'm<00:02:29.510> glad<00:02:29.689> they<00:02:29.989> did<00:02:30.170> it

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
move like that and I'm glad they did it

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.080 
move like that and I'm glad they did it
with<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.769> delay<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.219> hardline<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.909> might

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
with the delay of hardline this might

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.640 
with the delay of hardline this might
actually<00:02:32.269> bring<00:02:32.719> back<00:02:32.959> some<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.379> players

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
actually bring back some of the players

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.039 
actually bring back some of the players
that<00:02:33.829> quit<00:02:34.250> battlefield<00:02:34.760> 4<00:02:35.060> now<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.540> think<00:02:35.900> that

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
that quit battlefield 4 now I think that

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.929 
that quit battlefield 4 now I think that
hardline<00:02:36.469> can<00:02:36.680> actually<00:02:37.040> save<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.489> franchise

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
hardline can actually save the franchise

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.759 
hardline can actually save the franchise
for<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.269> couple<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:38.750> reasons<00:02:38.959> number<00:02:39.590> one

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
for a couple of reasons number one

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.009 
for a couple of reasons number one
hardline<00:02:40.489> has<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> total<00:02:41.180> new<00:02:41.329> concept<00:02:41.870> than

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
hardline has a total new concept than

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.869 
hardline has a total new concept than
any<00:02:42.230> other<00:02:42.469> battlefield<00:02:43.069> we<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.370> ever<00:02:43.519> seen

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
any other battlefield we have ever seen

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.240 
any other battlefield we have ever seen
number<00:02:44.480> two<00:02:44.689> delaying<00:02:45.140> hardline<00:02:45.650> makes<00:02:45.980> EA

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
number two delaying hardline makes EA

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.460 
number two delaying hardline makes EA
and<00:02:46.579> visceral<00:02:47.030> look<00:02:47.239> really<00:02:47.659> good<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.079> shows

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
and visceral look really good it shows

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.929 
and visceral look really good it shows
that<00:02:48.620> they<00:02:48.739> acknowledge<00:02:49.280> what<00:02:49.430> happened<00:02:49.819> in

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
that they acknowledge what happened in

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.970 
that they acknowledge what happened in
battlefield<00:02:50.420> 4<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.900> hopefully<00:02:51.290> won't<00:02:51.769> happen

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
battlefield 4 and hopefully won't happen

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.160 
battlefield 4 and hopefully won't happen
again<00:02:52.250> number<00:02:53.000> three<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.420> might<00:02:53.599> bring<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.930> lot

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
again number three it might bring a lot

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.599 
again number three it might bring a lot
of<00:02:54.349> new<00:02:54.500> people<00:02:54.889> to<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.159> Battlefield
