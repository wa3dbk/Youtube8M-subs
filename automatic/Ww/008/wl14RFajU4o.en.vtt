00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
think of being a teenager and going to a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.240 
think of being a teenager and going to a
dance<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.680> getting<00:02:51.890> rejected

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
dance like that and getting rejected

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.100 
dance like that and getting rejected
like<00:02:52.760> that's<00:02:53.030> because<00:02:53.660> you're<00:02:53.780> not<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.049> a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
like that's because you're not in a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.199 
like that's because you're not in a
couple<00:02:54.290> I'm<00:02:54.709> sure<00:02:54.920> their<00:02:55.190> methodology<00:02:56.060> your

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
couple I'm sure their methodology your

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.670 
couple I'm sure their methodology your
idea<00:02:56.510> behind<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.079> oh<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.500> want<00:02:57.650> to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
idea behind it is oh we want to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.470 
idea behind it is oh we want to
encourage<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.190> kids<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.459> go<00:02:58.670> as<00:02:58.850> pairs<00:02:59.150> or

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
encourage the kids to go as pairs or

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.819 
encourage the kids to go as pairs or
else<00:02:59.569> they<00:02:59.720> won't<00:02:59.870> or<00:03:00.139> something<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:00.680> it's

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
else they won't or something but it's

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.490 
else they won't or something but it's
ridiculous<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.609> it's<00:03:02.060> horrible<00:03:02.600> maybe<00:03:03.049> if<00:03:03.260> we

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
ridiculous and it's horrible maybe if we

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.690 
ridiculous and it's horrible maybe if we
let<00:03:03.709> singles<00:03:04.160> go<00:03:04.370> they'll<00:03:05.000> find<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.510> pair<00:03:06.700> you

let singles go they'll find a pair you
know<00:03:07.760> or<00:03:08.000> maybe<00:03:08.150> being<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.510> single<00:03:08.750> is

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989
