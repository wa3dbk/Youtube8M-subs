00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
darkening helmet basically looked on

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.259 
darkening helmet basically looked on
their<00:00:18.619> website<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:19.449> I<00:00:21.070> already<00:00:22.070> had<00:00:22.400> a<00:00:22.429> normal

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
their website and I already had a normal

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.899 
their website and I already had a normal
Jackson<00:00:23.929> helmet<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:24.439> really<00:00:25.189> liked<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.640> the

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:25.909 
Jackson helmet and really liked the the

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.279 
Jackson helmet and really liked the the
way<00:00:25.999> the<00:00:26.149> helmet<00:00:26.419> was<00:00:26.509> shaped<00:00:26.749> and<00:00:26.929> everything

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
way the helmet was shaped and everything

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.069 
way the helmet was shaped and everything
but<00:00:29.319> that's<00:00:30.319> pretty<00:00:30.679> much<00:00:30.829> it<00:00:31.960> from<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
but that's pretty much it from the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.279 
but that's pretty much it from the
outside<00:00:33.500> it's<00:00:33.800> as<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.219> can<00:00:34.370> see<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:35.289> it's

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
outside it's as you can see it's it's

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.490 
outside it's as you can see it's it's
the<00:00:36.469> shiny<00:00:36.769> black<00:00:37.100> it's<00:00:37.489> got<00:00:37.670> their<00:00:37.940> new<00:00:38.500> 370

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
the shiny black it's got their new 370

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.740 
the shiny black it's got their new 370
head<00:00:39.649> gear<00:00:39.920> which<00:00:40.129> actually<00:00:40.629> works<00:00:41.629> pretty

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
head gear which actually works pretty

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.250 
head gear which actually works pretty
well

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
well

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.060 
well
I<00:00:42.500> really<00:00:42.859> like<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:43.219> dial<00:00:43.519> on<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.789> works<00:00:44.300> good

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
I really like this dial on it works good

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.959 
I really like this dial on it works good
it's<00:00:46.070> easy<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.399> flip<00:00:46.609> down<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.089> everything

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
it's easy to flip down and everything

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.060 
it's easy to flip down and everything
basically<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.359> guess<00:00:54.260> what<00:00:54.499> they're<00:00:54.679> kind

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
basically this I guess what they're kind

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.649 
basically this I guess what they're kind
of<00:00:55.190> claiming<00:00:55.640> is<00:00:55.789> that<00:00:56.620> this<00:00:57.620> view<00:00:58.070> on<00:00:58.510> here<00:00:59.510> is

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
of claiming is that this view on here is

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.970 
of claiming is that this view on here is
I<00:00:59.870> think<00:01:00.230> one<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.530> biggest<00:01:00.710> in<00:01:00.949> the

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
I think one of the biggest in the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.610 
I think one of the biggest in the
industry<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.850> their<00:01:02.260> biggest<00:01:03.260> and

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
industry but this is their biggest and

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.980 
industry but this is their biggest and
baddest<00:01:03.920> one<00:01:04.070> they<00:01:04.250> make<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.480> best<00:01:05.660> one<00:01:05.960> I

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
baddest one they make the best one I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.750 
baddest one they make the best one I
think<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.830> they<00:01:07.010> have<00:01:07.160> on<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.370> market<00:01:07.670> right

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
think that they have on the market right

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.870 
think that they have on the market right
now<00:01:07.820> but<00:01:08.470> as<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.830> see<00:01:09.890> it's<00:01:10.190> got<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.580> four

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
now but as you can see it's got the four

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.970 
now but as you can see it's got the four
sensors<00:01:11.860> one<00:01:12.860> on<00:01:13.010> each<00:01:13.130> corner<00:01:13.520> which<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.420> a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
sensors one on each corner which is a

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.150 
sensors one on each corner which is a
really<00:01:15.980> good<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:17.560> it's<00:01:18.560> got<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:20.680> solar<00:01:21.680> panel

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
really good and it's got the solar panel

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.520 
really good and it's got the solar panel
down<00:01:22.310> there<00:01:24.790> it's<00:01:25.790> got<00:01:26.090> um<00:01:26.330> here's<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.170> inside

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
down there it's got um here's the inside

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.450 
down there it's got um here's the inside
which<00:01:27.830> has<00:01:28.160> all<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.180> controls<00:01:29.600> as<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:31.280> can

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
which has all the controls as you can

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.730 
which has all the controls as you can
see<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.840> grind<00:01:33.170> mode<00:01:33.740> torch<00:01:34.250> mode<00:01:34.550> weld<00:01:35.060> mode

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
see the grind mode torch mode weld mode

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.340 
see the grind mode torch mode weld mode
tells<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.190> battery<00:01:38.150> strength<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:40.340> shade

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
tells you the battery strength the shade

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.850 
tells you the battery strength the shade
sensitivity<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.570> delay<00:01:46.900> it's<00:01:47.900> just<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.500> really

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
sensitivity and delay it's just a really

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.040 
sensitivity and delay it's just a really
nice<00:01:49.160> comet<00:01:49.910> I<00:01:50.030> mean<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:50.330> really<00:01:50.720> really

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
nice comet I mean it's really really

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.960 
nice comet I mean it's really really
nice<00:01:51.310> really<00:01:52.310> liked<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:52.910> what's<00:01:53.240> cool<00:01:53.540> is

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
nice really liked it and what's cool is

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.290 
nice really liked it and what's cool is
this<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.790> actual<00:01:59.210> element<00:01:59.870> in<00:02:00.020> here<00:02:00.940> pops<00:02:01.940> out

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
this the actual element in here pops out

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.960 
this the actual element in here pops out
just<00:02:03.640> by

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
just by

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.859 
just by
clicking<00:02:06.570> these<00:02:06.750> two<00:02:07.080> little<00:02:08.090> things<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
clicking these two little things and you

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.420 
clicking these two little things and you
can<00:02:09.990> pull<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.320> right<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:14.070> from

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
can pull it right out and I think from

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.980 
can pull it right out and I think from
what<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.670> looks<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:18.300> pretty

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
what it looks like is that it pretty

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.940 
what it looks like is that it pretty
much<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.010> standard<00:02:21.380> Jackson<00:02:22.380> equipment

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
much is the standard Jackson equipment

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.320 
much is the standard Jackson equipment
for<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> helmet<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.210> there's<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.770> piece

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
for the helmet but there's the the piece

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.630 
for the helmet but there's the the piece
the<00:02:27.330> actual<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.740> what<00:02:28.920> all<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> money

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the actual this is what all the money

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.660 
the actual this is what all the money
goes<00:02:30.090> into<00:02:30.420> right<00:02:30.630> here<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.290> then<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.490> can

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
goes into right here and then you can

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.000 
goes into right here and then you can
see<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> actual<00:02:34.340> helmet<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.260> what<00:02:37.980> a
