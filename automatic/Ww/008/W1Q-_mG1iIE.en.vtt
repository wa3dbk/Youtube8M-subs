00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739

yeah maybe coaching after school etc I

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.350 
yeah maybe coaching after school etc I
think<00:03:46.500> baked<00:03:46.830> goods<00:03:47.070> are<00:03:47.190> great<00:03:47.430> because<00:03:47.610> it's

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
think baked goods are great because it's

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.820 
think baked goods are great because it's
something<00:03:48.720> you've<00:03:48.989> done<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:49.680> something

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
something you've done and it's something

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
that's consumable exact you actually put

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.210 
that's consumable exact you actually put
time<00:03:51.870> into<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.230> rather<00:03:52.470> than<00:03:52.739> just<00:03:52.920> going<00:03:53.100> to

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
time into it rather than just going to
