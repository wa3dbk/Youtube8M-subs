you

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300

so throughout the verses you'd only be
playing<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.950> minor<00:01:49.250> C<00:01:49.730> and<00:01:50.000> D<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.720> strumming

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
pattern picking pattern I want to look

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.880 
pattern picking pattern I want to look
at<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:54.110> let's<00:01:54.170> go<00:01:54.350> through<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.650> one<00:01:54.710> more

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
it's just like that very very simple you

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.230 
it's just like that very very simple you
get<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.320> hang<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.650> just<00:03:23.950> don't<00:03:24.210> go<00:03:25.210> crazy

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.790 

same<00:04:08.380> pattern<00:04:08.590> all<00:04:09.250> courses<00:04:10.260> now<00:04:11.260> at<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.740> very

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
same pattern all courses now at the very

same pattern all courses now at the very
last<00:04:12.250> line<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:13.060> chorus<00:04:14.069> you'll<00:04:15.069> be

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
last line of the chorus you'll be

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.690 
last line of the chorus you'll be
playing<00:04:15.520> AG<00:04:15.989> do<00:04:16.989> not<00:04:17.230> transition<00:04:17.920> over<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.190> ad

playing AG do not transition over to ad

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.690 
playing AG do not transition over to ad
go<00:04:19.120> back<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.780> minor<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.380> do<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.310> picking

go back to a minor and do that picking

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.129 
go back to a minor and do that picking
pattern<00:04:22.030> for<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.240> verses<00:04:22.570> again

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.050 

so<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.470> end<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.740> chorus<00:04:27.070> would<00:04:27.190> be<00:04:27.400> like

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
so the end of the chorus would be like

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.580 
so the end of the chorus would be like
this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590

you

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.170 

so<00:04:48.710> let's<00:04:48.860> go<00:04:49.040> through<00:04:49.370> this<00:04:49.460> one<00:04:49.520> more<00:04:49.880> time

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
so let's go through this one more time

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.070 
so let's go through this one more time
so<00:04:51.110> that<00:04:51.230> way<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.410> know<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.620> have<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:51.890> grasp<00:04:52.130> on
