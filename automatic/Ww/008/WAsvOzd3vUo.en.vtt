rest about a hundred eighty pounds in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.679 
rest about a hundred eighty pounds in
yeah<00:01:45.780> right<00:01:45.899> okay<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.100> how<00:01:47.970> many<00:01:48.030> total<00:01:48.390> pounds

yeah right okay so how many total pounds

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
yeah right okay so how many total pounds
of<00:01:48.840> nitrogen<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.680> out<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.250> 300

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
of nitrogen do we have out on this 300

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
of nitrogen do we have out on this 300
whistle<00:01:50.790> challenge<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.479> pre<00:01:51.689> plant<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> gross

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
whistle challenge we pre plant and gross

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
whistle challenge we pre plant and gross
gross<00:01:53.159> starter<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> side<00:01:54.149> dress<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.600> we're

gross starter and side dress so we're

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.520 
gross starter and side dress so we're
right

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
right

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.320 
right
okay<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.980> as<00:01:57.160> we<00:01:57.310> walk<00:01:57.610> out<00:01:57.790> into<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.120> field

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
okay and as we walk out into the field

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.060 
okay and as we walk out into the field
we've<00:01:58.750> got<00:01:58.930> summin<00:01:59.230> areas<00:01:59.440> where<00:01:59.650> we're

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
we've got summin areas where we're

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.710 
we've got summin areas where we're
showing<00:02:00.280> some<00:02:00.520> nitrogen<00:02:00.820> deficiency<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
showing some nitrogen deficiency and

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.660 
showing some nitrogen deficiency and
that's<00:02:02.380> due<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.920> all<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.130> rainfall<00:02:03.490> that

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
that's due to all the rainfall that

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.190 
that's due to all the rainfall that
we've<00:02:03.820> had<00:02:03.940> this<00:02:04.180> year<00:02:04.240> what<00:02:04.990> do<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.110> think

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
we've had this year what do you think

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.470 
we've had this year what do you think
you've<00:02:05.530> had<00:02:05.560> total<00:02:06.280> rainfall<00:02:06.520> wise<00:02:07.030> since

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
you've had total rainfall wise since

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.080 
you've had total rainfall wise since
corn<00:02:07.960> plant<00:02:08.229> since<00:02:08.860> June<00:02:09.190> first<00:02:09.430> we've<00:02:09.640> had<00:02:09.790> 10

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
corn plant since June first we've had 10

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.350 
corn plant since June first we've had 10
inches<00:02:10.590> okay<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.980> then<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.430> when<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.120> thinking

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
inches okay and then a when you thinking

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930 
inches okay and then a when you thinking
they<00:02:13.600> had<00:02:13.630> five<00:02:13.990> inches<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.470> may<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.250> not<00:02:15.790> quite

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
they had five inches of may so not quite

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.730 
they had five inches of may so not quite
20<00:02:16.300> inches<00:02:16.540> arranged<00:02:16.840> asunder<00:02:17.200> we've<00:02:17.470> been<00:02:17.620> in

20 inches arranged asunder we've been in

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.740 
20 inches arranged asunder we've been in
many<00:02:17.830> areas<00:02:18.130> where<00:02:18.430> we've<00:02:18.610> been<00:02:18.760> over<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.030> 20

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
many areas where we've been over that 20

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.990 
many areas where we've been over that 20
years<00:02:19.780> range<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.950> that's<00:02:21.430> definitely<00:02:21.790> left

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
years range but that's definitely left

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.370 
years range but that's definitely left
with<00:02:22.120> some<00:02:22.240> nitrogen<00:02:22.540> issues<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.200> field

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
with some nitrogen issues out the field

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.840 
with some nitrogen issues out the field
it's<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.740> be<00:02:23.830> very<00:02:23.980> interesting<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.670> see

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
it's going to be very interesting to see

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's going to be very interesting to see
if<00:02:25.000> we've<00:02:25.150> got<00:02:25.180> enough<00:02:25.570> nitrogen<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.680> get<00:02:26.830> us

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
if we've got enough nitrogen to get us

across my whole area right now we're

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.800 
across my whole area right now we're
seeing<00:02:42.100> probably<00:02:42.580> anywhere<00:02:42.940> thirty<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.540> forty

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
seeing probably anywhere thirty to forty

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.860 
seeing probably anywhere thirty to forty
percent<00:02:44.110> in<00:02:44.350> very<00:02:44.830> poor<00:02:45.130> conditions<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.880> lot<00:02:46.840> of

percent in very poor conditions a lot of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.740 
percent in very poor conditions a lot of
water<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.470> setting<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.070> lot<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.610> yellow<00:02:49.330> stomach

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
water so setting a lot of yellow stomach

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.250 
water so setting a lot of yellow stomach
plants<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:51.209> probably<00:02:52.209> in<00:02:52.360> my<00:02:52.690> whole<00:02:52.900> district

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
plants and probably in my whole district

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.199 
plants and probably in my whole district
as<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.410> whole<00:02:53.740> we're<00:02:54.130> seeing<00:02:54.340> maybe<00:02:54.580> ten<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
as a whole we're seeing maybe ten to

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.030 
as a whole we're seeing maybe ten to
fifteen<00:02:55.540> percent<00:02:55.840> that's<00:02:56.020> up<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.830> I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
fifteen percent that's up in that I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.850 
fifteen percent that's up in that I
guess<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.520> degraded<00:02:57.940> as<00:02:58.060> good<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.510> excellent

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
guess you degraded as good to excellent

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.990 
guess you degraded as good to excellent
but<00:02:59.860> then<00:02:59.980> again<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.280> still<00:03:00.550> got<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.820> water

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
but then again you still got the water

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.180 
but then again you still got the water
spots<00:03:01.300> out<00:03:01.480> on<00:03:01.630> fields<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.530> no<00:03:02.709> one<00:03:02.860> can<00:03:02.980> see

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.540 
spots out on fields that no one can see
and<00:03:03.459> all<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.910> corns<00:03:04.209> gone<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.660> mean<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:06.370> just

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
and all that corns gone I mean it's just

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.830 
and all that corns gone I mean it's just
one<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.760> those<00:03:06.880> things<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.450> water<00:03:07.630> never

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
one of those things that the water never

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.050 
one of those things that the water never
could<00:03:08.050> get<00:03:08.140> away<00:03:08.260> it's<00:03:08.739> just<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.430> corn<00:03:09.670> didn't

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
could get away it's just the corn didn't

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.390 
could get away it's just the corn didn't
have<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.269> oxygen<00:03:10.720> it's<00:03:11.320> dying<00:03:11.560> be<00:03:12.040> sure<00:03:12.250> to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
have the oxygen it's dying be sure to

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.729 
have the oxygen it's dying be sure to
check<00:03:12.580> back<00:03:12.610> in<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.090> us<00:03:13.150> next<00:03:13.450> month<00:03:13.780> we'll
