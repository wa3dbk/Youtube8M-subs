point we may get the to call denim who

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.170 
point we may get the to call denim who
made<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.650> water<00:03:56.799> facts<00:03:57.129> that's<00:03:57.489> Italian

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
made the water facts that's Italian

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.199 
made the water facts that's Italian
we<00:03:59.049> kind<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.319> want<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.530> do<00:03:59.709> like<00:03:59.920> a<00:04:00.430> water

Dandy's added in the gray along with the
white<00:04:06.909> which<00:04:07.750> was<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.049> steps<00:04:08.379> we<00:04:08.590> were<00:04:08.769> gonna

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
white which was the steps we were gonna

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.259 
white which was the steps we were gonna
continue<00:04:10.060> here<00:04:10.629> so<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:12.760> looking<00:04:13.030> pretty

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269

ledges have a nice white all the way

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.580 
ledges have a nice white all the way
along<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:25.180> starting<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.139> look<00:04:26.430> stony<00:04:27.430> stony

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
along and starting to look stony stony

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.990 
along and starting to look stony stony
stony<00:04:30.630> here's<00:04:31.630> another<00:04:32.220> fellow<00:04:33.220> like<00:04:33.789> that

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
stony here's another fellow like that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.670 
stony here's another fellow like that
though<00:04:34.180> they<00:04:34.360> will<00:04:34.570> have<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.870> Devlin<00:04:35.289> mud<00:04:35.440> wash

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
though they will have a Devlin mud wash

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.219 
though they will have a Devlin mud wash
so<00:04:36.370> I'm<00:04:36.430> gonna<00:04:36.520> be<00:04:36.729> quite<00:04:37.030> more<00:04:37.510> muddy<00:04:37.930> looking

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
so I'm gonna be quite more muddy looking

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.930 
so I'm gonna be quite more muddy looking
yeah<00:04:38.950> because<00:04:39.190> we<00:04:39.340> don't<00:04:39.490> want<00:04:39.639> them<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.820> look

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
yeah because we don't want them to look

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.850 
yeah because we don't want them to look
like<00:04:40.000> they<00:04:40.240> sit<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:40.840> there<00:04:41.020> for<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.260> few<00:04:41.320> days<00:04:41.500> we

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
like they sit in there for a few days we

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.839 
like they sit in there for a few days we
want<00:04:41.979> them<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.190> look<00:04:42.340> like<00:04:42.550> they've<00:04:42.700> been

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
want them to look like they've been

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.210 
want them to look like they've been
there<00:04:42.970> for<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> while<00:04:43.440> especially<00:04:44.440> throwing<00:04:45.099> in

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
there for a while especially throwing in

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.129 
there for a while especially throwing in
the<00:04:45.340> brown<00:04:45.580> color<00:04:46.090> with<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.599> green<00:04:46.840> it'll

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
the brown color with the green it'll

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.670 
the brown color with the green it'll
probably<00:04:47.500> make<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.280> pop<00:04:48.460> out<00:04:48.639> okay<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.210> as<00:04:50.110> you

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
probably make it pop out okay so as you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.830 
probably make it pop out okay so as you
can<00:04:50.889> see<00:04:51.099> we<00:04:51.340> put<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.789> grass<00:04:52.030> on<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:54.840> it's

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
can see we put the grass on and it's

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.279 
can see we put the grass on and it's
looking<00:04:56.410> good<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.889> mean<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:58.690> can't<00:04:58.960> complain

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
it kind of looks a little better even

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.659 
it kind of looks a little better even
over<00:05:10.750> here<00:05:10.870> we<00:05:10.960> had<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.110> little<00:05:11.199> patch<00:05:11.669> all

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
over here we had a little patch all

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:13.770 
over here we had a little patch all
right<00:05:12.820> so<00:05:12.940> we're<00:05:13.060> gonna<00:05:13.150> do<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> other<00:05:13.449> three

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.700 
right so we're gonna do the other three
the<00:05:14.260> other<00:05:14.380> two<00:05:14.590> pieces<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:15.250> then<00:05:16.680> those<00:05:17.680> will

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
the other two pieces and then those will

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.650 
the other two pieces and then those will
be<00:05:17.979> the<00:05:18.010> three<00:05:18.250> pieces<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.729> we<00:05:18.940> put<00:05:19.389> in<00:05:19.510> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
be the three pieces that we put in the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.350 
be the three pieces that we put in the
film<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.110> then<00:05:20.229> afterwards<00:05:20.860> we'll<00:05:21.270> put<00:05:22.270> them

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
film and then afterwards we'll put them

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.439 
film and then afterwards we'll put them
all<00:05:22.510> together<00:05:22.690> all<00:05:23.380> six<00:05:23.770> so<00:05:24.220> we<00:05:24.400> left<00:05:24.610> little

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
all together all six so we left little

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.860 
all together all six so we left little
spaces<00:05:25.840> for<00:05:26.349> our<00:05:26.380> other<00:05:26.620> light<00:05:26.949> green<00:05:27.340> and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
spaces for our other light green and

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.770 
spaces for our other light green and
then<00:05:28.870> once<00:05:29.650> we<00:05:29.830> don't<00:05:30.130> dump<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:30.909> off<00:05:31.150> then<00:05:31.570> we

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
then once we don't dump this off then we

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.719 
then once we don't dump this off then we
put<00:05:32.080> the

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
put the

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.899 
put the
the<00:05:33.659> lighter<00:05:34.199> green<00:05:34.499> here<00:05:34.800> it's<00:05:35.550> on<00:05:35.639> to

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.070 
the lighter green here it's on to
another<00:05:36.060> spot<00:05:36.389> so<00:05:36.539> we're<00:05:36.659> gonna<00:05:36.749> dump<00:05:36.960> it

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
another spot so we're gonna dump it

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.559 
another spot so we're gonna dump it
right<00:05:37.110> okay<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.900> finished<00:05:40.379> product

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
right okay so the finished product

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.360 
right okay so the finished product
except<00:05:42.569> for<00:05:42.810> there's<00:05:43.289> one<00:05:43.560> small<00:05:43.770> step<00:05:44.189> we

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
except for there's one small step we

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.899 
except for there's one small step we
didn't<00:05:44.580> do<00:05:44.699> yet<00:05:44.939> it's<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:47.430> step<00:05:47.699> where<00:05:47.879> we

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
didn't do yet it's the step where we

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.950 
didn't do yet it's the step where we
have<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.150> just<00:05:48.300> put<00:05:48.509> a<00:05:49.169> brown<00:05:50.099> wash<00:05:50.460> in<00:05:50.699> here
