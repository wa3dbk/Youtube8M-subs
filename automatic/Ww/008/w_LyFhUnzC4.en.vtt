we<00:00:13.570> start<00:00:14.350> the<00:00:14.530> concept<00:00:15.010> of<00:00:15.129> coming<00:00:15.789> up<00:00:15.820> with

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
we start the concept of coming up with

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.450 
we start the concept of coming up with
an<00:00:16.030> idea<00:00:16.090> for<00:00:16.390> a<00:00:16.600> new<00:00:16.690> car<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:18.100> probably<00:00:18.369> the

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
an idea for a new car it's probably the

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.790 
an idea for a new car it's probably the
funnest<00:00:18.670> part<00:00:19.660> of<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:19.869> whole<00:00:19.990> process<00:00:20.260> the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
funnest part of the whole process the

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.429 
funnest part of the whole process the
radical<00:00:21.430> ideas<00:00:21.910> are<00:00:22.210> thrown<00:00:22.750> in<00:00:22.960> so<00:00:23.230> that<00:00:23.349> you

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
radical ideas are thrown in so that you

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.720 
radical ideas are thrown in so that you
can<00:00:23.560> start<00:00:23.650> thinking<00:00:24.130> where<00:00:24.580> is<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.820> limit

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
can start thinking where is the limit

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730 
can start thinking where is the limit

how<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.020> simulate<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.220> physics<00:01:07.610> we<00:01:08.000> are

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
how we simulate the physics we are

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.020 
how we simulate the physics we are
happening<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:08.600> car<00:01:08.960> in<00:01:09.440> our<00:01:09.770> game<00:01:10.030> the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
happening in that car in our game the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.510 
happening in that car in our game the
hybrid<00:01:11.390> nature<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:12.050> it<00:01:12.200> how<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.800> suspensions

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
hybrid nature of it how the suspensions

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.220 
hybrid nature of it how the suspensions
architected<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.750> actually<00:01:14.990> has<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.140> be

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
architected that actually has to be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.600 
architected that actually has to be
reproduced<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.010> game<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:16.370> that's<00:01:16.460> a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
reproduced in the game and that's a

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.020 
reproduced in the game and that's a
really<00:01:17.120> interesting<00:01:17.290> challenge

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.330 

the<00:01:26.360> combination<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:27.140> being<00:01:27.409> able<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.830> make<00:01:28.190> an

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
the combination of being able to make an

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.890 
the combination of being able to make an
object<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.760> works<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:29.479> well<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.869> a

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
object that works so well is a

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.830 
object that works so well is a
combination<00:01:30.409> of<00:01:30.500> art<00:01:31.330> nature<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.630> science

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
combination of art nature and science

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.090 
combination of art nature and science
where<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.290> can<00:01:33.409> get<00:01:33.500> something<00:01:33.680> looking

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
where you can get something looking

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.010 
where you can get something looking
beautiful<00:01:34.310> performing<00:01:35.240> beautiful<00:01:35.750> and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
beautiful performing beautiful and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.960 
beautiful performing beautiful and
finding<00:01:36.770> out<00:01:36.860> how<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.130> actually<00:01:37.430> make<00:01:37.549> it<00:01:37.759> work

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
finding out how to actually make it work

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.840 
finding out how to actually make it work
with<00:01:38.509> cars<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.200> McLaren<00:01:39.619> p1<00:01:39.830> it's<00:01:40.670> not

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
with cars like the McLaren p1 it's not

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.430 
with cars like the McLaren p1 it's not
just<00:01:40.909> about<00:01:41.180> top<00:01:41.509> speed<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:42.020> fact<00:01:42.229> it's<00:01:42.380> more

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
just about top speed in fact it's more

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.380 
just about top speed in fact it's more
about<00:01:42.740> how<00:01:43.130> quickly<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.729> can<00:01:43.850> go<00:01:44.030> around<00:01:44.270> a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
about how quickly it can go around a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.700 
about how quickly it can go around a
track<00:01:44.770> bending<00:01:45.770> physics<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.580> its<00:01:46.759> will

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.859

we're trying to develop what we call the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.539 
we're trying to develop what we call the

perfection is unattainable actually I

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.440 
perfection is unattainable actually I
mean<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.799> can<00:03:07.919> pursue<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.549> obviously<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.239> you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
mean you can pursue it obviously but you

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.720 
mean you can pursue it obviously but you
can't<00:03:09.720> really<00:03:09.870> obtain<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.409> you<00:03:11.340> mean<00:03:11.609> the

we<00:03:14.129> leave<00:03:14.519> behind<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.329> love<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.530> process

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
we leave behind I love that that process

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.580 
we leave behind I love that that process
of<00:03:17.400> throwing<00:03:18.299> things<00:03:18.659> away<00:03:18.810> working<00:03:19.260> together

of throwing things away working together
coming<00:03:20.489> up<00:03:20.609> with<00:03:20.760> new<00:03:20.909> ideas<00:03:20.969> iterating

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
evolving that idea of evolution

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.500 
evolving that idea of evolution
we<00:03:26.020> found<00:03:26.290> in<00:03:26.470> 425<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.790> best<00:03:28.000> way<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.270> get

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
we found in 425 the best way to get
