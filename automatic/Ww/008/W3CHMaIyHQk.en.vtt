00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.060
 5 found welcome to all for one 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.730
 new review 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.580
 we are going to review a beautiful 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:16.550
 cyclometer heart rate monitor 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:20.210
 inaccurate polar model the cs 500 like 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 you can see it has just arrived in the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.310
 my hands so I don't know all the 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.160
 various complete operations at the moment 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.699
 i will go to make you the only one boxing this is 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.179
 the packaging as you can see 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.639
 original let's open it and there is the 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:40.940
 real product that is the cycle 

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:43.429
 computer that I allowed myself to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.289
 do it both because I like to do and the 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.659
 reviews of the products that arrive to me 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.370
 also because I have not seen so many 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.409
 guides in Italian those I saw 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.219
 they only had the music under and 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.829
 nothing more 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.440
 this is the back like 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.519
 we can see 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.299
 ok these are the usage buttons 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.450
 the part that must be blocked in the supports 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:13.039
 after which we have three more 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:19.729
 sensors we remove in April and pull them 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:22.850
 out to let you see one are 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:31.490
 wedged in from below for the one having in 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:35.220
 one hand the phone here forgive me 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.180
 here I am then 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.630
 soon here I am, the three sensors say 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.360
 these are the ones of cadence ok 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.160
 in the kit I took is a used kit 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.620
 I did not get it again there are all three 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.810
 the sensors usually that of the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.580
 cadence is not always included this e 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.160
 that of the cadence that must be mounted 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.730
 near the pedal the detector of the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.880
 speed is what goes in the band 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.860
 cardio on the rest we would find the attack 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.830
 for aa batteries as you can see 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.920
 here he has focused on the two attacks 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.230
 bayonet instead the sensor of the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.930
 speed on the back as you can see 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.940
 he knows nothing and neither does the color 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.130
 cadence between simply the joint 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:29.280
 so let's open the content 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:34.350
 inside as inside as you can 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.530
 note there are two magnets one will go 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.830
 coupled to the speed sensor that goes 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.020
 tied in 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.850
 in the expected rays here is if 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.590
 the attack is for the thinnest ray 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.840
 than that most often the life of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.750
 regulation and fly that this goes 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.530
 coupled with this instead that which 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.270
 for cadence it must be attached with lo 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.520
 scotch or whatever 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.740
 in the pedal for the cadence sensor 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.410
 what else we have we have one and two 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.700
 supports that are just for the two 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:18.830
 decadence and speed sensors if we have 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:23.510
 the cardio belt, the straps for fixing 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.720
 obviously all the support for the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.120
 computer cycle that the attack of 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.190
 computer cycle support then to his 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.050
 indoor 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.980
 we also have instructions but they have me 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:42.470
 already said that they are really minimal 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:48.410
 ok this is what i come to discover with gifts 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:52.370
 live what is the test of 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.980
 quality that has passed the certifications 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.030
 various this is composed of the box not 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.620
 there is something else in it like what else 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.310
 I want to tell you that I will show you later 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:09.489
 how it should be mounted who simply is me 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:12.170
 been told ok that this by pressing 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.620
 let's see and to do it backwards is not 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.620
 never easy 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:24.110
 here is putting it backing in 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.840
 this way the lever goes up and 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.470
 this is blocked after here in there 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.020
 the straps will go to fix this 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.060
 a box in and finished after I will make you 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.990
 see once I managed to 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.820
 mounting it thank you was not difficult me 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.729
 I have to correct I thought it was more 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.670
 complicated but it was not difficult 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.010
 here is the polar cs 500 mount mounted 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.900
 sorry if I'm a bit clumsy but 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.170
 always with one hand 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.060
 it's not easy I wanted you to show it 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:02.580
 quick release were better than that 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:07.260
 I do with the other hand or the ball there 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.050
 here then the support is fixed with a 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.800
 rather band two see you there is the 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.360
 rubber support and from here it is fixed 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.310
 always with clamps in the support 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.270
 higher than exits after they go 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.150
 cut our pole always try again 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.330
 with this hand here is allowed 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:32.280
 the autofocus set it up first in the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:37.410
 part below then with the pressure of the 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:43.670
 button I'll show you aligns the 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.670
 possibility to put it and it is locked 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.930
 here I also fixed the sensors of 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:55.770
 called speed challenge his wind 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.990
 magnets know how you can see that 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.000
 they say it serves to make false therefore if 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.730
 one more than a bicycle has to buy 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.830
 I forced the originals 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.020
 right at the end of the fork in 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.040
 so that it is right next to the rays 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:15.120
 as far as possible this is the sensor of 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:19.420
 cadence ok also here usually fixing 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:22.630
 with rubber support two straps e 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.960
 the only sensor that leaves a 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.100
 wish for the magnet he had set 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.110
 with scotch 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.840
 so I was told I repeat I have it 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.350
 taken used however it suffers a little 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.910
 of aesthetics so it appears here 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:42.850
 obviously in pots there is the band 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.790
 cardio I have already tried to 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:49.150
 see if it worked properly and for now 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:54.400
 everything works great and this is the 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:59.640
 our polar 500 that will turn on here 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.640
 I imagine prolonged pressure 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.260
 here it is in action ready e 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.040
 available for the first exit ie between 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:11.530
 very little was not the greatest this 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.360
 Driving though I have had a very short 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.270
 just to let you see how it went 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.700
 mounted where it was mounted and what it was 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.640
 contained in a pack with which you 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.740
 go to the forward button here instead you come back 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.970
 back here we start the session of 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.640
 training this the polar 50 this is 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.370
 the bike on which this fascia is mounted 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.060
 black in front of the front fork is the 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:39.910
 the phone holder is not the talk of what it is 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.960
 this is the ostecchia thanks 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.030
 for retirement 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.560
 rather than nothing that was not there 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.500
 even I put a guide in Italian 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.780
 something too 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.770
 so thank you for your attention 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.040
 let's see the next one 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.040
 Hello
