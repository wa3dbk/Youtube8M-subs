00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
it's a little up in the air but I think

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.400 
it's a little up in the air but I think
it'll<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.550> think<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.970> guys<00:04:00.150> will<00:04:00.570> enjoy<00:04:00.630> it

then<00:04:30.310> show<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.639> to<00:04:30.820> him<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.540> see<00:04:32.410> if<00:04:32.440> he<00:04:32.620> wants

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
then show it to him and see if he wants

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.290 
then show it to him and see if he wants
any<00:04:33.040> changes<00:04:33.490> made<00:04:33.520> or<00:04:33.790> anything<00:04:34.120> like<00:04:34.150> that

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
any changes made or anything like that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.440 
any changes made or anything like that
and<00:04:34.810> then<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.979> know<00:04:36.100> whenever<00:04:36.430> he<00:04:36.820> wants<00:04:37.419> to

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
and then you know whenever he wants to

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.740 
and then you know whenever he wants to
post<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:37.960> it'll<00:04:38.229> go<00:04:38.410> up<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:39.270> yeah<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.540> think

that's<00:04:41.229> it<00:04:41.410> about<00:04:41.979> like<00:04:42.340> timing<00:04:43.270> and

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
that's it about like timing and

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.480 
that's it about like timing and
logistics<00:04:43.479> but<00:04:44.260> you<00:04:44.950> know<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.100> didn't<00:04:45.340> want<00:04:45.460> to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
logistics but you know I didn't want to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.150 
logistics but you know I didn't want to
say<00:04:45.700> it's<00:04:46.120> been<00:04:46.240> really<00:04:46.510> cool<00:04:46.780> just<00:04:47.620> learning
