 welcome to day we bring you another 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.910
 delivery of captured gameplays 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.850
 directly 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.330
 of the iphone is worth and this time this radio 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.620
 play saliva a little bit for ios and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.540
 good for those who are undecided 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.880
 in buying it for good I will show a 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.120
 little how is handled here we have the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.030
 world of youtube we are going to load the world 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.740
 and the truth is that unlike the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.450
 minecraft this is handled quite 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.200
 pretty good, right now, it's 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.680
 doing at night and with this with this 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.260
 part of here we would handle the character 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.059
 and we would jump this one you already know that it is in 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.100
 where is it going for who knows terrorize 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.980
 for those who do not know it 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.839
 basically it's the minecraft made in the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.019
 North voucher here we can select 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.519
 where we want to chop or if we want to 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.410
 no specific site which I like 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.330
 pretty or if not directly here 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.330
 we chop from one place to another 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.110
 and I'm saying that basically it's about 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.110
 same go collecting 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.189
 the materials to build the house 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.280
 then you can make a village where 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.710
 you can have more people I was 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.049
 playing quite that configure the series 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.729
 the pc version and the truth is that it 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.070
 they discovered quite a lot of things 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.690
 here if we want to apply directly 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.840
 then we chop directly into the mineral 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.119
 and no need to sting 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.740
 the earth thing that I already say that has 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.280
 liked quite well handled very well already 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.710
 I say and soon they were going to put I think the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.439
 online mode the cooperative mode for 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.409
 to be able to play with your friends who have 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.759
 also the iphone game and you say 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.010
 that is handled very well is totally 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.890
 almost like computer 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.060
 I think that at the beginning it has not done 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.280
 nothing is missing 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.959
 says this man says you should be left 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.099
 house at night is very dangerous to walk 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.200
 around here in the dark and if 1713 create 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.420
 weapons and a shelter starts drilling 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.099
 felling trees and collecting wood worth 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.080
 wood they already had we are going to see them 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.080
 here so here I have 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.000
 and let's put here is our 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.550
 drag 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.660
 that's true now that we have wood 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.370
 and we have made a hole here 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.990
 for the moment we are going to cover this part of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.770
 up here we're going to take the wood and 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.770
 let's put them 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:55.459
 and there we have covered 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.860
 come on let's do around here she's going 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.220
 to have also mineral 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.390
 and down here 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.069
 d 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.170
 I met to find a bit and I say 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.999
 handle fire I will not show either 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.859
 much more because it does not have many 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.180
 Decent mysteries that can be play 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.049
 more than anything because like the game of 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.290
 payment so you can see how it is 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.290
 the game 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.120
 well man is giving him an eye 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.590
 demonic 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.400
 a shooting star has fallen I think 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.260
 they will serve 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.239
 I do not know exactly now we saw why 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.040
 they served but another that were important is 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.040
 go catching 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.100
 I will not apply much else because if not 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.840
 they are going to kill me and it is supposed to have arrived 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.630
 a moment that you could do we are 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.410
 kind character table or here is bank 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.750
 of work 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.750
 is worth 10 wooden worth create 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.260
 perfect 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.600
 here we are going to put here for example vale 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.600
 and let's set the table 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.070
 once already here at the table I think it 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:19.000
 they could create things let's see how it was 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:22.540
 I just do not remember 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.409
 and now if we can go creating little things 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.220
 OK 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:33.080
 we need gel and wood material to 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.300
 create a torch I do not have perfect 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.189
 but to make a table we have to do 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.960
 a door is worth practically we have 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:41.270
 to do already 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.009
 enough little things here we have to 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.009
 make a bow arrows to the model not 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.360
 we can do portions here 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.530
 this already once the table of 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.289
 work then we can create things here what 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.470
 we can put all this much nicer 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.470
 let's say yes 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.000
 and that just go looking for material 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.300
 looking for the minerals looking for everything 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.090
 for each time have a thing 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.790
 rather better is what it is about 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.410
 I already say minecraft type that good once 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.940
 who has been playing well does not have much 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.920
 mystery but good for whoever is 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.210
 hesitating to buy it or not the truth is 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.080
 which is a fairly recommended purchase 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.080
 so that he likes 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.610
 this of this game I was waiting for 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.229
 the output of news and well I think it 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.950
 it handles pretty well is a game 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.650
 quite I say pretty good 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.810
 and above all that the management since I do 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.480
 graf form to be first person 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.370
 is handled different this answer where 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.170
 it is perfectly handled on one side 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.730
 towards another up we would give it to 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:53.490
 jump is worth then nothing else game more 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.970
 captured two ways let's see if it happens 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.970
 the night 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:03.680
 because before I say goodbye I want to see if 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.680
 we can make one of meat 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:15.420
 of wood, no, I'm prince, pious 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.420
 at work not even land 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.800
 normally we can not make wood to the 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.949
 bed 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.659
 and good to spend the night I hope that 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.639
 a game has been seen as best as possible 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:33.819
 all way I'm going to create a new world 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:35.969
 so you can see the day game this one 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:35.969
 same 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.980
 test 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.980
 and creates the world test world also 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:52.910
 and so you also see it during the day 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.039
 even the average has not left me bad you see 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.169
 like getting somewhere else to go 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.020
 advancing because this was quite long 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:02.280
 is starting to move forward as you see has 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.210
 created let's say a 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.210
 a different site 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.760
 we'll see 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.410
 and although we are like in a forest not 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.690
 you are going through you are going through 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.790
 desert by snow 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.430
 I have seen that we have created a new world 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.980
 and be different, well, I said it 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.450
 I hope you liked the video os 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.690

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:29.030
 them both the iphone and the ipad 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.490
 you want to see in the channel because I do not 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.230
 it would matter to raise from time to time a 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.870
 different video of each game that 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.120
 you are interested and comment to see 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.040
