00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
it's important that we can all do that

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's important that we can all do that
but<00:03:28.349> um<00:03:28.730> yeah<00:03:30.500> ultimately<00:03:31.500> obviously

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
but um yeah ultimately obviously

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.160 
but um yeah ultimately obviously
disappointing<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:33.209> take<00:03:33.390> nothing<00:03:33.510> from<00:03:33.780> today

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
disappointing to take nothing from today

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
but the fact that you've taken on one of

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.869 
but the fact that you've taken on one of
the<00:03:36.750> top<00:03:37.019> teams<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:37.769> division<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.370> cause

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
some confidence set ahead of next

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.130 
some confidence set ahead of next
weekend<00:03:43.140> yeah<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> think<00:03:44.099> so<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.489> know<00:03:44.700> some

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140

weekend yeah I think so you know some
it's<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.200> good<00:03:46.349> test<00:03:46.530> for<00:03:46.650> us<00:03:46.769> against<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.099> top

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
it's a good test for us against a top

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.559 
it's a good test for us against a top
team<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.909> sort<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.150> gauge<00:03:48.299> where

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
team like you can sort of gauge where

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.899 
team like you can sort of gauge where
you<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.959> know<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.200> think<00:03:49.409> we<00:03:49.560> were

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
you are you know and I think we were

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.160 
you are you know and I think we were
easily<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.060> better<00:03:51.239> team<00:03:51.420> today<00:03:51.629> I<00:03:51.750> think<00:03:51.900> you

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
easily the better team today I think you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.839 
easily the better team today I think you
know<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:52.769> has<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> bit<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
know if it just has a bit of a

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:54.830 
know if it just has a bit of a
smash-and-grab<00:03:54.090> from<00:03:54.450> their<00:03:54.569> point<00:03:54.689> of<00:03:54.780> view

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
smash-and-grab from their point of view

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.420 
smash-and-grab from their point of view
but<00:03:55.049> lb<00:03:55.290> have<00:03:55.409> to<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.739> coming<00:03:56.220> away<00:03:56.370> to

what<00:04:19.200> would<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.440> say<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.799> realistic<00:04:20.130> target

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
what would you say is a realistic target

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.070 
what would you say is a realistic target
now<00:04:21.000> between<00:04:21.330> now<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.750> end<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
now between now and the end of the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.300 
now between now and the end of the
season<00:04:22.230> I<00:04:27.200> reckon<00:04:28.200> I<00:04:28.380> think<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.710> personally

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
season I reckon I think I personally

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.640 
season I reckon I think I personally
think<00:04:29.400> we<00:04:29.520> should<00:04:29.670> be<00:04:29.790> looking<00:04:30.150> at<00:04:30.600> easily<00:04:31.590> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
think we should be looking at easily the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.770 
think we should be looking at easily the
top<00:04:31.740> half<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.370> if<00:04:32.640> we<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:33.030> really<00:04:33.270> kick<00:04:33.600> on

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
top half and if we can really kick on

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.210 
top half and if we can really kick on
