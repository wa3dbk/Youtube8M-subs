00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
that I've been having for a fixed blade

that I've been having for a fixed blade
recently<00:00:25.310> been<00:00:25.730> watching<00:00:26.180> some<00:00:26.689> of<00:00:26.739> weapon

collectors videos and he just started
basically<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.390> idea<00:00:32.419> is<00:00:32.800> recycling<00:00:33.800> these

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
basically the idea is recycling these

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.209 
basically the idea is recycling these
cheap<00:00:34.760> knives<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.530> he's<00:00:36.530> been<00:00:36.739> making<00:00:36.920> it

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
cheap knives and he's been making it

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.160 
cheap knives and he's been making it
them<00:00:37.579> into<00:00:37.910> fixed<00:00:38.239> blades<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.780> they<00:00:38.960> look

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
them into fixed blades and they look

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.430 
them into fixed blades and they look
really<00:00:39.649> really<00:00:40.130> nice<00:00:40.430> um<00:00:40.790> I'm<00:00:41.600> really<00:00:42.140> for

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
really really nice um I'm really for

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.150 
really really nice um I'm really for
that<00:00:42.620> idea<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.280> recycle<00:00:43.820> these<00:00:44.539> are<00:00:45.160> otherwise

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
that idea to recycle these are otherwise

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.759 
that idea to recycle these are otherwise
like<00:00:46.489> cheap<00:00:46.940> knives<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.499> know<00:00:48.620> that

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
like cheap knives that you know that

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.860 
like cheap knives that you know that
they<00:00:49.010> weren't<00:00:49.219> that<00:00:49.370> great<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.149> he's<00:00:50.420> making

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
they weren't that great and he's making

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.139 
they weren't that great and he's making
them<00:00:51.050> into<00:00:51.440> something<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.519> great<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.120> I

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
them into something that is great so I

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.590 
them into something that is great so I
think<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:53.809> a<00:00:53.839> fantastic<00:00:54.140> idea<00:00:54.969> I<00:00:55.969> support

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
think that is a fantastic idea I support

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.939 
think that is a fantastic idea I support
that<00:00:56.629> one<00:00:56.929> hundred<00:00:57.199> percent<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:57.679> that<00:00:57.829> has

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
that one hundred percent so that has

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.639 
that one hundred percent so that has
been<00:00:58.190> my<00:00:58.730> inspiration<00:00:58.999> to<00:00:59.600> bring<00:00:59.839> back<00:01:00.079> this

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
been my inspiration to bring back this

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.009 
been my inspiration to bring back this
design<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.579> concept<00:01:02.179> that<00:01:02.329> I've<00:01:02.480> had<00:01:02.749> if

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
design this concept that I've had if

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.500 
design this concept that I've had if
this<00:01:03.289> is<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.589> knockoff<00:01:04.250> okay<00:01:05.150> this<00:01:05.300> is<00:01:05.480> a

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
this is a knockoff okay this is a

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.080 
this is a knockoff okay this is a
knockoff<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.370> basically<00:01:07.370> I<00:01:07.400> think<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:07.940> a

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
knockoff of basically I think it's a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.310 
knockoff of basically I think it's a
crkt<00:01:08.720> knife<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.150> when<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.300> get<00:01:11.659> something

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
crkt knife and when you get something

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.560 
crkt knife and when you get something
like<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.590> right<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.310> folding<00:01:14.060> knife<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.360> cheap

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
like this right a folding knife a cheap

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.800 
like this right a folding knife a cheap
folding<00:01:14.930> knife<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.040> want<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.540> use<00:01:17.540> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
folding knife and you want to use the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.630 
folding knife and you want to use the
blade<00:01:18.050> right<00:01:19.330> there<00:01:20.330> needs<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.990> be<00:01:21.640> basically

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
blade right there needs to be basically

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.120 
blade right there needs to be basically
on<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:23.840> side<00:01:24.110> there<00:01:24.380> needs<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.650> be<00:01:24.710> some<00:01:24.920> kind

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
on this side there needs to be some kind

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.760 
on this side there needs to be some kind
of<00:01:25.190> stopper<00:01:25.760> right<00:01:26.240> something<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.200> stop<00:01:27.560> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
of stopper right something to stop the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.060 
of stopper right something to stop the
blade<00:01:28.100> from<00:01:28.850> going<00:01:29.780> all<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.080> way<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.200> way<00:01:30.620> so

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
blade from going all the way this way so

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.480 
blade from going all the way this way so
in<00:01:31.370> order<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.880> blade<00:01:32.090> not<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.480> keep<00:01:32.780> going

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
in order for the blade not to keep going

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.160 
in order for the blade not to keep going
they<00:01:34.490> have<00:01:34.730> a<00:01:34.760> little<00:01:35.000> thing<00:01:35.420> right<00:01:35.600> here<00:01:35.660> or

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
they have a little thing right here or

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.210 
they have a little thing right here or
sometimes<00:01:36.620> they<00:01:36.740> could<00:01:36.860> have<00:01:36.980> something

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
sometimes they could have something

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.540 
sometimes they could have something
right<00:01:38.210> right<00:01:38.900> there<00:01:39.200> okay<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.190> course<00:01:40.250> you

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
right right there okay and of course you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.210 
right right there okay and of course you
need<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:40.790> pivot<00:01:41.410> this<00:01:42.410> this<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.980> main

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
need the pivot this this is the main

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.790 
need the pivot this this is the main
attachment<00:01:43.970> right<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:44.480> and<00:01:44.660> then<00:01:45.230> you<00:01:45.620> need

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
attachment right here and then you need

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.160 
attachment right here and then you need
something<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.220> stop<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.640> from<00:01:46.910> going<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.840> way

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
something to stop it from going this way

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.010 
something to stop it from going this way
alright<00:01:48.860> do<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.850> don't<00:01:50.180> want<00:01:50.300> it<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.780> blade

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
alright do you don't want it the blade

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.840 
alright do you don't want it the blade
to<00:01:51.140> come<00:01:51.290> back<00:01:51.440> this<00:01:51.590> way<00:01:51.800> so<00:01:51.860> here's<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
to come back this way so here's the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.370 
to come back this way so here's the
stopper<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:53.390> here<00:01:53.720> which<00:01:53.870> in<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.320> case

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
stopper right here which in this case

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.860 
stopper right here which in this case
this<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:56.090> lock<00:01:56.300> right<00:01:56.570> here<00:01:56.900> right<00:01:57.230> so

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
this is the the lock right here right so

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.230 
this is the the lock right here right so
there's<00:01:59.870> basically<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.500> three<00:02:01.400> components

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
there's basically a three components

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.930 
there's basically a three components
going<00:02:02.510> on<00:02:02.630> here<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.050> main<00:02:03.290> pivot<00:02:03.650> screw<00:02:03.940> the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
going on here the main pivot screw the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.360 
going on here the main pivot screw the
stopper<00:02:05.390> here<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.960> then<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> stopper<00:02:06.650> on<00:02:06.800> the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
stopper here and then the stopper on the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.990 
stopper here and then the stopper on the
other<00:02:07.550> side<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.709> design<00:02:10.099> that<00:02:10.550> I

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
other side so this is the design that I

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.100 
other side so this is the design that I
have<00:02:11.420> right<00:02:11.690> here<00:02:13.480> let<00:02:14.480> me<00:02:14.569> start<00:02:14.810> off<00:02:14.900> with

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
have right here let me start off with

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.649 
have right here let me start off with
the<00:02:15.200> stuff<00:02:15.410> that's<00:02:15.620> not<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:16.659> important

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
the stuff that's not that important

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.099 
the stuff that's not that important
right<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.499> thing<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:19.120> basically<00:02:20.120> can

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
right here this thing is basically can

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.470 
right here this thing is basically can
be<00:02:21.230> used<00:02:21.499> for<00:02:21.769> striking<00:02:22.400> purposes

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
be used for striking purposes

standard line your hole and then I

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.390 
standard line your hole and then I

you could put power cords you know onto

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.770 
you could put power cords you know onto
the<00:02:43.790> handle<00:02:44.180> because<00:02:44.299> this<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.599> like<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
skeleton knife and the whole idea right

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.430 
skeleton knife and the whole idea right

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
here this funny looking nose looking

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.300 
here this funny looking nose looking
thing<00:02:51.709> right<00:02:52.190> here<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.209> there<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.379> the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
thing right here this is there so the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.270 
thing right here this is there so the
main<00:02:55.610> pivot<00:02:55.910> screw<00:02:56.209> no<00:02:56.780> matter<00:02:57.019> even<00:02:57.319> if<00:02:58.069> it's

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
main pivot screw no matter even if it's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.610 
main pivot screw no matter even if it's
like<00:02:58.640> slightly<00:02:59.000> large<00:02:59.540> you'll<00:02:59.989> be<00:03:00.200> able<00:03:00.319> to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
like slightly large you'll be able to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.569 
like slightly large you'll be able to
put<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.609> different<00:03:01.879> type<00:03:02.450> size<00:03:03.160> blades<00:03:04.160> onto

put on different type size blades onto

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.869 
put on different type size blades onto
here<00:03:05.209> right<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.319> then<00:03:06.799> over<00:03:07.069> here<00:03:07.099> this<00:03:07.640> is

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
here right so and then over here this is

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.059 
here right so and then over here this is
the<00:03:08.450> side<00:03:08.690> that's<00:03:08.900> going<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.230> stop<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.829> put<00:03:10.040> a

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
the side that's going to stop you put a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.920 
the side that's going to stop you put a
screw<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:10.519> there<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.180> depending<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.750> how

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
screw in there and depending on how

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.860 
screw in there and depending on how
large<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.769> blade<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.640> you're<00:03:14.329> attaching

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
large this a blade that you're attaching

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.170 
large this a blade that you're attaching
on<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.410> guy<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.400> know<00:03:16.519> it's<00:03:16.970> going<00:03:17.120> to

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
on to this guy is you know it's going to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.750 
on to this guy is you know it's going to
change<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.480> location<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:18.349> where<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.459> put<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
change the location of where you put the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.869 
change the location of where you put the
screw<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.359> that's<00:03:20.840> why<00:03:21.019> has<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.370> long<00:03:22.370> shape

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
screw and that's why has that long shape

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.979 
screw and that's why has that long shape
and<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.810> same<00:03:24.019> thing<00:03:24.290> for<00:03:25.190> over<00:03:25.910> here<00:03:26.299> we<00:03:26.870> have

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
and the same thing for over here we have

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.599 
and the same thing for over here we have
the<00:03:27.109> same<00:03:27.319> concept<00:03:27.829> where<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.069> can<00:03:28.190> screw

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
the same concept where you can screw

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.830 
the same concept where you can screw
here<00:03:28.970> or<00:03:29.269> all<00:03:29.810> along<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.859> length<00:03:31.430> that's

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
here or all along the length that's

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.500 
here or all along the length that's
going<00:03:32.840> on<00:03:32.989> right<00:03:33.829> right<00:03:34.069> here<00:03:34.370> as<00:03:34.519> well<00:03:34.760> ok<00:03:35.450> so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
going on right right here as well ok so

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.930 
going on right right here as well ok so
basically<00:03:35.780> what<00:03:36.739> this<00:03:36.889> is<00:03:36.950> is<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.700> almost

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
basically what this is is this is almost

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.659 
basically what this is is this is almost
like<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:40.010> don't<00:03:40.190> know<00:03:40.430> like<00:03:40.609> a

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
like a I don't know like a

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.720 
like a I don't know like a
post-apocalyptic<00:03:41.599> type<00:03:42.470> thing<00:03:42.799> where<00:03:42.829> you

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
post-apocalyptic type thing where you

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.580 
post-apocalyptic type thing where you
know<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.910> can<00:03:44.120> get<00:03:44.239> any<00:03:44.480> kind<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.930> cheap<00:03:45.319> knife

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
know you can get any kind of cheap knife

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.390 
know you can get any kind of cheap knife
and<00:03:46.120> attach<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.329> blade<00:03:47.630> onto<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:48.919> area

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
and attach a blade onto the this area

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.870 
and attach a blade onto the this area
right<00:03:49.579> here<00:03:49.639> and<00:03:50.120> if<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:51.530> breaks<00:03:51.709> or<00:03:52.130> it's<00:03:52.730> not

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
right here and if it breaks or it's not

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.220 
right here and if it breaks or it's not
sharp<00:03:53.209> or<00:03:53.389> whatever<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:53.959> don't<00:03:54.139> have

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
sharp or whatever and you don't have

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.930 
sharp or whatever and you don't have
sharpening<00:03:54.739> tools<00:03:54.950> you'd<00:03:55.190> throw<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.519> away<00:03:55.609> and

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
sharpening tools you'd throw it away and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.750 
sharpening tools you'd throw it away and
then<00:03:56.389> put<00:03:56.720> on<00:03:56.840> another<00:03:57.109> one<00:03:57.349> so<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:58.160> it's<00:03:58.639> a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
then put on another one so it's it's a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.120 
then put on another one so it's it's a
maid<00:03:59.120> for<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.510> kind<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.900> thing<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.349> of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
maid for that kind of thing and of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.819 
maid for that kind of thing and of
course<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.940> area<00:04:02.329> right<00:04:02.480> here<00:04:02.799> you<00:04:03.799> know

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
course this area right here you know

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.979 
course this area right here you know
this<00:04:04.459> is<00:04:04.489> basically<00:04:05.090> going<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.359> be<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.660> spine

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
this is basically going to be the spine

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.190 
this is basically going to be the spine
side<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:07.459> maybe<00:04:08.450> there<00:04:08.720> should<00:04:08.930> be<00:04:09.019> some

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
side so maybe there should be some

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.080 
side so maybe there should be some
jimping<00:04:09.590> here<00:04:09.799> this<00:04:10.400> should<00:04:10.549> be<00:04:10.669> kind<00:04:10.879> of<00:04:10.970> like

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
jimping here this should be kind of like

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.420 
jimping here this should be kind of like
a<00:04:11.120> arrest<00:04:12.049> for<00:04:12.379> your<00:04:12.500> thumb<00:04:12.799> almost<00:04:13.220> kind<00:04:13.370> of

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
a arrest for your thumb almost kind of

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.339 
a arrest for your thumb almost kind of
like<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.579> ramp<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.090> then<00:04:14.629> on<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:14.930> side<00:04:14.989> over

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
like a ramp and then on this side over

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.319 
like a ramp and then on this side over
here<00:04:15.709> this<00:04:15.889> is<00:04:16.070> almost<00:04:16.280> like<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.579> finger<00:04:17.030> guard

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
here this is almost like a finger guard

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.020 
here this is almost like a finger guard
so<00:04:17.720> we<00:04:18.169> have<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> full<00:04:18.709> cross<00:04:19.010> guard<00:04:19.519> going<00:04:19.880> on

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
so we have a full cross guard going on

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.550 
so we have a full cross guard going on
and<00:04:20.299> right<00:04:20.510> here<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.840> course<00:04:20.870> could<00:04:21.320> be<00:04:21.410> used

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
and right here of course could be used

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.770 
and right here of course could be used
for<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:22.669> small<00:04:22.940> point<00:04:23.270> right<00:04:23.419> here<00:04:23.449> for

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
for this small point right here for

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.500 
for this small point right here for
striking<00:04:24.080> purposes<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.010> of<00:04:25.580> course<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:26.120> know

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
striking purposes and of course you know

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.300 
striking purposes and of course you know
both<00:04:26.750> points<00:04:27.289> on<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.470> cross<00:04:27.680> guard<00:04:27.949> can<00:04:28.130> also

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
both points on the cross guard can also

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.969 
both points on the cross guard can also
be<00:04:28.580> used<00:04:28.610> for<00:04:28.910> striking<00:04:29.330> purposes<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.260> this<00:04:30.770> is

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
be used for striking purposes so this is

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.360 
be used for striking purposes so this is
my<00:04:31.130> idea<00:04:31.340> i<00:04:31.610> call<00:04:31.909> it<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.060> Wraith<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:34.340> i

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
my idea i call it the Wraith and so i

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.519 
my idea i call it the Wraith and so i
hope<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.580> enjoyed<00:04:35.060> it<00:04:35.270> let<00:04:35.510> me<00:04:35.630> know<00:04:35.780> what
