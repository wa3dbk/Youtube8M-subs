00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.970
 I do not know if I say food a 

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:51.440
 I had a snack to introduce it 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.780
 because the truth is something super healthy 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.760
 super cool we are already in spring and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.530
 It starts to heat, then quoted 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 you do, but to me, as in 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.350
 These times do not seem like things to me 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.369
 very cool I am already know of 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.150
 delicious as broths at home but not 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.060
 I know how lately 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.550
 very natural and very rich and good I hope 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.170
 that does not have anything of the other world but 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 it's also something that I started to grab 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.980
 that I really like super rich and I think 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.540

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.320
 like it a lot so do not say go and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.320
 let's watch the video 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 we're going to need fresh spinach which is 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.050
 delicious avocado tomato also a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.479
 can of tuna in water and a little bit of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.430
 mayonnaise with chipotle remember that all 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.030
 our vegetables have to be fine 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.880
 washed and well disinfected mayonnaise 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.830
 you can change it for normal mayonnaise 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.470
 mayonnaise light or whatever you want to put 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.800
 let's take our tomato and for 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.500
 that is well paradito let's cut him 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.470
 a little slice as you're seeing from the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.600
 bottom part 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.430
 now with a little knife a little 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.740
 sharp be careful if you are small ask 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.430
 help please let's make a 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 small a little little circle as well 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.390
 is doing 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.719
 and after helping you with the same 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.819
 knife or with your hands to take it 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.769
 this capital 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.620
 and we will have something like that with the help 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.040
 of a spoon we will start to remove 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.659
 I recommend the tomato pulp and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.760
 are the ones that work the most that have been 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.709
 chopping tomatoes that are as with 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.659
 those who are harder because the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.609
 tomatoes for salsa come very 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.609
 the same then it will not work 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.860
 and we have to stay like that 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.140
 remove as much as possible of the pulp 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.640
 Now we will prepare our tuna you 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.110
 I say that I really like this 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.300
 mayonnaise with chipotle but you can 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.100
 Prepare as you like and as you want 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.100
 and we're just going to stir it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.900
 and now let's fill in our 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.700
 tomatoes do not worry you check it to 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.700
 the chalet that are well filled 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.989
 Y 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.010
 Now let's decorate our plate with 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.930
 our spinach surfaces and 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.870
 following interest addicts the barrel 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.030
 but you can change it for lettuce or 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.070
 so you do not like it and now we're going to 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.260
 put our tomatoes the base looks 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.360
 super nice very green very colorful me 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.580

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.770
 vice cabbage and good you know that to me 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.690
 I love avocado and I wanted to put 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.639
 a few small slices on one side but 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.190
 this is optional other you can put 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.190

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.300

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.300

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.280
 to need is orange and also strawberries 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.020
 disinfected and natural gasified water 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.150
 let's start cutting slices not 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.190
 very thick that are thin but 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.830
 neither like paper something less than 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.510

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.210
 you want depending if it's just going to be a 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.680
 glass or a jug I do not know that you're also 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.620

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.270

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.190
 well disinfected just like our 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.200
 orange and we're going to cut them in half 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.420

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.910

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.910
