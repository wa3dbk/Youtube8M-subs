series<00:04:00.069> but<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.430> my<00:04:00.879> opinion<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.419> think<00:04:01.449> this

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
series but in my opinion I think this

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:07.170 
series but in my opinion I think this
anime<00:04:02.620> has<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:03.629> lot<00:04:04.629> of<00:04:04.840> bad<00:04:05.519> rep<00:04:06.519> i<00:04:06.760> guess<00:04:06.939> i<00:04:06.970> can

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
anime has a lot of bad rep i guess i can

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.909 
anime has a lot of bad rep i guess i can
say<00:04:07.299> because<00:04:07.569> i'm<00:04:07.750> just<00:04:07.810> going<00:04:08.409> to<00:04:08.439> wound<00:04:08.709> a
