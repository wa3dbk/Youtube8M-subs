00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
we're going to take a quick look at the

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.090 
we're going to take a quick look at the
components<00:00:05.450> of<00:00:05.870> the<00:00:06.140> new<00:00:06.260> Miller<00:00:06.470> rod<00:00:06.649> polymer

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
components of the new Miller rod polymer

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.000 
components of the new Miller rod polymer
series<00:00:07.399> this<00:00:07.850> is<00:00:08.000> the<00:00:08.149> 7-foot<00:00:08.690> set<00:00:08.930> and<00:00:09.200> all

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
series this is the 7-foot set and all

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.770 
series this is the 7-foot set and all
the<00:00:10.160> sets<00:00:10.370> are<00:00:10.490> made<00:00:10.550> up<00:00:10.820> of<00:00:10.970> these<00:00:11.120> 14<00:00:11.660> inch

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
the sets are made up of these 14 inch

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.830 
the sets are made up of these 14 inch
rods<00:00:12.020> you<00:00:12.860> see<00:00:13.040> the<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:13.790> black<00:00:14.060> is<00:00:14.390> a<00:00:14.420> poly

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
rods you see the the black is a poly

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.480 
rods you see the the black is a poly
nylon<00:00:15.260> rod<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:15.769> it's<00:00:15.890> got<00:00:16.039> a<00:00:16.070> little<00:00:16.160> stiffness

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
nylon rod so it's got a little stiffness

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.329 
nylon rod so it's got a little stiffness
to<00:00:16.760> it<00:00:16.880> get<00:00:17.390> quarter-inch<00:00:18.050> threads<00:00:18.439> so

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
to it get quarter-inch threads so

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.650 
to it get quarter-inch threads so
they're<00:00:19.490> standard<00:00:19.789> strat<00:00:20.060> threads<00:00:20.419> will<00:00:20.570> be

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
they're standard strat threads will be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.089 
they're standard strat threads will be
able<00:00:20.810> to<00:00:20.960> be<00:00:21.380> used<00:00:21.499> with<00:00:21.740> all<00:00:21.890> your<00:00:22.039> other

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
accessories and you'll basically just

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.960 
accessories and you'll basically just
take<00:00:24.439> these<00:00:24.589> and<00:00:24.769> screw<00:00:24.980> them<00:00:25.099> together<00:00:25.220> now

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
take these and screw them together now

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.269 
take these and screw them together now
the<00:00:26.029> black<00:00:26.359> rods<00:00:26.659> are<00:00:27.140> stiff<00:00:27.829> they're<00:00:28.130> made

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
the black rods are stiff they're made

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.009 
the black rods are stiff they're made
for<00:00:28.489> giving<00:00:28.730> you<00:00:28.789> some<00:00:28.939> distance<00:00:29.359> across<00:00:29.659> a

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
for giving you some distance across a

cross and open ceiling in a wall or for

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.250 
cross and open ceiling in a wall or for
my<00:00:33.590> short<00:00:33.890> runs<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:35.180> also<00:00:35.420> get<00:00:35.720> two<00:00:35.990> of<00:00:36.020> these

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
my short runs you also get two of these

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.410 
my short runs you also get two of these
round<00:00:36.650> rods<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.340> these<00:00:37.460> are<00:00:37.640> more<00:00:37.760> flexible

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
round rods and these are more flexible

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.390 
round rods and these are more flexible
you<00:00:38.840> get<00:00:38.960> about<00:00:39.080> a<00:00:39.140> 35-percent<00:00:39.890> complex--

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
you get about a 35-percent complex--

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.160 
you get about a 35-percent complex--
with<00:00:40.580> these<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.300> also<00:00:41.570> notice<00:00:41.900> that<00:00:41.930> they're

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
with these and also notice that they're

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.170 
with these and also notice that they're
single<00:00:42.530> piece<00:00:42.920> construction<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:43.910> there<00:00:44.060> no

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
single piece construction so there no

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.030 
single piece construction so there no
separate<00:00:44.570> metal<00:00:44.870> tips<00:00:45.110> there's<00:00:45.860> no

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
separate metal tips there's no

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.190 
separate metal tips there's no
fiberglass<00:00:46.640> door<00:00:46.910> not<00:00:47.030> fiberglass<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:47.990> you'll

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
fiberglass door not fiberglass so you'll

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.590 
fiberglass door not fiberglass so you'll
never<00:00:48.470> get<00:00:48.650> anything<00:00:48.830> on<00:00:49.040> your<00:00:49.190> skin<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.610> they

never get anything on your skin and they

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.560 
never get anything on your skin and they
won't<00:00:50.810> shatter<00:00:51.220> you<00:00:52.220> also<00:00:52.550> get<00:00:52.700> two<00:00:53.000> of<00:00:53.300> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
won't shatter you also get two of the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.680 
won't shatter you also get two of the
flat<00:00:53.990> superflex<00:00:54.590> rods<00:00:54.890> which<00:00:55.220> will<00:00:55.400> go<00:00:55.690> 360

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
flat superflex rods which will go 360

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.750 
flat superflex rods which will go 360
degrees<00:00:57.110> as<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.440> can<00:00:57.620> see<00:00:57.830> and<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.520> course

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
degrees as you can see and of course

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.430 
degrees as you can see and of course
they<00:00:58.970> interact<00:00:59.450> with<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.810> other<00:00:59.900> rods<00:01:00.170> as

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
they interact with the other rods as

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.860 
they interact with the other rods as
well<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:02.000> you'll<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:02.420> screw<00:01:02.540> them<00:01:02.780> together

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
well so you'll just screw them together

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.609 
well so you'll just screw them together
to<00:01:03.339> make<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.670> set<00:01:04.909> of<00:01:05.150> your<00:01:05.360> choice<00:01:05.720> up<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:06.290> 7
