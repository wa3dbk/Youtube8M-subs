 Real people are very us 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 strong players can advance that 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.100
 Values ​​seen in comparison 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.480
 you can already see there 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 clearly done something 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.469
 the values ​​are really better 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.420
 become friends yes our first opponent 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 In this episode is a team of 110 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.469
 and we do because we think of trees 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.199
 start this game with alexander 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.030
 esswein and with the 10 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.379
 and you see a new one in the upper right corner 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.420
 upgrade counter 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 yes i said yes a new design 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 already the back law writes 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.619
 my comments as it finds so well 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.990
 how do you upgrade the counter for the 9th 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.310
 meanwhile this is unfortunately the 1 1 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.380
 and you see he jumps back to zero 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.990
 yes this time it is so with this update 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.299
 counter that is no plusminus there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 but green for positive numbers if we 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.180
 in the positive area are yes in the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
 neutral or just red when we are in the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.420
 Negative area is what we are 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.909
 Of course, do not even hope 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.710
 want it to get that far 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.860
 he must be armed 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.650
 yes we do the 2 1 in the 80 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 minute people edgar prib with his debut 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.240
 gate is running when the game 221 warn 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.860
 many hard-fought game but we 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.869
 We ended up with 2 2 1 for us 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.750
 decide against really strong 100 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.369
 team won the title as well 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.700
 consist of support improves 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.040
 continue 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.540
 and yes in the next game we meet 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.420
 then again because of a not quite so 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.830
 strong looking opponent with a team 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.590
 with a 965 rating and 4 and 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.050
 50 cm yes, but he comes directly with the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.710
 first chance here he is through and 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.320
 but shoots uncertain lupfer and again 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.800
 it is our goalkeeper to fend off the ball 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.840
 can 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.850
 yes, then with the next 10 of the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.860
 follower of the ball plays out 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.360
 about who made back in use 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.520
 right alarm again with us on lapa 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.620
 and he gets up and nods the ball 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.180
 a to 1 0 for us yes people is still running 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.610
 I say 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.980
 we can probably win our series 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.510
 I continue to evaluate that correctly 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.350
 horny is so much longer keeps the notes 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.780
 now there is the faster 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.280
 we do not get him any players but me 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.660
 can you ever tell people that 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.580
 she will also change a bit 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.350
 it just gets harder and harder now 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.140
 higher we come in the meantime 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.280
 piotr trochowski our man with us 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.030
 responsible for everything is ours 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.070
 game maker 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.540
 I'll be right who gets it people 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.740
 buys in any case better the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.290
 not right for me again 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.330
 is player makes her 2 0 and it was 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.140
 it applies here with a pass he pulls in 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.860
 the middle and then with the fiesta for the 13th 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.110
 yes after 38 minutes we lead with 13 07 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.480
 clear result yes and that thinks 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.220
 our opponent too, and he closes 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.290
 Then after the 13 new to a raid 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.820
 and you see people upgrades everyone 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.239
 jumps one more point up 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.040
 fit for this match looks good 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.690
 we're going to the last game episode yes 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.940
 This episode is not that long 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.650
 This time because in the first game where 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.709
 not so much just happened and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.700
 because of the second game with the railjet 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.050
 but I hope you like it 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.580
 still level up is very good at 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.610
 upon her market wants friends 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.130
 and that makes me happy and we see 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.300
 konstantin rausch meets only in the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.130
 70 minutes with the 1 0 for us too he in 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.140
 the episode in which he is at the status with the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.600
 Going back and forth also really retap people 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.400
 concept really horny left katar 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.480

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.739
 yes and then next scene 90 minute 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.750
 Fries I thought round thing works but 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.239
 no, we finally admit it 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.650
 another time for a ratsch quit the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.430

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.080

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.080

 gone but and two new players the one 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:18.509
 on the one hand, it earns max green for the store 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.609
 and tobias knows for the defensive 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.509
 Mittelfeld yes the defense should thereby 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.009
 be strengthened 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.600
 I hope that it works too you see 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.400

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.050
