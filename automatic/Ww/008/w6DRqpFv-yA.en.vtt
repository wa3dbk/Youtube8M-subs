hi<00:00:00.930> everyone<00:00:01.350> welcome<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.490> week<00:00:02.820> 2<00:00:03.090> video

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hi everyone welcome to the week 2 video

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.470 
hi everyone welcome to the week 2 video
for<00:00:03.720> acts<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.080> 232<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:05.060> terms<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.210> what<00:00:06.390> we

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
for acts I 232 in terms of what we

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.610 
for acts I 232 in terms of what we
talked<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.049> week<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.470> were

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
talked about this week we were

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.530 
talked about this week we were
continuing<00:00:07.919> talking<00:00:08.340> about<00:00:08.730> survival<00:00:09.210> models

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
continuing talking about survival models

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.720 
continuing talking about survival models
we<00:00:10.200> started<00:00:10.530> off<00:00:10.710> with<00:00:10.980> looking<00:00:11.340> at<00:00:11.519> some

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
we started off with looking at some

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.419 
we started off with looking at some
conditions<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.599> s<00:00:13.110> X<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.500> T<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
conditions on s X of T for it to be a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.430 
conditions on s X of T for it to be a
valid<00:00:14.700> survival<00:00:15.269> model<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.080> there<00:00:16.230> were<00:00:16.289> some

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
valid survival model so there were some

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.640 
valid survival model so there were some
technical<00:00:16.619> conditions<00:00:17.720> including<00:00:18.720> finite

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
technical conditions including finite

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.260 
technical conditions including finite
mean<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:19.980> variance<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.000> random

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
mean and variance for the random

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.670 
mean and variance for the random
variable<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.779> got<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.140> differentiable

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
variable it's got to be differentiable

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.429 
variable it's got to be differentiable
and<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.640> couple<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.000> other<00:00:24.150> logical<00:00:24.960> conditions

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and a couple of other logical conditions

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
and a couple of other logical conditions
such<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.310> got<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> non<00:00:26.970> increasing

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
such as it's got to be a non increasing

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.200 
such as it's got to be a non increasing
function<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.920> evaluated<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:29.699> T<00:00:29.880> equals

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
function and if we evaluated at T equals

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
function and if we evaluated at T equals
0<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.929> probability<00:00:31.410> has<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.130> 1<00:00:32.309> because

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
0 that probability has to be 1 because

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.150 
0 that probability has to be 1 because
we're<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.790> looking<00:00:33.210> into<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> future<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.899> all

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
we're not looking into the future at all

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.240 
we're not looking into the future at all
certainly<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> life<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.730> alive<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.420> now

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
certainly the life is alive right now

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
certainly the life is alive right now
the<00:00:38.250> next<00:00:38.399> thing<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.700> mentioned<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the next thing we mentioned was the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.930 
the next thing we mentioned was the
force<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.379> mortality<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> really

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
force of mortality and this is a really

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
force of mortality and this is a really
important<00:00:42.360> concept<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.989> actuarial<00:00:43.710> science

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
important concept in actuarial science

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.729 
important concept in actuarial science
the<00:00:44.489> force<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> mortality<00:00:45.120> mu<00:00:45.600> X<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:46.440> actually

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the force of mortality mu X we actually

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.229 
the force of mortality mu X we actually
graft<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.340> looks<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.789> real

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
graft what that looks like for real

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
graft what that looks like for real
human<00:00:48.629> mortality<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> couple<00:00:49.710> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
human mortality there are a couple of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.200 
human mortality there are a couple of
interesting<00:00:50.190> features<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.000> graph

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
interesting features of that graph

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
interesting features of that graph
including<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> Occident<00:00:52.289> bump<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.770> around

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
including the Occident bump at around

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.150 
including the Occident bump at around
age<00:00:53.250> 25<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> force<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> mortality<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
age 25 and the force of mortality is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.889 
age 25 and the force of mortality is
useful<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.059> easy<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.480> model<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
useful because it's easy to model that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.950 
useful because it's easy to model that
directly<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:58.739> turn<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.879> into<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
directly and then turn that into the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
directly and then turn that into the
rest<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> survival<00:01:01.890> model<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
rest of the survival model so the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.750 
rest of the survival model so the
definition<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.809> MU<00:01:04.170> X<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.619> mu<00:01:04.860> X<00:01:05.070> plus<00:01:05.309> T<00:01:05.549> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
definition of MU X or mu X plus T is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.859 
definition of MU X or mu X plus T is
actually<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.720> limit<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:08.310> probability<00:01:09.060> /<00:01:09.600> an

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
actually a limit of a probability / an

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.359 
actually a limit of a probability / an
interval<00:01:10.290> length<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> we're<00:01:11.070> taking<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
interval length and we're taking the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
interval length and we're taking the
limit<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.119> interval<00:01:12.450> length<00:01:12.600> goes<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.110> 0

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
limit as that interval length goes to 0

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.999 
limit as that interval length goes to 0
so<00:01:14.070> mu<00:01:14.310> X<00:01:14.520> itself<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> probability<00:01:15.960> mu<00:01:16.770> x

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
so mu X itself is not a probability mu x

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.530 
so mu X itself is not a probability mu x
times<00:01:17.490> an<00:01:17.700> interval<00:01:18.090> length<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
times an interval length is a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
times an interval length is a
probability<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.830> had<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.280> certain<00:01:20.520> small

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
probability we had a certain small

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240 
probability we had a certain small
interval<00:01:21.180> let's<00:01:21.360> say<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.689> day<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.650> mu<00:01:23.040> x

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
interval let's say one day then mu x

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.090 
interval let's say one day then mu x
divided<00:01:23.970> by<00:01:24.000> 365<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> probability

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
divided by 365 would be the probability

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.390 
divided by 365 would be the probability
of<00:01:26.549> someone<00:01:26.850> dying<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.290> day<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.189> turn

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
of someone dying the day that they turn

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.510 
of someone dying the day that they turn
8<00:01:29.700> X<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.299> somewhere<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> period<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.070> 1

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
8 X so somewhere in that period of a 1

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.200 
8 X so somewhere in that period of a 1
over<00:01:32.670> 360<00:01:33.570> fifth<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.170> year<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:35.820> looked<00:01:36.000> at

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
over 360 fifth of a year we looked at

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
over 360 fifth of a year we looked at
five<00:01:36.810> different<00:01:37.110> relationships<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> exist

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
five different relationships that exist

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.840 
five different relationships that exist
between<00:01:38.579> mu<00:01:39.479> X<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> new<00:01:40.140> X<00:01:40.320> plus<00:01:40.530> T<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
between mu X and new X plus T with the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
between mu X and new X plus T with the
remaining<00:01:42.180> functions<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.409> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
remaining functions that we know about a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.889 
remaining functions that we know about a
survival<00:01:44.070> model<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.820> had<00:01:45.000> two<00:01:45.329> ways<00:01:45.600> each

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
survival model so we had two ways each

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.700 
survival model so we had two ways each
of<00:01:46.200> getting<00:01:46.860> mu<00:01:47.250> X<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.790> mu<00:01:47.970> X<00:01:48.119> plus<00:01:48.360> T<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
of getting mu X and mu X plus T from the

other three functions s and little F
namely<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.399> didn't<00:01:53.640> talk<00:01:53.670> about<00:01:54.000> big<00:01:54.149> f

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
namely we really didn't talk about big f

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
namely we really didn't talk about big f
much<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.740> had<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.520> fifth<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
much and then we had one the fifth and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
much and then we had one the fifth and
most<00:01:57.329> important<00:01:57.899> relationship<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.560> how<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
most important relationship is how to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.420 
most important relationship is how to
get<00:01:59.250> s<00:01:59.549> from<00:02:00.360> mu<00:02:00.840> X<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.799> last<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
get s from mu X so that last one is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.590 
get s from mu X so that last one is
probably<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> most<00:02:02.909> important<00:02:03.479> relationship

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
probably the most important relationship

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.709 
probably the most important relationship
if<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.560> figure<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.860> new<00:02:05.219> X<00:02:05.430> from<00:02:06.090> data<00:02:06.450> or

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
if we can figure out new X from data or

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
if we can figure out new X from data or
however<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.200> modeled<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.619> then<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.580> get

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
however we modeled it then we can get

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279 
however we modeled it then we can get
the<00:02:08.910> rest<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> survival<00:02:09.810> function<00:02:09.929> by

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the rest of the survival function by

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.339 
the rest of the survival function by
using<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.770> fifth<00:02:11.039> relationship<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
using that fifth relationship and

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.910 
using that fifth relationship and
finally<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> last<00:02:13.500> thing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
finally the last thing

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.730 
finally the last thing
looked<00:02:14.099> at<00:02:14.250> was<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.940> bizarre<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.170> weird<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
looked at was the bizarre and weird and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.030 
looked at was the bizarre and weird and
very<00:02:16.860> useful<00:02:17.730> actuarial<00:02:18.569> notation<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.650> three

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
very useful actuarial notation so three

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.760 
very useful actuarial notation so three
particular<00:02:20.640> items<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.060> looked<00:02:21.270> at<00:02:21.450> we're<00:02:21.930> TPX

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
particular items we looked at we're TPX

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.010 
particular items we looked at we're TPX
and<00:02:23.099> not<00:02:23.670> simply<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> probability<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.840> a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
and not simply the probability that a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680 
and not simply the probability that a
life<00:02:25.230> age<00:02:25.470> x<00:02:25.739> right<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:26.160> survives<00:02:27.000> at<00:02:27.330> least

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
life age x right now survives at least

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.120 
life age x right now survives at least
two<00:02:28.020> years<00:02:29.330> TQ<00:02:30.330> x<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.080> opposite<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.620> TPX

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
two years TQ x is the opposite of TPX

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.680 
two years TQ x is the opposite of TPX
and<00:02:32.430> that's<00:02:32.700> looking<00:02:32.970> at<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> probability

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and that's looking at the probability

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.020 
and that's looking at the probability
that<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.870> life<00:02:34.110> age<00:02:34.350> x<00:02:34.620> right<00:02:34.830> now<00:02:35.010> doesn't<00:02:35.700> make

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
that a life age x right now doesn't make

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.240 
that a life age x right now doesn't make
it<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.600> two<00:02:36.810> years<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.319> future<00:02:37.470> so

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
it to two years in the future so

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.270 
it to two years in the future so
obviously<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.910> case<00:02:39.180> TP<00:02:39.989> X<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.440> T<00:02:40.560> QX<00:02:41.040> are

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
obviously in this case TP X and T QX are

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.580 
obviously in this case TP X and T QX are
mutually<00:02:42.150> exclusive<00:02:42.180> events<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.470> of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
mutually exclusive events and one of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.930 
mutually exclusive events and one of
them<00:02:43.680> has<00:02:43.830> got<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.160> occur<00:02:44.400> either<00:02:44.580> they're

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
them has got to occur either they're

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.630 
them has got to occur either they're
going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> survive<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.720> tea<00:02:46.319> time<00:02:46.980> period<00:02:47.400> or

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
going to survive that tea time period or

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.180 
going to survive that tea time period or
they're<00:02:47.880> not<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.780> TQ<00:02:49.709> x<00:02:49.860> +<00:02:50.130> 2<00:02:50.160> PX<00:02:51.060> equals<00:02:51.510> 1<00:02:51.930> and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
they're not so TQ x + 2 PX equals 1 and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.860 
they're not so TQ x + 2 PX equals 1 and
finally<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> third<00:02:53.459> thing<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.940> looking<00:02:54.690> at<00:02:54.840> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
finally the third thing is looking at a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.650 
finally the third thing is looking at a
deferred<00:02:55.350> probability<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.310> dying<00:02:56.880> during<00:02:57.330> a

deferred probability of dying during a

deferred probability of dying during a

period of length T starting with a life
HX<00:03:00.720> again<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.680> we're<00:03:02.010> looking<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.400> this

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
HX again but we're looking at this

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.870 
HX again but we're looking at this

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
period you years into the future so you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.020 
period you years into the future so you
deferred<00:03:06.360> TQ<00:03:06.930> X<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> probability

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
deferred TQ X is really the probability

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.759 
deferred TQ X is really the probability

that a life age x dies between you and t

that a life age x dies between you and t

x plus u plus T a little complicated and

x plus u plus T a little complicated and
we<00:03:22.769> also<00:03:22.920> looked<00:03:23.220> at<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.489> number<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.910> ways<00:03:24.120> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
we also looked at a number of ways to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.520 
we also looked at a number of ways to
express<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.380> terms<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.609> those<00:03:26.910> other<00:03:27.180> two

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
express this in terms of those other two

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.020 
express this in terms of those other two
actuarial<00:03:28.530> notations<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.940> was

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
actuarial notations and that was

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.880 
actuarial notations and that was
everything<00:03:30.299> for<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.630> week<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.470> hope<00:03:31.739> you're

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
everything for this week so hope you're

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.380 
everything for this week so hope you're
having<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.160> good<00:03:32.280> weekend<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.880> see<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.359> on
