for what I've done so far lovely dink
there<00:01:49.900> from<00:01:50.110> Chevy<00:01:50.530> but<00:01:51.130> Tim<00:01:51.690> Eaton<00:01:52.690> each

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
there from Chevy but Tim Eaton each

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.020 
there from Chevy but Tim Eaton each
standard<00:01:53.890> shot<00:01:54.160> seems<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.580> lot<00:01:54.730> better<00:01:54.760> than

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
standard shot seems a lot better than

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.370 
standard shot seems a lot better than
he's<00:01:55.120> finesse<00:01:55.510> this<00:01:55.720> year<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.080> don't<00:01:56.260> know<00:01:56.320> if

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
he's finesse this year I don't know if

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.900 
he's finesse this year I don't know if
anyone<00:01:56.620> else<00:01:56.710> has<00:01:56.860> noticed<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.310> but<00:01:57.730> if<00:01:57.850> you

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
anyone else has noticed that but if you

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.220 
anyone else has noticed that but if you
just<00:01:58.090> put<00:01:58.210> your<00:01:58.300> foot<00:01:58.540> right<00:01:58.570> through<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:59.140> he

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
just put your foot right through it he

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.440 
just put your foot right through it he
scores<00:01:59.530> most<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.070> time<00:02:00.280> but<00:02:00.820> his<00:02:00.970> finesses

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
scores most of the time but his finesses

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.230 
scores most of the time but his finesses
seem<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:01.810> be<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.320> little<00:02:02.650> bit<00:02:02.860> hit-and-miss

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
seem to be a little bit hit-and-miss

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.750 
seem to be a little bit hit-and-miss
just<00:02:04.240> my<00:02:04.480> slaps<00:02:04.810> efficient<00:02:05.230> so<00:02:05.440> far<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.160> but

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
just my slaps efficient so far and but

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.090 
just my slaps efficient so far and but
we<00:02:06.850> did<00:02:07.000> much<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.210> win<00:02:07.510> four<00:02:07.840> nil<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:09.070> I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
we did much to win four nil and so I

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.240

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
team but it has low polish Spanish BBV a

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.110 
team but it has low polish Spanish BBV a
centre-back<00:06:08.910> and<00:06:09.950> because<00:06:10.950> he<00:06:10.980> had<00:06:11.220> him<00:06:11.880> I

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
centre-back and because he had him I

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.670 
centre-back and because he had him I
decided<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.660> go<00:06:12.780> for<00:06:12.960> him<00:06:13.140> because<00:06:13.290> he<00:06:13.410> links

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.890 
decided to go for him because he links
up<00:06:13.800> perfectly<00:06:14.130> with<00:06:14.190> javi<00:06:15.060> so<00:06:15.570> the<00:06:15.870> idea

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
up perfectly with javi so the idea

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.130 
up perfectly with javi so the idea
behind<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.860> is<00:06:17.190> that<00:06:17.700> he<00:06:18.630> will<00:06:18.750> slot<00:06:18.990> in

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
behind that is that he will slot in

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.630 
behind that is that he will slot in
perfectly<00:06:19.560> with<00:06:19.830> shavii<00:06:20.250> so<00:06:20.460> we're<00:06:20.550> gonna
