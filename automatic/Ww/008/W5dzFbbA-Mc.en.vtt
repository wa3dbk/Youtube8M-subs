starting by just wrapping the tape

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.730 
starting by just wrapping the tape
around<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.640> top<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.630> glass<00:02:23.900> jar<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.470> then

around the top of the glass jar and then

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.350 
around the top of the glass jar and then
I'm<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.040> going<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.460> run<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.880> next<00:02:26.120> color

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
I'm just going to run the next color

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.970 
I'm just going to run the next color
underneath<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.110> keep<00:02:27.440> wrapping<00:02:27.620> all

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
underneath and just keep wrapping all

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.130 
underneath and just keep wrapping all
the<00:02:28.010> tapes<00:02:28.310> down<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.540> way<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.990> bottom

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
the tapes down all the way to the bottom

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.170 
the tapes down all the way to the bottom
of<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.530> glass<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.280> fully<00:02:31.520> covered<00:02:31.850> in

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
of the glass so it is fully covered in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:51.410 
of the glass so it is fully covered in
different<00:02:32.840> colored<00:02:33.110> tape

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.020 

so<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.560> next<00:02:52.740> one<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.280> little<00:02:53.550> bowl<00:02:53.730> and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
so the next one is this little bowl and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.400 
so the next one is this little bowl and
I've<00:02:54.120> decided<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.690> start<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.200> thicker

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
I've decided to start with the thicker

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.830 
I've decided to start with the thicker
tape<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.069> one<00:02:56.370> because<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.300> bowl<00:02:57.540> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
tape on this one because the bowl is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.440 
tape on this one because the bowl is
like<00:02:58.110> tapered<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.220> sticky<00:02:59.819> tape<00:02:59.970> doesn't

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
like tapered the sticky tape doesn't

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.559 
like tapered the sticky tape doesn't
wrap<00:03:00.660> around<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.170> completely<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.790> neat<00:03:03.090> so

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
wrap around it completely that neat so

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.330 
wrap around it completely that neat so
you<00:03:03.630> will<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.440> squish<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.860> down<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.250> have

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
you will have to squish it down and have

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.100 
you will have to squish it down and have
little<00:03:05.490> creases<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.120> folds<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.810> feel<00:03:06.990> like

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
little creases and folds but I feel like

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.720 
little creases and folds but I feel like
it<00:03:07.230> adds<00:03:07.380> character<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> little<00:03:08.550> bit<00:03:08.640> of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
it adds character and a little bit of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
it adds character and a little bit of
texture<00:03:09.209> which<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.390> kind<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.900> cool<00:03:10.080> as<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:10.380> so

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
texture which is kind of cool as well so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.100 
texture which is kind of cool as well so
with<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.370> jars<00:03:11.730> only<00:03:12.060> able<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.360> get<00:03:12.570> two<00:03:12.840> rows

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
with this jars only able to get two rows

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.080 
with this jars only able to get two rows
stuck<00:03:13.830> down<00:03:14.160> but<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.580> like<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.910> little

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
stuck down but I like the little

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.060 
stuck down but I like the little
combination<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.200> turquoisey<00:03:16.800> mint

are<00:03:20.700> my<00:03:20.760> little<00:03:20.880> jars<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.390> think<00:03:21.660> they're<00:03:21.780> so

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
are my little jars I think they're so

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.660 

so<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:46.020> some<00:03:46.320> really<00:03:46.530> cool<00:03:46.680> storage<00:03:47.040> ideas<00:03:47.520> I
