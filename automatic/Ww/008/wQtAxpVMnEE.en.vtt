00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
I don't know but this is what I was

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
I don't know but this is what I was
using<00:04:08.580> before<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:10.310> if<00:04:11.310> you'll<00:04:11.910> notice<00:04:11.970> this

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
using before and if you'll notice this

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.530 
using before and if you'll notice this
one<00:04:12.570> actually<00:04:12.780> has<00:04:13.080> int<00:04:13.880> which<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:15.030> wizard<00:04:15.299> once

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
one actually has int which a wizard once

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.140 
one actually has int which a wizard once
it<00:04:15.780> has<00:04:15.900> more<00:04:16.200> DPS<00:04:16.769> damage<00:04:17.400> per<00:04:17.519> second<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.000> has

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
it has more DPS damage per second it has

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.539 
it has more DPS damage per second it has
increased<00:04:18.570> attack<00:04:18.870> speed<00:04:18.950> yet<00:04:19.950> for<00:04:20.190> some<00:04:20.370> odd

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
increased attack speed yet for some odd

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.300 
increased attack speed yet for some odd
reason<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:21.000> does<00:04:21.180> 3000<00:04:21.959> damage<00:04:22.109> less<00:04:22.530> well

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
reason it does 3000 damage less well

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.529 
reason it does 3000 damage less well
that's<00:04:23.550> because<00:04:23.700> increased<00:04:24.240> attack<00:04:24.510> speed

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
that's because increased attack speed

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.680 
that's because increased attack speed
kind<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.140> sucks<00:04:25.350> now<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:26.520> do<00:04:26.700> still<00:04:26.970> want<00:04:27.150> it

overpriced right now at least decent
ones<00:06:55.719> are<00:06:55.990> so<00:06:56.319> I<00:06:56.349> can't<00:06:56.770> even<00:06:56.860> afford<00:06:57.039> one<00:06:57.490> with

00:06:57.929 --> 00:06:57.939 
ones are so I can't even afford one with

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:00.959 
ones are so I can't even afford one with
that<00:06:58.090> much<00:06:58.300> money<00:06:59.190> you'll<00:07:00.190> see<00:07:00.400> my<00:07:00.580> HP<00:07:00.759> is

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:00.969 
that much money you'll see my HP is

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:03.149 
that much money you'll see my HP is
pretty<00:07:01.300> low<00:07:01.509> -<00:07:01.750> see<00:07:01.990> how<00:07:02.080> I<00:07:02.110> only<00:07:02.289> have<00:07:02.469> 18,000

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.159 
pretty low - see how I only have 18,000

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:05.339 
pretty low - see how I only have 18,000
and<00:07:03.280> it's<00:07:03.849> perfectly<00:07:04.270> fine<00:07:04.539> for<00:07:04.599> act<00:07:04.990> 3<00:07:05.319> I

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
and it's perfectly fine for act 3 I

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.200 
and it's perfectly fine for act 3 I
don't<00:07:05.620> even<00:07:05.889> I<00:07:06.069> don't<00:07:06.129> die<00:07:06.550> and<00:07:06.610> stuff<00:07:06.969> I<00:07:07.150> don't

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
don't even I don't die and stuff I don't

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.760 
don't even I don't die and stuff I don't
know<00:07:07.360> I<00:07:07.389> don't<00:07:07.569> get<00:07:07.659> one<00:07:07.870> shot<00:07:08.139> anymore<00:07:08.319> so

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
know I don't get one shot anymore so

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.100 
know I don't get one shot anymore so
that's<00:07:09.759> all<00:07:09.879> that<00:07:10.060> matters<00:07:10.330> for<00:07:10.360> a<00:07:10.569> wizard<00:07:10.900> if

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
that's all that matters for a wizard if

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.999 
that's all that matters for a wizard if
you<00:07:11.169> don't<00:07:11.319> get<00:07:11.409> one<00:07:11.560> shot<00:07:11.710> you're<00:07:11.860> good

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009 
you don't get one shot you're good

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.570 
you don't get one shot you're good
damage<00:07:12.969> reduction<00:07:13.300> is<00:07:13.629> 60%<00:07:14.409> which<00:07:15.190> is<00:07:15.370> pretty

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
damage reduction is 60% which is pretty

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.180 
damage reduction is 60% which is pretty
nice<00:07:15.849> all<00:07:16.120> my<00:07:16.300> resists<00:07:16.750> are<00:07:16.930> roughly<00:07:17.830> in<00:07:17.919> the<00:07:17.979> 4

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
nice all my resists are roughly in the 4

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.959 
nice all my resists are roughly in the 4
to<00:07:18.340> 500<00:07:18.520> range<00:07:19.120> and<00:07:20.159> I<00:07:21.159> think<00:07:21.610> that's<00:07:21.789> all<00:07:21.940> the

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:21.969 
to 500 range and I think that's all the

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:23.700 
to 500 range and I think that's all the
important<00:07:22.509> stuff<00:07:22.690> I'll<00:07:22.900> scroll<00:07:23.169> down<00:07:23.229> here<00:07:23.620> if
