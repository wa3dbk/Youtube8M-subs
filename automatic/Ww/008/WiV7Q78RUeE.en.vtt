all<00:00:10.710> right<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.040> originally<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.849> pretty

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
all right so originally I was pretty

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.369 
all right so originally I was pretty
excited<00:00:12.179> about<00:00:12.750> starting<00:00:13.650> week<00:00:14.070> five<00:00:15.379> earlier

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
excited about starting week five earlier

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.859 
excited about starting week five earlier
but<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.220> quickly<00:00:17.430> realized<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.390> made<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> few

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
but I quickly realized I made a few

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.200 
but I quickly realized I made a few
mistakes<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.350> own<00:00:19.670> which<00:00:20.670> prevented<00:00:21.060> me

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
mistakes on my own which prevented me

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.590 
mistakes on my own which prevented me
from<00:00:21.240> continuing<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.109> progress<00:00:23.480> because<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
from continuing to progress because of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.759 
from continuing to progress because of
that<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.840> gonna<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> slightly<00:00:25.560> adjust

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that I'm gonna have to slightly adjust

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.400 
that I'm gonna have to slightly adjust
my<00:00:26.039> strategies<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.760> originally<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:28.320> gonna

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
my strategies see originally I was gonna

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.310 
my strategies see originally I was gonna
be<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> hit<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.210> weights<00:00:30.210> again<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:31.199> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
be to hit the weights again I think I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920 
be to hit the weights again I think I
was<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> 205<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.180> those<00:00:33.690> super

down<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> mucus<00:00:55.890> buildup<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.550> stopped

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
down the mucus buildup I stopped

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
down the mucus buildup I stopped
drinking<00:00:57.329> milk<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.840> several<00:00:58.109> days<00:00:58.820> which

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
drinking milk for several days which

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
drinking milk for several days which
also<00:01:00.030> slowed<00:01:00.480> down<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> materials<00:01:01.440> my

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
also slowed down all the materials my

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.920 
also slowed down all the materials my
body<00:01:01.770> needed<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> continue<00:01:02.399> growing<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:03.059> so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
body needed to continue growing more so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
body needed to continue growing more so
for<00:01:04.350> pretty<00:01:04.559> much<00:01:04.650> most<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.280> week<00:01:05.460> five<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
for pretty much most of week five I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
for pretty much most of week five I
didn't<00:01:06.180> quite<00:01:06.390> progress<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> most

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
didn't quite progress on the most

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.850 
didn't quite progress on the most
important<00:01:08.130> lifts<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.510> which<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
important lifts for this which is the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
important lifts for this which is the
squat<00:01:11.189> mainly<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.090> also<00:01:12.270> had<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> bit<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
squat mainly and also had a bit of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.910 
squat mainly and also had a bit of
trouble<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> stiff<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> deadlift

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
trouble with the stiff like a deadlift

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
trouble with the stiff like a deadlift
and<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.430> got<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.150> better<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and there was I got you better on the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.760 
and there was I got you better on the
overhead<00:01:15.840> press<00:01:16.049> which<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.350> proud<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
overhead press which I'm proud of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
overhead press which I'm proud of
but<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> basis<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.530> super

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
but that's not the basis of the super

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.999 
but that's not the basis of the super
squad<00:01:20.400> routine<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.140> week<00:01:22.740> 5

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
squad routine so because of that week 5

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.760 
squad routine so because of that week 5
I<00:01:23.040> didn't<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.729> very<00:01:23.909> far<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
I didn't get very far so because of that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
I didn't get very far so because of that
I'm<00:01:25.950> also<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.310> gonna<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.610> gained<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.939> my

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
something no squirrels I think they're

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:34.640

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
so I can continue to progress on the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.240 
so I can continue to progress on the
last<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.470> finally<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.130> be

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
last time and then I finally get to be

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.080 
last time and then I finally get to be
done<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.540> been<00:01:42.720> hard<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.350> been<00:01:43.590> good

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
hopefully I can be as optimistic by next

hopefully I can be as optimistic by next
week<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.570> end<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.619> week

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
week at the end of this week

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.530 
week at the end of this week
unless<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.579> totally<00:01:51.939> screwed<00:01:52.090> up<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.390> leaks

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
unless I totally screwed up the leaks

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.300 
unless I totally screwed up the leaks
again<00:01:52.750> like<00:01:52.899> I<00:01:52.990> did<00:01:53.110> last<00:01:53.259> time<00:01:53.530> where<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:54.250> just

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
again like I did last time where I just

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.810 
again like I did last time where I just
finished<00:01:54.880> week<00:01:55.149> five<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.710> thought<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.579> was

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
finished week five and thought I was

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.350 
finished week five and thought I was
starting<00:01:58.479> week<00:01:58.630> four<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:00.880> kind<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.149> dropped

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
starting week four so I kind of dropped

one<00:03:53.350> large<00:03:53.590> intent<00:03:53.950> set<00:03:54.160> such<00:03:54.370> as<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.610> super

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
one large intent set such as the super

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.360 
one large intent set such as the super
squats<00:03:55.150> used<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.870> with<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:58.510> gained

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
squats used and with that I have gained

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.960 
squats used and with that I have gained
nearly<00:04:00.370> 3/4<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.210> an<00:04:01.360> inch<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.570> each<00:04:01.720> arm<00:04:02.200> in

nearly 3/4 of an inch to each arm in

nearly 3/4 of an inch to each arm in

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
about three weeks I'll say it's averaged

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.930 
about three weeks I'll say it's averaged
about<00:04:07.210> a<00:04:07.240> quarter<00:04:07.600> inch<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:08.080> week<00:04:08.290> because<00:04:09.130> my

about a quarter inch a week because my

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.970 
about a quarter inch a week because my

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
middle of the thigh so they've gained

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.120

six weeks of super squats and that's the

six weeks of super squats and that's the
size<00:04:51.640> for<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.880> legs<00:04:52.060> plus<00:04:52.450> my<00:04:52.870> weight<00:04:53.110> get

size for the legs plus my weight get
went<00:04:54.280> up<00:04:54.370> 15<00:04:55.000> pounds<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.330> always<00:04:55.660> weigh<00:04:55.810> in<00:04:55.960> at

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
went up 15 pounds I always weigh in at

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.830 
went up 15 pounds I always weigh in at
least<00:04:56.230> 180<00:04:56.440> now<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:57.760> so<00:04:57.910> from<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.270> growth

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
least 180 now and so from that growth

this year I might do the cycle again
very<00:06:34.000> good<00:06:34.180> program<00:06:34.570> I'm<00:06:35.020> using<00:06:35.290> that<00:06:35.560> as<00:06:35.770> a

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
very good program I'm using that as a

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.550 
very good program I'm using that as a
basis<00:06:36.430> as<00:06:36.580> a<00:06:36.610> jumping<00:06:37.000> stone<00:06:37.240> to<00:06:38.050> facilitate

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
basis as a jumping stone to facilitate

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.460 
basis as a jumping stone to facilitate
further<00:06:38.860> gains<00:06:39.250> primarily<00:06:40.180> in<00:06:40.510> size<00:06:40.810> because

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
further gains primarily in size because

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.870 
further gains primarily in size because
I've<00:06:41.560> been<00:06:41.680> focusing<00:06:42.070> on<00:06:42.190> strength<00:06:42.580> for<00:06:42.850> a

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
I've been focusing on strength for a

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.820 
I've been focusing on strength for a
while<00:06:43.090> so<00:06:43.900> I<00:06:43.960> haven't<00:06:44.230> been<00:06:44.380> getting<00:06:44.530> much

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
while so I haven't been getting much

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.870 
while so I haven't been getting much
bigger<00:06:45.160> until<00:06:45.940> now<00:06:47.280> so<00:06:48.280> I'm<00:06:48.370> starting<00:06:48.820> to

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
bigger until now so I'm starting to

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.410 
bigger until now so I'm starting to
repeat<00:06:49.690> things<00:06:50.080> I<00:06:50.500> have<00:06:51.430> a<00:06:51.460> horrible<00:06:51.910> tendency

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
repeat things I have a horrible tendency

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.240 
repeat things I have a horrible tendency
of<00:06:52.450> doing<00:06:52.600> that<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:53.170> I'm<00:06:53.350> not<00:06:53.470> always<00:06:53.740> direct

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
of doing that to I'm not always direct

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.500 
of doing that to I'm not always direct
to<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:54.460> point<00:06:54.610> so<00:06:54.880> I'm<00:06:54.970> just<00:06:55.060> gonna<00:06:55.180> end<00:06:55.390> this

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
to the point so I'm just gonna end this

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:26.080 
to the point so I'm just gonna end this
now<00:06:55.950> before<00:06:56.950> I<00:06:57.160> ramble
