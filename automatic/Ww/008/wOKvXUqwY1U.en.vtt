 I like working a lot and I am a dynamic woman 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.230

 little more than two years 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.720
 I had to do 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.189
 and kick-start the children's stay program 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.880
 which is a program that gives security

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.230
 to many families 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.230
 and many working mothers 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.200

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.010
 that make 130 thousand children in a safe and well-cared place 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.000
 and that in addition 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.300
 well, he was supporting more than two hundred thousand 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.240
 moms and dads also 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 they will work quietly knowing that their children are 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130
 and insurance 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.970
 What else have I done? 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 I also worked on transparency and fighting corruption 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.090
 many years 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.360
 both of the test the public sector as the private 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
 I was in Mexican transparency that is a citizen organization 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.160
 work the fight against corruption 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.890
 and it touched me 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.160
 participate for one hundred an observation program 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.600
 citizen to government purchases 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.090
 so we see many tenders 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.260
 the citizen witness 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.910
 with which it was possible to guarantee transparency 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.050
 of these processes 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.140
 as well 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.300
 I worked 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.310
 in the public service and in the federal institute of access to 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.140
 information 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.250
 pure greens of public service 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.880
 creation 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.599
 they do it since the congress of the law of access to information that is 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.940
 a law that today allows citizens to know the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.909
 government information 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.499
 it is a law 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.939
 that generate much more then transparency and accountability 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.609
 I worked also many years ago at home alliance which is an organization 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.659
 citizen who works for street children 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.309
 for me it was a very valuable power of power 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.299
 contribute 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.849
 several children will leave the street 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.170
 and they could be in a place where they will hide 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:47.869
 is undoubtedly both el alarcón casa alianza and work in the 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:51.060
 child stays program the most valuable cálculo he told me 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.659
 is that I could be close to people 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:54.879
 and that I could 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.879
 listen to people and know 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.439
 many 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.199
 Realities 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.079
 why today 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.319
 continue working 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.970
