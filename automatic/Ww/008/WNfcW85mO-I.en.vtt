00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:13.680
 We introduce ball stop of ribbon embroidery 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:18.890
 This is a wooden stick used for ribbon embroidery 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:24.430
 Stores are sold in this way 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.430
 The width of the ribbon will use 5 mm this time 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.010
 Cut the tip of the ribbon diagonally 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.510
 It is to make it easy to pass the needle 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.510
 I will go through 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:55.269
 If you embroidered as it is , the ribbon will come off the needle 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:59.010
 Embroidery is to secure it to the needle in the hesitation 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.010
 It is a way to fix 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:11.860
 Flatten the ribbon 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.860
 Drop the needle at a point about 1.5 cm from the tip 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.970
 Remove the needle as it is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:28.140
 It becomes such a state 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 I pull down the part that I cut diagonally earlier 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:40.040
 It is in the state which pulled all by this 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.040
 I will bring this meeting place to this place 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.010
 Press tasted part in the finger 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.590
 Pull the longer one 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.850
 Where I met again 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:00.240
 Press with your finger and pull the longer one 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:05.450
 Bring up the mountain to paste the intersecting portions 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.450
 This will fix the ribbon when you play 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.980
 At an angle 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.980
 I will turn to the bottom 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.870
 The shape is ready now 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.390
 The ribbon is firmly fixed 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.120
 Next is the ball stop method 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.120
 I will flatten the ribbon 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.960
 I turn the tip about 1 cm 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.800
 Drop the needle in the middle of the folded part 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.430
 Pull the needle as it is 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.300
 This will be the feeling of stopping the ball 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.080
