00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
whatnot in front of me the chicken coop

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.839 
whatnot in front of me the chicken coop
and<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.680> lighting<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.250> still<00:00:26.400> hasn't<00:00:26.670> fixed

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and the lighting is still hasn't fixed

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.339 
and the lighting is still hasn't fixed
yet<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.420> haven't<00:00:27.510> decided<00:00:27.810> how<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> want

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
yet because I haven't decided how I want

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
yet because I haven't decided how I want
to<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.500> about<00:00:28.650> doing<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.310> think<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.910> torches

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
to go about doing it I think the torches

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
to go about doing it I think the torches
might<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> little<00:00:30.689> too<00:00:30.810> tacky<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:32.489> barn

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
might be a little too tacky the barn

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.340 
might be a little too tacky the barn
actually<00:00:33.329> came<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.809> bigger<00:00:34.050> than<00:00:34.230> I
