00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
here we are just going to walk through

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.849 
here we are just going to walk through
dad<00:00:04.970> show<00:00:05.689> you<00:00:05.749> where<00:00:06.080> I'm<00:00:06.229> up<00:00:06.319> to<00:00:06.529> with<00:00:06.680> this

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
dad show you where I'm up to with this

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.380 
dad show you where I'm up to with this
beast<00:00:07.330> so<00:00:08.330> basically<00:00:10.030> I'm<00:00:11.030> doing<00:00:11.300> the

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.390 
beast so basically I'm doing the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.179 
beast so basically I'm doing the
longitudinals<00:00:14.050> everything<00:00:15.050> the<00:00:15.740> top<00:00:15.950> ones

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
longitudinals everything the top ones

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.999 
longitudinals everything the top ones
done<00:00:16.550> that's<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:16.849> chine<00:00:17.119> log<00:00:17.330> right<00:00:17.859> and<00:00:18.859> then

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
done that's the chine log right and then

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.859 
done that's the chine log right and then
it's<00:00:19.220> this<00:00:19.400> bottom<00:00:19.789> one<00:00:19.820> down<00:00:19.970> here<00:00:20.480> has<00:00:20.570> still

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
it's this bottom one down here has still

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.120 
it's this bottom one down here has still
got<00:00:21.019> to<00:00:21.140> be<00:00:21.230> curved<00:00:21.650> around<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.130> front<00:00:24.130> it's

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
got to be curved around the front it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.649 
got to be curved around the front it's
about<00:00:25.339> the<00:00:25.460> same<00:00:25.669> on<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.179> other<00:00:26.210> side<00:00:26.390> that's

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:26.659 
about the same on the other side that's

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.999 
about the same on the other side that's
a<00:00:26.779> bit<00:00:26.900> further<00:00:27.109> along<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.499> other<00:00:27.589> side<00:00:27.679> so<00:00:27.949> I

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
a bit further along the other side so I

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.829 
a bit further along the other side so I
just<00:00:28.189> got<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.429> take<00:00:29.029> that<00:00:29.239> around<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.689> join

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
just got to take that around and join

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.500 
just got to take that around and join
that<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.730> bow<00:00:31.909> and<00:00:34.270> basically<00:00:35.270> as

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
that to the to the bow and basically as

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.080 
that to the to the bow and basically as
you<00:00:35.600> can<00:00:35.750> see<00:00:35.930> here<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:36.770> all<00:00:37.090> reasonably

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
you can see here it's all reasonably

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.500 
you can see here it's all reasonably
looking<00:00:38.930> good<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.710> pretty<00:00:40.070> true<00:00:40.510> that's

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
looking good and pretty true that's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.220 
looking good and pretty true that's
pretty<00:00:41.809> straight<00:00:43.329> there's<00:00:44.329> a<00:00:44.420> point<00:00:44.750> at<00:00:44.989> one

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
pretty straight there's a point at one

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.200 
pretty straight there's a point at one
point<00:00:45.440> where<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.829> wasn't<00:00:46.190> but<00:00:46.399> I<00:00:46.460> just<00:00:46.820> started

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
point where it wasn't but I just started

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.029 
point where it wasn't but I just started
putting<00:00:47.660> in<00:00:47.870> little<00:00:48.109> there's<00:00:48.679> a<00:00:48.769> bit<00:00:48.890> of<00:00:48.920> a

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
putting in little there's a bit of a

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.419 
putting in little there's a bit of a
kink<00:00:49.250> up<00:00:49.489> there<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:50.890> just<00:00:51.890> started<00:00:52.219> using

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
kink up there I just started using

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.419 
kink up there I just started using
little<00:00:52.989> wooden<00:00:53.989> wedges<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.589> then<00:00:54.739> one<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:55.129> one

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
little wooden wedges and then one of one

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.000 
little wooden wedges and then one of one
of<00:00:55.460> them<00:00:55.699> is<00:00:56.149> really<00:00:56.539> out<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.620> I'm<00:00:57.710> gonna<00:00:57.829> have

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
of them is really out so I'm gonna have

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.029 
of them is really out so I'm gonna have
to<00:00:58.039> build<00:00:58.249> that<00:00:58.460> up<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:59.300> join<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.769> and<00:01:00.769> put

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
to build that up to join it and put

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.650 
to build that up to join it and put
another<00:01:01.129> I'm<00:01:01.670> just<00:01:01.940> gonna<00:01:02.030> put<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.329> lot<00:01:02.539> of

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
another I'm just gonna put a lot of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.170 
another I'm just gonna put a lot of
strip<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.350> wood<00:01:03.499> along<00:01:03.739> here<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.759> take<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.089> out

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
strip of wood along here to take it out

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.200 
strip of wood along here to take it out
flush<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.159> plane<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:07.340> down<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.060> other

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
flush and plane it down and the other

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.880 
flush and plane it down and the other
side<00:01:08.329> will<00:01:08.659> be<00:01:08.720> thicker<00:01:09.079> and<00:01:09.320> sort<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.650> stand

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
side will be thicker and sort of stand

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.200 
side will be thicker and sort of stand
out<00:01:10.009> than<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.340> rest<00:01:10.520> but<00:01:10.610> already<00:01:10.939> matter

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
out than the rest but already matter

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.270 
out than the rest but already matter
won't<00:01:11.600> be<00:01:11.689> noticeable<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.040> was<00:01:13.130> either

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
won't be noticeable but it was either

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.639 
won't be noticeable but it was either
that<00:01:13.430> or<00:01:14.049> cut<00:01:15.049> through<00:01:15.350> all<00:01:16.310> of<00:01:16.369> these<00:01:16.880> um<00:01:17.649> cut

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
that or cut through all of these um cut

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.440 
that or cut through all of these um cut
through<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.009> joint<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.210> joint

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
through this joint here and that joint

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.920 
through this joint here and that joint
there<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.549> reglue<00:01:22.549> it<00:01:22.579> and<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.329> knew<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.750> knew

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
there and reglue it and I knew I knew

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.600 
there and reglue it and I knew I knew
before<00:01:24.079> I<00:01:24.290> put<00:01:24.439> these<00:01:24.560> longitudinals<00:01:25.250> on<00:01:25.399> that

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
before I put these longitudinals on that

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.460 
before I put these longitudinals on that
it<00:01:25.700> was<00:01:25.759> out<00:01:25.939> of<00:01:25.970> alignment<00:01:26.119> because<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.200> kind

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
it was out of alignment because I kind

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.230 
it was out of alignment because I kind
of<00:01:27.500> like<00:01:27.619> laid<00:01:27.920> stuff<00:01:28.340> up<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:28.850> seemed

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
of like laid stuff up to it and seemed

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.929 
of like laid stuff up to it and seemed
that<00:01:29.420> there<00:01:29.540> was<00:01:29.659> something<00:01:29.930> weird<00:01:30.110> going<00:01:30.229> on

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
that there was something weird going on

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.719 
that there was something weird going on
but<00:01:31.939> I<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.270> decided<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:33.009> yeah<00:01:34.040> worry<00:01:34.700> about

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
but I just decided to yeah worry about

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.770 
but I just decided to yeah worry about
it<00:01:35.020> just<00:01:36.020> kind<00:01:36.229> of<00:01:36.259> build<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.649> up<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.540> say<00:01:38.540> if

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
it just kind of build it up and say if

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.510 
it just kind of build it up and say if
something<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.229> too<00:01:39.439> far<00:01:39.649> out<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:39.860> just<00:01:40.159> cut<00:01:40.369> it

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
something is too far out I just cut it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.190 
something is too far out I just cut it
cut<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.210> back<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.630> make<00:01:41.750> sure<00:01:41.899> that<00:01:42.079> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
cut it back and make sure that the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600 
cut it back and make sure that the
alignment<00:01:42.439> of<00:01:42.619> longitudinals<00:01:43.250> right<00:01:43.430> now

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
alignment of longitudinals right now

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.609 
alignment of longitudinals right now
just<00:01:43.789> now<00:01:43.939> I<00:01:43.969> can<00:01:44.210> plane<00:01:44.810> something<00:01:45.140> back<00:01:45.439> if

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
just now I can plane something back if

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.920 
just now I can plane something back if
it's<00:01:45.799> sticking<00:01:46.399> too<00:01:46.579> far<00:01:46.789> out<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.780> far

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
it's sticking too far out but so far

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.179 
it's sticking too far out but so far
everything<00:01:48.170> else<00:01:48.380> has<00:01:48.530> been<00:01:48.560> pretty<00:01:48.829> accurate

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
everything else has been pretty accurate

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.190 
everything else has been pretty accurate
was<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:49.549> that<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:49.820> problem<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.960> one's

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
was just that one problem this one's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.700 
was just that one problem this one's
done<00:01:51.619> up<00:01:51.799> until<00:01:51.890> these<00:01:52.250> last<00:01:52.549> two<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:53.680> what<00:01:54.680> I

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
done up until these last two here what I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.520 
done up until these last two here what I
do<00:01:55.000> like<00:01:56.000> when<00:01:56.210> I<00:01:56.240> cut<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.600> notches<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.990> you

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
do like when I cut the notches in you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.170 
do like when I cut the notches in you
know<00:01:57.649> they're<00:01:57.950> cause<00:01:58.250> these<00:01:58.520> big<00:01:58.729> gaps<00:01:58.969> on

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
know they're cause these big gaps on

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.539 
know they're cause these big gaps on
these<00:01:59.329> curving<00:01:59.750> ones<00:02:00.070> because<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.159> just<00:02:01.369> did

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
these curving ones because I just did

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.760 
these curving ones because I just did
all<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.820> notches<00:02:02.180> like<00:02:02.359> square<00:02:02.719> but<00:02:03.020> what<00:02:03.560> I'm

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
all the notches like square but what I'm

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.380 
all the notches like square but what I'm
doing<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:04.159> I'm<00:02:04.280> cutting<00:02:04.609> a<00:02:04.670> bunch<00:02:04.820> of<00:02:05.030> wedges

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
doing is I'm cutting a bunch of wedges

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.510 
doing is I'm cutting a bunch of wedges
with<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.659> circular<00:02:06.079> saw<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:06.409> chopping<00:02:07.399> them

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
with the circular saw in chopping them

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.359 
with the circular saw in chopping them
in<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.330> gluing<00:02:09.319> them<00:02:09.440> in

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
in and gluing them in

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.020 
in and gluing them in
so<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.150> after<00:02:11.720> their<00:02:12.700> after<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.790> fact

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
so that after their after the fact

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.070 
so that after their after the fact
sometimes<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:16.519> points<00:02:17.480> looking<00:02:17.750> pretty<00:02:17.930> ugly

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
sometimes the points looking pretty ugly

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.540 
sometimes the points looking pretty ugly
here<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:19.090> cut<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.209> completely<00:02:20.360> wrong<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:22.430> it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
here I cut it completely wrong but it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.089 
here I cut it completely wrong but it
doesn't<00:02:22.819> matter<00:02:22.940> off<00:02:23.209> bog<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.080> up<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.530> fix<00:02:24.890> it

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
doesn't matter off bog it up and fix it

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.490 
doesn't matter off bog it up and fix it
somewhere<00:02:25.489> it's<00:02:26.480> not<00:02:26.540> pretty

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.350 

you<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.650> see<00:02:30.830> but<00:02:31.760> all<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:31.970> its<00:02:32.090> got<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.239> be

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
you can see but all of its got to be

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.770 
you can see but all of its got to be
coated<00:02:32.569> by<00:02:33.970> all<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.269> got<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.480> be<00:02:35.540> coated

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
coated by all of it's got to be coated

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.039 
coated by all of it's got to be coated
by<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.379> plywood<00:02:36.680> anyway<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> lot<00:02:38.959> of

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
by a plywood anyway so be a lot of

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.140 
by a plywood anyway so be a lot of
forgiveness<00:02:39.230> there<00:02:39.739> hopefully<00:02:40.150> that's

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
forgiveness there hopefully that's

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.009 
forgiveness there hopefully that's
looking<00:02:41.390> pretty<00:02:41.420> good<00:02:41.599> though<00:02:41.840> that

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
looking pretty good though that

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:50.470 
looking pretty good though that
curvature<00:02:46.989> yeah<00:02:48.489> basically<00:02:49.489> over<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.329> last

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
curvature yeah basically over the last

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.270 
curvature yeah basically over the last
bit<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.780> work<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.290> got<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.530> do<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.769> see<00:02:52.130> that

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
bit of work I got to do is see that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.559 
bit of work I got to do is see that
stripped<00:02:52.640> down<00:02:52.700> they're<00:02:53.000> running<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.329> the

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
stripped down they're running on the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.400 
stripped down they're running on the
bottom<00:02:53.840> they<00:02:54.380> cut<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.799> up<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:56.410> basically

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
bottom they cut that up and basically

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.910 
bottom they cut that up and basically
every<00:02:57.739> single<00:02:58.129> every<00:02:59.090> single<00:03:01.959> one<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.319> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
every single every single one of the the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.520 
every single every single one of the the
floor<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.450> whole<00:03:05.629> floor<00:03:05.959> and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
floor and the and the whole floor and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.039 
floor and the and the whole floor and
the<00:03:06.739> actual<00:03:07.040> interior<00:03:07.519> floor<00:03:07.819> needs<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.900> have

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
the actual interior floor needs to have

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.490 
the actual interior floor needs to have
like<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.310> supporting<00:03:10.310> strip<00:03:10.519> either<00:03:10.700> side<00:03:11.500> all

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
like a supporting strip either side all

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.530 
like a supporting strip either side all
the<00:03:12.739> way<00:03:12.829> up<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.040> down<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.220> boat<00:03:13.540> which

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
the way up and down the boat which

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.150 
the way up and down the boat which
basically<00:03:15.079> corresponds<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:17.769> these<00:03:18.769> members

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
basically corresponds to these members

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.770 
basically corresponds to these members
here<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.470> haven't<00:03:21.769> done<00:03:21.859> them<00:03:22.040> yet<00:03:22.660> but<00:03:23.660> I'm

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
here so I haven't done them yet but I'm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.780 
here so I haven't done them yet but I'm
not<00:03:24.019> looking<00:03:24.650> pretty<00:03:24.799> good<00:03:25.040> there's<00:03:25.639> my

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
not looking pretty good there's my

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.690 
not looking pretty good there's my
transom<00:03:26.889> gave<00:03:27.889> me<00:03:28.010> all<00:03:28.099> kinds<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.459> headaches

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
transom gave me all kinds of headaches

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.610 
transom gave me all kinds of headaches
not<00:03:29.000> least<00:03:29.269> because<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.750> didn't<00:03:30.019> get<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.349> glue

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
not least because I didn't get the glue

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.589 
not least because I didn't get the glue
mix<00:03:30.829> right<00:03:31.099> the<00:03:31.549> one<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.910> only<00:03:31.970> time<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:32.329> didn't

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
mix right the one and only time I didn't

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.940 
mix right the one and only time I didn't
get<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.780> glue<00:03:32.959> mix<00:03:33.139> right<00:03:33.319> was<00:03:33.470> on<00:03:33.620> one<00:03:33.799> of<00:03:33.829> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
get the glue mix right was on one of the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.059 
get the glue mix right was on one of the
most<00:03:34.040> complicated<00:03:34.370> pieces<00:03:36.040> variety<00:03:37.040> of

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
most complicated pieces variety of

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.170 
most complicated pieces variety of
Murphy's<00:03:37.549> Law<00:03:37.730> I'm<00:03:37.940> sure<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:39.880> yeah<00:03:40.880> but<00:03:41.060> um

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
Murphy's Law I'm sure and yeah but um

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.110 
Murphy's Law I'm sure and yeah but um
that's<00:03:41.389> looking<00:03:41.900> cool<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:42.910> breezin<00:03:43.910> ibly

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
that's looking cool and breezin ibly

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.970 
that's looking cool and breezin ibly
