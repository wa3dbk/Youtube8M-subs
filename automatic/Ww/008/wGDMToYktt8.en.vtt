 children perhaps the prototype of piñata 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.820
 served as Chinese figures dancing

 coloring in bright colors 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.570
 The base of piñata is traditionally cardboard but 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.790
 Our version is simplified We tear newspaper 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.310
 dunk it in the water the first layer will be 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.649
 water papier-mâché to be 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.270

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.440
 be ordered as if for 5-6 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.729
 in a week the shop would manage to make ours 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.080

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.080
 add some more water. 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.739
 take a glass of flour and add glue here 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.720
 pva glue pva if you have full 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.000
 the bottle is literally 1 4 thousand more 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.100
 will need to mix thoroughly and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.670
 again and tear the newspaper take a piece of paper 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.150
 dipped in this mixture 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.680
 as well as for the first time peel off the ball 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.500
 also completely in a chaotic manner like 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.890
 do you like to make pinata strong 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.090
 apply 3-4 layers of papier-mâché and so on. 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.069
 an hour and a half to dry and work 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.400
 we have a ready-made form for pinata 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.230
 and which we will further decorate 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.900
 suitable corrugated paper cut 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.209
 taped glue pva candy and candy 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.269
 can glue understood in the chaotic 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.970
 okay we close one tape the other one 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.450
 Victoria decoration takes about two 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.269
 o'clock 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.470
 stop stop what about the stuffing 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.810
 inside papier mache 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.650
 we take scissors with you and cut 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.049
 the ball can be very neatly done 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.049
 an incision he will not burst 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.079
 Now this well, actually get the ball 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:26.790
 and further and that our sweets were ours 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.790
 concepts we make a hole 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.330
 this hole was enough for us to 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.910
 fall asleep our pack and serpentine i 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.190
 cooked blanks have been sticks 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.040
 you can fasten to each other about the thread 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.950
 hole will need 3 on the south and 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.840
 the north pole of the ball and in the middle so 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.810
 it is more convenient to pass the rope on which 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.770
 pinata will hang middle hole 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.230
 falling asleep candy and other tinsel 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.630
 immured from further pinyatu 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.110
 hooks the ceiling or on 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.900
 tree 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.120
 the birthday boy is given a stick tied 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.519
 eyes and unwind in place 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.100
 the remaining children should confuse the batter's box and 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.450
 he tries to find and break the pinata 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.729
 to get candy contents i 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.380
