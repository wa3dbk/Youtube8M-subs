00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
back so a lot of times if that bar is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.420 
back so a lot of times if that bar is
just<00:00:59.219> very<00:00:59.489> slightly<00:00:59.910> forward<00:01:01.430> that'll

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
just very slightly forward that'll

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
just very slightly forward that'll
happen<00:01:02.579> despite<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> looking<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:04.080> good

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
happen despite it looking pretty good

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.429
