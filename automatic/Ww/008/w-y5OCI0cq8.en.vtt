can be used to take your current horn to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.130 
can be used to take your current horn to
the<00:03:09.569> next<00:03:09.840> level<00:03:10.190> sweet<00:03:11.190> or<00:03:11.519> fwe<00:03:12.120> stands<00:03:12.900> for

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
the next level sweet or fwe stands for

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.839 
the next level sweet or fwe stands for
standing<00:03:13.500> wave<00:03:13.650> efficiency<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.489> it's

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
standing wave efficiency and it's

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.240 
standing wave efficiency and it's
nothing<00:03:15.269> more<00:03:15.480> than<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:16.080> measure<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.709> how<00:03:17.190> much

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
nothing more than a measure of how much

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.759 
nothing more than a measure of how much
energy<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:18.090> going<00:03:18.269> into<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.660> trumpet<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.650> an

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
energy is going into a trumpet or in an

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.979 
energy is going into a trumpet or in an
acoustic<00:03:20.430> instrument<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.000> then<00:03:21.330> how<00:03:21.810> much

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
acoustic instrument and then how much

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.289 
acoustic instrument and then how much
comes<00:03:22.230> out<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.010> efficiency<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
comes out so the efficiency is the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.539 
comes out so the efficiency is the
difference<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.989> those<00:03:25.470> two<00:03:25.549> measures

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
difference of those two measures

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.270 
difference of those two measures
basically<00:03:27.330> swe<00:03:28.290> or<00:03:28.709> standing<00:03:29.130> wave

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
basically swe or standing wave

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.390 
basically swe or standing wave
efficiency<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.410> how<00:03:31.410> much<00:03:31.650> energy<00:03:32.010> is

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
efficiency is how much energy is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.960 
efficiency is how much energy is
preserved<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.900> wave<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.500> we<00:03:34.799> hear<00:03:35.099> we

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
preserved in the wave that we hear we

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.059 
preserved in the wave that we hear we
can<00:03:36.150> improve<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.900> standing<00:03:37.290> wave<00:03:37.410> efficiency

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
reflects on these two spots because you

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.760 
reflects on these two spots because you
have<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.850> soft<00:04:39.150> palate<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:39.660> your<00:04:39.780> mouth<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.650> is

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
have a soft palate in your mouth that is

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.010 
have a soft palate in your mouth that is
like<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:40.950> wall<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.520> then<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:42.000> have<00:04:42.479> impedance

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
like a wall and then you have impedance

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.980 
like a wall and then you have impedance
which<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.650> from<00:04:43.919> wave<00:04:44.550> or<00:04:44.850> air<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:45.720> just

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
which is from wave or air that is just

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.050 
which is from wave or air that is just
standing<00:04:46.289> in<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.530> room<00:04:46.710> so<00:04:46.919> a<00:04:47.460> wave<00:04:47.880> is

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
standing in the room so a wave is

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.610 
standing in the room so a wave is
reflecting<00:04:48.630> between<00:04:48.990> these<00:04:49.139> two<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.380> a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
reflecting between these two and a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.440 
reflecting between these two and a
simpler<00:04:50.010> way<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.220> imagining<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.240> just

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
simpler way of imagining it is just

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.960 
simpler way of imagining it is just
imagine<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:51.990> long<00:04:52.229> tube<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.520> have<00:04:53.700> a<00:04:53.729> wave

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
imagine a long tube and you have a wave

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.439 
imagine a long tube and you have a wave
that's<00:04:54.000> bouncing<00:04:54.690> from<00:04:54.810> either<00:04:55.050> ends

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
that's bouncing from either ends

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.899 
that's bouncing from either ends
so<00:04:56.659> if<00:04:56.779> you<00:04:56.960> add<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.379> sweet<00:04:57.889> mouth<00:04:58.069> piece<00:04:58.340> or

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
so if you add a sweet mouth piece or

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.209 
so if you add a sweet mouth piece or
sweet<00:04:59.330> trim<00:04:59.569> kids<00:04:59.840> or<00:05:00.080> both<00:05:00.409> then<00:05:01.009> you're

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
sweet trim kids or both then you're

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.879

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
efficiency and more solid attacks better

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.809 
efficiency and more solid attacks better
flexibility<00:05:09.229> in<00:05:09.379> most<00:05:09.559> cases<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.370> long<00:05:10.550> as<00:05:10.699> the

the overtone series on every note is

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.239 
and all of this is because you're
preventing<00:05:26.599> losing<00:05:27.199> that<00:05:27.349> energy<00:05:27.800> in<00:05:28.009> a

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.249 
preventing losing that energy in a

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.640 
preventing losing that energy in a
standard<00:05:28.610> horn<00:05:28.819> standard<00:05:29.360> horns<00:05:29.779> don't

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
standard horn standard horns don't

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.290 
standard horn standard horns don't
actually<00:05:31.069> sound<00:05:31.339> like<00:05:31.520> they<00:05:31.729> should<00:05:32.029> in

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
actually sound like they should in

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.659 
actually sound like they should in
theory<00:05:32.710> simply<00:05:33.710> because<00:05:34.039> there's<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:34.490> much

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
theory simply because there's so much

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.179 
theory simply because there's so much
energy<00:05:34.999> being<00:05:35.659> lost<00:05:35.839> in<00:05:36.080> some<00:05:36.259> places<00:05:36.499> and<00:05:36.889> in

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:37.189 
energy being lost in some places and in

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.760 
energy being lost in some places and in
many<00:05:37.580> cases<00:05:37.699> there's<00:05:38.659> extra<00:05:39.229> waves<00:05:39.409> that<00:05:39.710> are

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
many cases there's extra waves that are

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.640 
many cases there's extra waves that are
fed<00:05:40.219> into<00:05:40.729> your<00:05:40.969> standing<00:05:41.150> wave<00:05:41.650> creating

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
fed into your standing wave creating

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.129 
fed into your standing wave creating
basically<00:05:43.249> a<00:05:43.639> corrupt<00:05:44.060> wave<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.719> is<00:05:44.930> necessary

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
basically a corrupt wave it is necessary

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.929 
basically a corrupt wave it is necessary
to<00:05:45.529> sound<00:05:45.770> like<00:05:45.889> a<00:05:45.919> trumpet<00:05:46.129> to<00:05:46.460> have<00:05:46.610> some<00:05:46.819> of

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:46.939 
to sound like a trumpet to have some of

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.119 
to sound like a trumpet to have some of
that<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.360> that's<00:05:47.899> simply<00:05:48.289> because<00:05:48.319> that

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
that and that's simply because that

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.189 
that and that's simply because that
brightness<00:05:49.669> is<00:05:50.120> an<00:05:50.569> effect<00:05:50.899> of<00:05:51.080> an

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
brightness is an effect of an

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.249 
brightness is an effect of an
inefficiency<00:05:51.740> in<00:05:51.979> your<00:05:52.129> horn<00:05:52.399> so<00:05:52.789> we<00:05:53.539> really

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
inefficiency in your horn so we really

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.200 
inefficiency in your horn so we really
encourage<00:05:54.649> people<00:05:55.249> to<00:05:55.279> have<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.639> whitecaps

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
encourage people to have the whitecaps

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.959 
encourage people to have the whitecaps
for<00:05:56.839> lead<00:05:57.110> or<00:05:57.409> bright<00:05:57.680> sizzling<00:05:58.339> playing<00:05:58.699> and

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
for lead or bright sizzling playing and

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.420 
for lead or bright sizzling playing and
the<00:05:59.659> medium<00:06:00.050> are<00:06:00.199> heavier<00:06:00.499> caps<00:06:00.800> for

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
the medium are heavier caps for

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.719 
the medium are heavier caps for
classical<00:06:02.089> widgets<00:06:03.020> regular<00:06:03.800> jazz<00:06:04.069> playing

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
classical widgets regular jazz playing

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.570 
classical widgets regular jazz playing
and<00:06:05.149> all<00:06:05.839> the<00:06:05.930> way<00:06:06.020> to<00:06:06.080> like<00:06:06.439> solo<00:06:06.770> sounds<00:06:07.279> but

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
and all the way to like solo sounds but

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.129 
and all the way to like solo sounds but
the<00:06:07.699> heaviest<00:06:07.999> gaps<00:06:08.360> are<00:06:08.659> going<00:06:08.899> to<00:06:08.960> be<00:06:09.020> the

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
the heaviest gaps are going to be the

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.379 
the heaviest gaps are going to be the
most<00:06:09.289> efficient<00:06:09.889> at<00:06:10.099> all<00:06:10.310> times<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:11.029> there's

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
most efficient at all times and there's

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.659 
most efficient at all times and there's
often<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.080> controversy<00:06:12.770> over<00:06:12.800> whether<00:06:13.279> or<00:06:13.550> not

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
often a controversy over whether or not

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.550 
often a controversy over whether or not
you<00:06:13.849> need<00:06:13.969> all<00:06:14.149> three<00:06:14.569> or<00:06:14.839> if<00:06:15.139> you<00:06:15.229> just<00:06:15.259> need

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
you need all three or if you just need

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.920 
you need all three or if you just need
one<00:06:15.860> on<00:06:16.009> the<00:06:16.129> third<00:06:16.430> cap<00:06:16.819> and<00:06:17.240> everyone<00:06:17.719> has<00:06:17.899> a

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
one on the third cap and everyone has a

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.899 
one on the third cap and everyone has a
different<00:06:18.259> scenario<00:06:18.680> of<00:06:18.949> what<00:06:19.069> works<00:06:19.249> best<00:06:19.610> in

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
different scenario of what works best in

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.269 
different scenario of what works best in
the<00:06:20.209> lab<00:06:20.389> and<00:06:20.659> on<00:06:20.779> an<00:06:20.930> oscilloscope<00:06:21.279> three

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:22.279 
the lab and on an oscilloscope three

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:25.989 
the lab and on an oscilloscope three
heavy<00:06:22.939> caps<00:06:23.389> on<00:06:23.779> all<00:06:24.379> three<00:06:24.919> bottoms<00:06:25.279> is<00:06:25.520> more

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:25.999 
heavy caps on all three bottoms is more

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.119 
heavy caps on all three bottoms is more
efficient<00:06:26.449> than<00:06:26.569> any<00:06:26.779> other<00:06:27.020> scenario<00:06:27.259> it's

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:28.129 
efficient than any other scenario it's

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.040 
efficient than any other scenario it's
much<00:06:28.370> more<00:06:28.580> efficient<00:06:28.969> so<00:06:29.270> that's<00:06:29.719> what<00:06:29.870> we

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
much more efficient so that's what we

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.869 
much more efficient so that's what we
recommend<00:06:30.229> if<00:06:30.680> you<00:06:30.800> want<00:06:31.009> the<00:06:31.249> best<00:06:31.459> attacks

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
recommend if you want the best attacks

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.089 
recommend if you want the best attacks
and<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.240> best<00:06:32.719> lining<00:06:33.169> and<00:06:33.319> about<00:06:33.680> the<00:06:33.919> most
