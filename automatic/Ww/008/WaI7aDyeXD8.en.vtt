00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fiber the second level of fiber fiber

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.899

what<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> didn't<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.700> how

that happened but one of the scouts

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
that happened but one of the scouts
probably<00:01:08.460> moved<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.970> me<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> tank

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
probably moved on me and this the tank

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
probably moved on me and this the tank
hall<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.040> completely<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.450> how

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
happened to me before so I actually had

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.230 
happened to me before so I actually had
to<00:01:16.380> scrub<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.250> went<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> garbage<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to scrub that I went to garbage so I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.440 
to scrub that I went to garbage so I
just<00:01:18.509> cleaned<00:01:18.840> up<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> blade<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:21.860> did<00:01:22.860> piece

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
just cleaned up the blade and did piece

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.270 
just cleaned up the blade and did piece
23<00:01:25.610> actually<00:01:26.610> four<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.180> check<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.080> out

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
23 actually four but check that out

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.999 
23 actually four but check that out
really<00:01:29.280> nice<00:01:29.490> finishes<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:33.380> no<00:01:34.380> edges<00:01:34.829> on

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
really nice finishes on this no edges on

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.359 
really nice finishes on this no edges on
and<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:36.030> ground<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:37.560> probably<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and just ground I'm probably going to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219

the handles together with Jeff as a
little<00:01:43.290> collaboration<00:01:44.540> also<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.930> look<00:01:46.290> at

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
little collaboration also here look at

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the crisp lines really really nice

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.090 
the crisp lines really really nice
finish<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.119> blades<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> nice<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.829> thin

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

and this one I like a lot this one is
that<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> horizontal<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.960> almost

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that with the horizontal it's almost

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.530 
that with the horizontal it's almost
like<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> hendra<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.790> hand<00:02:03.090> rub<00:02:03.390> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
like a hendra but it's not hand rub it

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
time and do it really really pretty that

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.040 
time and do it really really pretty that
it's<00:04:04.989> that's<00:04:05.920> why<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.160> was<00:04:06.340> hoping<00:04:06.700> for<00:04:07.050> it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
it's that's why I was hoping for it

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.840 
it's that's why I was hoping for it
really<00:04:08.320> came<00:04:08.560> out<00:04:08.709> nice<00:04:08.920> actually<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.580> same

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
really came out nice actually the same

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.729 
really came out nice actually the same
thing<00:04:10.120> again<00:04:11.400> 50<00:04:12.400> grid<00:04:12.640> free<00:04:13.269> ground<00:04:13.739> then

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
thing again 50 grid free ground then

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.289 
thing again 50 grid free ground then
clean<00:04:15.100> up<00:04:15.130> with<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:16.650> 120<00:04:17.650> ceramic<00:04:18.310> after<00:04:19.180> the

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
clean up with the 120 ceramic after the

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.290 
clean up with the 120 ceramic after the
220<00:04:19.840> ceramic<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.560> after<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.160> this<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.060> just

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
220 ceramic and after that this is just

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.190 
220 ceramic and after that this is just
fine<00:04:22.990> scotch<00:04:23.530> brite<00:04:23.860> with<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.580> black

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
fine scotch brite with the black

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.050 
fine scotch brite with the black
compound<00:04:25.650> on<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.640> what<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.910> end

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
compound on it and this is what you end

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.390 
compound on it and this is what you end
up<00:04:27.150> with<00:04:27.210> an<00:04:27.510> it's<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:27.810> perfect<00:04:28.440> perfect

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
up with an it's like perfect perfect

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.490 
up with an it's like perfect perfect
perfect<00:04:29.460> but<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.000> think<00:04:30.360> why<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.200> so

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
perfect but I think why is it so

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.680 
perfect but I think why is it so
perfectly<00:04:31.770> even<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:32.700> much<00:04:32.880> nicer<00:04:33.120> than<00:04:33.360> before

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
perfectly even so much nicer than before

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.930 
perfectly even so much nicer than before
it's<00:04:34.470> not<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:34.980> much<00:04:35.040> nice<00:04:35.340> ability<00:04:35.790> isn't

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
it's not so much nice ability isn't

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.910 
it's not so much nice ability isn't
lighting<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.270> lot<00:04:36.420> nicer<00:04:36.630> than<00:04:36.810> before<00:04:37.080> the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
lighting a lot nicer than before the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.830 
lighting a lot nicer than before the
difference<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.490> think<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.090> get<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.570> do

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
difference is I think that I get to do

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.230 
difference is I think that I get to do
really<00:04:39.870> much<00:04:40.860> much<00:04:41.100> better<00:04:41.280> cleaning<00:04:41.700> with

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
really much much better cleaning with

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.650 
really much much better cleaning with
the<00:04:42.270> 220<00:04:43.050> because<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.440> like<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.620> run<00:04:43.830> low<00:04:44.100> speeds

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
the 220 because I like to run low speeds

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.870 
the 220 because I like to run low speeds
with<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.690> lot<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:46.020> water<00:04:46.230> so<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.920> really<00:04:47.610> get<00:04:47.730> to

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
with a lot of water so I really get to

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.700 
with a lot of water so I really get to
clean<00:04:48.120> I'm<00:04:48.300> dead<00:04:48.480> grind<00:04:48.810> perfect<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.560> it

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
clean I'm dead grind perfect so it

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.740 
clean I'm dead grind perfect so it
really<00:04:50.100> does<00:04:50.370> get<00:04:50.610> rid<00:04:50.820> of<00:04:50.910> all<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.510> ground

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
really does get rid of all the ground

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.140 
really does get rid of all the ground
lines<00:04:51.990> all<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.260> deeper<00:04:52.650> green<00:04:52.830> lines<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:56.150> so

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
lines all the deeper green lines and so

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.200 
lines all the deeper green lines and so
far<00:04:57.420> I'm<00:04:57.570> very<00:04:57.960> very<00:04:58.170> happy<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:59.490> also<00:04:59.970> still

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
far I'm very very happy and also still

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.880 
far I'm very very happy and also still
have<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.480> work<00:05:00.630> out<00:05:00.840> on<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.140> handles<00:05:01.680> were

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
have to work out on the handles were

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.470 
have to work out on the handles were
actually<00:05:02.280> pretty<00:05:02.400> nice<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.940> was<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.330> was

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
actually pretty nice it was it was

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.070 
actually pretty nice it was it was
pretty<00:05:04.050> good<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.650> work<00:05:04.800> with<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:05.910> was<00:05:06.150> because

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
pretty good to work with it was because

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.530 
pretty good to work with it was because
it<00:05:07.380> came<00:05:07.590> with<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.860> 8<00:05:08.010> inch<00:05:08.340> wheel<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.450> I

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
it came with that 8 inch wheel so I

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.600 
it came with that 8 inch wheel so I
that's<00:05:09.990> what<00:05:10.140> I<00:05:10.170> use<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.440> shape<00:05:10.920> my<00:05:11.130> handles

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
that's what I use to shape my handles

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.580 
that's what I use to shape my handles
and<00:05:11.880> I'm<00:05:12.060> used<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.390> it<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:13.110> actually<00:05:13.260> just

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
and I'm used to it it actually just

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.230 
and I'm used to it it actually just
changed<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.130> before<00:05:14.670> I<00:05:14.700> was<00:05:14.910> doing<00:05:15.150> the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
changed that before I was doing the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.660 
changed that before I was doing the
handles<00:05:15.600> this<00:05:15.720> way<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.020> know<00:05:16.290> vertically<00:05:17.220> now

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
handles this way you know vertically now

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.670 
handles this way you know vertically now
I<00:05:17.700> can<00:05:18.030> do<00:05:18.210> them<00:05:18.450> horizontally<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.410> I<00:05:19.440> even

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
I can do them horizontally so I even

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.620 
I can do them horizontally so I even
have<00:05:19.800> actually<00:05:20.160> better<00:05:20.340> control<00:05:20.850> and<00:05:21.090> since<00:05:21.540> I

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
have actually better control and since I

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.870 
have actually better control and since I
can<00:05:21.780> slow<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.020> down<00:05:22.200> I<00:05:22.650> can<00:05:23.040> actually<00:05:23.190> clean<00:05:23.670> it

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
can slow it down I can actually clean it

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.910 
can slow it down I can actually clean it
up<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.180> lot<00:05:24.420> better<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:25.050> means<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.440> lot<00:05:25.470> less

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
up a lot better that means a lot less

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.910 
up a lot better that means a lot less
hand<00:05:26.220> work<00:05:26.490> after<00:05:27.270> work<00:05:27.450> so<00:05:27.810> after<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.560> so

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
hand work after work so after that so

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.550 
hand work after work so after that so
that's<00:05:29.220> that's<00:05:29.520> awesome<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.960> know<00:05:31.020> this<00:05:31.260> all

that's that's awesome you know this all
is<00:05:31.800> actually<00:05:32.190> done<00:05:32.370> without<00:05:32.580> without<00:05:33.450> any

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810

hand<00:05:34.350> work<00:05:34.620> everything<00:05:35.340> by<00:05:35.520> machine<00:05:35.910> which<00:05:36.330> is

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
hand work everything by machine which is

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.350 
hand work everything by machine which is
pretty<00:05:36.960> great<00:05:37.470> it's<00:05:37.830> actually<00:05:38.190> that's<00:05:39.090> why<00:05:39.330> I

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
have those expensive machines that you

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.260 
have those expensive machines that you
get<00:05:42.630> to<00:05:42.660> do<00:05:42.960> you<00:05:43.860> know<00:05:44.010> you<00:05:44.580> have<00:05:44.730> to<00:05:44.820> do<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:44.970> less
