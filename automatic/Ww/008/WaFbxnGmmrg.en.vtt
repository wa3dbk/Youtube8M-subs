about<00:00:25.529> mirepoix<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.420> size<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
about mirepoix is that the size of the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.070 
about mirepoix is that the size of the
mirepoix<00:00:28.470> will<00:00:29.279> vary<00:00:29.730> depending<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.539> its<00:00:30.779> use

for<00:00:31.740> instance<00:00:32.099> if<00:00:32.219> I'm<00:00:32.399> making<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> 12-hour

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
for instance if I'm making a 12-hour

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.290 
for instance if I'm making a 12-hour
veal<00:00:33.899> stock<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.469> want<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.010> large<00:00:35.309> mirepoix<00:00:35.760> and

then if I'm making a soup that maybe

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.319 
then if I'm making a soup that maybe
will<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:39.989> less<00:00:40.230> time<00:00:40.260> I'll<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.520> fine

I'll<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:12.170> mirepoix<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.490> have

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I'll have mirepoix that will not have

I'll have mirepoix that will not have
dissolved<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.780> falling<00:01:16.200> apart<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.700> a

for<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.240> shape<00:01:51.540> matters<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
for and the shape matters in just that

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.530 
for and the shape matters in just that
that<00:01:53.340> they're<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.729> relatively<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.420> same

important in as in other recipes because

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
important in as in other recipes because
it's<00:02:01.920> being<00:02:02.100> strained<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.360> for

time<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.860> want<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.099> cut<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> smaller<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
time I even want to cut it smaller so I

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.100 
time I even want to cut it smaller so I
might<00:02:09.869> cut<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.259> carrot<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.950> length<00:02:11.640> strips

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
might cut my carrot in length strips

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.180 
might cut my carrot in length strips
cut<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.560> way<00:02:13.760> now<00:02:14.760> cut<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.480> across<00:02:16.190> now

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
cut it this way now cut it across now

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.520 
cut it this way now cut it across now
this<00:02:17.430> would<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.700> good<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.030> perhaps<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.290> soup

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
this would be good for perhaps a soup

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.160 
this would be good for perhaps a soup
maybe<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.890> split<00:02:20.220> pea<00:02:20.400> soup<00:02:20.430> where<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.900> only

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
maybe a split pea soup where it's only

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.860 
maybe a split pea soup where it's only
going<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.440> cook<00:02:22.650> for<00:02:22.890> 45<00:02:23.730> minutes<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
going to cook for 45 minutes and you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.760 
going to cook for 45 minutes and you
know<00:02:24.900> mirepoix<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:26.720> usually<00:02:27.720> strain<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.530> of

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
know mirepoix is usually strain out of

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.810 
know mirepoix is usually strain out of
whatever<00:02:28.980> you're<00:02:29.250> making

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
whatever you're making

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.030 
whatever you're making
it's<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.300> flavoring<00:02:30.990> agent<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.500> strain<00:02:32.010> it

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
it's a flavoring agent so you strain it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.400 
it's a flavoring agent so you strain it
out<00:02:32.370> some<00:02:33.000> recipes<00:02:33.450> may<00:02:33.630> even<00:02:33.870> call<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.290> you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
out some recipes may even call for you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.560 
out some recipes may even call for you
to<00:02:34.590> puree<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.310> mirepoix<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.970> then

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
to puree the mirepoix and then

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.600 
to puree the mirepoix and then
reintroduce<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.650> into<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> sauce<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
reintroduce it into the sauce of the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.370 
reintroduce it into the sauce of the
recipe<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.630> going<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> thicken<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
recipe and it's going to thicken the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.560 
recipe and it's going to thicken the
sauce<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.950> give<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.250> very<00:02:41.459> sweet<00:02:42.180> flavor

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
sauce and give it a very sweet flavor

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.090 
sauce and give it a very sweet flavor
because<00:02:42.870> there's<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.080> lot<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.350> sugar<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
because there's a lot of sugar in the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.140 
because there's a lot of sugar in the
onions<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> carrots<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.320> onion

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
onions and the carrots with the onion

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.380 
onions and the carrots with the onion
I'm<00:02:48.150> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> cut<00:02:49.020> two<00:02:49.820> horizontal<00:02:50.820> slices

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
I'm going to cut two horizontal slices

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.890 
I'm going to cut two horizontal slices
and<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.370> smaller<00:02:54.120> dice<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
and now I have a smaller dice on the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.780 
and now I have a smaller dice on the
onion<00:02:55.320> which<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.300> similar<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:59.100> celery<00:02:59.580> and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
onion which is similar to the celery and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.870 
onion which is similar to the celery and
the<00:02:59.880> carrot<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.020> here<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.800> mirepoix<00:03:02.370> in

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the carrot so here we have mirepoix in

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.640 
the carrot so here we have mirepoix in
three<00:03:03.660> different<00:03:04.290> sizes<00:03:04.850> because<00:03:06.110> I'm<00:03:07.110> using

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
three different sizes because I'm using

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.900 
three different sizes because I'm using
this<00:03:07.980> mirepoix<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.790> three<00:03:09.300> different<00:03:09.600> ways
