00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the flash that it's going to go off you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
the flash that it's going to go off you
just<00:00:48.750> turn<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.500> pops<00:00:49.829> right<00:00:50.040> up

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
just turn it on and put pops right up

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.630 
just turn it on and put pops right up
here<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.690> point<00:00:52.110> seven<00:00:52.710> exposure

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
here you have your point seven exposure

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
here you have your point seven exposure
compensation<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.660> perhaps<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.170> set<00:00:55.410> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
compensation so perhaps we set this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
compensation so perhaps we set this

learn a little bit more about it so
we're<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.200> our<00:01:43.939> four-way

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
we're going to take our four-way

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.580 
we're going to take our four-way
controller<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
controller and go all the way up to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.980 
controller and go all the way up to
quality<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.759> our<00:01:47.909> fine<00:01:48.270> say<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.780> wanted

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
quality we have our fine say we wanted

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170 
quality we have our fine say we wanted
to<00:01:49.049> change<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.710> hit<00:01:49.799> okay<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.060> can

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to change that we hit okay and you can

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.719 
to change that we hit okay and you can
use<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> four-way<00:01:51.780> controller<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.979> change<00:01:53.520> it

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
use the four-way controller to change it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 
use the four-way controller to change it
say<00:01:53.939> we'll<00:01:54.150> go<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> normal<00:01:54.659> right<00:01:55.409> from<00:01:55.710> this

with<00:02:01.259> image<00:02:01.799> size<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> could<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
with image size I could go there and

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
with image size I could go there and
change<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> medium<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.770> wanted<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.220> right

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
change it to medium if I wanted to right

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
change it to medium if I wanted to right
from<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> screen<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.540> great<00:02:06.750> improvement
