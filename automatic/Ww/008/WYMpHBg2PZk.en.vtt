00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.840
 in fact most new 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.720
 material suffers from the climate here 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.950
 pilot who just arrived the sdt 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.890
 it's the famous drones that were missing 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.110
 during ambush of uzbin at the front 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.750
 this ball contains several cameras 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.320
 to watch the Taliban catapult 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.850
 allows to ship the drone in the sky 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 six machines were sent from France 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.170
 and this lieutenant is all proud 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.170
 no longer need US drones 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.140
 it allows us to have our own 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.820
 means so in franco french what 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.920
 allows you to light convoys 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.809
 to illuminate recognitions to be in 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.489
 made the eyes of several infantrymen 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 kilometers in advance and protect the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.929
 ground troops 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.049
 the lieutenant takes us to see the team 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:01:00.399
 who's piloting the drone on the ground since that 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:03.039
 truck these two military are loaded 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.309
 to drive the drone through a simple 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 controller 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.140
 a second team orients the camera and 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.140
 analyze live images 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.840
 the lieutenant agrees to show us 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.450
 images recently filmed by the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.190
 drone we can see four men who 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:29.390
 dangerously close to a position 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:32.390
 French and are 400 meters above 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.300
 so in fact the four people who 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 are below are not in visual 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.900
 direct from the force if they are hidden by 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.240
 the ground movement if the behavior 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.340
 individuals is suspicious but 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.380
 impossible to be sure that it is about 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.300
 Taliban would have to know if they are 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.430
 armed 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.880
 the resolution does not allow it to do the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.590
 distinguished between a rifle or a stick 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 anything 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.189
 to see the weaponry it would take 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.570
 go down much lower and the enemy 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.009
 would hear the sound of the engine all 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.869
 simply 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.000
 and if the drone remains high it's 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.330
 he makes a lawn mower noise 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.830
 no here that day it is by receiving a 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 rocket that the French understand 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.390
 that the four men are good 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.769
 Taliban they will be killed by several 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.769
 French mortar fire 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.590
 the drone is already old first 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.990
 models date from fifteen years ago the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.490
 famous predator that makes fantasize 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.070
 French see it there the most drone 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.860
 used in afghanistan 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.410
 able to fly to the yard and during 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.250
 more than sixteen hours and even to launch 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.040
 missiles 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.840
 Americans have 150 of them 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.170
 English Italians have bought 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.170
 many
