we're going to talk about how to plant
crocosmia<00:00:19.310> bulbs<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:21.029> crocosmia<00:00:21.419> are<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:22.079 
crocosmia bulbs now crocosmia are a

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.439 
crocosmia bulbs now crocosmia are a
beautiful<00:00:22.470> plant<00:00:22.949> native<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.550> South<00:00:23.759> Africa

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
beautiful plant native to South Africa

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.260 
beautiful plant native to South Africa
and<00:00:24.689> they<00:00:25.320> grow<00:00:25.559> very<00:00:25.590> well<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.610> climates

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
and they grow very well in climates

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.880 
and they grow very well in climates
where<00:00:27.450> it<00:00:27.540> doesn't<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.899> a<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.529> really

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
where it doesn't get a really really

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.249 
where it doesn't get a really really
hard<00:00:29.160> freeze<00:00:29.489> so<00:00:30.210> places<00:00:30.540> like<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> Northwest

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
hard freeze so places like the Northwest

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.110 
hard freeze so places like the Northwest
they<00:00:31.469> do<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:32.039> well<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.910> are<00:00:32.969> some

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
they do really well and here are some

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.110 
they do really well and here are some
tips<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.480> planting<00:00:33.899> them<00:00:34.129> now<00:00:35.129> crocosmia<00:00:35.520> can

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
tips on planting them now crocosmia can

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.080 
tips on planting them now crocosmia can
be<00:00:36.360> purchased<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> seed<00:00:37.860> or<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.699> flower

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
be purchased as a seed or as a flower

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.660 
be purchased as a seed or as a flower
bulb<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.530> multiply<00:00:40.770> very<00:00:41.129> quick

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
bulb and they multiply very quick

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.479 
bulb and they multiply very quick
quickly<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.480> make<00:00:42.690> big<00:00:42.900> clumps<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.560> bulbs<00:00:43.920> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
quickly they make big clumps of bulbs so

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.100 
quickly they make big clumps of bulbs so
when<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:44.820> dividing<00:00:45.150> them<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
when you're dividing them out and you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.110 
when you're dividing them out and you
see<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> big<00:00:46.560> clump<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
see a big clump all you have to do to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
see a big clump all you have to do to
separate<00:00:48.480> them<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.810> actually<00:00:49.110> twist<00:00:49.410> them<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
separate them is actually twist them so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.460 
separate them is actually twist them so
you<00:00:50.130> just<00:00:50.340> twist<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:50.820> apart<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.320> you

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
you just twist them apart and then you

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.799 
you just twist them apart and then you
can<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.800> separate<00:00:53.190> bulbs<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.880> when<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> plant

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
can have separate bulbs and when I plant

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
can have separate bulbs and when I plant
them<00:00:54.930> back<00:00:55.200> you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.829> plant<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.130> anytime

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
them back you can plant them anytime

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.120 
them back you can plant them anytime
fall<00:00:57.180> spring<00:00:57.780> even<00:00:58.290> in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> middle<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> summer

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
fall spring even in the middle of summer

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.650 
fall spring even in the middle of summer
and<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.430> might<00:00:59.610> not<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.970> much<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.360> first

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and they might not do much that first

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
and they might not do much that first
year<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.860> will<00:01:02.070> eventually<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
year but they will eventually so when I

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.910 
year but they will eventually so when I
plant<00:01:03.630> them<00:01:03.750> back<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> ground<00:01:04.320> it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
plant them back in the ground it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
plant them back in the ground it's
usually<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.489> bullseye<00:01:06.000> goes<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> sky

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
usually the bullseye goes to the sky

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.889 
usually the bullseye goes to the sky
when<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.920> doubt<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.369> sideways<00:01:08.479> but<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.659> will

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
when in doubt go sideways but they will

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.990 
when in doubt go sideways but they will
work<00:01:10.200> their<00:01:10.469> way<00:01:10.619> from<00:01:10.890> upside<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:11.490> really

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
work their way from upside down really

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.270 
work their way from upside down really
easily<00:01:12.329> and<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.259> like<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> plant<00:01:13.829> at<00:01:14.069> least

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
easily and I like to plant at least

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.059 
easily and I like to plant at least
three<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.060> triangle<00:01:15.389> so<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:17.039> of

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
three in a triangle so I just kind of

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.249 
three in a triangle so I just kind of
make<00:01:17.249> a<00:01:17.280> hole<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.539> just<00:01:18.780> plant<00:01:19.079> them

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
make a hole and then just plant them

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.859 
make a hole and then just plant them
with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.469> bullseye<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:20.389> you<00:01:21.389> can<00:01:21.509> always<00:01:21.630> just

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
with the bullseye up you can always just

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.929 
with the bullseye up you can always just
push<00:01:22.200> them<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> soil<00:01:22.859> and<00:01:23.429> I<00:01:23.819> always

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
push them into the soil and I always

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.910 
push them into the soil and I always
kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.329> put<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.749> a<00:01:24.840> triangle<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.859> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
kind of put them in a triangle or a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.419 
kind of put them in a triangle or a
zigzag<00:01:26.639> type<00:01:27.359> of<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.049> design<00:01:28.709> so<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> they're

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
zigzag type of a design so that they're

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.330 
zigzag type of a design so that they're
not<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.579> sitting<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> row<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.219> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
not just sitting in a row and then I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.940 
not just sitting in a row and then I
just<00:01:32.490> cover<00:01:32.819> them<00:01:33.029> up<00:01:33.149> real<00:01:33.509> well<00:01:36.950> crocosmia

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
just cover them up real well crocosmia

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.609 
just cover them up real well crocosmia
like<00:01:38.490> full<00:01:38.909> hot<00:01:39.299> Sun<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.779> really<00:01:40.439> good

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
like full hot Sun and really good

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.099 
like full hot Sun and really good
drainage<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.279> hummingbirds<00:01:41.969> love<00:01:42.270> them<00:01:42.450> so

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
drainage and hummingbirds love them so

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:44.690 
drainage and hummingbirds love them so
plant<00:01:43.560> them<00:01:43.709> whenever<00:01:43.889> you<00:01:44.099> can<00:01:44.310> find<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
plant them whenever you can find the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
plant them whenever you can find the
bulbs<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.359> you<00:01:45.779> can<00:01:45.929> enjoy<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.469> every

bulbs and you can enjoy them every

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.639 
bulbs and you can enjoy them every
summer<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.639> when<00:01:48.389> they<00:01:48.539> multiply<00:01:49.170> over<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
summer and when they multiply over the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.289 
summer and when they multiply over the
years<00:01:49.889> you<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.279> of<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.520> dig<00:01:50.759> them<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.029> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
years you kind of just dig them up and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.879 
years you kind of just dig them up and
separate<00:01:51.689> them<00:01:51.869> back<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.319> give<00:01:52.679> them<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:52.889 
separate them back out and give them to

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:54.769 
separate them back out and give them to
your<00:01:53.009> friends<00:01:53.069> they're<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> great<00:01:54.179> addition<00:01:54.359> to
