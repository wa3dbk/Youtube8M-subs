I<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.620> temperature<00:00:47.100> reader<00:00:47.430> so

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I want a little temperature reader so

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
I want a little temperature reader so
look<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.690> heating<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> block<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
look as I'm heating a block up on the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.040 
look as I'm heating a block up on the
hot<00:00:50.910> plate<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.570> my<00:00:54.570> temp<00:00:54.840> gauge

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
and then I don't want my block getting
too<00:00:57.030> hot<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.539> usually<00:00:58.230> try<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.559> remove<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
too hot I usually try to remove the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
too hot I usually try to remove the
engine<00:00:59.820> bearings<00:00:59.969> when<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> first<00:01:00.629> hits<00:01:00.840> about

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
engine bearings when it first hits about

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
engine bearings when it first hits about
225<00:01:01.859> degrees<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.379> that'll<00:01:04.379> come<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
225 degrees and and that'll come out so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.649 
225 degrees and and that'll come out so
easy<00:01:05.250> Oh<00:01:05.400> heated<00:01:05.760> back<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
easy Oh heated back up a little more to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
easy Oh heated back up a little more to
about<00:01:06.810> 250<00:01:07.520> try<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> least

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
about 250 try to use the least

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.660 
about 250 try to use the least
temperature<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:10.159> safely<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.490> them

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
temperature that I can safely get them

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.179 
temperature that I can safely get them
out<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:12.960> we'll<00:01:13.619> start<00:01:13.830> from<00:01:14.010> there

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
out and and then we'll start from there

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.190 
and then starting install well I've got
the<00:01:17.400> engine<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.240> heating<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.080> the

the engine now heating up here on the
hot<00:01:19.350> plate<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.180> while<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.420> heating<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.200> on

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
hot plate and while it's heating up on

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.749 
hot plate and while it's heating up on
them<00:01:22.560> taking<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.070> temperature<00:01:23.520> gauge

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
them taking a little temperature gauge

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880

and<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> temp<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> block<00:01:25.500> every

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and I'm going to temp the block every

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
and I'm going to temp the block every

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the temperature I don't getting too hot

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.660 
the temperature I don't getting too hot
on<00:01:29.430> me<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.900> hurt<00:01:31.110> anything<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.610> to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
little bit in the engine we'll grab a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.539 
little bit in the engine we'll grab a
hold<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.359> bearing<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:33.340> just

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
bearings are installed in the engine

00:03:48.970 --> 00:04:00.680 
bearings are installed in the engine
once<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.049> cools<00:03:50.290> off<00:03:50.530> we'll<00:03:50.859> start<00:03:51.190> reassemble
