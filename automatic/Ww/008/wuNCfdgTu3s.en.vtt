at<00:01:45.659> them<00:01:45.780> from<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> back<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
at them from the back you can kind of

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.480 
at them from the back you can kind of
see<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.270> galaxy<00:01:48.630> s3<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.490> slightly

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
see that the galaxy s3 is slightly

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.630 
see that the galaxy s3 is slightly
taller<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.630> slightly<00:01:52.229> wider<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.520> not

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
taller and it's slightly wider it's not

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.370 
taller and it's slightly wider it's not
pushing<00:01:54.000> Galaxy<00:01:54.479> Note<00:01:54.630> territory<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.259> this

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
pushing Galaxy Note territory but this

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.100 
pushing Galaxy Note territory but this
is<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.829> big<00:01:56.100> phone<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.240> sides<00:01:57.570> it's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
is a big phone on the sides it's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.270 
is a big phone on the sides it's
actually<00:01:58.799> eight<00:01:59.369> point<00:02:00.000> six<00:02:00.689> millimeters<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
actually eight point six millimeters so

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually eight point six millimeters so
it's<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.210> thinner<00:02:03.540> than<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> Galaxy

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it's a little thinner than the Galaxy

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
it's a little thinner than the Galaxy
Nexus<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.649> verizon<00:02:05.610> version<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:06.479> both

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
Nexus a verizon version but they both

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.300 
Nexus a verizon version but they both
got<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> same<00:02:07.079> part<00:02:07.590> right<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:07.770> where<00:02:08.220> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
got the same part right here where you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130 
got the same part right here where you
see<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.700> line<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.209> defined<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.899> curves

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
see this line is defined and it curves

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.229 
see this line is defined and it curves
to<00:02:10.739> sort<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.039> trick<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.430> eye<00:02:11.610> into<00:02:12.000> thinking

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
to sort of trick your eye into thinking

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.260 
to sort of trick your eye into thinking
that<00:02:12.720> it's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that it's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.150 
that it's
smaller<00:02:13.450> than<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.530> when<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.800> hold<00:02:14.980> it

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
smaller than it is but when you hold it

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.220 
smaller than it is but when you hold it
it<00:02:15.310> doesn't<00:02:15.520> feel<00:02:15.850> clunky<00:02:16.360> or<00:02:16.570> big<00:02:17.050> or

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
it doesn't feel clunky or big or

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.740 
it doesn't feel clunky or big or
anything<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:18.640> does<00:02:18.850> feel<00:02:19.090> large<00:02:19.420> in

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
anything like that it does feel large in

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
but I could see myself using this day to

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.240 
but I could see myself using this day to
date<00:05:37.870> they<00:05:38.230> push<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.680> boundaries<00:05:39.040> a<00:05:39.130> little

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
date they push the boundaries a little

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.550 
date they push the boundaries a little
bit<00:05:39.580> it's<00:05:39.820> not<00:05:40.210> as<00:05:40.360> slim<00:05:40.750> it's<00:05:41.020> a<00:05:41.110> little<00:05:41.200> wider

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.610 
bit it's not as slim it's a little wider
but<00:05:42.250> it<00:05:42.490> is<00:05:42.640> thinner<00:05:43.030> in<00:05:43.330> depth<00:05:43.600> and<00:05:43.840> it's<00:05:44.320> just

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
but it is thinner in depth and it's just

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.940

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
buttons on the front but a couple of

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.610 
buttons on the front but a couple of
other<00:05:52.419> things<00:05:52.510> that<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.080> didn't<00:05:53.500> mention

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
other things that I didn't mention

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.670 
other things that I didn't mention
before<00:05:53.860> you've<00:05:54.340> got<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.700> 1.9<00:05:55.419> megapixel<00:05:55.900> front

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
before you've got a 1.9 megapixel front

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.260 
before you've got a 1.9 megapixel front
facing<00:05:56.710> camera<00:05:57.400> that's<00:05:57.790> going<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.030> be<00:05:58.120> good

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
facing camera that's going to be good

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.810 
facing camera that's going to be good
for<00:05:58.479> video<00:05:58.780> chat<00:05:59.140> another<00:05:59.919> thing<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.370> notice

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
for video chat another thing you notice

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.100 
for video chat another thing you notice
here<00:06:01.030> it's<00:06:01.150> got<00:06:01.270> another<00:06:01.540> sensor<00:06:01.930> on<00:06:02.020> the

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
here it's got another sensor on the

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.080 
here it's got another sensor on the
front<00:06:02.410> that's<00:06:02.800> because<00:06:03.130> it<00:06:03.310> has<00:06:03.490> something<00:06:04.000> in

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
front that's because it has something in

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.580 
front that's because it has something in
the<00:06:04.150> software<00:06:04.570> that<00:06:04.600> will<00:06:04.870> track<00:06:05.169> your<00:06:05.350> eyes

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
the software that will track your eyes

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.730 
the software that will track your eyes
so<00:06:06.250> if<00:06:06.520> you're<00:06:06.820> looking<00:06:07.450> at<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:07.960> screen<00:06:08.169> it'll

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
so if you're looking at the screen it'll

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.500 
so if you're looking at the screen it'll
know<00:06:08.919> not<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:09.400> dim<00:06:09.580> it<00:06:09.729> because<00:06:10.120> you're<00:06:10.240> still

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
know not to dim it because you're still

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.150 
know not to dim it because you're still
reading<00:06:10.720> it<00:06:10.990> so<00:06:11.350> even<00:06:11.590> though<00:06:11.620> if<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.890> screen

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.050

something<00:06:14.020> it'll<00:06:14.979> keep<00:06:15.100> going<00:06:15.490> until<00:06:15.700> it

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
something it'll keep going until it

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.670
