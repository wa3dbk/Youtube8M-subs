00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
but if you also look there's gravel Rob

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.969 
but if you also look there's gravel Rob
aside<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.659> gravel<00:02:01.200> texture<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.799> not

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
aside it's that gravel texture is not

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
aside it's that gravel texture is not
the<00:02:02.159> same<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> current<00:02:02.939> gravel<00:02:03.390> texture

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the same as the current gravel texture

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.990 
the same as the current gravel texture
as<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.229> tell<00:02:04.439> from<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:05.189> image<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
as you can tell from this image that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.609 
as you can tell from this image that
there's<00:02:06.270> two<00:02:06.479> different<00:02:06.689> types<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> gravel

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
there's two different types of gravel

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
there's two different types of gravel
textures<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.090> awesome

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
textures so that is really awesome

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.199 
textures so that is really awesome
feature<00:02:10.170> because<00:02:11.129> i<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.760> gravel

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
feature because i think this gravel

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.850 
feature because i think this gravel
looks<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.750> better<00:02:13.020> than<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.440> gravel

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
looks way better than I gravel

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830 
looks way better than I gravel
I gravel<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.120> now<00:02:15.330> looks<00:02:15.660> like

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I gravel that we have now looks like

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290 
I gravel that we have now looks like
dirty<00:02:16.140> sand<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.830> me<00:02:16.980> now<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.580> final<00:02:17.910> picture

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
dirty sand to me now the final picture

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.530 
dirty sand to me now the final picture
and<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.660> top<00:02:18.870> left<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.820> an<00:02:20.820> inventory<00:02:21.120> bars

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and the top left is an inventory bars

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.380 
and the top left is an inventory bars
there<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.550> buckets<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:24.000> looks<00:02:24.270> like

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
there is buckets and it looks like

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.260 
there is buckets and it looks like
wooden<00:02:25.200> bowls<00:02:25.500> wooden<00:02:26.220> bowls<00:02:26.460> already<00:02:27.000> go<00:02:27.210> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
wooden bowls wooden bowls already go to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.930 
wooden bowls wooden bowls already go to
a<00:02:27.540> stacks<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.990> 64<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.160> there's<00:02:29.490> no<00:02:29.610> change

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
a stacks of 64 so there's no change

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.760 
a stacks of 64 so there's no change
there<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.510> I'm<00:02:30.690> not<00:02:30.810> sure<00:02:30.870> while<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
there so I'm not sure while it's in the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.380 
there so I'm not sure while it's in the
picture<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.340> I'm<00:02:32.400> pretty<00:02:32.730> sure<00:02:32.850> its<00:02:33.120> wooden

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
picture but I'm pretty sure its wooden

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.150 
picture but I'm pretty sure its wooden
bowls<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.960> looked<00:02:34.350> at<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.590> close<00:02:34.860> as<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.100> could

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
bowls I looked at as close as I could

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.480 
bowls I looked at as close as I could
and<00:02:35.640> that's<00:02:35.760> wooden<00:02:36.180> bows<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:37.290> beside<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.310> is

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
and that's wooden bows now beside it is

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.670 
and that's wooden bows now beside it is
buckets<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.480> goes<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> stack<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.110> 16

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
buckets and it goes to a stack of 16

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.500 
buckets and it goes to a stack of 16
which<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.070> awesome<00:02:41.280> because<00:02:41.850> our<00:02:42.120> buckets

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
which is awesome because our buckets

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.290 
which is awesome because our buckets
only<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:43.230> stack<00:02:43.560> at<00:02:43.709> all<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.370> that's<00:02:44.850> a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
only don't stack at all now and that's a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.090 
only don't stack at all now and that's a
pain<00:02:45.990> if<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.320> have<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> chest<00:02:46.920> full<00:02:47.040> of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
pain if you have like a chest full of

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.400
