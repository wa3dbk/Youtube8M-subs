when<00:00:18.599> it<00:00:18.689> comes<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.080> creating<00:00:19.470> an<00:00:19.560> animated

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
when it comes to creating an animated

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.880 
when it comes to creating an animated
bug<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.759> really<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.689> complicated<00:00:22.140> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
bug it's really not that complicated you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
bug it's really not that complicated you
just<00:00:23.099> kind<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.369> need<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.550> sit<00:00:24.330> down<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.930> relax

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
just kind of need to sit down and relax

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.069 
just kind of need to sit down and relax
and<00:00:25.650> talk<00:00:26.039> yourself<00:00:26.189> through<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:26.880> steps<00:00:27.119> now

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
and talk yourself through the steps now

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.749 
and talk yourself through the steps now
we've<00:00:28.289> already<00:00:28.590> created<00:00:29.039> an<00:00:29.399> interesting

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
we've already created an interesting

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.659 
we've already created an interesting
logo<00:00:30.270> animation<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.739> beginning<00:00:32.129> of<00:00:32.460> this

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
logo animation in the beginning of this

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.820 
logo animation in the beginning of this
course<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.839> to<00:00:33.900> use<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.379> as<00:00:34.650> the

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
course so I'm going to use that as the

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.189 
course so I'm going to use that as the
basis<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.460> our<00:00:35.519> logo<00:00:36.089> animation<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.870> our<00:00:36.989> bug

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
basis for our logo animation for our bug

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.979 
basis for our logo animation for our bug
so<00:00:37.890> let's<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.220> started<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.420> scrub<00:00:39.780> through

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so let's get started if we scrub through

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
so let's get started if we scrub through
the<00:00:40.079> composition<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.949> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.519> I've

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the composition here you can see I've

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
the composition here you can see I've
got<00:00:42.030> my<00:00:42.089> logo<00:00:42.870> element<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.769> we<00:00:44.220> have<00:00:44.370> these

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
got my logo element and we have these

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.869 
got my logo element and we have these
bright<00:00:44.879> colorful<00:00:45.890> bars<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.190> pop<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
bright colorful bars that pop out and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.579 
bright colorful bars that pop out and
yes<00:00:48.360> they're<00:00:48.600> getting<00:00:48.839> cut<00:00:49.019> off<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.379> edges

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
yes they're getting cut off on the edges

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.060 
yes they're getting cut off on the edges
and<00:00:49.949> we'll<00:00:50.100> deal<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> second<00:00:51.210> but

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
and we'll deal with that in a second but

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.849 
and we'll deal with that in a second but
notice<00:00:53.300> my<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.629> sunflower<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.680> is

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
notice my little sunflower here is

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.939 
notice my little sunflower here is
already<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.390> beginning<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.829> go

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
already up at the beginning so we can go

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
already up at the beginning so we can go
ahead<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.309> create<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.820> quick<00:00:59.879> animation

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
ahead and just create a quick animation

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.779 
ahead and just create a quick animation
in<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.559> gonna<00:01:01.800> press<00:01:02.070> option<00:01:02.699> on

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
in for this I'm gonna press option on

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.749 
in for this I'm gonna press option on
the<00:01:02.879> Mac<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.300> alt<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.870> Windows<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:05.009> s<00:01:05.280> to

the Mac or alt on Windows and then s to

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.580 
the Mac or alt on Windows and then s to
automatically<00:01:06.240> add<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.509> keyframe<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:07.380> my

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
automatically add a keyframe for my

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.999 
automatically add a keyframe for my
scale<00:01:08.119> now<00:01:09.119> since<00:01:09.899> I<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> scale<00:01:10.770> for

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
scale now since I want this to scale for

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.499 
scale now since I want this to scale for
nothing<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.550> gonna<00:01:11.789> go<00:01:12.000> ahead<00:01:12.149> and<00:01:12.240> drag

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
nothing I'm just gonna go ahead and drag

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.469 
nothing I'm just gonna go ahead and drag
that<00:01:12.539> keyframe<00:01:13.289> down<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.830> timeline<00:01:14.149> about<00:01:15.149> 10

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that keyframe down the timeline about 10

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.200 
that keyframe down the timeline about 10
frames<00:01:16.160> now<00:01:17.160> I<00:01:17.190> can<00:01:17.490> go<00:01:17.610> ahead<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> change<00:01:18.060> my

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
frames now I can go ahead and change my

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990 
frames now I can go ahead and change my
scale<00:01:18.720> parameter<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> zero<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.429> if<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.700> scrub

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
scale parameter to zero and if we scrub

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.149 
scale parameter to zero and if we scrub
through<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.290> gonna<00:01:22.409> pop<00:01:22.890> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
through you can see it's gonna pop in

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.870 
through you can see it's gonna pop in
and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.600> different<00:01:25.020> arrays<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
and then we have our different arrays of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.359 
and then we have our different arrays of
color<00:01:26.880> popping<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.470> let's<00:01:28.950> deal<00:01:29.159> with

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
color popping out so let's deal with

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.760 
color popping out so let's deal with
those<00:01:29.520> rays<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.970> color<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.840> gonna<00:01:31.079> select<00:01:31.350> my

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
those rays of color I'm gonna select my

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
those rays of color I'm gonna select my
layer<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.610> composition<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.840> just

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
layer one composition here and just

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.370 
layer one composition here and just
click<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.979> hold<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.880> shape<00:01:36.180> tools<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:37.200> get

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.249 
going to keep this relatively tight to
our<00:02:06.899> individual<00:02:07.799> logo<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.780> open<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.840> my<00:02:09.899> mask

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
our individual logo and open up my mask

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.650 
our individual logo and open up my mask
options<00:02:10.829> here<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.489> feather<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.299> mask

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
options here and just feather this mask

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.660 
options here and just feather this mask
so<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.340> zoom<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.209> can<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.690> okay<00:02:16.109> that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
so if we zoom out you can see okay that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.280 
so if we zoom out you can see okay that
looks<00:02:17.670> pretty<00:02:17.910> cool<00:02:18.180> let's<00:02:18.630> scrub<00:02:19.019> through

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
looks pretty cool let's scrub through

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.349 
looks pretty cool let's scrub through
here<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.859> see<00:02:20.130> what<00:02:20.400> what's<00:02:21.120> actually

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
here and see what what's actually

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.790 
here and see what what's actually
happening<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:24.380> it's<00:02:25.380> extraordinarily

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
happening so it's extraordinarily

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.250 
happening so it's extraordinarily
vibrant<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.849> sort<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.209> pops<00:02:27.360> out<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
vibrant and it sort of pops out and and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.959 
vibrant and it sort of pops out and and
that's<00:02:28.860> cool

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
that's cool

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.539 
that's cool
sometimes<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:31.019> want<00:02:31.230> bugs<00:02:31.469> that<00:02:31.890> are<00:02:32.159> color

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
sometimes you want bugs that are color

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.910 
sometimes you want bugs that are color
bugs<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.510> sometimes<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.109> just<00:02:34.140> want<00:02:34.500> kind<00:02:34.829> of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
bugs and sometimes you just want kind of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.179 
bugs and sometimes you just want kind of
a<00:02:35.010> grayscale<00:02:35.549> version<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.890> version

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
a grayscale version so this version

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.300 
a grayscale version so this version
right<00:02:38.549> now<00:02:38.609> is<00:02:39.000> actually<00:02:39.209> set<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.109> be<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.500> color

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
right now is actually set to be a color

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.849 
right now is actually set to be a color
bug<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.659> go<00:02:42.810> ahead<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.079> turn<00:02:43.620> off

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
bug you can just go ahead and turn off

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.190 
bug you can just go ahead and turn off
the<00:02:44.489> visibility<00:02:44.879> for<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.599> background<00:02:46.079> layer

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the visibility for the background layer

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.280 
the visibility for the background layer
here<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.650> go<00:02:47.250> ahead<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.730> render<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.450> with

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
here and go ahead and render this with

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.229 
here and go ahead and render this with
an<00:02:49.500> alpha<00:02:49.799> Channel<00:02:50.159> to<00:02:50.400> actually<00:02:50.819> create<00:02:51.209> a

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
an alpha Channel to actually create a

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.410 
an alpha Channel to actually create a
transparent<00:02:52.109> version<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.709> bug<00:02:53.209> now<00:02:54.209> in

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
transparent version of this bug now in

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.670 
transparent version of this bug now in
order<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.750> create<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.139> black-and-white

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
order to create a black-and-white

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.470 
order to create a black-and-white
version<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.670> kind<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.939> need<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.120> talk

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
version we just kind of need to talk

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.229 
version we just kind of need to talk
ourselves<00:02:57.689> through<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> steps<00:02:59.030> so<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.120> get

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
ourselves through the steps so to get

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.539 
ourselves through the steps so to get
started<00:03:00.389> let's<00:03:00.780> select<00:03:01.200> layer<00:03:01.439> 1<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
started let's select layer 1 here and

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.699 
started let's select layer 1 here and
I'm<00:03:03.209> gonna<00:03:03.389> go<00:03:03.629> up<00:03:03.750> under<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.079> effects<00:03:04.439> panel

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
I'm gonna go up under the effects panel

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.460 
I'm gonna go up under the effects panel
and<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.760> color<00:03:06.090> correction<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.840> I'm<00:03:07.049> going

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
and go to color correction and I'm going

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.750 
and go to color correction and I'm going
to<00:03:07.590> choose<00:03:08.180> black<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.419> white<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:11.400> way<00:03:11.549> my

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
to choose black and white that way my

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.330 
to choose black and white that way my
logo<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.569> black<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.169> white<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.950> course<00:03:14.189> I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
logo is black and white and of course I

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.039 
logo is black and white and of course I
could<00:03:14.639> go<00:03:14.909> ahead<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.269> make<00:03:15.419> adjustments<00:03:16.019> to

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
could go ahead and make adjustments to

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.619 
could go ahead and make adjustments to
the<00:03:16.500> red<00:03:16.859> values<00:03:17.430> or<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:17.760> green<00:03:17.969> values<00:03:18.419> etc

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
the red values or the green values etc

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.619 
the red values or the green values etc
but<00:03:19.469> I'm<00:03:19.680> not<00:03:19.889> going<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:21.060> now<00:03:21.120> I

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
but I'm not going to do that just now I

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.659 
but I'm not going to do that just now I
want<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.169> get<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.500> sort<00:03:23.069> of<00:03:23.159> rocking<00:03:23.519> and

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
want to get this sort of rocking and

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.640 
want to get this sort of rocking and
rolling<00:03:23.760> let's<00:03:24.510> turn<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:24.989> visibility<00:03:25.620> of

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
rolling let's turn on the visibility of

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.629 
rolling let's turn on the visibility of
layer<00:03:25.889> 2<00:03:26.129> so<00:03:26.340> we<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.489> see<00:03:26.909> how<00:03:27.209> our<00:03:27.569> new<00:03:28.290> bug

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
layer 2 so we can see how our new bug

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.390 
layer 2 so we can see how our new bug
element<00:03:29.639> is<00:03:29.760> looking<00:03:30.349> now<00:03:31.349> in<00:03:31.680> order<00:03:32.159> to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
element is looking now in order to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.309 
element is looking now in order to
render<00:03:32.609> this<00:03:32.909> out<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.599> want<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.989> actually<00:03:34.109> have

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
render this out I want to actually have

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.369 
render this out I want to actually have
this<00:03:34.650> kind<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.099> be<00:03:35.569> semi-transparent<00:03:36.629> so<00:03:37.229> what

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
this kind of be semi-transparent so what

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.339 
this kind of be semi-transparent so what
I<00:03:37.440> want<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:38.099> use<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.840> black-and-white

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
I want to do is use this black-and-white

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.699 
I want to do is use this black-and-white
value<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.340> determine<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.849> transparency<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.900> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
value to determine the transparency of a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.740 
value to determine the transparency of a
fill<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.909> I'm<00:03:44.970> going<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.150> go<00:03:45.239> up<00:03:45.329> inner<00:03:45.540> layer

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
fill so I'm going to go up inner layer

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.789 
fill so I'm going to go up inner layer
and<00:03:46.109> choose<00:03:46.919> a<00:03:46.979> new<00:03:47.489> solid<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.560> make<00:03:49.560> sure

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
and choose a new solid and make sure

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.949 
and choose a new solid and make sure
it's<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:50.129> comp<00:03:50.340> size<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:51.060> I'll<00:03:51.419> go<00:03:51.599> ahead<00:03:51.689> and

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
it's the comp size and I'll go ahead and

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.830 
it's the comp size and I'll go ahead and
choose<00:03:52.229> a<00:03:52.500> solid<00:03:53.099> white<00:03:53.819> color<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.449> actually

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
choose a solid white color and actually

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.399 
choose a solid white color and actually
just<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.139> be<00:03:55.260> safe<00:03:55.590> I'll<00:03:55.829> make<00:03:56.040> sure<00:03:56.189> it's<00:03:56.340> 90%

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
just to be safe I'll make sure it's 90%

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.309 
just to be safe I'll make sure it's 90%
luminance<00:03:58.879> okay<00:03:59.879> so<00:04:00.419> there's<00:04:00.599> my<00:04:00.750> white<00:04:00.989> solid

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
luminance okay so there's my white solid

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.949 
luminance okay so there's my white solid
I'm<00:04:01.620> gonna<00:04:01.859> position<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.519> below<00:04:02.970> layer<00:04:03.359> 2<00:04:03.689> and

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
I'm gonna position it below layer 2 and

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.589 
I'm gonna position it below layer 2 and
then<00:04:04.620> if<00:04:04.979> you<00:04:05.430> don't<00:04:05.609> have<00:04:05.879> your<00:04:06.030> switches<00:04:06.479> and

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
then if you don't have your switches and

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.569 
then if you don't have your switches and
modes<00:04:06.659> active<00:04:07.409> make<00:04:07.829> sure<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.430> your

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
switches set up and change the track

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.629 
switches set up and change the track

matte to luma matte my bug element now

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.449 
matte to luma matte my bug element now
we<00:04:14.699> have<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> black<00:04:15.449> and<00:04:15.479> white<00:04:15.810> version<00:04:16.340> now<00:04:17.340> of

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
we have a black and white version now of

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.129 
we have a black and white version now of
course<00:04:17.639> it's<00:04:17.909> kind<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.329> hard<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.539> read<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:18.989> i

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
course it's kind of hard to read if i

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.159 
course it's kind of hard to read if i
zoom<00:04:19.169> up<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.709> 100%<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.669> reposition<00:04:21.419> here<00:04:21.690> you

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
zoom up to 100% and reposition here you

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.350 
zoom up to 100% and reposition here you
can<00:04:22.349> see<00:04:22.590> okay<00:04:22.830> it's<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.460> little<00:04:23.580> legible<00:04:24.150> but

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
can see okay it's a little legible but

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.839 
can see okay it's a little legible but
we<00:04:24.479> could<00:04:24.659> definitely<00:04:24.810> improve<00:04:25.470> on<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:25.860> the

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
we could definitely improve on this the

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.879 
we could definitely improve on this the
way<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.000> do<00:04:27.270> this<00:04:27.419> is<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.750> add<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.199> subtle<00:04:28.560> drop

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
way to do this is to add a subtle drop

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.920 
way to do this is to add a subtle drop
shadow<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.460> I'll<00:04:30.060> do<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.449> by<00:04:30.750> selecting

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
shadow and I'll do that by selecting

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.620 
shadow and I'll do that by selecting
layer<00:04:31.380> 2<00:04:31.650> holding<00:04:32.460> down<00:04:32.580> shift<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.150> selecting

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
layer 2 holding down shift and selecting

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.990 
layer 2 holding down shift and selecting
layer<00:04:33.780> 1<00:04:34.110> then<00:04:34.889> going<00:04:35.159> up<00:04:35.280> under<00:04:35.400> layer<00:04:35.699> and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
layer 1 then going up under layer and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.469 
layer 1 then going up under layer and
choose<00:04:36.870> precomposed<00:04:37.590> one<00:04:37.830> more<00:04:38.010> time<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.880> here

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
choose precomposed one more time in here

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.220 
choose precomposed one more time in here
I'll<00:04:39.630> call<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:39.990> bug<00:04:41.690> b/w<00:04:42.690> pre

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
I'll call this bug b/w pre

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.420 
I'll call this bug b/w pre
Kampf<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.980> click<00:04:44.490> okay<00:04:45.150> now<00:04:45.560> I<00:04:46.560> can<00:04:47.190> go<00:04:47.310> up

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
Kampf and click okay now I can go up

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.040 
Kampf and click okay now I can go up
into<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.760> effect<00:04:48.120> menu<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.780> go<00:04:49.020> to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
into the effect menu and go to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.370 
into the effect menu and go to
perspective<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:50.040> choose<00:04:50.660> drop<00:04:51.660> shadow

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
perspective and choose drop shadow

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.670 
perspective and choose drop shadow
now<00:04:53.370> that's<00:04:53.850> giving<00:04:54.180> me<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.480> kind<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.930> puffy

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
now that's giving me that kind of puffy

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.100 
now that's giving me that kind of puffy
look<00:04:55.920> that<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> lot<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.790> different<00:04:57.240> bugs<00:04:57.690> have

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
look that a lot of different bugs have

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.320 
look that a lot of different bugs have
now<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.130> course<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.490> could<00:04:59.550> decrease<00:05:00.090> the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
now of course I could decrease the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.020 
now of course I could decrease the
opacity<00:05:00.450> of<00:05:00.960> this<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:02.490> could<00:05:02.760> also

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
opacity of this and I could also

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.810 
opacity of this and I could also
decrease<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.600> opacity<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:04.530> my<00:05:04.560> bug<00:05:05.130> itself<00:05:05.550> if

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
decrease the opacity of my bug itself if

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.220 
decrease the opacity of my bug itself if
I<00:05:05.940> wanted<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.270> kind<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.540> blend<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.960> in<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.110> little

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
I wanted to kind of blend it in a little

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.850 
I wanted to kind of blend it in a little
bit<00:05:07.500> more<00:05:08.150> I'll<00:05:09.150> decrease<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.200> distance<00:05:10.470> of

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
bit more I'll decrease the distance of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.820 
bit more I'll decrease the distance of
my<00:05:11.070> shadow<00:05:11.970> here<00:05:12.420> just<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.380> looks<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.680> little

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
my shadow here just so it looks a little

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.800 
my shadow here just so it looks a little
bit<00:05:14.070> more<00:05:14.190> like<00:05:14.400> an<00:05:14.520> imprint<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.120> actually

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
bit more like an imprint and actually

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.120 
bit more like an imprint and actually
bump<00:05:16.080> up<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.410> opacity<00:05:18.020> okay<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:19.770> that's

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
bump up the opacity okay so that's

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.340 
bump up the opacity okay so that's
starting<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.700> look<00:05:20.790> pretty<00:05:21.150> good<00:05:21.210> if<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.020> fit

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
starting to look pretty good if I fit

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.160 
starting to look pretty good if I fit
back<00:05:22.500> up<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.860> 100%<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.760> can<00:05:24.060> see<00:05:24.390> it's<00:05:24.660> set<00:05:24.990> in

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
back up to 100% you can see it's set in

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.350 
back up to 100% you can see it's set in
there<00:05:25.380> now<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.190> course<00:05:26.490> as<00:05:26.700> I'm<00:05:26.880> looking<00:05:27.060> at

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
there now of course as I'm looking at

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.660 
there now of course as I'm looking at
this<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:28.050> does<00:05:28.380> need<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:28.770> little<00:05:29.040> bit<00:05:29.190> of<00:05:29.400> color

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
this it does need a little bit of color

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.510 
this it does need a little bit of color
so<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.060> could<00:05:30.540> go<00:05:30.720> back<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:31.230> change<00:05:31.320> my<00:05:32.220> white

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
so I could go back and change my white

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.330 
so I could go back and change my white
solid<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.780> different<00:05:34.320> color<00:05:34.560> let's

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
solid to a different color let's

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.790 
solid to a different color let's
actually<00:05:35.610> just<00:05:35.940> do<00:05:36.120> that<00:05:36.300> I'll<00:05:37.170> select<00:05:37.200> my

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
actually just do that I'll select my

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.550 
actually just do that I'll select my
white<00:05:38.040> solid<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:38.700> just<00:05:38.880> change<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.450> to<00:05:39.560> kind

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
white solid and just change this to kind

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.840 
white solid and just change this to kind
of<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.740> yellow<00:05:41.040> color<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.720> we'll<00:05:42.720> click<00:05:42.930> OK<00:05:43.850> and

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
of a yellow color and we'll click OK and

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.390 
of a yellow color and we'll click OK and
now<00:05:45.090> when<00:05:45.270> I<00:05:45.300> go<00:05:45.480> back<00:05:45.510> over<00:05:45.770> you<00:05:46.770> can<00:05:46.950> see<00:05:47.220> I

when it comes to actually create the

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.290 
when it comes to actually create the
animation<00:05:55.050> all<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:56.160> have<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.400> do<00:05:56.550> is<00:05:56.790> turn<00:05:57.120> off

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
animation all you have to do is turn off

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.820 
animation all you have to do is turn off
the<00:05:57.480> visibility<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.200> background<00:05:58.650> layer

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
the visibility of the background layer

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.680 
the visibility of the background layer
and<00:05:59.040> then<00:05:59.490> go<00:05:59.700> ahead<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.180> render<00:06:00.390> this

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
and then go ahead and render this

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.050
