 Speech that speaks to you is Bruno. 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.040
 welcome to the plan b and we are one 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.980
 video here well differentiated we will do here 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.619
 a wonderful passion fruit pie here 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.720
 of the beloved Patricia who knows how to use 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.340
 Well, it 's true, I do not want to talk too much. 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.810
 let's not play with the ingredients mode 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.500
 of preparation and will stay here 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 A delight for you to eat. 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.410
 the staff is the first that will make 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.930
 pick up and make the dough then we 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.850
 It makes with the biscuit of maisena and the people 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.190
 will come back here in the blender and will 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.229
 use a business called pulsar here 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.820
 should have your blender that is like 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.440
 if it were an indicator crusher 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.510
 there is no painting of the other we use 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.090
 this technique here very technical 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.340
 far-fetched and then we go back to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.200
 little on the hill vote at once 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.130
 need the mine gets worse 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 and that's it 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.009
 we finished here to make the farofa 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.710
 case of maize case in putting everything 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.140
 here on the farm here on the false 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.140
 than we can make the pasta and 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.079
 everything else 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:09.810
 bacca everything here we got to the greatest 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:13.769
 and we will add the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.880
 butter and butter so I am 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.450
 cook, right? 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.140
 you get only 100 to 200 grams more 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.870
 You get the womanizer so more or 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.560
 less and taka there only that neither near than 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.010
 It helps to press but there and you go 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.069
 changing the butter and mixing 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.130
 along with the farofa until it becomes a farofa 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.620
 wet if you get a more malleable deal 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.599
 giving it to you to organize a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.109
 maybe the box that the band plays 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.760
 So you have to stay in a more 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.560
 Broad I do not know exactly what to do 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.489
 but I'm going to come here you 'll call 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.489
 because I speak 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.620
 when the mass is more or less 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.049
 so at this point I 'll show you 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.540
 you have to make the dough cover the whole 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.159
 region of form and there you will take 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.989
 then to the preheated oven for 10 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.209
 minutes to leave the air for 10 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.609
 minutes until March to brown and hamas is 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.250
 ready very easy to do we can 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.250
 pass to the filling after that 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.579
 so we're going to hit the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.799
 passion fruit is what we are going to cut and 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.519
 pulp and put inside the 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.950
 indicator 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.139
 we have this business here will not 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.900
 let alone the south begin 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:21.340
 You've just hit it very quickly. 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.340
 only you go through what is 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:25.979
 The galley turned out good, angels garden. 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:26.819
 The militia I 'm going to give to prove jack 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:30.240

 canal cooking gives a job then 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.729

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.430
 I was text that will do if donated already 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:02.860
