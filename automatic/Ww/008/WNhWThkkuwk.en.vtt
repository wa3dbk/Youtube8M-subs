 like cinnamon cloves 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.420

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.830
 with sugar meanwhile 1 mont 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.610
 fire in a pot where it is adding 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:46.080
 milk part in the mixture slowly 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.080
 until it is diluted 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.420
 and the development of new formulations 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.160
 and recipes that Senna uses 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.300

 to ensure the nutrition of their children 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.250
 is with the diet is very important 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.919
