00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 who says at union maintenance 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.660
 bordeaux-bÃ¨gles says necessarily relegation 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.599
 has for agent the agenais condemned to the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.000
 pro d2 this even before receiving the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 French stage this afternoon fasting and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.619
 historic club with eight titles of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.859
 champion of France returns to pro 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.570
 d2 three years after coming back into 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.670
 the elite not easy necessarily to get 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.019
 motivate in these conditions there frederic 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.760
 viard that the atmosphere was heavy 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.130
 for the image and in any case before the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
 kick-off 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.880
 not too isabelle in fact because when everything 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.800
 is lost except honor it remains the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.420
 matches without pressure and then search 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.829
 maybe that's fun and in rugby the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 pleasure often it's like happiness 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.700
 he is in the meadow in this case on 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 the meadow on the ground in the image of a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.980
 marc giraud it's two o'clock and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.059
 half of the match so not too much pressure 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.170
 nor for monribot and even philippe sella 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.090
 seemed to have a small smile 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.559
 nevertheless the objective was displayed 1 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.539
 you have to win the last two matches 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.739
 at home this one and perpignan the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.059
 next week and besides these are 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.649
 the agenais who are the first to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 take the points to lead 3 0 but 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.680
 this is the French stage is in confidence 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.940
 right now he showed it he even 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 trust young people who are 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.540
 rather not bad in the image of a good 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.430
 son at tailgating today who at 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.750
 each time played behind him because 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.460
 it was the watchword of Parisians 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.780
 today try to play up the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 for as long as possible and especially 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.840
 replay behind is successful 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.420
 maybe these agenais this action is 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 very very long and we find 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 warwick at the opening again with my 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.619
 son we went back within 22 meters 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.900
 agen the balloon that will sleep in hand 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.030
 up to that of felipe contepomi and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.400
 this is the first try of the match on a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 long long action parisian party 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.090
 of their half of the Parisian land 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.500
 with two interventions little bonfils 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.610
 and the shower or the young person who is there 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.180
 also for son we will find him 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.460
 with this warwick pass and this 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.590
 release at the last moment for felipe 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.939
 talepomi who silences him and his 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.110
 back in this stadium team 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.280
 French who comes to mark so the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.740
 first try of the match to allow 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.750
 his team to lead 7 to 3 after a small 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.579
 just under a quarter of an hour 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 the agenais them always have as much 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.370
 of attention and will even go mark 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.500
 a 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.270
 mixing vaquin will resume inside 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.100
 you've heard the armandie audience 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 moan then when we see the first 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.010
 slow motion it's true that it's played well 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.920
 until then and 20 cases that will bed 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.180
 inside m and if we change cameras 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.580
 and if we go on the azure plane sees 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.110
 that 20 cases 20 vaquin forgiveness forgets two 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.520
 agenais notably known to lens and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.020
 nobody could stop him but 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.430
 here is an action that is missing a bit 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.660
 of realism and the defenses are very 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.710
 beefy especially on the side of agen you 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.150
 Just ask felipe contepomi 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.320
 what they think even if the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.730
 last points of this first 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.900
 period they are marked by porical and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.180
 at the break it's 13 to 6 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.680
 the future class 1 genesis and watch it 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.060
 the match is not yet the pro d2 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.380
 it's the bottle class and then especially 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.580
 the agenais return in second 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.840
 period with a lot more grinta 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.070
 a lot more envied but 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.750
 unfortunately still not enough 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.700
 realistic too much balloons lost and this 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.980
 this time it's felipe contepomi and who 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.240
 recovers 7 badly adjusted passes and 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.070
 comes to mark his second try 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.270
 staff he had waited eleven minutes 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.740
 in the first period to mark his 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.360
 death is there he just two 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.490
 minutes in the second period to go 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.320
 recover this balloon with the passage a 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.760
 nice tightrope walk but we know that 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.680
 it's an artist felipe contepomi 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.630
 makes even laugh david auradou hanna-elias 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.210
 because at that moment the mark of 18 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.350
 and from 18 to 6 and that's the gap the most 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.270
 important since the beginning of the match 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.590
 always so defensive buffer 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.989
 Marc Giraud will even take him out 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.100
 concussed on this new buffer but 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.810
 when I told you more grinta 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.160
 on the east side of agen here it is with laure 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.260
 and who gets this balloon who can 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.030
 serve and and guns and look 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.950
 as it is well done we can be a 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.480
 hooker we can go very fast 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.730
 it's Julian Arias who goes anyway 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.700
 look for the hooker replacing the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.430
 nice little kick in the way and 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.000
 the offering for the substitute hooker 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.800
 telephony caught up in extremis by 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.900
 arias still result no point 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.600
 for agenais and it starts to annoy 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.410
 seriously arica because because 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.330
 that there are things to do 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.830
 there is so much lagard attention is 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
 returned to the opening it is he who goes 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.860
 to serve edmond-samuel sure of her 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.420
 the acceleration of edmond samuel who can 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.680
 give back inside for the rear guard 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.150
 and the little gesture of the hand comes 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.650
 cross because I'm taking care of 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.269
 last defender these arias and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.590
 the offering for edmond samuel and here 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.480
 the second test agenais 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.780
 with the transformation it allows to 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.280
 go back to 13 18 yes there are only five 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.349
 difference points and 20 minutes to play 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.030
 again I remind you the purpose of the 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.550
 agenais win the last two matches 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.930
 at home to thank the audience who 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.550
 has been faithful throughout this year 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.040
 is very complicated mathieu blin knows it 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.480
 it rains can the agenais going 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.220
 to force this mac street but here is another 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.290
 times there is so much intention even 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.150
 Parisian side with Arias is going to be 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.440
 propelled into touch left in May which 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.220
 release his ball just before and then 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.900
 made it back the substitutes 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.100
 williams Parisian side with me is 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.930
 also the alternate pillar that is 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.280
 stopped just a few meters from the 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.330
 goal line one must hold the defense 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.139
 Agenaise worked so well 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.820
 until now 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.620
 and then it's gurruchaga to the Argentine 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.150
 who is also going to these small tictacs 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.470
 and the balloon that will be recovered 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.370
 again by a replacement returned 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.320
 a few minutes ago 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.460
 tommy tea that comes flattening in 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.780
 the in- year year that's what's going to be 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.340
 validated to the video so look at you 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.080
 go this is this image that viral tian 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.650
 and with the assistant of sir 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.960
 Berdos 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.820
 we will understand why this is him 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.500
 and validated to video because it is 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.490
 well flattened by tommy who is he grumbling 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.320
 holds because they help me I 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.090
 pushed Arias into touch where he pushed in 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.710
 touch them keep the ball that goes 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.630
 leave the hands daria this before his 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.830
 foot having touch so the test was 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.900
 really a valid 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.789
 nothing to say and at the same time with a 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.800
 new penalty of porical stadium 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.960
 French goes back to 28 13 but that's it 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.479
 we want agen side really good 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.580
 finish this season with photo key that 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.130
 took the place of sodium is behind 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.139
 losada the 2nd i who will go even in 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.110
 the in-goal to flatten this third try 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.760
 agenais to bring the mark back to 20 to 28 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.289
 May 2 to the limit is almost more than 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.370
 regrets of the goal for agen who will not have 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.840
 been until the end then in this 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.400
 part we saw envy we saw 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.919
 tests and some ponds have 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.220
 also watched miss or with 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.889
 handcuffs 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.510
 here are a few fluffy stuff and 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.340
 look at that it was cute it was 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.120
 missoup who came to chamber after 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.889
 votes for ten months 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.360
 your box is not super efficient it's a 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.349
 little one box two girls if you 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.430
 allow expression but still 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.630
 what was nice is the handle of 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.370
 hand between the two men at the end 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.710
 because it is the French state that is needed 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.480
 and david darricarrÃ¨re may be disappointed 28 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.620
 to twenty second away win 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.620
 this season for the French stadium 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.599
 but agen who finds the pro d2 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.550
 it's a new page of the club 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.410
 turns frÃ©dÃ©ric and despite this 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.900
 apparent decadence of which you 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.110
 spoke the emotion had to be force to 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.490
 armandie yes that's really felt 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.569
 at the end of the match by the way all 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.159
 players found themselves in the 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.990
 cloakroom the door was closed by the 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.280
 manager himself a philippe sella who 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.479
 yet is still very open on 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.789
 said things probably and 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.349
 to have the face behind the president 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.030
 tingaud coming out we also 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.139
 parliament talk about the future but 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.120
 it was really the grimace soup 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.440
 tonight on the agen side because still 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.090
 once the goal was clear to entice 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.750
 and win the last two matches at 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.210
 home 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.680
 so even though we talked about the future we 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.599
 really wants to the image of the manager 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.220
 philippe sella finish the season 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.509
 philippe that was very emotional all over 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.080
 the hour at the microphone of christophe me 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:42.270
 showering the end of the season is for us 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.159
 for all those who participated in the 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.300
 season this year what's left this 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:49.620
 they leave 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:54.129
 and so I will not make any connection between 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.690
 this year next year just I 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.039
 disappointed it's because what I 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.699
 wish was what I wish in 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.539
 finish as best as possible this season 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:05.650
 it's not a defeat 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:08.259
 it's not a match with 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.490
 approximations of the gifts that we 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:15.159
 not allow to define with a sixth 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.780
 victory only moved touched philips 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:17.770
 is there but he quickly recovered we know 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.629
 that he was a fighter 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.250
 incredible when he was a player 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:22.569
 philippe sun and not an hour and 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.550
 half after the match look at it with 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:26.590
 mathieu lamoulie and he is already in the process 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.789
 to try to pass him that rage of 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.289
 overcome this desire to finish well 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:33.150
 the year like what when we were a 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.150
 great player we also have a great manager
