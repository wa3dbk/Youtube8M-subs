all right for you guys out there that
may<00:00:27.789> have<00:00:27.820> one<00:00:28.150> of<00:00:28.180> these<00:00:28.360> Harbor<00:00:29.170> Freight

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
may have one of these Harbor Freight

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.569 
may have one of these Harbor Freight
lifts<00:00:30.880> with<00:00:31.570> this<00:00:31.810> unique<00:00:32.320> jack

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
lifts with this unique jack

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.660 
lifts with this unique jack
and<00:00:34.329> when<00:00:34.480> I<00:00:34.510> say<00:00:34.720> unique<00:00:35.079> it's<00:00:35.680> got<00:00:36.640> a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
and when I say unique it's got a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.729 
and when I say unique it's got a
built-in<00:00:37.090> eyelet<00:00:37.629> in<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.900> bottom<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.440> then

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
built-in eyelet in the bottom and then

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.119 
built-in eyelet in the bottom and then
the<00:00:38.829> top<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:41.050> issue<00:00:41.230> is<00:00:41.559> is<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:41.949> if<00:00:42.040> they

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
the top now the issue is is that if they

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.970 
the top now the issue is is that if they
go<00:00:42.280> bad<00:00:43.019> you<00:00:44.019> can't<00:00:44.260> good<00:00:44.470> luck<00:00:44.650> finding<00:00:44.860> one

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
go bad you can't good luck finding one

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.299 
go bad you can't good luck finding one
of<00:00:45.100> these<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:46.530> when<00:00:47.530> that's<00:00:47.650> Harbor<00:00:48.070> Freight

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
of these so when that's Harbor Freight

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.820 
of these so when that's Harbor Freight
and<00:00:48.879> I<00:00:49.000> bought<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.420> replacement<00:00:49.690> jack<00:00:50.260> thinking

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
and I bought a replacement jack thinking

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.829 
and I bought a replacement jack thinking
I'd<00:00:50.920> have<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.220> remodel<00:00:51.580> I<00:00:51.850> but<00:00:52.540> then<00:00:52.660> when<00:00:52.809> I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
I'd have to remodel I but then when I

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.439 
I'd have to remodel I but then when I
got<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.140> looking<00:00:53.500> at<00:00:53.650> this<00:00:53.860> Jack<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:54.550> realized

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
got to looking at this Jack I realized

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.990 
got to looking at this Jack I realized
that<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.710> was<00:00:56.830> really<00:00:57.190> wrong<00:00:57.430> with<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.850> and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
that what was really wrong with it and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.590 
that what was really wrong with it and
wasn't<00:00:58.809> so<00:00:58.900> much<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.080> jack<00:00:59.500> itself<00:01:00.360> hits<00:01:01.360> the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
wasn't so much the jack itself hits the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.980 
wasn't so much the jack itself hits the
arm<00:01:01.869> and<00:01:02.409> it's<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.799> plunger<00:01:03.780> system<00:01:06.990> we're

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
arm and it's the plunger system we're

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.020 
arm and it's the plunger system we're
not<00:01:08.110> really<00:01:08.260> going<00:01:08.500> into<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.920> this<00:01:09.670> has<00:01:10.000> a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
not really going into it this has a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.980 
not really going into it this has a
little<00:01:10.270> arm<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:10.930> it

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.490 

this<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.799> this<00:01:18.159> is<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.400> original<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
this is the this is the original and the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.410 
this is the this is the original and the
original<00:01:21.130> doesn't<00:01:21.670> have

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
original doesn't have

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.789 
original doesn't have
a<00:01:23.509> little<00:01:24.229> warm<00:01:24.439> on<00:01:24.799> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a little warm on it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.529 
a little warm on it
so<00:01:26.570> basically<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:28.619> plunger<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.119> kinked

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
so basically this plunger can get kinked

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.810 
so basically this plunger can get kinked
the<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.740> designed<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.399> very<00:01:32.609> well

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the way this is designed not very well

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.109 
the way this is designed not very well
and<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> gets<00:01:34.200> kink<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.280> washers<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.789> bad

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and when it gets kink the washers go bad

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
and when it gets kink the washers go bad
inside<00:01:36.539> or<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> seals<00:01:37.289> and<00:01:37.649> then<00:01:38.280> you're

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
inside or the seals and then you're

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.059 
inside or the seals and then you're
going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> lose<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.299> pressure<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> what

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
going to lose all your pressure so what

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:48.380 
going to lose all your pressure so what
I<00:01:41.130> did<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:42.049> about<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.259> guy<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.179> took<00:01:45.209> off

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.310 

the<00:01:48.960> arm<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.550> plunger<00:01:50.820> mechanism<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the arm and the plunger mechanism and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.990 
the arm and the plunger mechanism and
then<00:01:52.410> she<00:01:52.530> put<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.830> here<00:01:53.130> connected<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.700> test

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
then she put it on here connected a test

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.630 
then she put it on here connected a test
and<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.990> actually<00:01:55.290> makes<00:01:55.470> pressure<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.280> we're

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and it actually makes pressure so we're

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.080 
and it actually makes pressure so we're
good

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
good

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
good
what<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.350> attempt<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
what I'm going to do now is attempt to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.880 
what I'm going to do now is attempt to
remount<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.810> issue<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.770> going

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
remount this the issue is that I'm going

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
remount this the issue is that I'm going
to<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.580> that<00:02:02.910> this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.870> of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to have here is that this is was kind of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.610 
to have here is that this is was kind of
a<00:02:04.080> old<00:02:04.500> system<00:02:05.010> I'm<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:06.120> have<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
a old system I'm going to have to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.820 
a old system I'm going to have to
re-engineer<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.899> way<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.259> pumping<00:02:10.619> system

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
re-engineer the way the pumping system

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.559 
re-engineer the way the pumping system
are<00:02:11.490> operates<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.630> how<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.930> how<00:02:13.830> it

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
are operates and how it how it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.610 
are operates and how it how it
makes<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:17.189> function<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.359> articulating<00:02:19.049> so

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
makes this function and articulating so

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.890 
makes this function and articulating so
I<00:02:20.010> hope<00:02:20.249> that<00:02:20.310> makes<00:02:20.489> sense<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:20.909> so<00:02:21.450> gotta<00:02:21.659> I'm

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
I hope that makes sense but so gotta I'm

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.539 
I hope that makes sense but so gotta I'm
going<00:02:22.109> to<00:02:22.170> reinstall<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.129> the

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
going to reinstall this and then the

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.530 
going to reinstall this and then the
second<00:02:23.879> job<00:02:23.999> will<00:02:24.269> be<00:02:24.359> B<00:02:24.719> then<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.939> make<00:02:26.939> it<00:02:26.969> so

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
second job will be B then to make it so

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.530 
second job will be B then to make it so
the<00:02:28.469> hand<00:02:29.430> crank<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:29.969> other<00:02:30.090> excuse<00:02:30.450> me

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the hand crank on the other excuse me

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.520 
the hand crank on the other excuse me
the<00:02:30.629> foot<00:02:30.810> crank<00:02:31.019> on<00:02:31.109> the<00:02:31.200> other<00:02:31.349> side

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
the foot crank on the other side

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.250 
the foot crank on the other side
actually<00:02:31.799> engages<00:02:32.639> this<00:02:32.969> properly<00:02:33.389> and<00:02:33.719> makes

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
actually engages this properly and makes

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:49.160 
actually engages this properly and makes
the<00:02:35.599> fixes<00:02:36.599> Jack<00:02:36.719> work<00:02:36.930> right<00:02:37.280> that's<00:02:38.280> it

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.250 

all<00:02:50.170> right<00:02:50.290> let's<00:02:50.440> have<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.620> look<00:02:50.799> so<00:02:52.140> just<00:02:53.140> to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
all right let's have a look so just to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.589 
all right let's have a look so just to
give<00:02:53.379> me<00:02:53.500> some<00:02:53.830> space<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.459> put<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.120> jack<00:02:55.420> in

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
give me some space I put this jack in

arm now actuates this and just to show
you<00:03:31.420> guys<00:03:31.840> it's<00:03:32.049> working<00:03:40.049> jack<00:03:41.049> is<00:03:41.319> working

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
you guys it's working jack is working

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.670 
you guys it's working jack is working
now<00:03:42.180> which<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.650> very<00:03:44.650> cool<00:03:46.230> but<00:03:47.230> I've<00:03:47.349> just<00:03:47.379> got

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
now which is very cool but I've just got

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.930 
now which is very cool but I've just got
to<00:03:47.769> figure<00:03:47.980> out<00:03:48.040> how<00:03:50.640> we've<00:03:51.640> got<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.849> figure

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
to figure out how we've got to figure

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.990 
to figure out how we've got to figure
out<00:03:52.060> how<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.450> arm<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:54.010> going<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.250> engage<00:03:54.400> this

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
out how this arm is going to engage this

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.059 
out how this arm is going to engage this
properly<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.200> that'll<00:03:56.470> be<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.739> next<00:03:56.859> task

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
properly so that'll be the next task

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.759 
properly so that'll be the next task
okay<00:04:00.069> so<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.669> taking<00:04:00.940> me<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.150> day<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:02.049> it

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
okay so it's taking me all day and it

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.369 
okay so it's taking me all day and it
was<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.099> lot<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.250> trial<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:03.760> error<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:05.079> in<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
was a lot of trial and error and in the

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.159 
was a lot of trial and error and in the
end<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:07.120> was<00:04:07.239> actually<00:04:07.599> a<00:04:07.629> pretty<00:04:07.840> simple

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
end it was actually a pretty simple

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.319 
end it was actually a pretty simple
solution<00:04:08.950> but<00:04:09.870> I'm<00:04:10.870> not<00:04:11.019> an<00:04:11.200> engineer<00:04:11.319> so<00:04:12.329> what

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
solution but I'm not an engineer so what

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.659 
solution but I'm not an engineer so what
I<00:04:13.359> did<00:04:13.480> was<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:15.209> ended<00:04:16.209> up<00:04:16.359> having<00:04:16.599> to<00:04:16.900> cut<00:04:16.930> oh

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
I did was I ended up having to cut oh

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.470 
I did was I ended up having to cut oh
well<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:18.789> year

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.030 

cut<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.710> arm<00:04:24.100> down<00:04:24.430> was<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:24.940> lot<00:04:25.180> longer<00:04:26.040> this

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
cut this arm down was a lot longer this

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.690 
cut this arm down was a lot longer this
is<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.340> mechanism<00:04:28.000> from<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:29.700> substitute

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
is the mechanism from the substitute

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.200 
is the mechanism from the substitute
jack<00:04:31.350> put<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:32.710> there<00:04:32.920> notched<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:34.030> out<00:04:34.180> a

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
jack put that in there notched it out a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.610 
jack put that in there notched it out a
little<00:04:34.390> bit<00:04:34.660> so<00:04:34.840> things<00:04:35.020> could<00:04:35.200> articulate

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
little bit so things could articulate

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.850 
little bit so things could articulate
probably<00:04:36.160> more<00:04:36.340> than<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.610> needed<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:38.440> then

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
probably more than I needed to and then

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.070 
probably more than I needed to and then
the<00:04:39.580> best<00:04:39.790> thing<00:04:40.030> would<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.270> do<00:04:40.390> was<00:04:40.660> because

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
the best thing would to do was because

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.560 
the best thing would to do was because
this<00:04:41.380> pivots<00:04:42.310> here<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.000> had<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.240> keep<00:04:43.420> this

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
this pivots here and I had to keep this

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.160 
this pivots here and I had to keep this
straight

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
straight

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.030 
straight
or<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.770> straight<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:46.210> pivots<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.920> you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
or this straight and that pivots and you

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.500 
or this straight and that pivots and you
really<00:04:48.280> need<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.670> here<00:04:48.910> otherwise<00:04:49.090> the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
really need this here otherwise the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.140 
really need this here otherwise the
plunger<00:04:49.870> is<00:04:49.990> going<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.230> get<00:04:50.460> out<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.640> shape<00:04:51.880> and

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
plunger is going to get out of shape and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150 
plunger is going to get out of shape and
then<00:04:52.390> it's<00:04:52.570> going<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.810> bust<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.470> seals<00:04:53.740> inside

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
then it's going to bust the seals inside

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.120 
then it's going to bust the seals inside
and<00:04:54.310> you're<00:04:54.400> going<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.580> be<00:04:54.640> screwed<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:56.070> all<00:04:57.070> I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
and you're going to be screwed so all I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.670 
and you're going to be screwed so all I
did<00:04:57.280> was<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:58.080> welder<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.230> here<00:05:00.600> replace<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.990> pin

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
did was a welder to here replace the pin

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.770 
did was a welder to here replace the pin
that<00:05:02.830> was<00:05:03.010> holding<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.610> before<00:05:04.000> with<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.330> bolt

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
that was holding it before with a bolt

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.980 
that was holding it before with a bolt
and<00:05:05.310> then<00:05:06.310> as<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:06.550> can<00:05:06.670> see<00:05:06.820> I've<00:05:06.970> got<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.510> had

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
and then as you can see I've got I had

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.870 
and then as you can see I've got I had
to<00:05:08.080> do<00:05:08.170> a<00:05:08.200> couple<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.500> different<00:05:08.740> holes<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:09.220> see

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
to do a couple of different holes to see

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.260 
to do a couple of different holes to see
which<00:05:10.120> would<00:05:10.300> work<00:05:10.600> best<00:05:10.930> but<00:05:12.030> just<00:05:13.030> kind<00:05:13.240> of

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
which would work best but just kind of

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.440 
which would work best but just kind of
made<00:05:13.450> my<00:05:13.600> own<00:05:13.630> linkage<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.670> then<00:05:15.670> here<00:05:16.330> as

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
made my own linkage and then here as

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.650
