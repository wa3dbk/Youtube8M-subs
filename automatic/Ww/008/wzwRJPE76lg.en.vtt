00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
we really expected it's actually a gated

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.819 
we really expected it's actually a gated
community<00:03:48.700> was<00:03:49.420> really<00:03:49.749> not<00:03:50.109> what<00:03:50.379> we<00:03:50.560> had<00:03:50.799> in

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
community was really not what we had in

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.580 
community was really not what we had in
mind<00:03:51.219> but<00:03:51.659> living<00:03:52.659> in<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.989> middle<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.319> nowhere

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
mind but living in the middle of nowhere

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.489 
mind but living in the middle of nowhere
that<00:03:54.159> is<00:03:54.790> neither<00:03:55.510> what<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:55.989> were<00:03:56.139> looking<00:03:56.469> for

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:56.499 
that is neither what we were looking for

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.740 
that is neither what we were looking for
so<00:03:57.159> here<00:03:57.639> we<00:03:57.760> really<00:03:57.909> have<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.299> feeling<00:03:58.510> like

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
so here we really have the feeling like

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.559 
so here we really have the feeling like
there's<00:03:59.739> enough<00:04:00.010> movement<00:04:00.280> around<00:04:00.849> me<00:04:01.060> but

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
there's enough movement around me but

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.440 
there's enough movement around me but
it's<00:04:01.750> still<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.290> quiet<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:03.099> we<00:04:03.670> can<00:04:04.090> go<00:04:04.269> for

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
it's still so quiet that we can go for

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.830 
it's still so quiet that we can go for
hours<00:04:04.629> beach<00:04:05.109> walk<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:07.000> only<00:04:07.329> met<00:04:07.510> two<00:04:07.659> or
