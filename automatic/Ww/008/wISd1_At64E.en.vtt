00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 aesthetic appreciation painting 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.139
 workshop of analysis of the paintings of the great masters 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.009
 and the starry night 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
 Vincent van Gogh 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.310
 it's an expressionist landscape 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.220
 where the moon appears in one of the angles 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.409
 It is as radiant as a sun 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.510
 the sky is full of stars that seem to be spinning and taking fire 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.070
 in the center and along the sky a strange form coiled 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.960
 in the foreground some cypresses and die violently as if ripping from the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.850
 land 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.070
 at the bottom 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.820
 a field trees and hills also move around the only 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.720
 still elements 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.410
 a church with its auction in abuja 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.360
 and some small houses 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.360
 with its windows on 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 our knowledge of the life of bank 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.990
 They suggest that the subject is a reflection of the author's internal life. 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 emotional torments his failed search for peace 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.420
 his terrible loneliness 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 and periods of irrationality to suffer 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.290
 in its composition the painting seems a spontaneous appearance but in reality 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.910
 this highly calculated 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 the ascending twisting of the forms of the cypresses 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.870
 it is used to slow down a bit the royal way that crosses the sky 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.610
 both ways of life more and be exaggerated or dominate others 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.100
 the strongest shadows of the cypresses 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
 they contrast with the strongest light of the moon 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.110
 the needle of the church unifies the composition echoing the forms 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.629
 of the cypresses 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.999
 and interrupting 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.459
 the undulata line of the sky and the mountains 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.989
 as for the color 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.529
 van gogh is direct 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.529
 as if the colors had gone directly 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.599
 of the paint tube in his hand 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.789
 actually 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.719
 he experimented with promates to obtain this effect 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:35.119
 in conclusion the art of bango expressing the need felt by 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.489
 communicate 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.769
 and reflects the isolation that they lived as an individual 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.279
