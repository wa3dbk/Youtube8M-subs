mtar<00:00:35.520> has<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> 4224<00:00:36.600> damage<00:00:37.350> range<00:00:37.620> while<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
mtar has a 4224 damage range while the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910 
mtar has a 4224 damage range while the
type<00:00:38.250> 25<00:00:38.399> has<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> 33<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> 22<00:00:39.989> damage<00:00:40.290> range<00:00:40.500> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
type 25 has a 33 to 22 damage range so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.910 
type 25 has a 33 to 22 damage range so
the<00:00:41.100> type<00:00:41.280> 25<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:42.329> bit<00:00:42.450> weaker<00:00:42.920> they

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the type 25 is a little bit weaker they

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.119 
the type 25 is a little bit weaker they
both<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.700> 30<00:00:45.270> bullet<00:00:45.930> mag<00:00:46.230> size<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.950> they

both have a 30 bullet mag size and they
both<00:00:47.280> come<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.550> 90<00:00:47.940> extra<00:00:48.270> bullets<00:00:48.600> when<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
both come with 90 extra bullets when you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.220 
both come with 90 extra bullets when you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
start off a match the mtar shoots at 750

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
start off a match the mtar shoots at 750
rounds<00:00:52.440> per<00:00:52.920> minute<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> type<00:00:53.879> 25<00:00:54.000> shoots

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
rounds per minute but the type 25 shoots

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
rounds per minute but the type 25 shoots
a<00:00:54.629> little<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:54.960> faster<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.469> 937<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> half

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a little bit faster at 937 and a half

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.610 
a little bit faster at 937 and a half
rounds<00:00:57.329> per<00:00:57.480> minute<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.500> opinion

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
rounds per minute which in my opinion

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920 
rounds per minute which in my opinion
the<00:00:58.890> faster<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> gun<00:00:59.609> shoots<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.480> better<00:01:00.690> can

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the faster the gun shoots the better can

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.540 
the faster the gun shoots the better can
make<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.289> its<00:01:01.590> lack<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.829> damage<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
make up for its lack of damage in this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.549 
make up for its lack of damage in this
case<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> type<00:01:03.149> 25<00:01:03.270> makes<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.350> its<00:01:04.439> lack

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
case the type 25 makes up for its lack

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.740 
case the type 25 makes up for its lack
of<00:01:04.739> damage<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.280> its<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.850> high<00:01:06.150> fire<00:01:06.479> rate

the mtar with an empty clip takes two

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
the mtar with an empty clip takes two

the clip is completely empty it takes

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
the clip is completely empty it takes
two<00:01:12.720> point<00:01:12.990> nine<00:01:13.049> seven<00:01:13.350> seconds<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> reload

the type 25 takes two point three two
seconds<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> reload<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.330> when<00:01:18.479> it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
seconds to reload but when it's

seconds to reload but when it's
completely<00:01:19.020> empty<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.680> takes<00:01:19.890> two<00:01:20.159> point<00:01:20.549> nine

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
completely empty it takes two point nine
five<00:01:20.759> seconds<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.659> isn't<00:01:21.930> much<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
five seconds there isn't much of a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
five seconds there isn't much of a
difference<00:01:22.710> there<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> type<00:01:23.880> 25<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
difference there but the type 25 is a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
difference there but the type 25 is a
little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.049> faster<00:01:25.530> both<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.250> not

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
little bit faster both when it's not

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
little bit faster both when it's not
empty<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.240> when<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.750> completely<00:01:28.350> empty

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
empty and when it is completely empty

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.069 
empty and when it is completely empty
looking<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> recoil<00:01:30.030> patterns<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.930> can

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
looking at the recoil patterns you can

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.380 
looking at the recoil patterns you can
see<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> type<00:01:31.740> 25<00:01:31.829> has<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> much<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:33.060> up

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
see that the type 25 has a much more up

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780 
see that the type 25 has a much more up
and<00:01:33.780> down<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.680> recoil<00:01:35.009> pattern<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and down kind of recoil pattern which is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.670 
and down kind of recoil pattern which is
probably<00:01:36.090> due<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> its<00:01:36.570> high<00:01:36.600> fire<00:01:37.020> rate<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
probably due to its high fire rate the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
probably due to its high fire rate the
mtar<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.100> much<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.640> manageable<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:39.990> much

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
mtar is much more manageable it has much

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
mtar is much more manageable it has much
less<00:01:40.470> recoil<00:01:40.710> than<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> type<00:01:41.280> 25<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.119> another

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
less recoil than the type 25 so another

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.109 
less recoil than the type 25 so another
recap<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.320> mtar<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> great<00:01:44.610> gun<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:44.970> you're

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
recap the mtar is a great gun if you're

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.080 
recap the mtar is a great gun if you're
looking<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.540> our<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.549> recoil<00:01:47.549> manageability

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
looking for our and recoil manageability

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.840 
looking for our and recoil manageability
but<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> has<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> generally<00:01:49.950> slower<00:01:50.369> rate<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but it has a generally slower rate of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.389 
but it has a generally slower rate of
fire<00:01:51.060> than<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> type<00:01:51.630> 25<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.649> type<00:01:52.829> 25<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
fire than the type 25 the type 25 is a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.999 
fire than the type 25 the type 25 is a
great<00:01:53.729> gun<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.270> you're<00:01:54.420> looking<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.780> fast<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
great gun if you're looking for fast and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.520 
great gun if you're looking for fast and
quick<00:01:56.280> kills<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:57.930> weak<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
quick kills but it is very weak and the
