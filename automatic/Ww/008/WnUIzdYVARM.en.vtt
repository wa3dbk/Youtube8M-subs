00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
with them enough for me to like pass

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.490 
with them enough for me to like pass
judgment<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.630> which<00:01:27.780> ones<00:01:27.990> were<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> best

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
judgment on which ones were at the best

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
judgment on which ones were at the best
I<00:01:28.650> want<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> experiment<00:01:29.250> hold<00:01:29.549> them<00:01:29.759> first<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
I want to experiment hold them first and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
I want to experiment hold them first and

great so that's the work craze on the
best<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> the

what<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.480> want<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:18.870> sometimes<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.410> do

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
what you want because sometimes you do

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.350 
what you want because sometimes you do
want<00:02:19.710> them<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.010> stick<00:02:20.250> back<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> high

defensive workrate and a lower attacking
work<00:02:23.790> great<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.300> guess<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> works<00:02:24.780> for<00:02:24.870> them

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960
