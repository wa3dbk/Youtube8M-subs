00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.070
The Mystery of Nanoflares - 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.050
presented by Science@NASA

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.260
When you attach the prefix 'nano' to something, 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.350
it usually means 'very small'. 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.090
Solar flares appear to be the exception. 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.860
But researchers are studying a type of explosion 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.120
on the sun called a 'nanoflare.' 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620
A billion times less energetic than ordinary flares, 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.060
nanoflares nevertheless have a strength that belies their name.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.290
'A typical 'nanoflare' 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.710
has the same energy as 240 megatons of TNT,' 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.850
says physicist David Smith of UC Santa Cruz.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.920
'That would be something like 10,000 atomic fission bombs.'

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.080
The sun can go days, 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.540
weeks or even months 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.390
without producing large solar flares. 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.960
Nanoflares, on the other hand, 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.060
are crackling on the sun almost non-stop.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.200
'They appear as little brightenings of the solar surface 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.500
at extreme ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths,' 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.670
continues Smith.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.140
'The first sightings go back to Skylab in the 1970s.'

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.530
The relentless crackle of nanoflares 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.080
might solve a long-standing mystery in solar physics: 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.080
What causes the sun's corona to be so hot?

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.740
Imagine standing in front of a roaring fire.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.620
You feel the warmth of the flames. 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.320
Now back away.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.910
You get cooler, right? 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.820
That's not how it works on the sun. 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.050
The visible surface of the sun, 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.480
called the photosphere, 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.400
has a temperature of 5500 C. 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.900
Moving away from the surface should provide some relief. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.140
Instead, the sun's upper atmosphere, 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.030
known as the 'solar corona,' 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.570
sizzles at a million degrees--

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.700
a temperature almost 200 times higher 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.080
than that of the roaring furnace below.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.810
For more than a half-century, 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.870
astronomers have tried to figure out 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.120
what causes the corona to be so hot. 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.650
Every year or so, 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.680
a press release appears purporting to solve the mystery, 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.030
only to be replaced by a competing theory 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.730
a year or so later.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.470
It is one of the most vexing problems in astrophysics.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.700
Smith thinks nanoflares might be involved. 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.790
For one thing, 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.340
they appear to be active throughout the solar cycle. 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.060
Over the course of about 11 years, 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.340
the sun  cycles through periods of high and low solar activity, 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.470
referred to as Solar Maximum 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340
and Solar Minimum respectively. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.010
While the frequency of large solar flares 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.690
is affected by this cycle, 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.690
nanoflare activity appears to remain constant 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.920
which could explain why the corona remains hot 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.630
even during Solar Minimum. 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.390
While each individual nanoflare 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.870
falls far short of the energy required to heat the sun's atmosphere, 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.540
collectively they might have no trouble doing the job.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.230
To investigate this possibility, 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.960
Smith turned to a telescope 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.310
designed to study something completely different.  

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.310
Launched in 2012, 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.410
NASA's NuSTAR X-ray telescope's primary mission 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.710
is to study black holes 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.420
and other extreme objects in the distant cosmos. 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.350
Solar scientists first thought of using NuSTAR 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.480
to study the sun about seven years ago, 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.740
after the space telescope's design and construction was underway. 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.520
Smith contacted the principal investigator, 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.230
Fiona Harrison of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.000
to see what she thought.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.500
'At first I thought the whole idea was crazy,' says Harrison. 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.530
'Why would we have the most sensitive 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.140
high energy X-ray telescope ever built, 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.510
designed to peer deep into the universe, 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.850
look at something in our own back yard?'

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.910
Eventually, she was convinced. 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.320
As Smith explained, 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.180
NuSTAR has just the right combination of sensitivity 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.250
and resolution to study the telltale X-ray flickers of nanoflares. 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.300
A test image they took in late 2014 removed any doubt. 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.700
NuSTAR turned toward the sun and, 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.590
working together with NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.170
captured one of the most beautiful images 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.570
in the history of solar astronomy.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.000
The next step, says Smith, 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.700
is to wait for Solar Minimum. 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.640
Having just passed Solar Maximum, 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.410
the current solar cycle will wind down in the next few years, 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.110
leaving the sun mostly free of sunspots 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.720
and other magnetic clutter that can obscure nanoflares. 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.550
NuSTAR will be able to survey the stellar surface 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.410
and gather data on these explosions 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.420
like no telescope has done before.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.200
Will it solve the mystery of nanoflares and the solar corona?  

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.960
'I don't know,' says Smith, 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.260
'but I cannot wait to try.'

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.930
