okay<00:00:04.690> so<00:00:04.750> I've<00:00:05.350> got<00:00:05.410> this<00:00:07.049> what<00:00:08.049> Kira<00:00:08.340> do<00:00:09.809> 2d

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
okay so I've got this what Kira do 2d

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.529 
okay so I've got this what Kira do 2d
gimble<00:00:12.010> and<00:00:12.969> I<00:00:13.900> wanted<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:14.500> fit<00:00:15.059> my<00:00:16.059> camera<00:00:16.390> to

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
gimble and I wanted to fit my camera to

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.029 
gimble and I wanted to fit my camera to
it<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:17.369> amee<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.900> unfortunately<00:00:20.650> done<00:00:20.800> quite

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
it the amee but unfortunately done quite

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.120 
it the amee but unfortunately done quite
fit<00:00:21.279> which<00:00:21.490> I<00:00:21.849> knew<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:22.679> various<00:00:23.679> ways<00:00:23.710> of

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
fit which I knew and various ways of

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.220 
fit which I knew and various ways of
getting<00:00:24.939> this<00:00:25.060> to<00:00:25.119> fit<00:00:25.509> at<00:00:25.839> once<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.900> craft

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
getting this to fit at once the craft

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.000 
getting this to fit at once the craft
knife<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:30.150> gradually<00:00:31.150> sort<00:00:31.390> of<00:00:31.890> cut<00:00:32.890> this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
knife and gradually sort of cut this

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.240 
knife and gradually sort of cut this
away<00:00:34.170> really<00:00:35.170> don't<00:00:35.650> they<00:00:35.710> ask<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.040> I<00:00:36.100> work

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
away really don't they ask and I work

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.920 
away really don't they ask and I work
particularly<00:00:36.520> well<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.600> think<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.840> would

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
particularly well and I think it would

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.190 
particularly well and I think it would
take<00:00:38.080> ages<00:00:38.440> because<00:00:38.590> this<00:00:39.310> is<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:41.110> bit

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
take ages because this is a little bit

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.840 
take ages because this is a little bit
over<00:00:41.380> half<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.680> millimeter<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.220> come<00:00:42.460> off<00:00:42.580> both

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
over half a millimeter to come off both

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.210 
over half a millimeter to come off both
ways<00:00:43.120> so<00:00:44.110> I've<00:00:44.350> come<00:00:44.500> up<00:00:44.530> with<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:44.800> way<00:00:44.950> I

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
ways so I've come up with the way I

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.990 
ways so I've come up with the way I
think<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.240> work<00:00:46.450> and<00:00:47.580> let's<00:00:48.580> see<00:00:48.730> how<00:00:48.790> we<00:00:48.850> get

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
think the work and let's see how we get

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.780 
think the work and let's see how we get
on

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
on

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.460 
on
first<00:00:51.790> of<00:00:51.910> all<00:00:52.000> going<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.270> take<00:00:52.450> that<00:00:52.690> virtual

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
first of all going to take that virtual

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.150 
first of all going to take that virtual
camera<00:00:53.800> cage<00:00:54.010> off<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.640> gimbal<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.010> then

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
camera cage off the gimbal and then

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.530 
camera cage off the gimbal and then
missus<00:00:57.490> to<00:00:57.580> come<00:00:57.760> up<00:00:57.850> with<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.030> way<00:00:58.180> of<00:00:58.300> cutting

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
missus to come up with a way of cutting

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.420 
missus to come up with a way of cutting
it<00:00:58.810> which<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.380> a<00:00:59.410> little<00:00:59.680> bit<00:00:59.800> more<00:00:59.980> efficient

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
it which is a little bit more efficient

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.430 
it which is a little bit more efficient
than<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.940> knife<00:01:01.330> or<00:01:01.570> anything<00:01:01.630> and<00:01:02.140> it's<00:01:02.320> gonna

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
than a knife or anything and it's gonna

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.060 
than a knife or anything and it's gonna
be<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.650> big<00:01:02.830> woman<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.989> I<00:01:05.049> went<00:01:05.199> for<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.379> trusty

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
be a big woman so I went for the trusty

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.489 
be a big woman so I went for the trusty
power<00:01:06.280> tool<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:07.359> thinking<00:01:07.810> if<00:01:08.109> I<00:01:08.229> try<00:01:08.439> and

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:08.499 
power tool and thinking if I try and

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:11.039 
power tool and thinking if I try and
hold<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.549> go<00:01:09.700> along<00:01:09.969> and<00:01:10.179> go<00:01:10.329> up<00:01:10.840> and

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
hold this and go along and go up and

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.609 
hold this and go along and go up and
down<00:01:11.259> this<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.070> move<00:01:12.539> so<00:01:13.539> I<00:01:13.780> thought<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:14.320> come<00:01:14.530> up

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
down this is move so I thought I come up

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.080 
down this is move so I thought I come up
with<00:01:14.649> an<00:01:14.829> idea<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.219> might<00:01:15.520> work<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.939> little

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
with an idea that might work a little

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.109 
with an idea that might work a little
bit<00:01:16.270> better<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.740> came<00:01:17.979> up<00:01:18.130> with<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.310> idea<00:01:18.700> of

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
bit better so I came up with the idea of

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.239 
bit better so I came up with the idea of
using<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:20.759> bits<00:01:21.759> of<00:01:21.880> paper<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.439> use<00:01:23.829> that<00:01:24.039> as

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
using just bits of paper and use that as

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:30.050 
using just bits of paper and use that as
a<00:01:26.219> basically<00:01:27.219> up<00:01:27.340> walk<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.210> sit<00:01:28.689> this<00:01:28.840> on

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
a basically up walk to sit this on

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.700 
a basically up walk to sit this on
double<00:01:31.060> keep<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.359> at<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.509> same<00:01:31.689> height<00:01:31.960> and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
double keep it at the same height and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.639 
double keep it at the same height and
then<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:33.520> can<00:01:34.119> just<00:01:34.299> hold<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.109> down<00:01:35.319> flat<00:01:35.619> on

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
then I can just hold this down flat on

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.499 
then I can just hold this down flat on
the<00:01:35.829> table<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.310> hopefully<00:01:36.520> just<00:01:36.999> go<00:01:37.119> back<00:01:37.329> and

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
the table and hopefully just go back and

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.539 
the table and hopefully just go back and
forwards<00:01:37.869> so<00:01:38.499> that<00:01:38.740> would<00:01:38.889> give<00:01:39.039> it<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.280> much

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
forwards so that would give it a much

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.179 
forwards so that would give it a much
better<00:01:39.729> way<00:01:39.939> of<00:01:39.969> doing<00:01:40.359> it<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:40.929> can<00:01:41.710> do<00:01:41.859> this<00:01:41.979> on

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
better way of doing it I can do this on

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.489 
better way of doing it I can do this on
a<00:01:42.490> chopping<00:01:42.819> block<00:01:43.030> rather<00:01:43.389> than<00:01:43.509> my<00:01:43.840> table

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
a chopping block rather than my table

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:45.989 
a chopping block rather than my table
because<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.770> table<00:01:45.069> bows<00:01:45.280> quite<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.700> bit<00:01:45.880> when

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
because the table bows quite a bit when

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.399 
because the table bows quite a bit when
you<00:01:46.060> put<00:01:46.209> any<00:01:46.389> pressure<00:01:46.569> on<00:01:46.749> it<00:01:46.929> so<00:01:47.139> just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
you put any pressure on it so just

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.620 
you put any pressure on it so just
literally<00:01:48.039> get<00:01:48.219> you<00:01:48.399> bits<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.030> paper<00:01:49.149> I'm<00:01:49.450> not

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
literally get you bits of paper I'm not

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.090 
literally get you bits of paper I'm not
saying<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:49.959> is<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.139> most<00:01:50.350> scientific<00:01:50.920> all

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
saying this is the most scientific all

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.129 
saying this is the most scientific all
the<00:01:51.340> best<00:01:51.609> way<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.789> doing<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.329> just<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.810> way

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
the best way of doing it is just a way

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.539 
the best way of doing it is just a way
of<00:01:53.170> come<00:01:53.439> up<00:01:53.530> with<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:54.009> we<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.130> see<00:01:54.399> how<00:01:54.490> we

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
of come up with and we just see how we

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.109 
of come up with and we just see how we
go<00:01:54.759> on<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.649> keep<00:01:56.859> adding<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.909> paper

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
go on and you just keep adding the paper

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.669 
go on and you just keep adding the paper
till<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.079> get<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.590> make<00:01:59.889> your<00:02:00.069> first<00:02:00.219> cut

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
till you get it to make your first cut

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.050 
till you get it to make your first cut
trying<00:02:02.679> to<00:02:02.740> keep<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:02.979> pressure<00:02:03.189> even<00:02:03.429> and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
trying to keep the pressure even and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.870 
trying to keep the pressure even and
just<00:02:04.359> keep<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.719> in<00:02:04.929> a<00:02:05.049> stable<00:02:05.590> position<00:02:05.880> and

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
just keep this in a stable position and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.550 
just keep this in a stable position and
then<00:02:07.029> they<00:02:07.389> are<00:02:07.509> they<00:02:07.659> racing<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:07.990> cut<00:02:08.350> back

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
then they are they racing just cut back

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.350 
then they are they racing just cut back
and<00:02:08.679> forwards<00:02:08.979> along<00:02:09.190> here<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.030> was<00:02:10.119> a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
and forwards along here and it was a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.050 
and forwards along here and it was a
reasonably<00:02:11.140> level<00:02:11.379> it's<00:02:11.860> not<00:02:12.129> like<00:02:12.700> using<00:02:12.879> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
reasonably level it's not like using the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.710 
reasonably level it's not like using the
milling<00:02:13.299> machine

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
milling machine

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.420 
milling machine
or<00:02:13.780> anything<00:02:13.930> particularly<00:02:14.740> after<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.250> but

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
or anything particularly after it but

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.750 
or anything particularly after it but
it'll<00:02:16.120> be<00:02:16.270> close<00:02:16.480> enough<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:17.310> think<00:02:18.310> I'm

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
it'll be close enough I think I'm

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.890 
it'll be close enough I think I'm
hopefully<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.450> better<00:02:19.600> finish<00:02:24.480> they<00:02:25.480> were<00:02:25.540> just

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
hopefully a better finish they were just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.390 
hopefully a better finish they were just
starting<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.260> get<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.710> can<00:02:26.830> hear<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.130> just

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
starting to get you can hear that just

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.490 
starting to get you can hear that just
grateful<00:02:27.880> more<00:02:28.030> hopefully<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.290> we're<00:02:29.380> getting

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
grateful more hopefully so we're getting

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.420 
grateful more hopefully so we're getting
a<00:02:29.620> little<00:02:29.770> bit<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.160> cutlet<00:02:32.010> pickup<00:02:33.010> drive<00:02:33.250> up

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
a little bit of cutlet pickup drive up

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.330 
a little bit of cutlet pickup drive up
the<00:02:33.880> other<00:02:34.030> thing<00:02:34.210> I<00:02:34.660> think<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.980> pressing

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the other thing I think just pressing

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.370 
the other thing I think just pressing
down<00:02:36.370> onto<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.090> paper<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.870> my<00:02:37.990> left<00:02:38.140> hand

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
down onto this paper with my left hand

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.530 
down onto this paper with my left hand
here<00:02:38.590> pushing<00:02:39.010> down<00:02:39.220> if<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.970> ease<00:02:40.300> up

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
here pushing down if you ease up

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.210 
here pushing down if you ease up
slightly<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.140> papers<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:41.590> got<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> little

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
slightly the papers just got a little

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.740 
slightly the papers just got a little
bit<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.430> spring<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.420> could<00:02:43.570> probably

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
bit of spring in it so it could probably

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.410 
bit of spring in it so it could probably
use<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.410> cut<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.790> anyway<00:02:45.790> but<00:02:46.090> give<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.330> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
use that to cut it anyway but give it a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.930 
use that to cut it anyway but give it a
go<00:02:46.540> see<00:02:46.959> how<00:02:47.050> we<00:02:47.140> go<00:02:53.370> theory<00:02:54.370> seems<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.760> work

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
go see how we go theory seems to work

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.420 
go see how we go theory seems to work
I'm<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.690> gonna<00:02:55.840> add<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.050> few<00:02:56.410> gold<00:02:57.070> bits<00:02:57.280> of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
I'm just gonna add a few gold bits of

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:09.180 
I'm just gonna add a few gold bits of
paper<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:07.530> really<00:03:08.530> don't<00:03:08.709> want<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.920> be<00:03:09.010> buying

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
paper I really don't want to be buying

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.040 
paper I really don't want to be buying
another<00:03:09.550> one<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.790> these<00:03:09.880> or<00:03:10.510> making<00:03:10.840> some

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
another one of these or making some

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.320 
another one of these or making some
other<00:03:11.709> adjustments<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.910> make<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.150> work

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.030 

just<00:03:16.330> adjust<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.810> height<00:03:19.709> make<00:03:20.709> sure<00:03:20.830> your

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
just adjust the height make sure your

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.490 
just adjust the height make sure your
cables<00:03:21.400> well<00:03:21.580> out<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> way<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.030> well

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.190 

okay<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.560> we're<00:03:30.830> getting<00:03:31.040> there<00:03:31.190> now

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
okay so we're getting there now

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.540 
okay so we're getting there now
obviously<00:03:33.200> this<00:03:33.590> one's<00:03:33.830> gonna<00:03:34.010> be<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.220> bit<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.490> a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
obviously this one's gonna be a bit of a

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.420 
obviously this one's gonna be a bit of a
but<00:03:35.450> if<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.660> look<00:03:35.810> fiddle<00:03:36.290> trying<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.590> get<00:03:37.280> this

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
but if it look fiddle trying to get this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.000 
but if it look fiddle trying to get this
to<00:03:37.640> sit<00:03:38.510> somewhere<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.520> just<00:03:40.520> nice<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.120> see<00:03:41.390> I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
to sit somewhere so just nice to see I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.450 
to sit somewhere so just nice to see I
like<00:03:43.010> simple<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.460> do<00:03:43.580> simple<00:03:44.030> very<00:03:44.240> easy<00:03:45.460> just

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
like simple I do simple very easy just

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:55.450 
like simple I do simple very easy just
simply<00:03:46.850> use<00:03:47.030> two<00:03:47.690> blocks<00:03:51.850> pop<00:03:52.850> my<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:54.460> and

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
simply use two blocks pop my in and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.030 
simply use two blocks pop my in and
you've<00:03:55.550> got<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.730> same<00:03:55.880> setup<00:03:56.390> again<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:57.040> keep

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
you've got the same setup again I keep

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.070 
you've got the same setup again I keep
the<00:03:58.190> way<00:03:58.340> even<00:03:58.850> over<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.210> -<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.750> they<00:03:59.900> won't

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
the way even over the - and they won't

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:11.770 
the way even over the - and they won't
compress<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.070> corners

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.260 

and<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.290> got<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.470> similar<00:04:12.800> problem<00:04:12.980> here<00:04:13.310> just

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
and I got a similar problem here just

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.490 
and I got a similar problem here just
gotta<00:04:14.680> take<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.740> little<00:04:16.010> bit<00:04:16.130> out<00:04:16.250> here<00:04:17.350> just<00:04:18.350> to

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
gotta take a little bit out here just to

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.620 
gotta take a little bit out here just to
make<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:18.860> fit<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.430> cage<00:04:19.940> will<00:04:20.150> hold<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.480> on<00:04:20.600> to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
make it fit so a cage will hold it on to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.770 
make it fit so a cage will hold it on to
the<00:04:20.870> gimbal<00:04:24.760> just<00:04:25.760> give<00:04:25.970> me<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> rough<00:04:26.390> idea<00:04:26.570> of

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
the gimbal just give me a rough idea of

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:43.879 
the gimbal just give me a rough idea of
where<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.080> need<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.290> go

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.830 

and<00:04:44.889> that<00:04:45.039> you<00:04:45.129> have<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.900> all<00:04:46.900> fixed<00:04:48.840> working

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
and that you have it all fixed working

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.550 
and that you have it all fixed working
well<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.349> gimbal<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:51.990> think<00:04:52.990> still<00:04:53.229> use<00:04:53.409> it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
well on the gimbal I think still use it

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.149 
well on the gimbal I think still use it
again<00:04:53.800> ever<00:04:54.310> ever<00:04:54.340> by<00:04:54.759> GoPro<00:04:55.560> or<00:04:56.560> any<00:04:56.919> other

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
again ever ever by GoPro or any other

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.460 
again ever ever by GoPro or any other
camera
