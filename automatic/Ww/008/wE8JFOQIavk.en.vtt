00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi nice that you look at father planet 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.359
 i'm on today i'm paying and that's the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.220
 largest pair the stock market in germany and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.900
 you can make a lot of sense and that behind you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.580
 I am also a couple of the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.719
 Health and I'm going to give you something today 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.379
 tell about where the intestines and feed 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.480
 as you may know 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.340
 studied medicine here and I am learning 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.250
 so a lot about horse health 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 today I am going to tell something about intestines 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 and one of those parts of the corridor 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.590
 the small intestine 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.900
 here they have a bath with liquid 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 and here is between couples then 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.809
 so you can see how that is inside 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 looks exactly 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.870
 that small intestine is super long 25 meters 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.340
 long 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 the end of the day comes of course 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.570
 pooping out and drove a very nice video 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.030
 made over horse floor and you can 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.770
 see here 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.059
 horses gut and those are super long and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 were knew it is because one 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.410
 horse is a herbivore and in plants 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 contain a lot of fiber in vegetable 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.289
 material that must all be digested 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.960
 become quite difficult through 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.430
 that's why those guts are incredibly cowardly 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.050
 to be able to digest all that yes and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.930
 in the end , of course , they just call 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 really a pair of arm doesn't exist alone 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.900
 from the thin through but also as a thick one 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.900
 gut that hamza 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.249
 piggy bank of a horse 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.950
 and that is also part of the 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:16.929
 digestive system so that there and that 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.270
 large intestine that just seemed super 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.979
 super large this is also from a couple 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.810
 but they made hard so here 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.840
 You can see how it looks in large 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.909
 here also see a few de above me 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.069
 stomach and that's just like you 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.780
 also have and this is also from a real one 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.459
 been worth it and what's so 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.770
 special to that make that is just like 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.569
 with us is flexible like one 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.500
 horse an empty stomach in it's newest 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.090
 little 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.689
 if you are called then put that stomach 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.789
 out for that gets bigger because it 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.739
 gastrointestinal system of such a horse super 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.229
 complicated is a super long sometimes 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:52.780
 more than 35 believe to be there also quite 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.039
 many diseases for one of them is colic and 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.659
 different types of audience 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.579
 for example, sand colic on a terrace 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.859
 colic and colic is kind of you 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.319
 abdominal pain like illness that yes very much 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.000
 pain gives me a horse and there are 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.739
 certain symptoms that your horse then 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.840
 gives where you can see that colic 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.340
 has often been associated with sweating 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.500
 sometimes a little vibrate and feel 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.480
 clearly not comfortable and what they are 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.950
 very often do is that they start rolling and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.319
 what you can do because this has 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.549
 reported in the coupe video is watching 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.130
 feces 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.900
 is brit has said and yellow droppings 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.739
 but it is also very often not drunk 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.599
 or just diarrhea colic is a super 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.620
 serious illness so if you think so 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.540
 horse can watch 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.530
 call a direct vet for quality 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.060
 can be deadly and he can know 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.650
 to keep your horse healthy 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.030
 very important that you take good care of him 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.830
 for example, does not give a yes 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.120
 Moldy food that can do all kinds of 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.220
 cause diseases including 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.659
 for example belt and how can you do that 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.879
 well see and you can see here 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.590
 this is also crushed port this is actually 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.299
 same as this 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.159
 Only you can see that it is much dark 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.799
 is it is it smells a little muffler 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.629
 gas your tears and is it what yes what 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.310
 black pieces in it is therefore a bit one 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.940
 matter of looking and especially of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.290
 to smell 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:10.329
 this just smells good and uses this 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.790
 you can also check hay here you have 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.310
 some different baskets of healthy hay 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.620
 and that is a bit of a yellow green gene 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.599
 also smells really nice smells nice 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.310
 a bit sweeter and festive 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.409
 moldy beautiful actually looks one 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.209
 little so that is a bit yellowish and 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.909
 actually very pathetic very delicate 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.680
 This is really super super protective of hearing 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.209
 you are even in lumps 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.709
 And this is really dangerous you have to 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.530
 certainly not to feed your horse because this 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.150
 also causes oil, for example 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.769
 besides that you have to be very careful or 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.659
 your vehicle is good you also have to be whole 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.129
 pay attention to poisonous plants 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.470
 are simply plants that are toxic to 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.450
 horses that they are not allowed to eat here 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.470
 is for example 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.329
 scallop that is just a spice 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.250
 which grows a lot in our netherlands 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.780
 the what is toxic for horses is one 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.909
 another plant is for example 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.799
 rodondendron that looks like this too 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.959
 toxic for your horse and various 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.849
 species of yew and box they are also whole 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.200
 poison another plant which the 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.299
 most of you probably already in 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.760
 having the garden is climbing and that is too 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.379
 toxic form and if you think so 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.299
 your horse has eaten something or you have 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.189
 seen it then you can go west for a moment 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.389
 some picking and then the vet 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.699
 call because then you can leave 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.019
 see exactly what he ate 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.060
 nutrition is of course pretty good 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.620
 complicated but also great fun for you 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.979
 you can of course just give your horse a break 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.740
 get used to 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.270
 and here behind me they have a lot 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.289
 different horse treats all 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.280
 tastes 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.530
 all colours 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.270
 hey can just be so weak here and 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.500
 yourself that very short film whatever you want 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.240
 want 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.070
 I told you a lot about today 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.690
 enter horses and over horses 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.820
 but you can do many more fun things 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.950
 and are you interested there 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.480
 than we can, for example item about 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.530
 colic about something else that you 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.080
 like it 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.220
 filming at the real horse clinic super 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.910
 thanks for watching and see you next 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.130
 week 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.169
 doeg that is gone makes up for the other 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.880
 place that means the people that 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.990
 left on rows take precedence over the 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.990
 people who reach clockwise
