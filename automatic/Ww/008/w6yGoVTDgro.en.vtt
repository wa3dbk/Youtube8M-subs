00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.870
 and here then this gallery because we 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.379
 It allows 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.300
 use the policy modalities 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:53.059
 50 meters and the modalities of 100 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.579
 meters that are not Olympic but that we 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.010
 they allow to put the rifles to aim 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.050
 how are they doing these right now 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.540
 two guys here for example on the flec 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.790
 this allows us to see you see that they have the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.790
 Weapons are with some three objectives 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.840
 grassi it is true that now in these in 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.520
 these times in which the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.540
 closed and now there are more stalks that people 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.970
 with you need precision shooter 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.800
 stayed a little longer because of that 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.270
 now it is more frequent that you 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.750

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 path 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.350
 and we have it already perfectly prepared 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.300
 you have everything ready to start the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 shooting activity 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.580
 I am a pistol shooter. This is a 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.190
 modality of the most difficult there are 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.890
 it's an Olympic way if you shoot with 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.900
 caliber 22 gun to the monkey shot and it 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.250
 strip 50 meters away good 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.250
 we will see that this aim that such 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.490
 well we are in the gallery of 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.890
 25 meters they are the ones that usually 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.080
 use more this gallery any that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.940
 shooter who is licensed 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.860

 weapons and have your life 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.100
 corresponding can pull and use the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.900
 Gallery 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 if someone 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250
 by mistake or simply to catch 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.829
 pods because you want to go out to the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.930
 line of targets through the post of 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.030
 shot immediately there is a system of 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.709
 alarm that would warn all 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.099
 shooters that someone has pierced 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.099
 that 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:47.040
 we are in the task zone of 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:49.410
 eta faustino enchanted is a very sport 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.100
 sure taking the steps that we must 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.250
 give yes especially in the handling of the weapon 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.200
 as long as it's forward, it does not 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.209
 twists when the loaded weapon is 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.630
 discharge always looking 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.020
 go ahead and this is a sport is a super 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.020
 safe 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.940
 we have seen that the plate was operated 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.630
 it was fired but how have you done it? 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:22.580
 with the voice so that scream that you have stuck 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.030
 that sound the voice by the micro and jumps 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.030
 to the plate 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.989
 and we went to the next post 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.379
 because you have to go running the 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:39.200
 posts are 25 dishes in which there are 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.569
 three positions in each position are 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.260
 different dishes one central another 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.700
 lateral and other side lower 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.219
 sensors that more Olympians so if not 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.469

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.769
 good faustino after throwing to the plate 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.120

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.950
