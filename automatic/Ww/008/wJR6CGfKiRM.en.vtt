00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.010
 tha 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello my name is guillaume I am 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.639
 landscaper today I'm going to you 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.230
 show how to implement watering 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.370
 automatic for a turf so the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.009
 material for automatic watering 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.750
 for grass so you need a 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:26.980
 programmer a solenoid valve a purge 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.630
 an elbow with cap then you need 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.880
 connections to connect to 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.739
 feed pipes for the wake he 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.309
 you need power strip pliers a 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.050
 secateur 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.820
 now i'm going to show you how 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.890
 assemble the elements of the central 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.479
 for automatic watering for 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.850
 lawn for mounting elements 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.489
 all the pieces do not need to 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.010
 June made with Teflon some 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.710
 are forearmed with an O I 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.780
 begins with the cap I saw him his 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.690
 end needs to serve well and once 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.769
 that the resistance is there we stop 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:11.710
 Then I will mount the same purge 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:13.210
 on the o-ring so notice and 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.000
 until then to the resistance 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:22.600
 here I am preaching end that will welcome 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.370
 the solenoid valve and I saw the seal 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:32.590
 O is here I just high school 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:34.840
 the solenoid valve on once the purge 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.050
 screw the solenoid valve screwed on the elbow 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.360
 we come alive it's the elbow of the arrival 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:46.659
 of water I come vi and the fitting of 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.930
 water supply the circuit 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.420
 mounted the cap is screwed the purge is 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.970
 screwed the solenoid valve and the fittings of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 water supply pipes we're going 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.590
 now plug the water source on 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.720
 the central of the automatic watering 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.159
 so for automatic watering of 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.530
 turf it is necessary to dig a 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.409
 trench upstream down to 60 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.680
 cm deep at this depth there 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.810
 where we install the pipe that is connected to 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.319
 Central to dig trenches 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.120
 you need a spade and a pickaxe 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.420
 now I just connect the network 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.670
 of distribution 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.489
 to the water inlet pipe to do this 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.480
 it takes a necklace with a ring I 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.660
 come in box and at most the network 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.810
 of water in the plant just 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.970
 screw maximum always I come to 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.520
 grant the distribution network of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.350
 metals yesterday on the network 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.080
 to do this you always need a 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:54.319
 necklace with a ring I give them to 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:03:00.760
 the electron ban there is the handle is tight 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:02.900
 necklace and here is the pipe once 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.299
 position in the trench we are going 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.069
 now implant the throttles so 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.340
 on this model if there is a cap 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.730
 it is enough to extract the flow 100 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.630
 then there is a very important filter 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.580
 we just put inside 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:25.549
 thereafter we just introduce the nozzle 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:29.299
 who are screwing certain nozzles are from 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.170
 180 degrees and 360 and 90 some are 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.510
 adjustable 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.410
 once the nozzle position in the 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.700
 tuyÃ¨re one comes alive it's an elbow on 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.269
 the nozzle to be a little teflon 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.910
 three turns is enough convis by 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.040
 below 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.269
 always screwed up without breaking the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.420
 plastic the nozzle is ready 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.310
 then we take the secateur and we go 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.170
 come cut the pipe that is in 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.170
 the trench I cut the pipe 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.519
 I come installed intriguing and with 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.519
 elbows 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.040
 always tight I install the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.040
 second necklace 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:42.180
 I put Teflon on the elbow and I 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:49.200
 just screw and to the people fittings 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:57.720
 grant the pipe I cut to the 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:59.990
 desired length and I just install my 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.020
 nozzles without their agreement 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.730
 the nozzle is ready to be buried 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.160
 now we see the trench 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.300
 and place the nozzle a little bit 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.320
 below the grass level like this 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.930
 do not forget to connect your 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.790
 programmer the solenoid valve and 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.340
 plunge your circuits in the winter for the 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.840
 put out of water now you know 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.380
 install an automatic watering for 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.700
 lawn 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.080
 find me on an upcoming topic 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.080
 how to maintain your bamboo
