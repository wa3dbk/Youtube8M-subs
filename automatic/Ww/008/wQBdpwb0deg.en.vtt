00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 are all guys are zero uil hicks e 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 today I'm here with a video in which 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.960
 we'll see if the bee gassi osiris is 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.269
 the fastest car ever 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.340
 so we'll go and compare it with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.340
 the hearing that as you know laden 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.170
 currently the fastest vehicle in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.699
 absolute of the game before starting 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.170
 you remember that leaves a like also 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.400
 because it only takes two backgrounds 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.810
 leave a trip facebook page la 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.189
 you will find the description of this video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.939
 while you subscribe to the channel for others 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.130
 content 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.980
 then like many of you you will know the audio 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.969
 is the fastest vehicle ever 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 absolute game because if we put a 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.440
 any vehicle against rather than in a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.710
 very long straight that lasts 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.020
 40 50 seconds the audio will always succeed e 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 however to overcome it despite ad 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.030
 example the internal aunt to a better one 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 acceleration with respect to the other for 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.289
 I wanted to compare this with 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.410
 the pegasus iss to see if this 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.500
 time the pegasus liszt will be able to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.600
 defeat we can say the vehicle more 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 absolute fast of the game for the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.189
 moment as we have seen fu mater non 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.369
 modified the result on the straight 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.080
 of the airport and the 24 seconds and 5 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.090
 cents we will see if there are significant 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.189
 differences or not regarding 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.320
 acceleration with the application 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.530
 obviously modified the price list 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.450
 straight is always the same and let's see 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.689
 a little what happens 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.909
 the difference is not noticeable we can 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.700
 say that it is not even a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.970
 second for the moment apparently la 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.829
 pegasus is faster about it anyway 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.700
 acceleration let's see what 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.320
 always happens on the same track 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 but obviously this time with i 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.850
 then maximized vehicles 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.280
 this time we have the modified audio 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 at most always on the same 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.630
 straight we will see a little if 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.270
 differences will change 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.539
 this time we obviously have a 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.350
 better result than vehicles 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.360
 without changes 21 seconds 21 cents 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.030
 now instead we will see what happens 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.760
 if we put one in the same destiny 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.069
 osiris practice modified to the maximum how 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.530
 you see there are all the changes then 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.090
 let's see if the difference is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:25.910
 remarkable or not for the moment not 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.820
 understands so well and apparently 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.010
 no no absolutely not the difference is 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.990
 really very low then to what 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.030
 it seems more or less we can say that 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.460
 regarding acceleration these vehicles 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.930
 they are similar to each other as you see 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.720
 these are the results 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.000
 and now we go to the final tests instead 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.650
 and compare on the straight 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.290
 a very long prayed osiris 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.300
 modified against one of the amended 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.840
 obviously at the most and here we are with 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.090
 the first test of the two vehicles in this 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.550
 circuit and we can see that the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.800
 pegasus series to greater 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.220
 acceleration over drinking and succeeds 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.260
 to remarkably asphalt the eudur with the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.170
 his magnificent acceleration though 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.780
 despite this you will later notice it towards the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.630
 final of this test the audio will succeed 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.970
 however we say to resume almost 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.100
 the vehicle as you initially see the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.320
 detachment was greater and then what it is 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.270
 success happened that the audio was 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.370
 to resume the prayer osiris li 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.590
 it was enough maybe a few more meters or ha 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.350
 redone the exact same tester 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.910
 yet another time and is practically a 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.680
 the same thing happened yesterday, that is 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.660
 the audio was about to resume in the final 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.940
 from picasso left then what I have 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.740
 decided to make a final test 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.420
 final going further back than 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.920
 at the beginning of the circuit and doing 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.530
 starting both vehicle at the same 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.780
 time is what happened practically is 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.580
 success that despite the magnificent 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.970
 acceleration compared to the other 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.709
 of the bee gassi osiris l'udeur with the 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.540
 time has managed to resume the 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.180
 fold osiris so we can say that 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.040
 despite all the web say that this 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.620
 vehicle is the fastest 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.620
 I can confirm you also with 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.130
 this test that the hearing is the most vehicle 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.380
 absolute fast of the game as you see 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.359
 I tried to keep as much as possible 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.919
 the maximum speed even dodging 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.290
 curves risking a little bit of 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.300
 however, despite it , it is 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.550
 managed to recover even if briefly 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.169
 the vehicle with its maximum speed 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.210
 so guys, I can confirm that 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.680
 the udur is the fastest vehicle of the 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.150
 game of course this does not mean 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.700
 that is the super best probably 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.010
 the vehicle is also important in a vehicle 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.500
 maneuverability and also acceleration 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.050
 obviously especially if there are any 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.630
 collisions because the trails are 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.060
 important then we say that despite 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.050
 the audio is at the fastest vehicle in 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.780
 absolute 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.490
 this does not mean we can 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.400
 guarantee a vehicle premium 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.870
 better than the game and I would say that 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.440
 in spite of everything generally the bee 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.060
 nice liszt is a better vehicle 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.980
 I respect this but the audio 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.510
 they leave like they absolutely want us 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.040
 seconds click that blue button 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.900
 let me like the facebook page 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.880
