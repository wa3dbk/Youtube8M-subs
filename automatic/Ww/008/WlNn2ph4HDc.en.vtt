00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
intro tutorial we will use a circular

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.299 
intro tutorial we will use a circular
needle<00:00:30.900> with<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> length<00:00:31.410> less<00:00:31.920> than<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
needle with a length less than the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.620 
needle with a length less than the
circumference<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> item<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.600> are

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
circumference of the item you are

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.530 
circumference of the item you are
knitting<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.950> example<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.640> your<00:00:36.090> hat<00:00:36.329> will<00:00:36.510> be

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
knitting for example if your hat will be

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.229 
knitting for example if your hat will be
18<00:00:37.079> inches<00:00:37.290> around<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:38.040> finished<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:39.090> would

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
18 inches around when finished you would

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.560 
18 inches around when finished you would
use<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> 16<00:00:39.989> inch<00:00:40.260> long<00:00:40.620> needle<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:42.059> reason<00:00:42.420> for

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
use a 16 inch long needle the reason for

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.150 
use a 16 inch long needle the reason for
this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.230> stitches<00:00:43.590> need<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> fit

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
this is that the stitches need to fit

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.369 
this is that the stitches need to fit
comfortably<00:00:44.430> around<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.329> needle<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.809> meet

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
comfortably around the needle and meet

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.830 
comfortably around the needle and meet
at<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> tips<00:00:46.890> without<00:00:47.250> stretching<00:00:47.780> using<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
at the tips without stretching using a

at the tips without stretching using a
needle<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.350> too<00:00:49.710> long<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.399> result<00:00:50.730> in

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
needle that is too long can result in

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
needle that is too long can result in
