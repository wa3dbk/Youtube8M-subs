like<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.519> kind<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.030> when<00:00:09.330> you

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
like it because that is kind of when you

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.950 
like it because that is kind of when you
think<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.080> that's<00:00:10.710> what<00:00:11.010> bleach<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.759> at<00:00:12.690> its

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
think of it that's what bleach is at its

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.180 
think of it that's what bleach is at its
core<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.269> fights<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.020> great<00:00:16.350> fight

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
core is the fights it's the great fight

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.790 
core is the fights it's the great fight
and<00:00:17.550> I'm<00:00:17.699> quite<00:00:18.180> enjoying<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.380> far

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
and I'm quite enjoying this one so far

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.519 
and I'm quite enjoying this one so far
they<00:00:20.520> explained<00:00:21.180> Sookie<00:00:21.750> she<00:00:21.900> must<00:00:22.080> power<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
they explained Sookie she must power a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.630 
they explained Sookie she must power a
bit<00:00:22.769> more<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.880> he<00:00:24.240> could<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:24.600> cut

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
bit more that he could actually cut

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.500 
bit more that he could actually cut
objects<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.869> I<00:00:27.869> guess<00:00:28.710> make<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.580> object<00:00:30.269> put

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
objects and I guess make that object put

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.290 
objects and I guess make that object put
the<00:00:30.660> future<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.320> mean<00:00:31.679> put<00:00:31.830> put<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> pass<00:00:32.790> of

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the future I mean put put the pass of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
the future I mean put put the pass of
that<00:00:34.020> object<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:37.230> he<00:00:37.440> could<00:00:37.590> cut<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
that object and like he could cut the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.080 
that object and like he could cut the
ground<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> he<00:00:39.120> made<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.230> ground

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
ground and he made it so that the ground

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.459 
ground and he made it so that the ground
actually<00:00:42.090> he<00:00:42.239> said<00:00:42.480> attract<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:43.140> before

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
actually he said attract there before

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.940 
actually he said attract there before
but<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.920> he<00:00:44.070> has<00:00:44.329> he<00:00:45.329> planted<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
but really he has he planted that in to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.010 
but really he has he planted that in to
its<00:00:47.070> past<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:48.030> i<00:00:48.210> guess<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.450> pretty<00:00:48.840> cool

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
its past which i guess is pretty cool

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709 
its past which i guess is pretty cool
even<00:00:49.320> cut<00:00:49.500> unlimited<00:00:50.390> organisms<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> he

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
even cut unlimited organisms and he

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.229 
even cut unlimited organisms and he
could<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.050> cut<00:00:52.350> pretty<00:00:52.800> much<00:00:52.920> anything<00:00:53.309> so

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
could just cut pretty much anything so

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.069 
could just cut pretty much anything so
what<00:00:54.539> he<00:00:54.690> does<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:55.110> cuts<00:00:56.420> byakuya<00:00:57.420> sword

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
what he does is he cuts byakuya sword

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.880 
what he does is he cuts byakuya sword
and<00:00:58.500> he<00:00:58.890> puts<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.870> its<00:01:01.140> past<00:01:01.530> or

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and he puts it and like its past or

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
and he puts it and like its past or
future<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.760> his<00:01:03.090> powers<00:01:03.449> very

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
future I don't know his powers very

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
future I don't know his powers very
confusing<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.559> puts<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.489> past<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
confusing so he puts it the past or the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.289 
confusing so he puts it the past or the
future<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> sword<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.920> never

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
future of the sword that it will never

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.870 
future of the sword that it will never
strike<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.600> kashima<00:01:10.140> again<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.159> he's<00:01:11.820> like

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
strike two kashima again and he's like

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
strike two kashima again and he's like
there<00:01:12.330> you're<00:01:13.140> trapped<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:13.979> nothing<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
there you're trapped there's nothing you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.700 
there you're trapped there's nothing you
can<00:01:14.549> do<00:01:14.700> I've<00:01:15.299> seen<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.049> attacks<00:01:16.380> now

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
can do I've seen all your attacks now

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.240 
can do I've seen all your attacks now
now<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:18.240> sword<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:18.930> much<00:01:19.020> useless<00:01:19.290> so

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
now your sword is pretty much useless so

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.700

guess<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> question<00:01:53.810> Fukushima<00:01:54.810> which<00:01:55.470> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
guess the question Fukushima which is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.100 
guess the question Fukushima which is
pretty<00:01:56.430> cool<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.930> one

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
pretty cool and I really like this one

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.469 
pretty cool and I really like this one
panel<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> copy<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.310> he's<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.729> I'm<00:01:59.939> pasty

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
panel of a copy when he's like I'm pasty

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.340 
panel of a copy when he's like I'm pasty
if<00:02:00.840> he<00:02:01.200> would<00:02:01.380> die<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.600> was<00:02:04.110> kind

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
if he would die for you so that was kind

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.990 
if he would die for you so that was kind
of<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.649> guess<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.189> best<00:02:05.369> part<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> chapter

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
of I guess the best part of the chapter

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.200 
of I guess the best part of the chapter
for<00:02:06.329> me<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:06.719> I'm<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.140> huge

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
for me just because I'm a huge

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.770 
for me just because I'm a huge
and<00:02:09.040> overall<00:02:10.040> pretty<00:02:10.550> decent<00:02:10.940> chapter<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.540> have

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
and overall pretty decent chapter I have

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.450 
and overall pretty decent chapter I have
no<00:02:11.930> no<00:02:12.380> real<00:02:12.590> problem<00:02:13.010> with<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:14.030> story

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
no no real problem with it the story

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.150 
no no real problem with it the story
progressed<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.850> guess<00:02:17.210> enough<00:02:17.840> for<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.380> chapter

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
progressed I guess enough for a chapter

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.370 
progressed I guess enough for a chapter
at<00:02:19.340> least<00:02:19.790> because<00:02:20.150> usually<00:02:20.390> breached<00:02:20.870> bleep

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380
