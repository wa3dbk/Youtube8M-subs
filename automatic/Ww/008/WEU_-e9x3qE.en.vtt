00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.869
 we have obligation 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.109
 how are we doing there is a solar plant 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.579
 there in the cearÃ¡ 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:26.529
 this lack to speak up a model dog in the case of coal coal 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.019
 vegetable on the note the sermon flourish coffee mineral coal are deposits of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.390
 group gas has a 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.630
 - the holiday colony was concentrated are aimed at the most 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.980
 rich in the world 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.540
 05 cities due to high calorie content 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.820
 abundance in the world for 300 years I gave up energy because of what 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.650
 for the 300 years here will be sought the technological solution to make it 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.390
 carbon neutral is not 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.550
 he also did not rest here projects so can always search also 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 what is g1 what Brazil is looking for 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.170
 but can be very happy fortunately 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.110
 if you have thanks today to make you want to get accustomed to thermoelectric 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.399
 with all the standards of nine years and efficient of generating income and 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.740
 catch 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.610
 the 15-minute particle but you can also deploy the phrase to create 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.990
 a compensation 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 of these thermal relation now to what our humanity can not forget 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.640
 which are the source 300 years time it is very cheap so we know 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.150
 too easy 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.660
 the finger itself to everyone that what is maestro wants to be more expensive is you 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.610
 does not generate the megawatt because it is the best one dollar generated power generate 22 in the pib 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.330
 regional 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.900
 this expensive question if you do not have this energy right and we all here 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.790
 We are dedicated to hiding electric power. The cell phone is in shooting. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.650
 is a fugitive 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.380
 very cheap energy generation and technology has evolved in such a way that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.199
 you fear practicing and generating almost cast 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:13.249
 you are born the old thermoelectric plants spit smoke particularly if 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.759
 all environments and this does not happen anymore like I said when you 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:19.859
 spends a little 2 billion 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.559
 in the long term investment investment in this area is what happens
