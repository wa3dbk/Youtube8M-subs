00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.130
 hello today tell you about my 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.019
 opinion about urban gardens in fact 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.090
 the form of the answers that were sent to me 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.529
 competition pass around accordingly 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.020
 city fixes yes they embraced 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.700
 almost everything you can and 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.099
 add from me practically 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.610
 nothing that is guys done there 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.020
 about 14 video stories of the pros and cons 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.790
 someone is an opponent of urban fixes by giving 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.250
 someone on the contrary them so let's say 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.200
 adherent but in any case there 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.270
 There were different guys 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.670
 point of view different opinions i'm at 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.570
 somewhat agree with everyone with 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.070
 them as there is no perfect knife and 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.350
 always we we have to put up with 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.110
 by some compromises that is either this 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.270
 compact knife which is very comfortable 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.690
 carry a knife 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.690
 Respectively more acceptable large 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.290
 which is convenient to cut some salads 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.350
 for example, that is, it all depends on your 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.750
 tasks either it is a cutter or it is a scrap well and 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.750
 so on in fixing letting everyone have 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.490
 Of course, a number of certain advantages 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.030
 one of the main advantages of ficsed 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.690
 is its very convenient and quick 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.729
 extract from compact fix food 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 is a big advantage 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.060
 its very convenient and many ways 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.600
 He has in terms of wearing in contrast 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.510
 even from such a convenient clip that 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.630
 can be worn on the clips after all they 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.460
 well let's say less diverse and for 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.280
 in order to come up with experience a new way 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.979
 wearing for the clip then but you need to say so 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.020
 right cunning here taking advantage 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.960
 a small piece of paracord 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.420
 and fairly literate in terms of wearing 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 you can come up with a very very necessary 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.659
 many variations pick exactly 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.920
 convenient way 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.070
 under your wardrobe under your lifestyle 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.119
 clothes and for your purpose 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.149
 surely so small urban 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.610
 fixed has the disadvantage of the blade length 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.549
 but this drawback is again 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.350
 firstly compensated 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.420
 the disadvantage is compensated 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.580
 convenience in wearing secondly need for 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.410
 understand yourself that the length of the blade though 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.840
 cool i prefer long knives 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.400
 blade but still the length of the blade is not 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.380
 always so important and not always we 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.480
 use this blade length more than that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.450
 even if we say that we are missing 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.390
 cut the bread but often do we cut here 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.910
 I will give such fixes somewhere out of the house 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.500
 let's say bread if you are at work then 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.610
 it's often easier there to have some 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.550
 plain 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.860
 the kitchenette accordingly if it is already 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.720
 some kind of forced measure then believe me 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.440
 I can cut bread with this knife too 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.420
 yes smarty cut it in two runs 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.180
 so let's say every piece is wrong 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.940
 convenient it will not cause such a storm 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.480
 delight and so on but still it's a knife 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.700
 but then he can always be with you 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.400
 The convenience of wearing a cure is the most 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.950
 more importantly you can not 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.569
 don't be afraid of making a knife so let's say a knife when 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.790
 you use it in some dirty 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.070
 work precisely because all these 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.810
 mechanisms nodes are missing which 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.660
 can just plain foul 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.230
 which gets dirt from yes all the washers and 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.480
 etc 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.120
 the knife does not have to disassemble the knife here not 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.790
 you have to grease the knife more reliable 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.980
 in principle, well, and as a result, 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.670
 the rule is cheaper initially in 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.560
 production and operation 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.950
 accordingly in my opinion it is very and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.840
 very cool mean so i can 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:52.680
 say about fix dah what fix &amp; d can 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.140
 have well as we even know whether pause 1 2 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.109
 for example can have the same blade 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.140
 but different ergonomics of the handle and in 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.660
 the ergonomics principle of the handle is chosen 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.230
 just the way it should be 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.290
 what is it needed for this niche under 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.120
 This knife task is a folding knife. 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.680
 certain limitation that is in 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.420
 the handle should fit the blade 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.079
 let's say if we have blade length 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.209
 great accordingly we oblige 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.090
 the longer arm is necessarily huge 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.069
 it turns out such a handle well there 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.659
 it is clear that there are a number of factors on the handle 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.879
 always longer than the blade 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.830
 This time someone this plus me for example on 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.449
 like it but for some it causes 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.669
 shortcoming in fikseda may be 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.949
 on the contrary may be the length of the blade 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.469
 for example there are two centimeters to length 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.659
 hilt so 10 can be perfect 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:44.030
 the opposite task again these here 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.000
 this whole node at some loads 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.009
 folding knife of course has 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.370
 disadvantages often need such loads 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.219
 I personally do not have that why I wear with 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.930
 gifts or three though lately 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:59.060
 so let's say my passion for living 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.710
 passed on to what I need a couple 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.810
 even one knife for more then 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.060
 serious works suddenly they will need but 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.159
 and so let's say a spare knife can be a knife 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.800
 which I can give to someone before some 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.539
 tasks and accordingly my choice here 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.069
 it is full of such a little study she 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.349
 disappointed me with her cut 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:18.800
 Again, urban fix &amp; d are 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:21.080
 very different in terms of cutting geometry and 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.840
 so on and you can choose something under 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.479
 yourself a huge huge advantage and 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.580
 what you should pay attention to 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.259
 it needs to be done on the sheath 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.860
 either to order or buy immediately 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.430
 competent and comfortable you need know need 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.949
 is for sale 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.000
 mount I did not show saved relationships 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.509
 with this mount 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.589
 but overall it is also very, very 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.779
 cool convenient option 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:47.860
 everything turns out very compact very 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:51.860
 subtle and very very comfortable 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.139
 now regarding the city itself 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.050
 fixed of please make a conclusion for 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.300
 I don't want to advise myself 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.849
 immediate zulu and directly 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.060
 fix and this is just a matter of preference 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.900
 the question of the tasks that you put if 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.580
 you need a knife, well, just say so 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.740
 it's unclear why you like knives 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.080
 just want to wear them then choose something 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.270
 what will please your eye what will be 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.919
 convenient to lie in the hand that you will 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.289
 comfortable to wear it will be easy 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.110
 bring you pleasure 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.680
 accordingly if you want yourself a knife 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.800
 for any specific purpose 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.660
 and tasks then you will build on 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.710
 directly from these tasks and here already 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:37.440
 the choice will be primarily from exactly 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.050
 works that are done with a knife 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.539
 pay attention that this one has more 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.380
 so let's say the complete set and sounds 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.750
 such a convenient time to put on a clip 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.660
 very tight nothing done 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.520
 anywhere from the belt will not break there still there 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.729
 a couple more smaller ringlets of attack 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.710
 there is a flint 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:00.270
 to my surprise here is such 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.150
 simple but in principle which 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.030
 enough for a number of times in this 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.060
 additional all sorts and come here 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.460
 such is my opinion on urban 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.160
 fixes yes I hope it was interesting I would 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.539
 I really wanted the competition to be intense 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.669
 so that the competition is interesting and 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:20.160
 definitely try in my opinion 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.229
 make a qualitatively interesting video 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.380
 to win and to make us very 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:27.380
 it is interesting to look at it bye
