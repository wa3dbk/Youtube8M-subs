were<00:01:16.049> actually<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> tank<00:01:18.110> I'm

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
were actually when I was in the tank I'm

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.130 
were actually when I was in the tank I'm
not<00:01:19.320> sure<00:01:19.380> exactly<00:01:19.860> why<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.110> just

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
not sure exactly why but it was just

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
not sure exactly why but it was just
consistent<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.009> both<00:01:23.400> cards<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.939> I'm

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
consistent with both cards that I'm

consistent with both cards that I'm
going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> review<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.960> particular<00:01:25.140> video

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
going to review in this particular video

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
going to review in this particular video
and<00:01:26.240> by<00:01:27.240> frame<00:01:27.540> job<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.080> mean<00:01:28.619> possibly<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and by frame job I mean possibly to the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
and by frame job I mean possibly to the
five<00:01:30.509> frames<00:01:30.900> per<00:01:31.170> second<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> significant

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
five frames per second not a significant

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.760 
five frames per second not a significant
number<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.299> frames<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:34.229> say<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.590> you're

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
number of frames I would say if you're

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310 
number of frames I would say if you're
in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> market<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.610> low-end<00:01:36.270> video<00:01:37.020> card

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
in the market for a low-end video card

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
in the market for a low-end video card
this<00:01:37.590> particular<00:01:38.130> card<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.000> fit<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> bill

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this particular card will fit the bill

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.530 
this particular card will fit the bill
it's<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.490> very<00:01:41.490> expensive<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.270> point

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
it's not very expensive this point

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540 
it's not very expensive this point
and<00:01:43.630> performs<00:01:44.440> very<00:01:44.710> well<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:45.010> battlefield<00:01:45.460> 4

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
and performs very well in battlefield 4

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.430 
and performs very well in battlefield 4
so<00:01:46.360> if<00:01:46.450> you're<00:01:46.540> looking<00:01:46.630> for<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.990> performance

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
so if you're looking for a performance

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.050 
so if you're looking for a performance
boost<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.920> don't<00:01:48.190> have<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.370> lot<00:01:48.550> of<00:01:48.580> cash<00:01:48.820> to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
boost and don't have a lot of cash to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.580 
boost and don't have a lot of cash to
spend<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:49.510> probably<00:01:49.840> would<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.230> one<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
spend this probably would be the one to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.330 
spend this probably would be the one to
look<00:01:50.710> for<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:52.660> next<00:01:52.810> video<00:01:53.200> card<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.800> I'm

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
look for the next video card that I'm

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.820 
look for the next video card that I'm
going<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.580> review<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:54.970> EVGA<00:01:57.030> 770<00:01:58.030> GTX<00:01:58.830> FTW

4<00:02:00.070> gigabyte<00:02:00.490> version<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.480> system

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
4 gigabyte version this is the system

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.080 
4 gigabyte version this is the system
setup<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.920> was<00:02:03.040> used<00:02:03.280> for<00:02:03.460> this<00:02:03.610> particular

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
setup that was used for this particular

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.700 
setup that was used for this particular
card<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:06.120> this<00:02:07.120> is<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.330> higher-end<00:02:07.840> card<00:02:08.140> so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
card and this is a higher-end card so

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.650 
card and this is a higher-end card so
it's<00:02:09.040> probably<00:02:09.250> going<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.520> give<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.210> lot<00:02:10.509> more

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
it's probably going to give a lot more

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.990 
it's probably going to give a lot more
frames<00:02:10.990> per<00:02:11.200> second<00:02:11.590> than<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:12.100> card<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:12.880> to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
frames per second than a card like to

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300 
frames per second than a card like to
say<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.180> 7790<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.380> what<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.680> found<00:02:14.950> was<00:02:15.130> that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
say the 7790 and what I found was that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.150 
say the 7790 and what I found was that
this<00:02:15.940> particular<00:02:16.150> card<00:02:16.630> on<00:02:16.780> low<00:02:17.020> did<00:02:17.380> perform

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
this particular card on low did perform

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.340 
this particular card on low did perform
