00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.690
 for knitting cord we need yarn 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.290
 I took 100 percent viscose of this thread 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:19.760
 sapphire will also need two hooks 125 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:24.990
 millimeters and but 75 millimeters lock 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.019
 for mounting and gum but I took 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.029
 gum i just have no cord 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.550
 better to take a cord that will 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.200
 tied inside the lace at the very 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.020
 In fact, I just have nothing to gum 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.620
 ordinary lace so thin and so 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.620
 take the hook 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:53.610
 125 millimeter now I do the first 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:01:02.579
 loop and dial a chain of air 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:05.220
 loops ok necessary length well and so 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.790
 further it is to determine how long it is 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.220
 you need you need a lace and this length 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.210
 need to dial a chain and so here I am 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.220
 I got the chain I needed and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.130
 I will knit the first row now 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:29.180
 loop one air and I knit it all 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.180
 air loops with single crochets 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.240
 and so on that is the number you need 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.880
 dovyazat until the end and so here I am tied 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.680
 first row at the same time tied a tail 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.149
 which remains from the start of knitting 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:55.399
 now do a loop unfold and 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.009
 This series I will knit for the front 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.340
 base loop thread 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:05.600
 that is, touching on this thread 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.039
 which is in front and so on 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.720
 I will need to knit 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:20.930
 the whole row until the end and so here I have tied 2 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.930
 row now i need to collect with with 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.870
 hand on this side as if all 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.760
 loops on one that is like this 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.560
 way 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:43.850
 I do a loop on changing the hook 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:44.900
 we put with 5 we take a fastener I dress is 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.160
 hour on the hook 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:57.340
 and neatly need to pull the thread 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:03:00.319
 here through this loop so knitted 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.910
 now you can do it again i'm 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.160
 the camera will not do it because 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.120
 that is uncomfortable to dress again on 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.239
 hook and pull the thread and so here I am 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.970
 department fastener tied rather and 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.290
 now I'm knitting through this one 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.109
 initial loop and on I'll be like 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.049
 would connect these two sides 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:27.609
 knit gum and so need to put 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:32.019
 gum here in this way for 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:36.380
 the middle, then I hit the thread for 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:42.709
 first loop then on the opposite 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.130
 side and pull the thread through all that 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.230
 these loops 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.200
 here you need to crochet of course 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.200
 thicker i.e. change the hook again to 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.470
 1 that is one by 25 millimeters and so 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.200
 Touch the front loops and 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.570
 hind we are about this here and rezinochku 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.970
 rather, this one will connect the cord 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.530
 will be round and so here I am connected 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.960
 it turned out such a string 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.150
 it's a ponytail from the beginning of knitting it needs 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.640
 will just cut right here right here 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.660
 you need to cut the gum and also connect 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.310
 tie several loops in one 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.930
 several loops in one knit with 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.750
 using two hooks i have i 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.940
 made 2 loops and now this one is done 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.050
 I will hook the hook first on the first hook 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.220
 and then on the second and so here I am knitted 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.400
 on the first shoot hook 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:46.290
 so then you need this loop 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.510
 knit through the first two loops here 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.660
 so it turns out as if 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.390
 the end of this lace is now necessary 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:02.210
 will do the same thing as at the beginning 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:05.540
 that is, I see an eyelet, I find a fastener 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:12.260
 so here and in 2 parts and 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:17.360
 putting on the hook so now we pull out 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:22.980
 a thread through these two loops 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:26.000
 then you can do it the same way again 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.000
 let's go first 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.940
 so that's about knitting that is now one more time 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.069
 also 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.440
 I can knit here 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:43.340
 cling 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.169
 zipper to lace 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.020
 that's the way then this tail 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.419
 trimmed only in length and tail 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.949
 cleaned inside necessarily 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.410
 tie knots somewhere 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.460
 when you pull the tail for the first time 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.610
 need to tie a knot so that it does not 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.669
 dissolved 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.770
 and remove this one here tail and gum 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:08.750
 that is, in principle, on this in general 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.750
 knitting and you can finish
