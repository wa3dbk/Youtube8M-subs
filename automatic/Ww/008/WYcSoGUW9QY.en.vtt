00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
symbols last year we introduced CRX

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.199

CRX<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:14.580> stands<00:03:15.580> for<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.820> classic<00:03:16.360> rocket

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
CRX is stands for a classic rocket

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.620 
CRX is stands for a classic rocket
extreme<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.430> all<00:03:18.640> fits<00:03:18.880> within<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.390> one

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
extreme so it all fits within the one

finish on the extreme sorry symbols the
other<00:03:30.819> new<00:03:31.030> thing<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:32.050> we<00:03:32.170> have<00:03:32.319> reverse

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
other new thing is that we have reverse

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.059 
other new thing is that we have reverse

China's normally the bell is inverted on

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.979 
China's normally the bell is inverted on
this<00:03:36.640> side<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.090> China<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.569> drummers

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
this side of the China and drummers

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.220 
this side of the China and drummers
would<00:03:38.170> set<00:03:38.380> their<00:03:38.560> symbols<00:03:38.920> up<00:03:39.069> upside<00:03:39.489> down

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
would set their symbols up upside down

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.720 
would set their symbols up upside down
that<00:03:41.230> makes<00:03:41.470> them<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.709> little<00:03:41.890> wobbly<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.670> a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
that makes them a little wobbly and a

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.789 
that makes them a little wobbly and a
little<00:03:42.910> more<00:03:43.000> prone<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.299> damage<00:03:43.630> if<00:03:44.320> they<00:03:44.590> play

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
little more prone to damage if they play

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.680 
little more prone to damage if they play
with<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.310> bell<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> normal<00:03:46.540> position

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
with the bell is a normal position

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.539 
with the bell is a normal position
they're<00:03:47.470> playing<00:03:47.709> with<00:03:47.920> their<00:03:48.070> stick<00:03:48.310> right

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
they're playing with their stick right

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.759 
they're playing with their stick right
on<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.910> left<00:03:49.360> turn<00:03:49.540> Hartnett<00:03:50.110> damages<00:03:50.620> the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
on the left turn Hartnett damages the

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.610 
on the left turn Hartnett damages the
sticks<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.610> by<00:03:51.820> inverting<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.420> symbol<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:53.410> get

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
sticks so by inverting the symbol we get

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.860 
sticks so by inverting the symbol we get
something<00:03:54.280> that's<00:03:54.549> much<00:03:54.730> more<00:03:55.360> durable

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
something that's much more durable

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.310 
something that's much more durable
without<00:03:56.829> changing<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.700> sound<00:03:57.940> very<00:03:58.810> at<00:03:59.079> all

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
without changing the sound very at all

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.470 
without changing the sound very at all
really

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
really

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.599 
really
that's<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.629> 12<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.439> an<00:04:03.590> 18<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:07.129> here<00:04:07.519> are

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
that's a 12 this is an 18 and here are

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.099 
that's a 12 this is an 18 and here are
some<00:04:07.670> of<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:07.999> other<00:04:08.150> sounds<00:04:08.629> that<00:04:08.689> are<00:04:08.900> in<00:04:08.989> the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
some of the other sounds that are in the

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:25.330 
some of the other sounds that are in the
extreme<00:04:09.469> range

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.330 

so<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:27.150> extremes<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.380> new<00:04:28.560> inverted

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
so the extremes and the new inverted
