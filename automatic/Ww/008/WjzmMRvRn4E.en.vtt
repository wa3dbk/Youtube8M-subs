been period eyes and calculated down to
the<00:03:01.230> last<00:03:01.500> detail<00:03:01.860> now<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.760> know<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:02.970> don't

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
the last detail now you know I don't

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.090 
the last detail now you know I don't
really<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.140> sciency<00:03:04.590> stuff<00:03:04.620> or

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
really like the sciency stuff or

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.830 
really like the sciency stuff or
whatever<00:03:05.280> but<00:03:05.910> Kelly<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.540> know<00:03:06.630> that's

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
whatever but Kelly you know that's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.960 
whatever but Kelly you know that's
that's<00:03:07.080> his<00:03:07.290> forte<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:07.830> he's<00:03:08.250> gotten<00:03:08.880> this

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
that's his forte so he's gotten this

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.759 
that's his forte so he's gotten this
down<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> science<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.290> we<00:03:10.380> can<00:03:10.500> do<00:03:10.620> nothing

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
down to a science so we can do nothing

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.070 
down to a science so we can do nothing
basically<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.180> Darren<00:03:12.510> t<00:03:12.660> you're

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
