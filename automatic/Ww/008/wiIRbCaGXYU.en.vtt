00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.990 

let's<00:03:40.560> see<00:03:40.799> how<00:03:40.950> will<00:03:41.129> finish<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:44.700> almost

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
let's see how will finish it almost

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.259 
let's see how will finish it almost
looks<00:03:45.299> like<00:03:45.420> Charlie<00:03:45.870> giving<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:48.120> this

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
looks like Charlie giving up but this

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.449 
looks like Charlie giving up but this
handset<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.870> pocket<00:03:49.379> standing<00:03:49.830> around<00:03:50.069> there

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
handset is pocket standing around there

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.789 
handset is pocket standing around there
yeah<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.299> he<00:03:51.599> won't<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:51.900> really

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
yeah I think he won't be really

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.080 
yeah I think he won't be really
satisfied<00:03:53.310> with<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.519> as<00:03:53.670> last<00:03:53.819> round<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.360> I

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
satisfied with it as last round but I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.600 
satisfied with it as last round but I
think<00:03:57.090> shima<00:03:57.420> could<00:03:57.599> have<00:03:57.720> ended<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.049> better

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
think shima could have ended it better

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.860 
think shima could have ended it better
this<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.790> going<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.120> tough<00:04:00.329> call<00:04:00.569> for<00:04:00.599> the
