00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
drive from the motherboard go ahead and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.760 
drive from the motherboard go ahead and
pry<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:59.000> it<00:01:00.000> has<00:01:00.300> four<00:01:00.750> screws<00:01:01.739> in

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
pry that up there it has four screws in

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:19.109 
pry that up there it has four screws in
the<00:01:02.160> four<00:01:02.460> corners<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:04.110> out

drive because it really speeds up the
computer<00:03:37.480> for<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.689> one<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:38.989> had<00:03:39.349> an<00:03:39.530> alienware

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
computer for this one I had an alienware

this SSD which I'm putting into my new
Alienware<00:03:49.609> I<00:03:50.150> mean<00:03:51.019> this<00:03:51.170> be<00:03:51.560> different<00:03:52.129> was

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
Alienware I mean this be different was

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:11.909 
Alienware I mean this be different was
significant<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:08.359> you're<00:04:08.629> gonna<00:04:08.810> go<00:04:09.079> ahead

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.909 

push<00:04:12.919> this<00:04:13.280> back<00:04:13.669> into<00:04:14.299> here<00:04:14.569> just<00:04:15.019> be<00:04:15.409> careful

push this back into here just be careful
this<00:04:16.130> little<00:04:16.519> membrane<00:04:16.759> here<00:04:17.509> so<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.139> don't

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
this little membrane here so you don't

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.649 
this little membrane here so you don't
break<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:21.669> go<00:04:22.669> ahead<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.479> plug<00:04:25.330> hard<00:04:26.330> drive

break it go ahead and plug hard drive
back<00:04:26.990> into<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.680> motherboard<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:31.449> said<00:04:32.449> it's

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
back into the motherboard I said it's
