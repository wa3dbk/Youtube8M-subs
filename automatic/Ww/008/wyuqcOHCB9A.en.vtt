ok<00:00:27.740> perfect<00:00:28.820> ok<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:29.880> you're<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> take<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
ok perfect ok so you're going to take a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.430 
ok perfect ok so you're going to take a
line<00:00:31.590> sheet<00:00:31.890> paper<00:00:32.630> fold<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.870> doesn't<00:00:34.290> matter

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
line sheet paper fold up doesn't matter

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.080 
line sheet paper fold up doesn't matter
what<00:00:34.620> size<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> blowing<00:00:35.520> back<00:00:40.969> don't<00:00:41.969> make

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
what size of the blowing back don't make

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.619 
what size of the blowing back don't make
it<00:00:42.300> shoes<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:44.129> impossible<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.120> blow<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it shoes so it's impossible to blow it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.600 
it shoes so it's impossible to blow it
so<00:00:46.410> make<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.620> too<00:00:46.950> small<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.129> impossible<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.489> go

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
so make it too small so impossible to go

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.950 
so make it too small so impossible to go
in<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.629> make<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.440> perfect<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.960> ok

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
in but make it just perfect for you ok

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
in but make it just perfect for you ok
it's<00:00:55.170> pretty<00:00:55.350> simple<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.670> make<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.210> be

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it's pretty simple to make this be

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's pretty simple to make this be
starting<00:00:58.109> gun<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.719> given<00:01:01.170> tutorials

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
starting gun I will be given tutorials

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.730 
starting gun I will be given tutorials
on<00:01:02.270> how<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.300> make<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.339> like<00:01:05.339> mg42<00:01:06.229> with<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> stand

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
on how to make a like mg42 with a stand

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.670 
on how to make a like mg42 with a stand
bios<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:09.990> where<00:01:10.290> you're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
bios and so that's where you're going to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.510 
bios and so that's where you're going to
make<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.820> beware<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.880> um<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:17.070> pretty<00:01:17.130> much

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
make that beware so um it's pretty much

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
make that beware so um it's pretty much
it<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.830> barrel<00:01:20.360> but<00:01:21.409> you're<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it for this barrel but you're going to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.700 
it for this barrel but you're going to
make<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:24.630> um<00:01:25.520> take<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.850> piece<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> paper

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
make two little um take a piece of paper

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.630 
make two little um take a piece of paper
roll<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.040> cut<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.030> half<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.040> then<00:01:32.040> tape

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
roll it up cut it in half and then tape

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.149 
roll it up cut it in half and then tape
it<00:01:32.670> onto<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.420> barrel<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.920> looks<00:01:35.070> like

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it onto this barrel so it looks like

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.680 
it onto this barrel so it looks like
this

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.550 

so<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.210> what<00:01:44.420> we're<00:01:44.630> going<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.870> use<00:01:44.900> right

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
so that is what we're going to use right

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.320 
so that is what we're going to use right
now<00:01:45.940> so<00:01:47.950> this<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.280> part<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.910> will<00:01:49.970> show<00:01:50.270> you

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
now so this is the part I will show you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.320 
now so this is the part I will show you
to<00:01:50.480> make<00:01:50.690> right<00:01:51.230> now<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:52.460> takes<00:01:52.730> about<00:01:52.910> three

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
to make right now it takes about three

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.980 
to make right now it takes about three
or<00:01:53.360> four<00:01:53.480> minutes<00:01:54.110> but<00:01:55.030> it's<00:01:56.030> worth<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.720> it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
or four minutes but it's worth it it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.040 
or four minutes but it's worth it it
looks<00:01:57.320> really<00:01:57.590> cool<00:01:58.010> oh<00:01:58.400> yeah<00:01:59.360> if<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.660> let<00:01:59.870> the

looks really cool oh yeah if you let the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.310 
looks really cool oh yeah if you let the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
gun so once it gets down to lip out here

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.960 
gun so once it gets down to lip out here
blow<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.400> out<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.880> then<00:02:27.580> usually<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.790> could

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970
