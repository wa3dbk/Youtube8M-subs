00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 under skiing lessons 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.529
 lesson number six basics waving carving 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.710
 technicians in this series we will introduce you to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.830
 new carving technique 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.020
 you learn all the secrets of the turns that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.650
 as you probably thought only available 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.650
 to experts 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.770
 you see two types of alpine skiing and fsk ues 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.920
 those on the left are modern carving 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.920
 skiing 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.670
 toe and heel carving skis 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.250
 significantly wider than waist compared to 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.840
 traditional skis just this 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.420
 ski design feature 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.430
 makes cornering easier when 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.500
 you cant your carving skis and 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.820
 start loading their main pressure 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.010
 the ski is carried out in its center we 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.900
 begins to independently describe the arc 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.900
 in other words feed 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.600
 if you start to accelerate into that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.030
 the moment you are at an angle to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.530
 slope you will notice that you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.530
 turn almost independently 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.010
 keep the correct distance between 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.940
 your skis to free 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.860
 work with both of them don't forget 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.520
 move up and down keeping the rhythm 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.520
 movements 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.960
 the easiest way to carving 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.729
 is this that start 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.040
 walk slowly down the slope 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.500
 and now with the help of the knee and shin 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.460
 conveniently increase the clone of the ski which 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.460
 located down the hill 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.490
 now do it using both legs 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.740
 your legs should move to the side 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.780
 turning thereby increasing the angle 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 ski slope in relation to the slope 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.000
 during the turn you have to make sure 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.300
 that your feet move in 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.300
 turning 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.540
 when you master this technique 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.450
 try to use both legs 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.680
 at the same time 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.840
 accelerate gradually every time 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.790
 guiding your skis more and more down 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.770
 slope before you start to increase 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.770
 ski slope 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.900
 when you practiced enough in 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.110
 cornering both ways and you can 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.349
 start connecting them together 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.250
 find the right rhythm and speed 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.690
 start down the slope make sure 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.560
 that your movements are smooth and 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.560
 controlled 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.210
 movement of your legs and side to side 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.210
 determines the angle of rotation 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.830
 start turning with your knees and 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.020
 ankles 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.180
 when you start accelerating you should 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.350
 steer the skis in turn and place 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.350
 his business inside the turn 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.140
 the higher your speed the greater should 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.120
 be amplitude bend more 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.070
 the amplitude of the rotation gives more 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.780
 grip go to bed with such a clone 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.030
 way you will control even 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.710
 very high speed you can 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.660
 control also the width of the turn 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.730
 when you are from a wide turn 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.240
 you can always continue short 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.240
 by turning 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.090
 if you can ride for sleep and 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.010
 keep a good balance 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.850
 you will become really good 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.850
