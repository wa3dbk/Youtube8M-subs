00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.280 
of them and building a cold frame or
anything<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.030> good<00:00:36.149> idea<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.899> get

as<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.370> material<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.960> for

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
as much of the material as you can for

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.740 
as much of the material as you can for
free<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.059> next<00:00:42.300> part<00:00:42.540> goes

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
free and I think the next part goes

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
free and I think the next part goes
without<00:00:43.020> saying<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.649> always<00:00:43.980> ask<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.000> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
without saying but always ask if you can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
without saying but always ask if you can
have<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> material<00:00:46.110> first<00:00:49.129> most<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> day

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
will be all cold frame area here for

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.399 
will be all cold frame area here for
winter<00:01:21.750> crops<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:26.810> more<00:01:27.810> than<00:01:28.020> double<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.490 
we started by putting a 8 foot 2x4
between<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.570> clothesline<00:01:42.290> post<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:44.500> made

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
between the clothesline post and made

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.730 
between the clothesline post and made
sure<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.340> ground<00:01:46.880> was<00:01:47.180> level<00:01:47.740> stacked

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
sure that the ground was level stacked

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.320 
sure that the ground was level stacked
the<00:01:48.950> pallets<00:01:49.340> up<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.700> see<00:01:49.880> what<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:50.120> going<00:01:50.240> to

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
the pallets up to see what it's going to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.510 
the pallets up to see what it's going to
look<00:01:50.420> like<00:01:50.480> and<00:01:50.900> then<00:01:51.680> started<00:01:52.070> cutting<00:01:52.280> it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
look like and then started cutting it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.410 
look like and then started cutting it
into<00:01:52.670> shape<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.040> this<00:01:55.040> was<00:01:55.310> my<00:01:55.550> basic<00:01:55.910> shape

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
into shape and this was my basic shape

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.080 
into shape and this was my basic shape
and<00:01:56.660> then<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.050> remembered<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.710> had<00:01:57.950> some<00:01:58.760> screen

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090

and then I remembered I had some screen
doors<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.690> I<00:01:59.840> had<00:02:00.050> used<00:02:00.290> they'd<00:02:00.680> built<00:02:00.980> for<00:02:01.190> a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220

is<00:02:16.700> about<00:02:16.880> letting<00:02:17.090> light<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:20.380> built<00:02:21.380> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
is about letting light in so I built a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.410 
is about letting light in so I built a
top<00:02:21.800> section<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.370> put<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> second<00:02:23.150> screen

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
top section and put the second screen

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.100 
top section and put the second screen
door<00:02:23.660> up<00:02:24.020> there<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.910> adjusted<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> dorsum

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
door up there and I adjusted the dorsum

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.830 
door up there and I adjusted the dorsum
so<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:27.860> fit<00:02:28.100> better<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.550> there<00:02:28.810> but<00:02:29.810> you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
so that we fit better on there but you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.920 
so that we fit better on there but you
can<00:02:30.170> see<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.500> coming<00:02:30.680> together<00:02:30.920> pretty<00:02:31.280> well

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
can see it's coming together pretty well

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.140 
can see it's coming together pretty well
inside<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.290> about<00:02:33.530> seven<00:02:34.070> feet<00:02:34.310> by<00:02:34.760> five

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
inside it's about seven feet by five

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.070 
inside it's about seven feet by five
feet<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.760> where<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.360> could<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
feet and this is where I I could get the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.290 
feet and this is where I I could get the
cardboard<00:02:39.530> boxes<00:02:39.950> for<00:02:40.010> free<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.850> went<00:02:41.150> down

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
cardboard boxes for free so I went down

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.610 
cardboard boxes for free so I went down
to<00:02:41.330> look<00:02:41.570> at<00:02:41.660> store<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.650> screw<00:02:42.980> them<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.280> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
to look at store to screw them on and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.259 
to look at store to screw them on and
then<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.739> took<00:02:45.800> some<00:02:46.010> leaves<00:02:46.459> because<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.150> was

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
then I took some leaves because it was

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.930 
then I took some leaves because it was
fall<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.930> stuff<00:02:48.860> leaves<00:02:49.160> down<00:02:49.430> in<00:02:49.670> through

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
fall and stuff leaves down in through

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.940 
fall and stuff leaves down in through
all<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.330> pallets<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.170> somewhat

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
all the pallets so it's somewhat

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.640 
all the pallets so it's somewhat
insulated<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:55.580> was<00:02:55.930> pretty<00:02:56.930> easy<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.440> put

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
insulated and it was pretty easy to put

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.530 
insulated and it was pretty easy to put
together<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.280> then<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.730> bought<00:02:58.970> some<00:02:59.180> spray

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
together and then I bought some spray

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.870 
together and then I bought some spray
paint<00:02:59.570> and<00:03:00.080> spray<00:03:00.530> painted<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.040> outside<00:03:01.070> and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
paint and spray painted the outside and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.720 
paint and spray painted the outside and
most<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.930> inside<00:03:03.500> just<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:04.400> keep<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
most of the inside just to keep the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.460 
most of the inside just to keep the
moisture<00:03:05.150> from<00:03:05.360> destroying<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.930> cardboard

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
moisture from destroying the cardboard

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.430 
moisture from destroying the cardboard
until<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.340> find<00:03:07.640> something<00:03:08.120> for<00:03:08.360> free<00:03:08.600> to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
until I can find something for free to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.890 
until I can find something for free to
replace<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.160> that's<00:03:10.370> more<00:03:10.580> durable<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.540> here's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
replace it that's more durable so here's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.470 
replace it that's more durable so here's
my<00:03:12.080> foot<00:03:12.380> print<00:03:12.650> inside<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.700> did<00:03:13.940> wrap<00:03:14.330> the
