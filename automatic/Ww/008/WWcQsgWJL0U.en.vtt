00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
the beginning of the year so that they

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.630 
the beginning of the year so that they
better<00:02:21.959> also<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.739> battery<00:02:24.220> supposed<00:02:24.550> to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
better also the the battery supposed to

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.660 
better also the the battery supposed to
have<00:02:24.730> 12<00:02:24.970> hours<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:26.069> battery<00:02:27.069> life<00:02:27.099> now<00:02:27.459> which

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
have 12 hours of battery life now which

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.199 
have 12 hours of battery life now which
is<00:02:27.700> amazing<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:29.709> original<00:02:30.129> one<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.760> said<00:02:31.090> to

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
is amazing this original one it said to

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.199 
is amazing this original one it said to
have<00:02:31.360> nine<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.440> nine<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.739> half<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:33.129> get<00:02:33.970> about

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
have nine to nine and a half I get about

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.970 
have nine to nine and a half I get about
six<00:02:34.599> to<00:02:34.750> seven<00:02:34.780> which<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:35.799> it's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
six to seven which you know it's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.699 
six to seven which you know it's
reasonable<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.989> one<00:02:38.170> would<00:02:38.260> 12<00:02:38.530> you

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
reasonable so this one would 12 you

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.710 
reasonable so this one would 12 you
should<00:02:39.129> expect<00:02:39.400> nine<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.790> ten<00:02:39.970> hours<00:02:40.000> on<00:02:40.450> every

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
should expect nine to ten hours on every

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.930 
should expect nine to ten hours on every
charge<00:02:40.989> on<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:42.190> dock<00:02:42.370> someone<00:02:42.640> going<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.849> add

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
charge on the dock someone going to add

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.580 
charge on the dock someone going to add
six<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.450> who<00:02:43.540> cares<00:02:45.630> also<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> dock<00:02:46.959> only<00:02:47.410> has

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
six but who cares also the dock only has

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.880 
six but who cares also the dock only has
one<00:02:47.890> USB<00:02:48.220> port<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:49.000> by<00:02:49.780> instead<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.260> two<00:02:50.470> so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
one USB port now by instead of two so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.850 
one USB port now by instead of two so
that's<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:51.099> little<00:02:51.190> bit<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.489> downside<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:53.709> on

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
that's a little bit of a downside but on

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.920 
that's a little bit of a downside but on
the<00:02:53.980> tablet<00:02:54.280> itself<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:55.239> has<00:02:55.269> all<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.690> same

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
the tablet itself it has all the same

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.660 
the tablet itself it has all the same
docks<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.620> buttons<00:02:57.040> they're<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.430> moved

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
docks and buttons they're just moved

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.119 
docks and buttons they're just moved
around<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.150> bit<00:02:59.129> that's<00:03:00.129> pretty<00:03:00.310> much<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.950> if

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
around a bit that's pretty much it so if

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.619

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
you should just get your transformer

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.059 
you should just get your transformer
it's<00:03:18.790> really<00:03:19.000> up<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.859> don't<00:03:20.859> know<00:03:20.920> what

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
benefits right now this is much thinner

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.720 
benefits right now this is much thinner
it's<00:03:25.870> much<00:03:26.109> lighter<00:03:26.380> tigra<00:03:27.100> 3<00:03:27.370> which<00:03:27.579> will

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
it's much lighter tigra 3 which will

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.339 
it's much lighter tigra 3 which will
make<00:03:27.819> flash<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.630> games<00:03:29.500> much<00:03:29.829> smoother

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
make flash and games much smoother

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.660 
make flash and games much smoother
webpages<00:03:32.349> load<00:03:32.500> much<00:03:32.829> faster<00:03:33.400> you're<00:03:33.549> all

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
webpages load much faster you're all

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.229 
webpages load much faster you're all
that<00:03:33.849> stuff<00:03:34.120> it's<00:03:34.660> got<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> CMOS<00:03:35.940> sensor<00:03:36.940> on<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
that stuff it's got a CMOS sensor on the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.110 
that stuff it's got a CMOS sensor on the
camera<00:03:37.569> eat<00:03:37.690> megapixel<00:03:38.319> LED<00:03:39.069> flash<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:40.000> that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
camera eat megapixel LED flash so that

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.150 
camera eat megapixel LED flash so that
camera<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.569> going<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.750> be<00:03:40.900> like<00:03:41.170> almost

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
camera is going to be like almost

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.210 
camera is going to be like almost
point-and-shoot<00:03:42.790> quality<00:03:43.799> from<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.889> sounds

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
point-and-shoot quality from the sounds

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.750 
point-and-shoot quality from the sounds
of<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:46.139> it's<00:03:47.190> thinner<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.340> lighter<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:48.579> believe

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
of it it's thinner and lighter I believe

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.490 
of it it's thinner and lighter I believe
I<00:03:48.880> said<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.090> already<00:03:49.299> it's<00:03:49.930> got<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.230> nice

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
I said that already it's got the nice

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.240 
I said that already it's got the nice
aluminum<00:03:50.829> backing<00:03:51.280> now<00:03:51.639> it<00:03:52.389> doesn't<00:03:52.660> have<00:03:52.810> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
aluminum backing now it doesn't have the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.979 
aluminum backing now it doesn't have the
bevel<00:03:54.250> anymore<00:03:54.730> it's<00:03:54.940> just<00:03:55.180> nice<00:03:55.419> and<00:03:55.450> flat

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
bevel anymore it's just nice and flat

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.440 
bevel anymore it's just nice and flat
and<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.989> does<00:03:59.260> have<00:03:59.340> more<00:04:00.340> memory<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.970> for

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
and it does have more memory like for

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.440 
and it does have more memory like for
the<00:04:01.540> price<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:02.079> can<00:04:02.500> kind<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.769> say<00:04:03.450> because

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
the price you can kind of say because

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.530 
the price you can kind of say because
the<00:04:04.569> original<00:04:04.660> transformer<00:04:06.209> well<00:04:07.209> no<00:04:07.359> it's

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
the original transformer well no it's

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.789 
the original transformer well no it's
it's<00:04:07.810> like<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.260> same<00:04:08.470> as<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.709> original

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
it's like the same as the original

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.979 
it's like the same as the original
transformer<00:04:09.609> they<00:04:09.730> just<00:04:09.940> bumped<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.299> out<00:04:10.419> the
