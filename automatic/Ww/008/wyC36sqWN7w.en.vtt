why don't we develop an outreach
mechanism<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:26.810> actually<00:01:27.259> go<00:01:27.440> into<00:01:27.709> these

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
mechanism to actually go into these

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
better way to symbolize lending a hand

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.620 
better way to symbolize lending a hand
