00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:11.150
 north gin is much like 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.780
 hem rear arches 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.770
 young and complexity means that for a long time 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:24.180
 we have such a crown there most likely 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.380
 the amplifier stopped us moving he like 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 would divide the dent into two parts with 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:37.290
 the top of the form here means 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.930
 the work will be entered initially by the system 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.059
 extensions still install 2 clips 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 separately across this one ribs 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.500
 in this part second in this part in order 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.539
 to unload it here itself 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.190
 edge that is pull this way 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.110
 so here it is a rib with us 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.410
 spontaneously unloaded later 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.320
 his likeness and pull up the tops 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.939
 Here you can install 3 clips 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.430
 1 here and the third top will start 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.730
 equals here and so she herself 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.570
 the hardest 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.490
 will what we do we mean by 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.210
 maximum on the glue system everything is in it 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.260
 or here we have a large-scale work 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.280
 only curve system 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.860
 my a half times and glue system 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 toy compartments 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.240
 cleaning everyone is not away now with us 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.590
 nearing the end remained luck style and so 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.690
 a lot of everything here but the end is already visible 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.750
 It means that we work mainly 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.790
 through the hole lichka fuel tank 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.060
 use different types of tools 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.890
 here and from here in a couple we 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.660
 sometimes they put their hands on the contour 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.020
 originally when very deep were 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.060
 here here are the places near 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.980
 the edges we counter them whipping a little bit 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.130
 raised extremely difficult because the contra 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.110
 then climbs back hard butt contra 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.320
 pores had to work here but in any 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.160
 case we quietly quietly 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.679
 put the plane in place all 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.140
 the rest was finished with glue and 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.790
 the tool periodically punched all 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.980
 the advantages that we have here 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.340
 sometimes punched them special yes 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.840
 spat that do more flat 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.340
 the surface to make it more obedient 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.370
 was coming because stiffness is very 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.650
 high here and two edges next therefore 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.489
 there is enough tension between them 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.640
 here but in any case 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.120
 handled now finish 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.120
 to finish
