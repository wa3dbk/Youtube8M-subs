yeah<00:03:55.579> today<00:03:56.540> okajima's<00:03:57.260> gene<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:58.250> internal

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
yeah today okajima's gene the internal

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.539 
yeah today okajima's gene the internal
perspective<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.900> then<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.859> making<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.340> metal

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
perspective and then the making of metal

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.640 
perspective and then the making of metal
gear<00:04:01.669> solid<00:04:01.849> for<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.470> external<00:04:03.470> perspective
