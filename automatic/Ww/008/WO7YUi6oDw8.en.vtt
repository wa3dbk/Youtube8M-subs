00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 comes home later 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.340
 3 meters 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.430
 5 meters could exist young people and 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.370
 before I start sticking with you 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.840
 I can breathe a little more 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.879
 a lady is sitting someone will be here soon 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.379
 our cameraman under water for two hours 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.580
 here on the ground 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.860
 and his name is frank give me great 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.199
 we can make applause a selfie 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.160
 we can look at what i think it is 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.560
 quite a few 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.430
 I'm fine okay guys put it on 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.990
 well yes we will be shown then 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.820
 you're off and was 10 meters 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.500
 of course a bit of a heavy scroll 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 and you go down a bit anyway 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.420
 what is the special reason 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.490
 it's a much technical leap 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.470
 yes, and he's just not he succeeded yet 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.399
 it is the journey successful not successful 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.539
 let's hope the marriage and what's up 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.610
 well this jump 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.640
 yes it is it is another closed 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.110
 end with a half screw and with a dive 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.610
 well that's not a cat piss itself 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.100
 is rather over it seems a bit 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.080
 but that of Jeffrey just a little less 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.600
 ok ok ok ok you just have to do something 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.540
 figure hey province already a lot 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.439
 success is about concentrating and that's why 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.280
 give him a big applause 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.280
 dordtenaar 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.970
 he is nice and tasty 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.970
 water 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.950
 quite a bit serious 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.440
 of course we already knew you were a third 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.910
 devil was when you got rid of those 10 meters 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.590
 Now it appears to me that you use that technique 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.660
 still pretty under control and above all 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 start loss could went pretty well anyway 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.280
 yeah I'm glad he finally some light 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.930
 you then with your arm it's just a start 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 yes that is the technique i need 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.800
 assume at the beginning and that is in the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.890
 air through your arm too 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.959
 move then turn but that is real 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.280
 very suspiciously difficult we go to the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.680
 our jury 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.900
 inge this is our goldenboy he was that 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.670
 also tonight yes i thought so i thought 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.709
 with you that was possible for the entire total package 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.530
 clock with you you have the looks i have it 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.970
 live and the guts and that really has 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.470
 translated into your jumps that you too 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.060
 once a choir and growing in the stands 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.870
 sit our dear siren who knew you 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.090
 encourages 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.840
 transported completely well in LED 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.840
 yes your live group really in very few 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.540
 very tight and straight, very well done 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.600
 I think class is done thank you 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.400
 nice maurice 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.440
 do you see a new career? 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.729
 here well who knows yes but I think so 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.100
 he is still busy with it 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.060
 skating but as a top athlete you know 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.919
 of course like no other 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.110
 competition mentality is and in the 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.570
 you have to come in final next week 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.130
 you go beyond that hall final yourself and 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.660
 maybe some people are already thinking 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.700
 first it was ten meters, now it is five 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.890
 meter that is less spectacular 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.630
 but the difficulty level that you have 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.910
 chosen for this jump let's that 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.120
 especially remember that is really great 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.729
 thank you thank you well this translates 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.610
 in the points but is that we want to know 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:56.909
 I'll cut your first and last name as you 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.840
 he in I totally agree with that 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.840
 chasing after maurice 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:06.810
 lisa no no eight 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.580
 peripheral with the second point high that I 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.650
 have looked thick enough for a moment 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.280
 The provisional ranking koen 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.319
 you come to these points on a 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.419
 shared shared fourth place 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.550
 with jowie not wrong at all but 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.620
 want your home to make sure kun
