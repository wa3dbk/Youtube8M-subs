00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
as well so it just made me think that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.360 
as well so it just made me think that
maybe<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.640> red<00:00:53.820> lip<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.309> be

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
maybe the red lip is you know it can be

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
maybe the red lip is you know it can be
more<00:00:56.579> versatile<00:00:57.120> than<00:00:57.180> than<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.870> think

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
more versatile than than you think

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.979 
more versatile than than you think
because<00:00:58.260> normally<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.829> would<00:00:59.480> assume<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
because normally you would assume that a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
because normally you would assume that a
red<00:01:01.320> lip<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.739> inappropriate<00:01:01.980> unless

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
red lip would be inappropriate unless

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.189 
red lip would be inappropriate unless
you<00:01:02.879> were<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> formal<00:01:03.629> event<00:01:03.809> for

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you were going to a formal event for

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
you were going to a formal event for
example<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.189> there<00:01:05.790> are<00:01:05.820> issues<00:01:06.000> about

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
example and then there are issues about

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.920 
example and then there are issues about
what<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> red<00:01:07.200> lip<00:01:07.380> matches<00:01:08.570> like<00:01:09.570> some<00:01:09.720> people

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
what a red lip matches like some people

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.130 
what a red lip matches like some people
might<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.740> goes<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:12.140> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

think<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:08.070> fact<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.400> it's<00:02:08.610> orange<00:02:08.940> toned

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
think the fact that it's orange toned

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.320 
think the fact that it's orange toned
makes<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.960> more<00:02:10.520> wearable<00:02:11.520> especially

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
makes it a bit more wearable especially

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.180 
makes it a bit more wearable especially
because<00:02:12.570> I'm<00:02:12.750> obviously<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:14.100> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
because I'm obviously you know I have a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.490 
because I'm obviously you know I have a
yellow<00:02:14.340> undertone<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.180> an<00:02:15.420> orange<00:02:16.050> tone<00:02:16.290> red

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
yellow undertone so an orange tone red

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.040 
yellow undertone so an orange tone red
lipstick<00:02:16.920> would<00:02:17.130> suit<00:02:17.820> my<00:02:18.060> skin<00:02:18.570> coloring

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
lipstick would suit my skin coloring

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.730 
lipstick would suit my skin coloring
more<00:02:19.320> than<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> cool<00:02:20.490> tone<00:02:20.700> redwood<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:22.650> if

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
more than a cool tone redwood but if

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.410 
more than a cool tone redwood but if
you're<00:02:22.890> cool<00:02:23.160> tones<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.090> have<00:02:24.180> pink

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
you're cool tones like you have pink

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.940 
you're cool tones like you have pink
undertones<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:24.960> your<00:02:25.110> skin<00:02:25.320> than<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> cooler

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950

undertones in your skin than a cooler
toned<00:02:26.460> red<00:02:27.420> lipstick<00:02:27.810> would<00:02:27.960> suit<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.260> better

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290

toned red lipstick would suit you better
which<00:02:28.770> means<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.280> has<00:02:29.370> more<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.790> blue

which means that it has more of a blue

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.940 
which means that it has more of a blue
undertone<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.470> has<00:02:31.620> more<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.860> an

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.850 
undertone to it and this has more of an
orange<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.730> yellow<00:02:32.970> undertone<00:02:33.590> I'm<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:34.680> going

really<00:02:56.190> fun<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.560> wear<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.770> nighttime<00:02:59.030> so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350

might<00:04:02.250> not<00:04:02.400> be<00:04:02.550> able<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.730> see<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.120> my<00:04:03.180> lips

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
might not be able to see it on my lips

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.009 
might not be able to see it on my lips
yeah<00:04:05.670> it's<00:04:05.820> definitely<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.269> orange<00:04:06.750> undertone

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
yeah it's definitely a orange undertone

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.550 
yeah it's definitely a orange undertone
so<00:04:07.470> that's<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.890> lip<00:04:08.040> liner<00:04:08.900> Rouge<00:04:09.900> it's

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
so that's the lip liner Rouge it's

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.699 
so that's the lip liner Rouge it's
called<00:04:10.739> Bruges<00:04:10.980> number<00:04:11.280> 20<00:04:11.550> for<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:11.850> that's

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
called Bruges number 20 for and that's

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.850 
called Bruges number 20 for and that's
one<00:04:13.709> side<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.100> the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
one side of the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.400 
one side of the
lip<00:04:15.310> liner<00:04:15.520> so<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.690> can<00:04:16.840> see<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.079> it's

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
lip liner so you can see that it's

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.430 
lip liner so you can see that it's
sharpened<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.720> not<00:04:19.840> sharp<00:04:20.079> in<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.320> usual

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
sharpened it's not sharp in the usual

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.920 
sharpened it's not sharp in the usual
way<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.980> looks<00:04:21.160> different<00:04:21.609> too<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.540> looks<00:04:22.720> much

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
way it looks different too it looks much

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.740 
way it looks different too it looks much
neater<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.380> much<00:04:24.010> more<00:04:24.340> precise<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.630> way

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
neater and much more precise the way

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.930 
neater and much more precise the way
they<00:04:25.900> sharpened<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:27.190> maybe<00:04:27.370> that's<00:04:27.640> what

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
they sharpened it so maybe that's what

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.360 
they sharpened it so maybe that's what
their<00:04:28.270> sharpener<00:04:29.080> does<00:04:29.290> I'm<00:04:29.620> not<00:04:29.770> sure<00:04:29.950> could

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
their sharpener does I'm not sure could

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.850 
their sharpener does I'm not sure could
just<00:04:30.490> be<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.670> standard-sized<00:04:31.590> sharpen<00:04:32.590> up<00:04:32.650> on

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
just be a standard-sized sharpen up on

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.140 
just be a standard-sized sharpen up on
the<00:04:32.980> other<00:04:33.100> side<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:35.590> lip<00:04:35.740> liner<00:04:36.150> this

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
the other side of the lip liner this

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.080 
the other side of the lip liner this
side<00:04:37.510> there's<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.290> lip<00:04:38.860> brush<00:04:39.070> which<00:04:39.670> comes<00:04:39.970> to

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
side there's a lip brush which comes to

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.600 
side there's a lip brush which comes to
a<00:04:40.240> point<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.140> think<00:04:41.260> that'll<00:04:41.740> be<00:04:41.890> really

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
a point so I think that'll be really

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.090 
a point so I think that'll be really
this<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:43.570> basically<00:04:43.990> for<00:04:44.320> your<00:04:44.470> lipstick<00:04:44.950> I

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
this is basically for your lipstick I

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.580 
this is basically for your lipstick I
think<00:04:45.370> which<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.360> really<00:04:46.660> nice<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.260> could

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
think which is really nice so you could

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.070 
think which is really nice so you could
apply<00:04:47.980> our<00:04:48.190> lip<00:04:48.340> liner<00:04:48.580> either<00:04:49.419> just<00:04:49.840> around

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
apply our lip liner either just around

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.020 
apply our lip liner either just around
the<00:04:50.230> edges<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.740> outline<00:04:51.070> or<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.550> could<00:04:51.790> fill

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
the edges to outline or you could fill

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.270 
the edges to outline or you could fill
in<00:04:52.060> your<00:04:52.300> entire<00:04:52.570> lip<00:04:52.810> as<00:04:52.930> well<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.380> help<00:04:53.410> your

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
in your entire lip as well to help your

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.060 
in your entire lip as well to help your
lipstick<00:04:54.669> stay<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.150> longer<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:55.840> then<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:56.770> guess

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
lipstick stay on longer and then I guess

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.100 
lipstick stay on longer and then I guess
you<00:04:57.250> could<00:04:57.280> use<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:57.850> brush<00:04:58.150> to<00:04:58.540> apply<00:04:58.570> your

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
you could use this brush to apply your

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.050 
you could use this brush to apply your
lipstick<00:04:59.640> or<00:05:00.640> even<00:05:01.120> your<00:05:01.210> lip<00:05:01.390> gloss<00:05:01.630> um<00:05:03.060> so

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
lipstick or even your lip gloss um so

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.020 
lipstick or even your lip gloss um so
yeah<00:05:04.180> that's<00:05:04.390> these<00:05:04.690> my<00:05:04.900> first<00:05:05.260> Chanel<00:05:06.220> lip

more<00:05:33.310> matte<00:05:33.550> formula<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:34.270> would<00:05:34.510> describe<00:05:35.110> the

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
more matte formula I would describe the

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.590 
more matte formula I would describe the
finish<00:05:35.680> as<00:05:35.860> satin<00:05:36.280> finish<00:05:36.550> not<00:05:36.790> completely

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
finish as satin finish not completely

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.990 
finish as satin finish not completely
mad<00:05:37.750> but<00:05:37.960> satin<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.740> they<00:05:39.220> also<00:05:39.400> have<00:05:39.640> left<00:05:39.850> an

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
mad but satin and they also have left an

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.300 
mad but satin and they also have left an
aqua<00:05:40.360> Lumia<00:05:40.690> lipstick<00:05:41.229> line<00:05:41.410> which<00:05:41.680> is<00:05:41.919> more

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
aqua Lumia lipstick line which is more

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.719 
aqua Lumia lipstick line which is more
glossy<00:05:42.669> and<00:05:43.590> probably<00:05:44.590> not<00:05:45.070> as<00:05:45.190> long<00:05:45.310> lasting

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
glossy and probably not as long lasting

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.100 
glossy and probably not as long lasting
and<00:05:45.880> then<00:05:46.030> they<00:05:46.120> have<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.360> new<00:05:46.479> Rouge<00:05:46.720> cocos

line most of the Reds they had had a

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.990 
line most of the Reds they had had a
kind<00:05:55.150> of<00:05:55.210> like<00:05:55.360> a<00:05:55.390> diluted<00:05:55.960> dark<00:05:56.260> pink<00:05:56.590> color
