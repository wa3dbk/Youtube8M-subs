00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.540
 ultimate team 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
 finally I hurried quickly to hear 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.780
 but starter pack it will be this little 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.639
 short video 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 thanks case or via the access we can play 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.490
 at ultimate team 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.500
 go it's gone first pack on those 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.039
 ci fains the ultimate team I hope 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.300
 to have heavy 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.680
 sergio boosket this mega okay so we 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.980
 rather pretty badly 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.199
 it's clear it's not the egg player 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.050
 but hey that's still a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.940
 player at 85.2 general so here is there 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.760
 still boyata in right defender 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.989
 kokorine who still beautiful little 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.600
 stat then we have three players 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.820
 off normal so kokorin danilo and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 donors we agree a player 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.840
 German a Brazilian player and a few 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 little money players who are not going to be 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.949
 very interesting but that's when 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930
 not too bad we will open the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.719
 next steps we will of course send 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.329
 all the elements remaining at the club 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.070
 Come on guys I hope we're going to get caught 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 heavy so I'm not in phase 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.479
 range for today but you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.760
 do not worry then he will not have 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.409
 of course go second pack I do not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.979
 do not even look at what's the packs 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.080
 I will see the surprise art by myself 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.310
 go we'll see give back on this new 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 pack it's a little shame they 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.119
 that only one rare item and all does say 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.150
 nothing stadium taxis say ramalho and so 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.180
 we had williams gaboulov regard man's 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.310
 nice good hike is a very good player 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.049
 so that's pretty good but on 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.479
 in the stuff of the beginning we will send 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.220
 again one more time towards our 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.930
 club for me it's not very 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.220
 very fishy same time it is on his 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 easter carters 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.360
 go we'll open the third pack I 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.840
 do not really know at all what is it 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.149
 these packs 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.130
 I hope I have a lot of agreement 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.590
 henderson good it's not too much for 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.040
 a non- rare player yong as well as a good 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.369
 right side then onlines and necid 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.869
 who play this flight so that's ok so a 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.540
 coach had to laugh coach 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.959
 Belgian and so here we begin to have 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.220
 the basic style cards for a guardian that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.420
 we are not interested and the jersey of 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.060
 madrid atletico so here it is in january 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.640
 once again 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.630
 of course everything in our club I think 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.819
 of course you 're not going to do 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.980
 shame fast from the start we have left 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.690
 two packs to open to go I hope 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.130
 have a nice little card on everything 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.760
 but for the moment I have not yet put 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.430
 the points that annoy santa cruz claire 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.019
 and diop - proment it's not famous 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.760
 all the guys but hey those are the ones 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.810
 first normal pacsÃ©s the jersey of 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.830
 australia of course since she is 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.739
 shirt of the national selections 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.019
 now again we're going back 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.720
 all this and now we will open the 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.660
 last xbox legends pack so here it is 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.030
 there is only one element to I hope anyway 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.920
 that it's going to be cool for us for this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.280
 last pack I hope it'll fall to 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.110
 gorging at rodrigues so here it is a 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.459
 little bit the packs that can be 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.080
 maybe in the teeth the gifts 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.540
 daily it's that kind of easter 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.530
 on the web API 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.700
 apparently yes it must be that so 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.810
 here it is still not too much 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.610
 unhappy driguet it stays in good 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.260
 little players to start I think 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.690
 that he has four and hall 2a no ago 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.940
 three stars so yeah good it stays 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.650
 very very average but good that night 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.989
 that's always it's an old easter 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.359
 the last so now after bruno 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.130
 remains bronze packs to open but good 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.329
 since we have this training it's the beginning 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.670
 we will not offer them 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.170
 and now has over Easter 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.239
 open what is a little pity 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.459
 when we quickly went around now 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.410
 you still have a lot of solutions to 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.730
 you either put yourself more than 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.410

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.420
