it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.910 
it
another<00:03:00.780> function<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.620> want<00:03:01.860> to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
another function that I want to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.010 
another function that I want to
highlight<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:03.090> option<00:03:03.450> for<00:03:03.480> your<00:03:03.750> screen

highlight is the option for your screen
rising<00:03:04.670> let's<00:03:05.670> see<00:03:06.350> step

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
rising let's see step

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.400 
rising let's see step
let's<00:03:09.000> just<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.750> screen<00:03:10.140> is

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
let's just think that this screen is

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.830 
let's just think that this screen is
actually<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:11.070> document<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.690> sign

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
actually a document and you have to sign

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.230 
actually a document and you have to sign
that<00:03:12.900> document<00:03:13.460> so<00:03:14.460> what<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.730> need<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.060> do

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
that document so what you need to do

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.160 
that document so what you need to do
just<00:03:15.530> do<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:17.540> activate<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.690> air<00:03:18.810> command

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
just do is like activate the air command

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.850 
just do is like activate the air command
click<00:03:19.740> on<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.430> screen<00:03:20.730> right<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.860> let's

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
click on the screen right and let's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.100 
click on the screen right and let's
pretend<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.790> white<00:03:24.090> box<00:03:24.390> over<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.780> is

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
pretend that this white box over here is

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.330 
pretend that this white box over here is
where<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.530> need<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.800> write<00:03:25.950> your<00:03:26.130> signature

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
where you need to write your signature

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.580 
where you need to write your signature
so<00:03:27.090> if<00:03:27.180> we're<00:03:27.330> ready<00:03:27.630> taking<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.110> screenshot

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
so if we're ready taking the screenshot

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.950 
so if we're ready taking the screenshot
of<00:03:28.800> that<00:03:28.830> document<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.970> now<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.750> have

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
of that document and now you just have

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.650 
of that document and now you just have
to<00:03:31.110> sign<00:03:31.290> over<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.710> sign<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.760> over<00:03:32.910> here<00:03:33.300> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
to sign over it sign it over here and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.110 
to sign over it sign it over here and
after<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.190> easily<00:03:35.370> send<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.910> back

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
after that you can easily send it back

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.720 
after that you can easily send it back
to<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.390> person<00:03:36.570> who<00:03:36.900> needs<00:03:37.080> your<00:03:37.200> contract<00:03:37.730> so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
as easy as that no need to print it out

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.100 
as easy as that no need to print it out
sign<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.490> then<00:03:41.700> scan<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.330> back<00:03:42.720> just<00:03:43.020> to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
sign it and then scan it back just to

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.160 
sign it and then scan it back just to
send<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.970> particular<00:03:45.240> tablet<00:03:45.930> has

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
send it so this particular tablet has

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.910 
send it so this particular tablet has
white<00:03:46.740> has<00:03:47.750> LTE<00:03:48.750> connectivity<00:03:49.080> correct<00:03:49.620> yes

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
white has LTE connectivity correct yes

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.180 
white has LTE connectivity correct yes
so<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:50.550> don't<00:03:50.820> have<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.330> like<00:03:52.230> look<00:03:53.010> around

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
so you don't have to like look around

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.670 
so you don't have to like look around
for<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> Wi-Fi<00:03:54.090> hotspot<00:03:54.480> just<00:03:55.410> with<00:03:55.560> your
