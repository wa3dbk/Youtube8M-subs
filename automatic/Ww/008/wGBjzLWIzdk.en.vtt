know one of those presentations where
you'd<00:00:04.170> rather<00:00:04.380> take<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.830> bullet<00:00:05.250> then<00:00:05.759> read

another bullet point on a slide turns

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.820 
another bullet point on a slide turns
out<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.240> not<00:00:09.420> your<00:00:09.809> fault<00:00:10.110> or<00:00:10.410> even<00:00:10.740> the

presenters fault for that matter it's

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.299 
presenters fault for that matter it's
actually<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:13.559> our<00:00:13.740> brains<00:00:14.070> are

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
presentations awesome let's get started

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.959 
presentations awesome let's get started
shall<00:00:32.430> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
shall we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.959 
shall we
problem<00:00:33.809> number<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.680> redundancy<00:00:35.370> effect

problem number one the redundancy effect

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.090 
problem number one the redundancy effect
turns<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.899> our<00:00:36.930> brain<00:00:37.410> isn't<00:00:37.890> able<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
turns out our brain isn't able to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
turns out our brain isn't able to
process<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.850> same<00:00:39.120> information<00:00:39.719> efficiently

when<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.190> hear<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.090> same<00:00:42.360> thing<00:00:42.660> at

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
when you see and hear the same thing at

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.950 
when you see and hear the same thing at
the<00:00:42.960> same<00:00:43.530> time<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.340> too<00:00:44.940> much<00:00:45.149> info<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.719> once

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the same time it's too much info at once

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.080 
the same time it's too much info at once
it's<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> episode<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.670> The<00:00:47.789> Simpsons

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's like that episode of The Simpsons

it's like that episode of The Simpsons
where<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.840> doctor<00:00:49.289> explains<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:49.950> mr.<00:00:50.309> burns

where that doctor explains how mr. burns

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.970 
where that doctor explains how mr. burns
isn't<00:00:50.910> sick<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.680> many

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
isn't sick because there are so many

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
isn't sick because there are so many
