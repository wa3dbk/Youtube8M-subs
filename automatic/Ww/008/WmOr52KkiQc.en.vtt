 hooks it has repeatedly argued in 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.710
 features to classic sprint from not 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.750

 percentage nasty form Kryukov Now 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.710

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.640
 as far as walking mouths like on 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.610

 goes hooks including frequency slightly 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:32.770
 approaching them under the lazy that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:36.080
 takes but not so bad this 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.750
 olympic champion beats tortuga day 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.790

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.520
 there really is no show this time 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.520
 was because the liver pinched him 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.980

 competitions at first did not look like 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.649
 formidable as we used to see it but 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.020
 here he got the trajectory 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.020
 the opposite of how the race developed
