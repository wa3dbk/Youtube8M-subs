00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:14.150
 and collect how are you telling them that the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.279
 frontal system that affected the area 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.020
 central country during the end of 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.210
 week would stay at this time 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.029
 affecting in the northern provinces 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.890
 also in the south of the littoral and the north 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.689
 from the province of buenos aires while 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.849
 than in the rest of the Pampa plain 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.430
 in which and in Patagonia improves the 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.110
 situation the time will be good stable 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.210
 with clear or partially clear sky 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.579
 cloudy and wind rotation towards the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.379
 northern sector which will allow a good 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.480
 thermal amplitude with respect to the end of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.640
 week and also the rise of the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.649
 temperature reaching the values 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.109
 normal averages for the month of March 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.309
 Meanwhile as I said to the 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.199
 province of buenos aires- la 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.390
 instability of being in Buenos Aires and 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.699
 in silver still with rainfall 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.980
 or each thermal amplitude and values ​​per 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.690
 below average the minimum will be 14 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.409
 degrees and the maximum would be reaching 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.269
 the 19 degrees in the southeast sector is going 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.009
 recovering the time if it partially 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.229
 on one side of the slight rise of the 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.439
 temperature with a minimum of 10 and a 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.329
 maximum of only 20 degrees to bay 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.119
 white- also the situation is similar 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.369
 conditions improve 12 24 the 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.189
 values ​​with variable cloudiness in the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.229
 center and in the provincial west 13 22 and 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.840
 the partially annulled winds rotating 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.490
 towards the northeast sector and for the area 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.009
 of junin and surroundings one morning 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.590
 pretty cool 9 degrees the minimum and the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.180
 maximum would be reaching there the 21 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.549
 degrees also with sky between 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.430
 Partly cloudy covered improving 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.840
 during the last hours of the day 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.579
 well now as always I tell you if 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.859
 they need more information can 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.549
 consult our page every day 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.079
 web at www.clear.com that these 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.759
 operators I hope in the next broadcast 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.759
 again with the forecast of the day
