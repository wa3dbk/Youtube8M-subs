I<00:01:30.020> think<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.140> Reynolds<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.710> some<00:01:31.920> flies

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
I think it's Reynolds that some flies

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.840 
I think it's Reynolds that some flies
punch<00:01:32.640> their<00:01:32.910> mesh<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.380> no<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:35.010> bodies<00:01:35.640> go

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850

and me the ball you should don't do you
anticipate<00:01:38.430> soon<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:39.410> think<00:01:40.410> we<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> see

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860

the Rangers we're at excellent in the
first<00:01:42.330> half<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.040> think<00:01:44.250> they'd<00:01:44.370> like<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.100 
first half and I think they'd like to
get<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.000> back<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.420> part<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> as

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
