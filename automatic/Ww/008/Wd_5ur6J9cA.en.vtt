00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.760 

I<00:01:34.900> think<00:01:35.900> this<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.110> going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.290> be<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.410> good<00:01:36.590> race

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
I think this is going to be a good race

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.130 
I think this is going to be a good race
because<00:01:37.220> when<00:01:37.490> he<00:01:37.580> passed<00:01:37.820> me<00:01:38.060> he<00:01:38.840> didn't<00:01:39.050> do

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
because when he passed me he didn't do

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.080 
because when he passed me he didn't do
it<00:01:39.170> overly<00:01:39.590> aggressive<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.310> think<00:01:40.670> he's<00:01:40.880> a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
it overly aggressive so I think he's a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.270 
it overly aggressive so I think he's a
respectable<00:01:41.690> driver

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
respectable driver

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.890
