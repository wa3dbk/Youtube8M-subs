00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

kinds<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.740> jelsoft<00:01:25.740> cases<00:01:26.340> before<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:28.700> this

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
kinds of jelsoft cases before but this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.020 
kinds of jelsoft cases before but this
actually<00:01:30.630> became<00:01:31.409> from<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.430> liking<00:01:32.729> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
actually became from me not liking this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.210 
actually became from me not liking this
type<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> case<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.439> being<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.799> favorite

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
type of case to it being my favorite

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.249 
type of case to it being my favorite
case<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
case and it's not just because of the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.990 
case and it's not just because of the
color<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.750> thing<00:01:41.000> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
color but because for one one thing the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.120 
color but because for one one thing the
chrome<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
chrome here you can actually see the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.330 
chrome here you can actually see the
chrome<00:01:44.430> through<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> case<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.960> cool

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
chrome through the case which is so cool

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.300

because<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> chrome<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
because I really like the chrome and I

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.210

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and being able to see the chrome through

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.639 
and being able to see the chrome through
the<00:01:58.469> case<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.520> some<00:02:00.020> whether<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.320> did

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the case it's just some whether they did

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
the case it's just some whether they did
that<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:01.979> purpose<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.850> was<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.329> a

really<00:02:03.659> nice<00:02:03.840> feature<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.890> does<00:02:05.159> go<00:02:05.369> over<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
really nice feature it does go over the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
really nice feature it does go over the
chrome<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.509> protecting<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> at<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> same

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
accessible well for me it is

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.880 
accessible well for me it is
but<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.540> small<00:04:27.810> fingers<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.410> I'm<00:04:28.500> not<00:04:28.680> sure

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
but I have small fingers so I'm not sure

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.450 
but I have small fingers so I'm not sure
how<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.730> would<00:04:29.880> be<00:04:30.210> for<00:04:30.990> guys<00:04:31.770> with<00:04:32.160> bigger

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
how it would be for guys with bigger

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.630 
how it would be for guys with bigger
hands<00:04:32.970> or<00:04:33.090> whoever<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.200> are<00:04:34.350> but<00:04:34.680> for<00:04:34.950> me<00:04:35.490> it's

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
hands or whoever you are but for me it's

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.140 
hands or whoever you are but for me it's
easy<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:37.160> this<00:04:38.160> is<00:04:38.310> cut<00:04:38.520> out<00:04:38.550> pretty<00:04:38.850> nicely

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
easy and this is cut out pretty nicely

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.210 
easy and this is cut out pretty nicely
it<00:04:39.540> actually<00:04:39.870> has<00:04:40.020> more<00:04:40.050> space<00:04:40.710> on<00:04:40.920> this<00:04:41.160> side

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
it actually has more space on this side

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.630 
it actually has more space on this side
but<00:04:41.700> maybe<00:04:42.210> it's<00:04:42.420> just<00:04:42.480> my<00:04:42.990> case<00:04:43.290> but<00:04:43.740> what

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
but maybe it's just my case but what

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.840 
but maybe it's just my case but what
nonetheless<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:46.350> happened<00:04:47.070> for<00:04:47.310> me<00:04:47.460> so

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
nonetheless it it happened for me so

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.160 
nonetheless it it happened for me so
it's<00:04:48.720> not<00:04:48.870> like<00:04:49.140> perfect<00:04:49.710> there<00:04:51.170> something

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
it's not like perfect there something

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.870 
it's not like perfect there something
that<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.350> don't<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:52.860> about<00:04:52.920> this<00:04:53.310> case<00:04:53.580> though

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
that I don't like about this case though

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.010 
that I don't like about this case though
one<00:04:54.690> thing<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.170> it<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:56.100> annoys<00:04:56.550> me<00:04:56.580> because

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
one thing that it just annoys me because

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.570 
one thing that it just annoys me because
I'm<00:04:58.020> putting<00:04:58.680> my<00:04:58.800> ear<00:04:59.040> like<00:04:59.280> here<00:04:59.790> right<00:05:00.210> and

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
I'm putting my ear like here right and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.330 
I'm putting my ear like here right and
this<00:05:02.580> part<00:05:02.910> right<00:05:03.000> here<00:05:03.120> it's<00:05:03.690> like<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.340> don't

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
this part right here it's like I don't

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.370 
this part right here it's like I don't
know<00:05:05.550> if<00:05:05.730> you<00:05:05.910> guys<00:05:06.030> call<00:05:06.330> it<00:05:06.360> flash<00:05:06.840> or

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
know if you guys call it flash or

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.080 
know if you guys call it flash or
whatnot<00:05:07.590> because<00:05:07.980> it's<00:05:08.250> not<00:05:08.400> really<00:05:08.700> flash

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
whatnot because it's not really flash

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.380 
whatnot because it's not really flash
it's<00:05:09.419> just<00:05:10.070> kind<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.160> sharp<00:05:11.760> right<00:05:12.000> here<00:05:12.240> and

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
it's just kind of sharp right here and

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.930 
it's just kind of sharp right here and
it<00:05:12.450> always<00:05:12.660> makes<00:05:13.169> my<00:05:13.470> ear<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.190> top<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.610> my<00:05:14.730> ear

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
it always makes my ear the top of my ear

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.820 
it always makes my ear the top of my ear
so<00:05:15.530> that's<00:05:16.530> something<00:05:16.890> that<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:18.560> don't<00:05:19.560> like

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
so that's something that I don't like

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.370 
so that's something that I don't like
and<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:21.180> don't<00:05:21.419> know<00:05:21.480> if<00:05:21.570> you<00:05:21.630> can<00:05:21.780> do<00:05:21.960> that<00:05:21.990> but

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
and I don't know if you can do that but

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.890
