00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:25.279
 Good day today, I did not prepare a salad 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:30.410
 female of cucumbers for the winter so close 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.550
 I will need 3 kilograms of cucumbers for 3 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.239
 kilogram of cucumbers 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.260
 One and a half kilograms of onion I took 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:43.129
 white onions blue and yellow and all chips 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.469

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.609

 plain black peas and bay leaf 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.350
 so cucumbers 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:06.340
 since they're big enough I'm cutting 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:14.409

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:18.880

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.159

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.119
 I will cut part of the sound like this 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:30.659
 half rings 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:30.659
 too thin enough for them separately 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:47.099
 just cut for different 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740
 but 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.960
 [music] 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.260

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.040
 all this mass I should have 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.040
 eight 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.970
 36 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 eggs 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.100
 so ok 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.230
 insofar as 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.820

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.879

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.970
 random list 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.060

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.470
 pour 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.519

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.980
 so 10 minutes of us 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.400
 confessed our pillows with puffs 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.900
