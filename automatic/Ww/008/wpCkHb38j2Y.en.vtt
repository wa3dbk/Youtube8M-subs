00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
once you take it out one thing I have

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.990 
once you take it out one thing I have
noticed<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.619> haven't<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.520> found<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.820> good

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
noticed is I haven't really found a good

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.810 
noticed is I haven't really found a good
way<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.300> keep<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.960> pocket<00:02:10.380> clip<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.610> light

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
way to keep the pocket clip on the light

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.090 
way to keep the pocket clip on the light
while<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.570> holder<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.350> kind<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.950> wish

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
while it's in the holder I kind of wish

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.920 
while it's in the holder I kind of wish
there<00:02:14.310> was<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.460> way<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.880> could<00:02:15.570> keep<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
there was a way that you could keep the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.610 
there was a way that you could keep the
clip<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.320> there

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
clip on there

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.710 
clip on there
all<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> time<00:02:17.090> which<00:02:18.090> I'm<00:02:18.209> sure<00:02:18.390> there<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
all the time which I'm sure there is a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.330 
all the time which I'm sure there is a
way<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.319> haven't<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.830> found<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.159> good

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
way I just haven't really found a good

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.309 
way I just haven't really found a good
way<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.580> do<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.090> yet<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.569> makes<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.019> still

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
way to do it yet that makes it still

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.670 
way to do it yet that makes it still
easy<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.769> slide<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.790> out<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.680> headband

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
easy to slide in and out of the headband

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.059 
easy to slide in and out of the headband
holder<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.549> that's<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:27.000> thing<00:02:27.150> about<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.599> and

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
holder so that's one thing about it and

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.880 
holder so that's one thing about it and
this<00:02:29.069> one<00:02:29.340> has<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.420> easy<00:02:30.890> user

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
this one has a really easy user

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.880 
this one has a really easy user
interface<00:02:32.489> with<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.790> light<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:34.440> does<00:02:34.650> come

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
interface with the light so it does come

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.069 
interface with the light so it does come
in<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.190> neutral<00:02:35.489> y<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.599> cool<00:02:36.810> white

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.780 
in the neutral y or the cool white
you're<00:02:37.349> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.560> get<00:02:37.739> more<00:02:37.980> lumens<00:02:38.519> with

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
you're going to get more lumens with

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.229 
you're going to get more lumens with
that<00:02:39.030> cool<00:02:39.329> white<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.769> has<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.250> cree<00:02:41.549> xm-l

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
that cool white and it has the cree xm-l

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.920 
that cool white and it has the cree xm-l
led<00:02:42.989> in<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.379> so<00:02:43.709> one<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.640> newer
