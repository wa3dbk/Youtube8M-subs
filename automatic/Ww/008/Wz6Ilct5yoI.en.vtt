00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello very good youtube structures 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:09.070
 youtube here we are in a new video 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:12.130
 with 755 today I come to teach you how 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.400
 make a roof in minecraft 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.849
 with oak wood stairs 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:23.230
 and good with that is done with that 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:27.400
 we started to make a kind of table d 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.710
 forgiveness of normal law is worth what 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.970
 We should first be done before it 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.000
 I will explain how it was done before 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.370
 before we would have to place one here 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.370
 ok and then we would place 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.860
 so when placing one here it would be 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.860
 more or less so 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.440
 and then with this 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 and then it would continue to do this 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.239
 it would be like that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.700
 but well this has changed thanks 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.670
 God and the ceiling is not that ugly 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.800
 so to speak it has improved rather little 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.320
 but it has improved as it does now 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.880
 let's see we have this is the end of 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.130
 keyboard that we want we choose we put 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 stairs here 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.090
 stairs to here 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.240
 ah 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 here to finish we will place one here 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.159
 and without looking is to turn water and it will be 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.159
 all right 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 this space is worth this space is covered 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.060
 with wooden boards 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.340
 then these tables can be removed and 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.990
 make a garret or leave it 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.330
 I do not know if you need the wood you take and do not 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.250
 leave it 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.880
 in this way then it will be 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.239
 rather a little 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.020
 Well, we repeat the same thing again 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.020
 we put this web 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.030
 here 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.780
 I come or I put up here and then 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 placed this paraguay 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.040
 you have seen 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.230
 and finally 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.650
 A) Yes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.710
 outside 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.700
 another here 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.150
 and that way we would have our 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.349
 roof made 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.349
 and here not 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.180
 We say we would have done these left 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.920
 then we can also make several 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.190
 forms for example like what I'm going to 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.190
 do and now 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.200
 now here we can 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.960
 see how 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.490
 in a field 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.490
 besides now you see it 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.060
 instead of being everything as I have done 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.060
 before 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.010
 better or better different because each one 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.310
 He has his tastes and everyone does it like 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.310
 want 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.420
 a tad tilted the truth 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.910
 ok as before we put the first and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.910
 we do this 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.569
 OK, perfect 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.569
 and now what are we doing here let's see 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.930
 this 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.220
 let's take 4 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.500
 It's worth nothing else 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:32.340
 we continue 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.340
 we leave it parked 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.550
 it does not bother us 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.100
 perfect we follow this 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.759
 let's go back to this 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.400
 let's put it through baa 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.260
 if we want we continue with our 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.260
 stairs 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.439
 the wrong done 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.629
 it is perfect 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.629
 it will be 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.840
 we follow this up so that 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.840
 stay roll as castilla so to speak 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.550
 ok it's there 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.550
 neither will there need to be the largest 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.220
 and we can leave this empty if you want 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:53.110
 I do not know what I 'm saying hey he's like this 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.110
 continue to save something the same 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.180
 important is going to be the last 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.180
 as it would be so the top 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.240
 and now we do the usual 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:18.910
 we put one here 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.910
 here not here is here 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.510

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.850
