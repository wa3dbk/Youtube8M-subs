00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
is actually a connects wheel as you can

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
is actually a connects wheel as you can
see<00:00:44.429> I<00:00:44.639> had<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> hot<00:00:45.179> glue<00:00:45.389> the<00:00:45.569> outer<00:00:45.749> rubber

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
see I had to hot glue the outer rubber

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
see I had to hot glue the outer rubber
onto<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.710> rim<00:00:46.920> because<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:47.429> the<00:00:47.519> motor<00:00:47.699> was

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
onto the rim because when the motor was

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.849 
onto the rim because when the motor was
spinning<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.629> full<00:00:48.839> speed<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.499> red<00:00:49.679> would

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
spinning at full speed the red would

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.559 
spinning at full speed the red would
actually<00:00:50.249> try<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.609> come<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.389> rim<00:00:53.569> here's

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
actually try and come off the rim here's

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:56.569 
actually try and come off the rim here's
a<00:00:54.659> quick<00:00:54.899> demo<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.649> launcher<00:00:56.010> actually

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
a quick demo of the launcher actually

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:12.830 
a quick demo of the launcher actually
shooting<00:00:56.909> a<00:00:57.030> ping-pong<00:00:57.269> ball

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.599 

along<00:01:13.840> with<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.109> launcher<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.679> also<00:01:14.950> built<00:01:15.399> a
