00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
these up so there's no steam escaping

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.570 
these up so there's no steam escaping
too<00:02:34.990> many<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.320> these<00:02:35.380> places<00:02:35.740> throw<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.310> so

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
too many of these places throw it so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.190 
too many of these places throw it so
these<00:02:36.760> are<00:02:36.970> twice<00:02:37.360> tight<00:02:37.770> okay<00:02:39.990> put<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.020> bowl

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
these are twice tight okay put a bowl

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.460 
these are twice tight okay put a bowl
here<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:45.270> I'll<00:02:46.270> go<00:02:46.480> ahead<00:02:47.730> pick<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.940> up<00:02:49.470> okay

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
here and I'll go ahead pick it up okay

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.430 
here and I'll go ahead pick it up okay
I'll<00:02:50.950> little<00:02:51.280> overlap<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.290> what

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
I'll little overlap and this is what

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.140 
I'll little overlap and this is what
water<00:02:53.650> will<00:02:53.890> come<00:02:54.070> out<00:02:54.190> okay<00:02:54.580> two<00:02:54.850> quarter

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
water will come out okay two quarter

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.260 
water will come out okay two quarter
turns<00:02:55.360> oh<00:02:55.480> good<00:02:56.050> alright<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> whole

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
lot okay so let's do that warmed up the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.750 
lot okay so let's do that warmed up the
air<00:03:01.690> put<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.930> silver<00:03:02.230> handle<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.270> down

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
air put a silver handle for this down

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.980 
air put a silver handle for this down
now<00:03:06.760> I'll<00:03:07.030> go<00:03:07.210> ahead<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:09.510> put<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.600> coffee<00:03:10.810> in

I'll<00:03:32.870> let<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.200> Panhandle<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.519> we'll<00:03:34.640> let<00:03:34.730> it

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
I'll let the Panhandle and we'll let it

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:56.220 
I'll let the Panhandle and we'll let it
run<00:03:35.030> for<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.239> 15<00:03:35.690> seconds

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230

still and again hardly any pressure and
there's<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.239> little<00:04:13.330> pressure<00:04:13.540> now<00:04:13.660> coming

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
there's a little pressure now coming

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.490 
there's a little pressure now coming
through<00:04:14.349> Anderson<00:04:14.860> unexpected<00:04:15.400> coming<00:04:15.610> up

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
through Anderson unexpected coming up

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.100 
through Anderson unexpected coming up
okay<00:04:17.970> but<00:04:18.970> as<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.180> can<00:04:19.269> see<00:04:21.000> not<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> lot<00:04:22.150> which

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
about bad the problems of temperature

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.780 
about bad the problems of temperature
even<00:04:29.410> though<00:04:29.500> it's<00:04:29.650> boiling<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.430> I've<00:04:30.610> had

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
this to a machine running for about

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.270 
this to a machine running for about
maybe<00:04:32.800> or<00:04:32.979> 20<00:04:33.639> minutes<00:04:33.940> now<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:35.470> can<00:04:35.650> see<00:04:35.950> I'll

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
the first one being that not making

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.270 
the first one being that not making
expresso<00:06:37.860> at<00:06:38.070> level<00:06:38.370> one<00:06:38.580> power<00:06:38.940> level<00:06:39.270> one

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
expresso at level one power level one

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.310 
expresso at level one power level one
second<00:06:41.280> one<00:06:41.400> is<00:06:41.550> that<00:06:41.850> at<00:06:42.330> power<00:06:42.540> level<00:06:42.840> two<00:06:43.020> is

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
second one is that at power level two is

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.830 
second one is that at power level two is
making<00:06:43.770> cold<00:06:44.760> expresso<00:06:45.150> even<00:06:45.570> though<00:06:45.660> I've

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
making cold expresso even though I've

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.900 
making cold expresso even though I've
had<00:06:46.020> the<00:06:46.140> machine<00:06:46.470> running<00:06:46.680> for<00:06:47.010> almost<00:06:47.490> 20

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
had the machine running for almost 20

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
had the machine running for almost 20
minutes<00:06:48.030> and<00:06:49.760> they<00:06:50.760> can't<00:06:51.030> froth<00:06:51.270> any<00:06:51.480> milk<00:06:51.750> so

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
minutes and they can't froth any milk so

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.790 
minutes and they can't froth any milk so
it's<00:06:52.140> far<00:06:52.380> from<00:06:52.820> the<00:06:53.820> condition<00:06:54.390> that<00:06:54.630> I<00:06:55.200> was

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
it's far from the condition that I was

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.320 
it's far from the condition that I was
expecting<00:06:57.320> okay
