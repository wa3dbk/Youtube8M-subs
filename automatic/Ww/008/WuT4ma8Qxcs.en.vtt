00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.100
 in this video we are going to show you how 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.050
 customize products with the application 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.180
 of original gift we have taken as 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.730
 example a case the iphone 5 but 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.170
 it would be the same with any other product 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.029
 The first thing to do is give the 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.550
 Buy button to add the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.560
 product our shopping cart is 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.779
 You can customize on this screen or 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.699
 after putting all our data if 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.369
 we would like to do it now, there would only be 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.169
 what to give the design button in the first 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.669
 place we are asked for the email and the phone 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.500
 so you do not miss the job of 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.060
 customization in case it goes out 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 the computer or the connection to 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.090
 Internet 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.520
 when putting that data you access the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.040
 application to customize the product 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.600
 It is divided into two areas to 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.640
 left you see how the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.530
 product and on the right are the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.810
 tools to customize what 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.570
 let's start uploading a photo to 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.200
 It is necessary to click on the image button 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.120
 then to select file 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.410
 and then we select the image with 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.159
 we want to customize our 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.159
 product 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.049
 to finish you have to add the 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.049
 Image can be edited in two ways 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.120
 different on the one hand with the mouse and 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.280
 be moving the site 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.060
 changing its size with squares 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.060
 of the perimeter 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.170
 or rotating it with the square that is 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.170
 about him 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.290
 or directly with the tools of 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.290
 the right changing the position 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.560
 changing the size 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.180
 or rotating the either with the squares of 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.400
 here or directly with the wheel 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.320
 you can put several images if 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.270
 we would like to add another one, we should give it 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.220
 to the same button and repeat the process in 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.200
 this case what we are going to add now goes 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.210
 to be a text for it is the button 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.659
 above we write whatever we want 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.229
 put and we give to add 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.679
 we can choose a color and also a 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.679
 source 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.629
 the text can also be edited with the 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.680
 mouse or directly with the 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.680
 tools here below 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.200
 you can also add several texts 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.880
 repeating this process finally if 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.530
 our customization does not cover all the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.840
 printing area we could also 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.460
 put a background color in this case 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.460
 by hitting the corresponding button 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.209
 to finish the tool layers 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.250
 allows you to manage all the work that you already 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.170
 we have done either by putting some 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.640
 elements over others for example 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.190
 putting the text below the image 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.690
 although in this case it would not be edited 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.690
 those with the corresponding button 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.400
 or eliminating something if we are no longer interested 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.439
 If this is how we want our product 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.720
 custom you just have to give it 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.640
 to the end button 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.110
 if everything went well the button that 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.270
 originally it was in red now 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.430
 it will be green as we have 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.410
 said customization can be done 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.170
 at the beginning at the end if we had 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.700
 side directly to arrange purchase and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.700
 we would have filled in the form 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.690
 we would have reached this window here 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.040
 You can make the payment first and 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.050
 just below to the area to 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.420
 customize that takes us directly 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.430
 the designer has done it before or 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.350
 after to confirm that the product 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.240
 is customized has to appear 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.740
 this gentleman lifting his thumb if he is 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.740
 so the process is over
