00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.360
 gambling presents 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.670
 she is 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.980
 so studio treyarch with presented to us 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 multiplayer new call of duty call of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.900
 duty black ops 3 to the point that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 Makes 1 black ops 2 black ops very 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 boundary world at war 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.379
 and of course we could expect these and well 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.320
 next call of duty next likes 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.150
 but what we saw to the call 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.150
 debt is only partly related 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.350
 the man that made the studio essentially a game 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.120
 dismantled to the grounds then collected 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.190
 re using elements of some kind 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.379
 neighbors in the genre of games that we, too 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.600
 know well and it turned out in the end some 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.580
 mix and because of call of duty titanfoll and and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 tests are not a test they go mechanics 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.960
 classes each have their own special moves 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.970
 special weapons special movements she need 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.400
 note that this desire is treyarch 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.930
 to collect from the option little by little and in the case of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 classes broke such a joke 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.520
 developers can not say otherwise 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 because one of the classes is called 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.090
 the prophet and he looks like well 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 hero zagryz krayzis 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 and there is another class you enjoyed 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.909
 very popular within our homes 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.549
 session is outrider 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.740
 and this girl in the hood that is, she is like 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.549
 as if she came to us straight from 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.549
 assassin's creed 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.500
 I knew 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.750
 returning class yes there are tricks 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.030
 sleep opportunities but take advantage of them 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.280
 possible only if you commit tellest 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.230
 rake that is some masterful action 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.030
 and most importantly you can 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.680
 you can use not 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.200
 some kind of situation and tactically 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.180
 the complexity of the minute is not even then reasonable 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.710
 get a super gun remove the gun 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.390
 and yours continue to shoot their own 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.220
 own it says that up 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.410
 some class struggle in this game 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.720
 always produces but it is not bright 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.430
 expressed as other classes 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.800
 oriented shooters such as 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.850
 overvotch it is understandable why in aktivizhn 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.040
 second overwatch 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.870
 but we need a new call of duty, but why? 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.540
 his 2 titanfall here is a question 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.070
 because the game is played moving one 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.250
 almost like titanfall 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.290
 the speeds of feeling weapons are all there and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.020
 here is the fur of not enough yet 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.840
 titanfall introduced fear factor in shooters 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.220
 did you run from anyone in this game 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.650
 run around 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.090
 attack and all major music 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:40.280
 mechanics they contribute to this penguin 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.970
 stacks lad tuna fork buy stool 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.190
 . 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.890
 interesting part of the developers of black ops 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.470
 3 used to work on tony hawk pro series 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
 skater and and i will honestly tell you this 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.580
 it feels necessary you should n't be scared 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.709
 recognizable call of duty is still 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.840
 call of duty longtime on one side in 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.330
 move then the titanfall mechanic to the country 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.070
 Poddinu some elements of the test 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.500
 not a game loses a little from this 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.540
 individuality but to be honest to 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.280
 understand how independent it is 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.900
 game you need to play yourself a player 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.269
 because on the one hand a single player 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.239
 will add us the background by this 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.120
 cool they are all very ordinary even 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.860
 strange sometimes but what is behind them 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.810
 not so this moment just playing 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.120
 single player we certainly want 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.650
 play polish and me multiplayer because 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.959
 that she is not represented by a mechanic 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.060
 one dimensional there are 2 one third bottom 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.519
 to break it you need to play 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.510
 much more than one hour and many 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.510
 tens of hours
