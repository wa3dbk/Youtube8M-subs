00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
different chits in the game that's posed

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.770 
different chits in the game that's posed
by<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.450> downfall<00:02:51.019> for<00:02:51.050> many<00:02:51.950> people<00:02:52.130> one<00:02:53.030> diet

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780

35 its own that would probably be at the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
planning sheet and navigation think that

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.020 
planning sheet and navigation think that
from<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.570> rulebook<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:16.489> what<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.730> makes<00:03:16.880> a

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
from the rulebook so what it makes a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.949 
from the rulebook so what it makes a
reference<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:18.019> certain<00:03:18.410> sections<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:20.180> our<00:03:20.360> f1

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
reference to certain sections and our f1

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.030 
reference to certain sections and our f1
or<00:03:21.430> p5<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.820> then<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.570> can<00:03:23.780> refer<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.500> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
or p5 and then you can refer to it the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.660 
or p5 and then you can refer to it the
process<00:03:25.519> on<00:03:25.790> your<00:03:26.150> cheat<00:03:27.049> sheet<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:31.370> we've<00:03:31.519> got
