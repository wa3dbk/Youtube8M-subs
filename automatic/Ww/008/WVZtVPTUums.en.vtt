00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
year so with mammoths long history of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
year so with mammoths long history of
the<00:01:26.700> kamikaze<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:28.470> together<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.860> Troy

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the kamikaze I got together with Troy

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.850 
the kamikaze I got together with Troy
Lee<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.549> day<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.540> many<00:01:31.020> months<00:01:31.200> back<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
Lee one day it was many months back and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
Lee one day it was many months back and
Troy<00:01:32.520> said<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.060> let's<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.659> let's<00:01:33.930> do

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
Troy said you know let's do let's do

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.410 
Troy said you know let's do let's do
this<00:01:34.229> legends<00:01:34.740> race<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.820> took<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.329> we

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
this legends race so we took that and we

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510 
this legends race so we took that and we
morphed<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> into<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.860> kamikaze

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
morphed it into really it's a kamikaze

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.350 
morphed it into really it's a kamikaze
2.0<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.740> original<00:01:41.369> kamikaze<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.240> up

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
2.0 so the original kamikaze will be up

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.179 
2.0 so the original kamikaze will be up
at<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> main<00:01:42.720> lodge<00:01:42.930> they'll<00:01:43.619> finish<00:01:43.829> their

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
at the main lodge they'll finish their

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.700 
at the main lodge they'll finish their
the<00:01:44.399> riders<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.450> off<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.750> course<00:01:46.049> get

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the riders will get off that course get

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.200 
the riders will get off that course get
on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> gondola<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> couple<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
on the gondola right about a couple of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
on the gondola right about a couple of
thousand<00:01:48.600> feet<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.560> mid<00:01:50.310> station<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.909> our

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
thousand feet to the mid station of our

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.179 
thousand feet to the mid station of our
Mountain<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.140> they'll<00:01:52.409> traverse<00:01:52.829> over

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Mountain and then they'll traverse over

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.510 
Mountain and then they'll traverse over
and<00:01:53.399> do<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.329> start<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.840> kamikaze<00:01:55.439> too<00:01:55.740> so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and do the start and do kamikaze too so
