00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.660 
panel the pr 24 Public Relation was 24
inches<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:50.300> bit<00:02:50.630> more<00:02:50.870> flexible<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.550> it

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
inches is a bit more flexible it but it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.070 
inches is a bit more flexible it but it
will<00:02:52.820> not<00:02:53.000> break<00:02:53.240> any<00:02:53.480> bones

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
will not break any bones

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.530 
will not break any bones
generally<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.250> will<00:02:55.400> not<00:02:55.580> break<00:02:55.790> any<00:02:56.210> hands

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
generally it will not break any hands

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.620 
generally it will not break any hands
and<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.380> can<00:02:57.650> now<00:02:57.860> use<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.340> for<00:02:58.370> other<00:02:59.270> areas

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
and you can now use it for other areas

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.000 
and you can now use it for other areas
like<00:03:00.700> striking<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.820> sciatic<00:03:02.330> nerve<00:03:02.570> right<00:03:03.230> or

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
like striking the sciatic nerve right or

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.670 
like striking the sciatic nerve right or
striking<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.730> arm<00:03:04.940> here<00:03:05.470> okay

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
striking the arm here okay

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.510 
striking the arm here okay
chances<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.550> if<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.120> do<00:03:08.330> strike<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:09.620> body<00:03:10.220> part

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
chances are if you do strike a body part

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.090 
chances are if you do strike a body part
and<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.820> does<00:03:11.030> skip<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:12.170> will<00:03:12.410> not<00:03:12.620> carve<00:03:12.890> any

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
and it does skip it will not carve any

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.440 
and it does skip it will not carve any
brain<00:03:13.400> damage<00:03:13.430> or<00:03:14.709> compromised<00:03:16.090> your<00:03:17.090> skull

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
part of this baton is what at the end

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.250 
part of this baton is what at the end
okay<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:30.709> is<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.010> bright<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.550> time<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:32.260> bit

okay this is the bright of a time a bit

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.320 
okay this is the bright of a time a bit
longer<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:34.100> made<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.550> same<00:03:34.730> material<00:03:35.239> is

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
longer but made of the same material is

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.440 
longer but made of the same material is
the<00:03:35.420> pr<00:03:35.660> 24<00:03:36.290> never<00:03:37.220> intertwine<00:03:38.209> your<00:03:38.239> fingers

right these other rubber batons are a

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.810 
right these other rubber batons are a
little<00:04:19.060> bit<00:04:19.209> more<00:04:19.470> skinnier<00:04:20.470> right<00:04:21.370> they

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
little bit more skinnier right they

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.540 
little bit more skinnier right they
actually<00:04:22.380> leave<00:04:23.380> more<00:04:23.620> bruising<00:04:24.130> because<00:04:24.280> you

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
actually leave more bruising because you

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.879 
actually leave more bruising because you
have<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:24.970> smaller<00:04:25.570> surface<00:04:25.960> area<00:04:26.350> so<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.710> can

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
have a smaller surface area so you can

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.370 
have a smaller surface area so you can
concentrate<00:04:27.340> a<00:04:27.580> lot<00:04:27.880> more<00:04:28.180> energy<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:29.050> a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
concentrate a lot more energy and a

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.060 
concentrate a lot more energy and a
smaller<00:04:29.740> surface<00:04:30.130> area<00:04:30.520> as<00:04:31.090> opposed<00:04:31.630> to

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
smaller surface area as opposed to
