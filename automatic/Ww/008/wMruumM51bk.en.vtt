him a lot of credit I don't think they

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.229 
him a lot of credit I don't think they
fully<00:00:45.780> understand<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.250> done<00:00:47.489> well<00:00:48.210> I

let's<00:00:52.530> face<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.100> don't<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.489> we'd<00:00:53.610> have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
let's face it I don't think we'd have

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.940 
let's face it I don't think we'd have
triple-a<00:00:54.210> baseball<00:00:54.450> I<00:00:54.989> don't<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.770> we'd

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
triple-a baseball I don't think we'd

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.860 
triple-a baseball I don't think we'd
have<00:00:56.010> hockey<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.089> we<00:00:57.420> wouldn't<00:00:57.720> have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
have hockey and I know we wouldn't have

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.320 
have hockey and I know we wouldn't have
basketball<00:00:58.409> if<00:00:58.920> he<00:00:59.280> hadn't<00:00:59.580> stepped<00:00:59.610> up<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
basketball if he hadn't stepped up and

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.660 
basketball if he hadn't stepped up and
put<00:01:00.690> his<00:01:00.839> money<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.379> his<00:01:01.500> reputation<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.519> his

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
put his money and his reputation and his

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.119 
put his money and his reputation and his
expertise<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:04.140> line<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.980> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
expertise on the line I think it's that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.970 
expertise on the line I think it's that
simple<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.720> sports<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.530> Utah

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980

professional sports you have to think

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.070 
professional sports you have to think
