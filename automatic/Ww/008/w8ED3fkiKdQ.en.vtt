00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.160 

this<00:00:03.090> week<00:00:03.270> we're<00:00:03.420> looking<00:00:03.449> at<00:00:03.720> brake<00:00:03.990> light

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
this week we're looking at brake light

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.139 
this week we're looking at brake light
problems<00:00:04.590> on<00:00:04.740> cars<00:00:05.010> because<00:00:05.640> every<00:00:06.000> month

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
problems on cars because every month

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:08.030 
problems on cars because every month
hundreds<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.630> accidents<00:00:07.050> are<00:00:07.109> caused<00:00:07.319> by<00:00:07.349> them

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
hundreds of accidents are caused by them

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.860 
hundreds of accidents are caused by them
not<00:00:08.160> operating<00:00:08.580> correctly<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:09.570> there's

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
not operating correctly now there's

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.060 
not operating correctly now there's
three<00:00:09.990> main<00:00:10.169> problems<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.650> brake<00:00:10.860> lights

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
three main problems with brake lights

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.369 
three main problems with brake lights
the<00:00:11.339> either<00:00:11.459> don't<00:00:11.730> work<00:00:11.879> at<00:00:12.030> all<00:00:12.240> they<00:00:13.110> stay

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
the either don't work at all they stay

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.829 
the either don't work at all they stay
on<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.009> time<00:00:14.280> or<00:00:14.579> they<00:00:15.209> operate<00:00:15.539> sort<00:00:15.749> of

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
on all the time or they operate sort of

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
on all the time or they operate sort of
dimly<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.560> can't<00:00:16.800> tell<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> difference

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
dimly so you can't tell the difference

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.770 
dimly so you can't tell the difference
between<00:00:17.460> your<00:00:17.670> brake<00:00:17.910> lights<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.360> your

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
between your brake lights and your

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.900 
between your brake lights and your
actual<00:00:19.020> taillights<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:20.610> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.790> show

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
actual taillights so I'm going to show

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.570 
actual taillights so I'm going to show
you<00:00:20.970> hopefully<00:00:21.650> what<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> problems<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.220> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
you hopefully what the problems are and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.010 
you hopefully what the problems are and
maybe<00:00:23.790> so<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.360> got<00:00:24.510> fixing<00:00:24.900> them

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
maybe so you can have a got fixing them

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.110 
maybe so you can have a got fixing them
at<00:00:25.110> home<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.440> your<00:00:25.530> own<00:00:25.590> car<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.850> the<00:00:26.940> first

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
at home on your own car so the first

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.190 
at home on your own car so the first
thing<00:00:27.270> I'm<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.600> is<00:00:27.720> assume<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
thing I'm going to do is assume that the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.050 
thing I'm going to do is assume that the
brake<00:00:28.380> lights<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.800> not<00:00:29.070> working<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.610> all<00:00:29.790> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
brake lights are not working at all and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.500 
brake lights are not working at all and
so<00:00:30.600> we<00:00:30.690> look<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> back<00:00:31.260> remove<00:00:31.950> the<00:00:32.510> bulb

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so we look in the back remove the bulb

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.689 
so we look in the back remove the bulb
from<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:34.079> holder<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> look<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.579> it

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
from the holder and have a look at it

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.239 
from the holder and have a look at it
and<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.120> check<00:00:36.359> the<00:00:36.480> filament<00:00:36.839> inside<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:38.070> see

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
and we check the filament inside to see

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:39.709 
and we check the filament inside to see
if<00:00:38.429> it<00:00:38.550> looks<00:00:38.760> okay<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.300> does<00:00:39.449> in<00:00:39.600> this

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
if it looks okay and it does in this

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.709 
if it looks okay and it does in this
case<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.429> next<00:00:41.579> thing<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.089> is<00:00:42.329> we

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
case so the next thing we do is we

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.389 
case so the next thing we do is we
actually<00:00:42.839> check<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.499> simple<00:00:43.980> test<00:00:44.190> light

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
actually check with a simple test light

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.880 
actually check with a simple test light
to<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.390> we've<00:00:45.539> got<00:00:45.570> power<00:00:45.960> coming<00:00:46.559> through

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to see if we've got power coming through

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.209 
to see if we've got power coming through
to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> ball<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:48.530> while<00:00:49.530> we're<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.920> here

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to the ball here while we're in here

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.919 
to the ball here while we're in here
we're<00:00:50.550> also<00:00:50.730> checking<00:00:50.969> multi<00:00:51.480> plugs<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
we're also checking multi plugs and

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.139 
we're also checking multi plugs and
wires<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.440> make<00:00:52.469> sure<00:00:52.800> we've<00:00:52.979> got<00:00:53.149> no

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
wires to make sure we've got no

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.969 
wires to make sure we've got no
corrosion<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.929> good<00:00:55.170> connections<00:00:55.679> there

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
corrosion and good connections there

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.130 
corrosion and good connections there
because<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.339> can<00:00:56.729> be<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> problem<00:00:57.269> if<00:00:57.420> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
because that can be a problem if we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
because that can be a problem if we
think<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.499> sound<00:00:58.769> is<00:00:58.890> okay<00:00:59.309> we're<00:00:59.670> then

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
think that sound is okay we're then

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.250 
think that sound is okay we're then
going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> move<00:01:00.059> inside<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.510> vehicle<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
going to move inside the vehicle and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.869 
going to move inside the vehicle and
have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> look<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> brake<00:01:02.339> pedal<00:01:02.699> where

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have a look down the brake pedal where

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
have a look down the brake pedal where
we've<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> brake<00:01:03.449> light<00:01:03.629> switch<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
we've got the brake light switch and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.840 
we've got the brake light switch and
then<00:01:05.040> we're<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> check<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.640> sure

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
then we're going to check to make sure

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.880 
then we're going to check to make sure
that's<00:01:05.969> connected<00:01:06.509> and<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.079> operated<00:01:07.530> okay

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that's connected and it's operated okay

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
that's connected and it's operated okay
so<00:01:08.250> we'll<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> look<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:08.759> there<00:01:12.049> now<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so we'll have a look at there now the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.870 
so we'll have a look at there now the
next<00:01:13.380> part<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> testing<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.280> inside<00:01:14.579> here

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
next part of the testing is inside here

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
next part of the testing is inside here
on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> pedal<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> brake<00:01:16.530> pedal<00:01:16.799> we've<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.039> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
on the pedal the brake pedal we've got a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.889 
on the pedal the brake pedal we've got a
little<00:01:17.369> switch<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.149> removed<00:01:18.450> but

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
little switch which I have removed but

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.330 
little switch which I have removed but
before<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> removed<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.740> made<00:01:20.009> sure<00:01:20.189> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
before I removed it and made sure that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.560 
before I removed it and made sure that
the<00:01:20.460> wires<00:01:20.670> were<00:01:20.909> connected<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the wires were connected to the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.569 
the wires were connected to the
terminals<00:01:22.049> when<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> test<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> with

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
terminals when I'm going to test it with

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.730 
terminals when I'm going to test it with
a<00:01:23.640> simple<00:01:24.240> multimeter<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.469> we're<00:01:25.619> checking

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
a simple multimeter and we're checking

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
a simple multimeter and we're checking
it<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.189> continuity<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.479> them

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it just for continuity with them

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.899 
it just for continuity with them
connected<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.320> seeing<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.579> reading

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
connected and seeing if we get reading

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.849 
connected and seeing if we get reading
or<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.210> yeah<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.990> load<00:01:31.170> right<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
or not yeah it's a load right or it

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.730 
or not yeah it's a load right or it
isn't<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> okay<00:01:33.719> in<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.930> case<00:01:34.109> it<00:01:34.289> is<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
isn't if it is okay in this case it is I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.260 
isn't if it is okay in this case it is I
can<00:01:34.950> refit<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.490> make<00:01:35.700> sure<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> wires<00:01:36.119> are

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can refit that make sure the wires are

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.940 
can refit that make sure the wires are
connected<00:01:36.329> back<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> check

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
connected back up and then go and check

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.469 
connected back up and then go and check
the<00:01:38.039> fuses<00:01:38.460> under<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> bonnet<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.299> there

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the fuses under the bonnet see if there

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.819 
the fuses under the bonnet see if there
are<00:01:39.509> any<00:01:39.600> blown<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:40.710> going

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
are any blown so that's what we're going

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.690 
are any blown so that's what we're going
to<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.039> now<00:01:42.979> now<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.039> fuses<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.579> we're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to do now now the fuses that we're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.580 
to do now now the fuses that we're
looking<00:01:44.789> at<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.600> car<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:46.320> under<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
looking at on this car are under the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.560 
looking at on this car are under the
bonnet<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.609> some<00:01:47.850> cars<00:01:48.090> maybe<00:01:48.390> they

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
bonnet and but on some cars maybe they

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.380 
bonnet and but on some cars maybe they
don't<00:01:48.719> want<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.079> own<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:50.189> are<00:01:50.219> inside<00:01:50.850> maybe

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
don't want you own they are inside maybe

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
don't want you own they are inside maybe
under<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> dashboard<00:01:51.840> somewhere<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.649> fuse<00:01:53.219> box

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
under the dashboard somewhere a fuse box

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.980 
under the dashboard somewhere a fuse box
over<00:01:53.670> here<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.359> we're<00:01:54.479> looking<00:01:54.719> for<00:01:54.750> is

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
over here and what we're looking for is

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
over here and what we're looking for is
basically<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.469> fuse<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:55.979> blown<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
basically a fuse that's blown and you

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.550 
basically a fuse that's blown and you
can<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.149> these<00:01:57.810> fuses<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
can see on these fuses they have a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.830 
can see on these fuses they have a
little<00:01:58.829> element<00:01:59.189> inside<00:01:59.640> that<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.630> see

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
little element inside that you can see

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.200 
little element inside that you can see
when<00:02:00.990> they're<00:02:01.079> okay<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.679> that<00:02:01.770> blows<00:02:02.210> when

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
when they're okay and that blows when

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.330 
when they're okay and that blows when
there's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> fault<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> circuit<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:04.590> if

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
there's a fault on the circuit now if

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.889 
there's a fault on the circuit now if
you<00:02:05.520> check<00:02:05.759> all<00:02:05.909> your<00:02:05.939> fuses<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.780> either

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
you check all your fuses and you either

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.169 
you check all your fuses and you either
replace<00:02:07.320> them<00:02:07.619> or<00:02:07.799> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
replace them or you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.149 
replace them or you
found<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:09.959> they're<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.200> okay<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.920> break

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
found that they're all okay you break

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.190 
found that they're all okay you break
