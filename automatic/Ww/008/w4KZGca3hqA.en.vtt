and he's got a nice little wave of again
more<00:02:09.950> part<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.250> nice<00:02:10.459> sort<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.620> particle

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
more part of nice sort of particle

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.380 
more part of nice sort of particle
effects<00:02:12.860> around<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.310> particularly<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.240> it

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
effects around that particularly like it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.150 
effects around that particularly like it
it<00:02:14.569> works<00:02:14.720> great<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.020> combos<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:16.010> see

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
it works great in combos you can see

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.400 
it works great in combos you can see
it's<00:02:16.340> easily<00:02:16.910> landed<00:02:17.300> after<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.569> TX<00:02:17.900> pin<00:02:18.170> kick

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's easily landed after a TX pin kick

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.130 
it's easily landed after a TX pin kick
so<00:02:19.130> he's<00:02:19.310> got<00:02:19.520> good<00:02:19.760> good<00:02:20.480> options<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:20.959> that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
so he's got good good options on that

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.710 
so he's got good good options on that
and<00:02:21.380> basically<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.760> far<00:02:23.030> as<00:02:23.150> overall<00:02:23.270> play

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and basically as far as overall play

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
basically owns the entire bottom space

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.970 
basically owns the entire bottom space
of<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.130> ground<00:02:28.340> here<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.440> air<00:02:30.590> look

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
of the ground here so in the air look

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
even t-hawk who can dive in at him will

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.550 
even t-hawk who can dive in at him will
be<00:02:34.940> able<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.120> give<00:02:35.270> DJ<00:02:35.450> some<00:02:35.720> trouble<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:36.470> as

far<00:02:36.709> as<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.980> basic<00:02:37.340> bottom<00:02:38.030> part<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
far as the basic bottom part of the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.590 
far as the basic bottom part of the
screen<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:39.130> vijay's<00:02:40.130> going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> own<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.730> so

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
screen here vijay's going to own that so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.030 
screen here vijay's going to own that so
yeah<00:02:41.900> where<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.170> might<00:02:42.380> want<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.620> take<00:02:42.709> out<00:02:42.860> DJ

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
yeah where you might want to take out DJ

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.660 
yeah where you might want to take out DJ
so<00:02:43.220> we<00:02:43.430> get<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> third<00:02:43.850> round<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.410> action<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:46.160> DJ

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
so we get a third round of action but DJ

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.060 
so we get a third round of action but DJ
with<00:02:47.060> his<00:02:47.450> combination<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.200> fast<00:02:48.440> max<00:02:48.800> outs

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
with his combination of fast max outs

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.210 
with his combination of fast max outs
and<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:50.000> sohbat<00:02:50.330> kicks<00:02:50.660> really<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.620> effective

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and the sohbat kicks really is effective

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.970 
and the sohbat kicks really is effective
at<00:02:52.400> long<00:02:52.880> range<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.420> effective<00:02:53.959> at<00:02:54.500> medium

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
at long range is effective at medium

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.040 
at long range is effective at medium
range<00:02:55.010> up<00:02:55.550> close<00:02:55.880> he's<00:02:56.120> still<00:02:56.390> got<00:02:56.540> good<00:02:56.750> combo

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
range up close he's still got good combo

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.440 
range up close he's still got good combo
potential<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:58.730> his<00:02:58.850> only<00:02:58.970> weakness<00:02:59.239> is

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
potential so really his only weakness is

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.090 
potential so really his only weakness is
in<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.750> air<00:02:59.900> his<00:03:00.200> air<00:03:00.470> moves<00:03:00.680> are<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.890> little

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
in the air his air moves are a little

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.600 
in the air his air moves are a little
slower<00:03:01.340> his<00:03:01.910> jump<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.360> not<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.690> best<00:03:02.900> but<00:03:03.830> as

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
slower his jump is not the best but as

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.090 
slower his jump is not the best but as
far<00:03:04.790> as<00:03:04.850> like<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.300> horizontal<00:03:05.930> range<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:07.010> the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
far as like the horizontal range of the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.699 
far as like the horizontal range of the
screen<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.700> space<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.000> uh<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.810> DJ's

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
screen this space is uh is DJ's

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.259 
screen this space is uh is DJ's
playground<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.370> he<00:03:10.519> really<00:03:10.640> controls<00:03:11.120> that

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
playground so he really controls that

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.270 
playground so he really controls that
space<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.900> you'll<00:03:12.530> probably<00:03:12.799> have<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.160> be

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
space and you'll probably have to be

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.400 
space and you'll probably have to be
doing<00:03:13.459> some<00:03:13.700> jumping<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.360> new<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.900> damage<00:03:15.230> to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
doing some jumping to a new to damage to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.979 
doing some jumping to a new to damage to
DJ<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.549> that's<00:03:17.030> him<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.360> nutshell<00:03:17.540> let's<00:03:17.870> see

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
DJ so that's him in a nutshell let's see

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.140 
DJ so that's him in a nutshell let's see
if<00:03:18.049> we<00:03:18.140> can<00:03:18.290> get<00:03:18.410> maybe<00:03:18.980> DJ<00:03:19.340> super<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:19.910> here

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
if we can get maybe DJ super on here

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.210 
if we can get maybe DJ super on here
he's<00:03:21.110> building<00:03:21.440> up<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.560> little<00:03:21.739> super<00:03:22.040> meter

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
he's building up a little super meter

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.740 
he's building up a little super meter
leave<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:23.000> super<00:03:23.390> is<00:03:25.150> also<00:03:26.150> pretty<00:03:26.299> versatile

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
leave is super is also pretty versatile

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.229 
leave is super is also pretty versatile
maybe<00:03:26.989> get<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.230> couple<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.590> DJ's<00:03:27.860> throws<00:03:28.239> or

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
maybe get a couple of DJ's throws or

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.770 
maybe get a couple of DJ's throws or
maybe<00:03:29.900> he's<00:03:30.049> going<00:03:30.200> to

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
maybe he's going to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.420 
maybe he's going to
with<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.410> forward<00:03:32.770> flip<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.250> i<00:03:33.490> didn't<00:03:33.700> get

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
with the forward flip and i didn't get

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.590 
with the forward flip and i didn't get
