00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.570
 widely aquarium life is 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.680
 and the opportunity I have not been used 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.359
 are hardly gotten 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.749
 I still ask myself 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.989
 to have short 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.589
 pretty good one up in the base no one can care much about the head 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.080
 being kids 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 first on the two 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.480
 Zurich liver as the only thing done back in March 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.980
 almost 500 Uli in purchase 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.550
 okay we have the construction 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879
 because I quit nobody 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.979
 they became quiet 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.219
 Not 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.919
 I'm going from that 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.429
 as a child he was often too much won 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.789
 we just make it 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.869
 because the four guys do not have to explain 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.539
 important is 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.539
 therefore limited to test 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.309
 more head on the 1 one 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.309
 Boonen's team Pletscher Schlei 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.129
 big machines for shortening 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.179
 frozen 200000 250 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
 the perfection 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.960
 I still have my aunt a bit 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.509
 have just said said thousandth 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.689
 Kylie I could fix myself back 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.710
 although I do not need it 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.270
 we have it as fair 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.520
 we have enough gold for our times 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.469
 9 13 21 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.949
 while not leaving 65 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.839
 1800 TI 30 tourists 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.839
 around 3800 lives 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.900
 that it is a dangerous mixture 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.050
 Let's have a look at the clock Korbach 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.669
 53 minutes as already 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.449
 and she's playing 70's food i mean it's not all that good now 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.469
 Has 13 dead 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.469
 but you also have to worry about it being 1 17 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.819
 and partly because as a child here losers brazen 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.789
 Imports itself first 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.789
 but sometimes electricity is convenient 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.150
 and so on with bold letters 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.379
 could come to this 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.339
 okay we have not won yet 10 s Sebastiano the steering shows up 

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.659
 Let's go CSR 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.659
 the last instance 

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:43.889
 I thank you for looking 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:48.030
 I'm sure the fewest cylinders looked or Fox Polo as he too long 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.499
 it takes just nothing to do 

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:53.859
 and the hand that was expected in the coming days 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.990
 and yes we look at each other 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.759
 best german
