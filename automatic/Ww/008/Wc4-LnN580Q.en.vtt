00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
actually a little trick I picked up a

of grated cheese on the bottom of a
baking<00:01:36.470> pie<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:38.420> actually<00:01:38.899> create<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> seal

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009

that<00:01:40.759> stops<00:01:41.090> anything<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.690> goes<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:41.989> top<00:01:42.229> of

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
that stops anything that goes on top of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.410

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
little pieces so we're just evenly

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.800 
little pieces so we're just evenly
distributed<00:02:10.750> fairly<00:02:11.750> simply<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:14.690> is

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
distributed fairly simply so this is

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.280

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.790 

making<00:03:31.680> sure<00:03:31.740> we<00:03:31.950> cover<00:03:32.220> those<00:03:32.400> gaps<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.800> we

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
making sure we cover those gaps and we

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.250 
making sure we cover those gaps and we
just<00:03:35.010> press<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.000> edge<00:03:36.150> around<00:03:36.510> with<00:03:37.080> your

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
just press the edge around with your

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.330 
just press the edge around with your
thumbs<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:39.780> seal<00:03:40.500> those<00:03:40.710> two<00:03:40.980> pieces<00:03:41.310> of

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
thumbs just to seal those two pieces of

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.840 
thumbs just to seal those two pieces of
pastry<00:03:41.610> together<00:03:42.800> that's<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.920> way<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:46.850> we're

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
pastry together that's the way and we're

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.090 
pastry together that's the way and we're
just<00:03:47.970> going<00:03:48.210> to<00:03:48.390> trim<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.470> excess<00:03:49.590> pastry

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
just going to trim the excess pastry

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.070 
just going to trim the excess pastry
from<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.640> side<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:56.390> just<00:03:57.390> using<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.780> fork

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
from the side and just using a fork

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.170 
from the side and just using a fork
we're<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:58.860> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.190> press<00:03:59.670> around<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
we're just going to press around the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.510 
we're just going to press around the
edge<00:04:00.470> to<00:04:01.470> create<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.830> little<00:04:01.890> pattern<00:04:02.400> this

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
edge to create a little pattern this

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.260 
edge to create a little pattern this
also<00:04:02.760> helps<00:04:03.210> to<00:04:03.330> seal<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:05.040> just<00:04:05.370> all<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
also helps to seal it so just all the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.770 
also helps to seal it so just all the
way<00:04:06.360> around<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.750> edge<00:04:08.240> I'm<00:04:09.240> just<00:04:09.450> using<00:04:09.600> a

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
way around the edge I'm just using a

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.620 
way around the edge I'm just using a
knife<00:04:09.990> just<00:04:10.640> poke<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> little<00:04:11.820> hole<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.540> the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
knife just poke a little hole in the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.449 
knife just poke a little hole in the
middle<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:13.770> allows<00:04:14.070> any<00:04:14.340> excess<00:04:15.180> air<00:04:15.390> to

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
middle this allows any excess air to

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.720 
middle this allows any excess air to
escape<00:04:17.459> out<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.860> we're<00:04:19.860> just<00:04:20.040> going<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.489> brush

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
escape out and we're just going to brush

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.650 
escape out and we're just going to brush
the<00:04:20.970> top<00:04:21.180> of<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.420> pie<00:04:21.650> with<00:04:22.650> one<00:04:22.920> beaten<00:04:23.340> egg

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
the top of the pie with one beaten egg

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.760 
the top of the pie with one beaten egg
this<00:04:24.660> just<00:04:24.930> helps<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.230> make<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.590> nice<00:04:25.740> and

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
this just helps to make it nice and

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.200 
this just helps to make it nice and
golden<00:04:27.530> make<00:04:28.530> sure<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.800> get<00:04:28.890> all<00:04:29.040> those<00:04:29.160> edges

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.290 

and<00:04:34.250> that's<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.520> basically<00:04:35.730> we're<00:04:36.150> just<00:04:36.180> going

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
this on the side for about 15-20 minutes

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.470 
this on the side for about 15-20 minutes
to<00:05:01.530> cool<00:05:01.740> as<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.250> inside<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.790> still<00:05:02.910> cooking

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
to cool as the inside is still cooking

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.390
