flipping<00:01:15.900> items<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> becoming<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.520> little

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
flipping items is becoming a little

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
flipping items is becoming a little
easier<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.470> runescape<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.790> mean<00:01:21.680> like<00:01:22.680> four

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
easier on runescape now I mean like four

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
easier on runescape now I mean like four
months<00:01:23.369> ago<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.409> risk

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
months ago it was really kind of risk

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030 
months ago it was really kind of risk
but<00:01:26.100> now<00:01:26.310> flipping<00:01:26.790> items<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.570> eat<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
but now flipping items is eat it's a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
but now flipping items is eat it's a
little<00:01:29.159> easier<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.299> more<00:01:30.390> stable<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:31.020> my

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
little easier and more stable in my

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.050 
little easier and more stable in my
opinion<00:01:31.500> well<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.549> again<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> really

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
opinion well then again it really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
opinion well then again it really
depends<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.659> items<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> use<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.740> you're

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
depends what items you use if you're

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.670 
depends what items you use if you're
using<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.700> item<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.540> fucking<00:01:37.079> crashing

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
