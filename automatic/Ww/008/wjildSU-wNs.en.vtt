00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
inch Hampton Bay Huntington fan with a

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.990 
inch Hampton Bay Huntington fan with a
gilded<00:01:36.440> mahogany<00:01:37.010> finish<00:01:37.370> I<00:01:37.730> believe

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
gilded mahogany finish I believe

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.120 
gilded mahogany finish I believe
something<00:01:38.390> something<00:01:39.110> close<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.770> that

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
something something close to that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.960 
something something close to that
um<00:01:40.930> but<00:01:41.930> it's<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.710> puts<00:01:43.070> on<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.220> ton<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.460> air<00:01:43.700> I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
um but it's a puts on a ton of air I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.090 
um but it's a puts on a ton of air I
think<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.810> most<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.409> Huntington<00:01:45.830> pants

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
think that most of the Huntington pants

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.820 
think that most of the Huntington pants
husband<00:01:47.090> collection<00:01:47.510> pants<00:01:47.840> without<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.560> ton

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
husband collection pants without a ton

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.630 
husband collection pants without a ton
of<00:01:48.860> air<00:01:49.360> um<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.140> that's<00:01:51.320> that's<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.190> on<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:54.640> I

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
of air um so that's that's it on and I

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.580 
of air um so that's that's it on and I
guess<00:01:56.120> that's<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.540> for<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.720> fan<00:01:57.020> out<00:01:57.050> here<00:01:57.500> in

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
guess that's it for that fan out here in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.200 
guess that's it for that fan out here in
our<00:01:57.680> barbecue<00:01:58.100> area<00:01:58.400> we<00:01:58.640> have<00:01:58.850> our<00:01:59.530> 52<00:02:00.530> inch

quick-connect<00:04:23.540> but<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.810> looks<00:04:23.960> very<00:04:24.020> similar

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
quick-connect but it looks very similar

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.270 
quick-connect but it looks very similar
to<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.860> fan<00:04:25.690> but<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:27.020> does<00:04:27.350> move<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.710> quite<00:04:28.250> a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
to this fan but it does move a quite a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.890 
to this fan but it does move a quite a
lot<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.490> air<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.850> this<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.150> really<00:04:29.360> our<00:04:29.600> only

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
lot of air and this is really our only

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.600 
lot of air and this is really our only
fan<00:04:30.229> I<00:04:30.260> think<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.770> house<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.160> does<00:04:31.400> not

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
fan I think in the house that does not

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.300 
fan I think in the house that does not
wobble<00:04:31.880> at<00:04:32.240> all<00:04:32.449> so<00:04:33.260> let<00:04:33.410> me<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:33.590> turn<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.919> huh

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.159 

yeah<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.610> is<00:04:38.090> on<00:04:38.330> low<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:38.780> it's<00:04:38.900> not<00:04:38.990> moving

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
yeah it is on low so it's not moving

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.320 
yeah it is on low so it's not moving
that<00:04:39.410> fast<00:04:39.590> but<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.130> does<00:04:40.310> move<00:04:40.580> quite<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> lot

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
that fast but it does move quite a lot

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.540 
that fast but it does move quite a lot
of<00:04:41.419> air<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.810> know<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.860> looks<00:04:43.010> really<00:04:43.220> good<00:04:43.340> but

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
of air you know it looks really good but

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.250 
of air you know it looks really good but
this<00:04:43.639> room's<00:04:43.910> with<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.330> dark<00:04:44.540> ceiling<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.139> it

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
this room's with the dark ceiling so it

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.689 
this room's with the dark ceiling so it
kind<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.410> blends<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:45.889> almost<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.520> it's<00:04:46.669> not

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
kind of blends in almost like it's not

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.240 
kind of blends in almost like it's not
even<00:04:46.880> there

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
even there

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.340 
even there
and<00:04:49.250> I've<00:04:49.970> actually<00:04:50.120> never<00:04:50.330> seen<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:50.870> fan<00:04:51.199> in

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
and I've actually never seen this fan in

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.840 
and I've actually never seen this fan in
a<00:04:51.410> residence<00:04:51.800> before<00:04:52.130> most<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.460> them<00:04:52.580> seem<00:04:52.820> to

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
a residence before most of them seem to

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.060 
a residence before most of them seem to
be<00:04:53.000> in<00:04:53.120> commercial<00:04:53.539> areas<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:54.380> that's

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
be in commercial areas so that's

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.850 
be in commercial areas so that's
probably<00:04:55.340> why<00:04:55.699> it's<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.030> reliable<00:04:56.570> in<00:04:56.780> such<00:04:57.770> a

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
probably why it's so reliable in such a

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.750 
probably why it's so reliable in such a
good<00:04:58.010> tank<00:04:58.660> okay<00:04:59.690> Oh<00:04:59.840> in<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.830> office<00:05:01.250> we<00:05:01.490> have

complement<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.300> fan<00:05:32.510> nicely<00:05:33.010> um<00:05:34.039> let's<00:05:34.430> from

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
complement the fan nicely um let's from

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.560 
complement the fan nicely um let's from
on<00:05:34.729> the<00:05:34.910> actual<00:05:35.419> thing<00:05:40.120> it<00:05:41.120> actually<00:05:41.240> moves

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
on the actual thing it actually moves

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.990 
on the actual thing it actually moves
quite<00:05:41.810> a<00:05:41.840> bit<00:05:41.990> of<00:05:42.080> air<00:05:42.260> in<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:44.419> room<00:05:45.490> so<00:05:46.490> I

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
quite a bit of air in the room so I

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.790 
quite a bit of air in the room so I
think<00:05:47.510> that's<00:05:47.750> pretty<00:05:47.870> much<00:05:47.990> it<00:05:48.110> for<00:05:48.410> that<00:05:48.470> end

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
think that's pretty much it for that end

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.879 
think that's pretty much it for that end
but<00:05:49.010> it's<00:05:49.130> it's<00:05:49.820> not<00:05:49.970> available<00:05:50.660> for<00:05:51.530> purchase

but it's it's not available for purchase

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.650 
but it's it's not available for purchase

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
because it was only available for a

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.629 
because it was only available for a
short<00:05:53.870> amount<00:05:53.900> of<00:05:54.110> time<00:05:54.169> like<00:05:54.500> in<00:05:54.650> 2007<00:05:55.520> or

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
short amount of time like in 2007 or

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.689 
short amount of time like in 2007 or
something<00:05:55.880> like<00:05:55.970> that<00:05:56.180> but<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.710> does<00:05:58.070> there's

another one she had that wobbled way too
much

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
much

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.929 
much
um<00:06:32.300> but<00:06:33.300> this<00:06:33.599> one<00:06:33.870> does<00:06:34.139> not<00:06:34.259> wobble<00:06:34.939> very

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:35.939 
um but this one does not wobble very

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.939 
um but this one does not wobble very
much<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.479> mean<00:06:36.509> it<00:06:37.080> may<00:06:37.229> well<00:06:37.500> just<00:06:37.650> a<00:06:37.830> little

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
much I mean it may well just a little

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.670 
much I mean it may well just a little
bit<00:06:38.189> but<00:06:38.430> it<00:06:38.550> doesn't<00:06:38.789> bubble<00:06:38.939> at<00:06:39.330> all<00:06:39.539> like<00:06:40.409> a

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
bit but it doesn't bubble at all like a

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.429 
bit but it doesn't bubble at all like a
lower<00:06:41.639> stuff<00:06:42.180> or<00:06:42.449> low<00:06:42.689> or<00:06:42.960> like<00:06:43.199> the<00:06:43.319> low

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:43.439 
lower stuff or low or like the low

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.429 
lower stuff or low or like the low
speeds<00:06:43.969> but<00:06:44.969> when<00:06:45.539> it's<00:06:45.659> moving<00:06:45.900> it<00:06:46.110> does<00:06:46.259> move

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:46.439 
speeds but when it's moving it does move

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.990 
speeds but when it's moving it does move
quite<00:06:46.680> a<00:06:46.710> lot<00:06:46.860> of<00:06:46.949> air<00:06:47.069> like<00:06:47.250> I'm<00:06:47.490> over<00:06:47.759> in<00:06:47.879> the

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
quite a lot of air like I'm over in the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.490 
quite a lot of air like I'm over in the
corner<00:06:48.300> of<00:06:48.389> the<00:06:48.509> room<00:06:48.689> and<00:06:48.900> I<00:06:48.930> could<00:06:49.110> feel<00:06:49.289> the

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
corner of the room and I could feel the

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.159 
corner of the room and I could feel the
fan<00:06:49.710> hitting<00:06:50.129> my<00:06:50.250> skin<00:06:50.520> so<00:06:51.360> this<00:06:52.020> is

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
fan hitting my skin so this is

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.170 
fan hitting my skin so this is
definitely<00:06:52.500> one<00:06:52.800> of<00:06:52.830> those<00:06:52.979> fans<00:06:53.219> where<00:06:53.460> they

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
definitely one of those fans where they

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.320 
definitely one of those fans where they
make<00:06:54.750> a<00:06:54.780> lot<00:06:55.050> of<00:06:55.080> them<00:06:55.319> it's<00:06:55.560> a<00:06:55.680> standard

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
make a lot of them it's a standard

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.760 
make a lot of them it's a standard
regular<00:06:57.330> looking<00:06:57.719> ceiling<00:06:58.259> fan<00:06:58.409> but<00:06:58.590> it's

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
regular looking ceiling fan but it's

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.189 
regular looking ceiling fan but it's
definitely<00:06:58.949> a<00:06:59.569> useful<00:07:00.569> one<00:07:00.689> that<00:07:00.900> puts<00:07:01.080> out<00:07:01.169> a

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
definitely a useful one that puts out a

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.600 
definitely a useful one that puts out a
lot<00:07:01.349> of<00:07:01.439> air<00:07:01.849> so<00:07:02.849> last<00:07:03.419> but<00:07:03.629> not<00:07:03.689> least<00:07:04.610> right

video<00:07:10.770> of<00:07:11.129> this<00:07:11.639> finished<00:07:12.060> all<00:07:12.330> by<00:07:12.659> itself<00:07:12.960> so

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
video of this finished all by itself so

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.820 
video of this finished all by itself so
this<00:07:13.830> is<00:07:13.979> the<00:07:14.099> 52<00:07:14.490> inch<00:07:14.699> hunter<00:07:15.090> Westcott<00:07:15.449> hand
