there's<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> German<00:00:37.469> engineer<00:00:38.239> that<00:00:39.239> used<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
there's a German engineer that used a

there's a German engineer that used a
couple<00:00:40.410> computers<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.190> come<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
couple computers to come up with the

way these frets are positioned and it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.350 
way these frets are positioned and it
throughs<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.680> intonation<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.729> eliminate

throughs up this intonation we eliminate

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.640 
throughs up this intonation we eliminate

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the flat flatness of these notes and so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
the flat flatness of these notes and so

traditionally sound out of tune even on
a<00:01:58.240> perfectly<00:01:58.750> tuned<00:01:59.110> guitar<00:01:59.770> on<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.670> guitar

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
a perfectly tuned guitar on this guitar

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.270 
a perfectly tuned guitar on this guitar
they<00:02:01.570> just<00:02:01.780> Sparkle<00:02:02.320> they're<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:02.860> dead<00:02:03.250> on
