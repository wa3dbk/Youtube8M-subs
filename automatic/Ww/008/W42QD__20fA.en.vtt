00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.769
 we are again 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.640
 this time 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.909
 to introduce you 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:11.099
 this little book that is therapeutic revolution of the pyramids is not 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.859
 we are in this moment 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.789
 in the clear pyramid we will go now we are in comonú 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.239
 the temple of medicine 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.459
 since here we also worked today we taught to use the 

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:23.210
 pyramids 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.470
 some of the xxi with children that we expose 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 see in all the columns you may represent them 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.879
 he there are no pyramids near this area at least 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.670
 but nevertheless 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 in this temple the temple of medicine we have actions to the pyramids on 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 we all have allusions as we see in it 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 we got that you also entered alfano options 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.370
 in this case we have the god 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.250
 percent and ibiza 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.540
 Now i search 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.750
 transmitting 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.690
 1 energy 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.920
 down the pharaoh 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.930
 We are talking 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.980
 healing 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.590
 We are talking 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.670
 medicine in what was tyranny were 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.070
 very many relationship 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.060
 this book we explain 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.780
 basically how the pyramids work without going too deep 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.560
 because da hénin 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 sacred technologies 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.030
 tactics 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.240
 in this book 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.590
 we have percent basically 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.230
 the therapeutic subject 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.770
 of the pyramids apart from other uses just discussed 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.299
 I hope percent does not happen after several years of December 2005 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 the pyramidal effect 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300
 has stopped being an album is 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.170
 known effect called pyramidal effect 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 no more pyramidal energy is given by doctors had mind 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.340
 for operator an academic showdown by physicists however 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.330
 there are currently many physicists who are working with the police 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.280
 federal 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.130
 and there's no problem in calling him that way 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.290
 in this book we propose not only the use of the pyramids the therapeutic 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.590
 mind but also we answer most of the questions that are 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.110
 do doctors and not therapists and therapists who are beginning 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.609
 to use the pyramids 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.159
 fortunately in Cuba it is already official 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.739
 in the eyes a hundred and some hospitals that the country has in all of them use 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.759
 batteries 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.179
 but obscure of Cuba by his side one two or three hundred doctors 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.570
 rich juries who have in their concept of pyramids 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.339
 and therapists possibly many more 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:38.479
 in Spain unfortunately there are very few at night 20 30 doctors 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.499
 if there are more therapists my plans 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:42.939
 and that in this book 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.749
 we put them very clearly 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.289
 doctor Julio Cesar Sosa Salinas and talks to them Gabriel Silva 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.769
 the covered so far in a simple way of course there is much more 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.189
 all books do not fit 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.189
 the problem that researchers have is that he writes to you 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.299
 it takes a while 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.199
 we perceive sometimes 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.199
 obsessed with research 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:07.899
 quite 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.809
 there he participated in tap questions answered part of everything that 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.649
 everything I know exposes 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:17.519
 so that it gives 324 pages 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 before states put 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.399
 get theory on the pyramids reads we recommend go to this book 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.989
 that is here that is where you will find the main answers 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.459
 practically four decades of work 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.379
 percent but apple
