in<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.110> me<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.410> think<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.070> think<00:03:24.000> he's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
in so I me I think is I think he's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.240 
in so I me I think is I think he's
calculated<00:03:24.780> 500<00:03:25.410> million<00:03:25.769> fishing

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
calculated 500 million fishing

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.520 
calculated 500 million fishing
experience<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.720> course<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.989> would<00:03:28.320> be

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
experience and of course that would be

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.770 
experience and of course that would be
awesome<00:03:28.830> if<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.550> was<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.880> prestige<00:03:30.239> system

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
awesome if it was in the prestige system

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.820 
awesome if it was in the prestige system
but<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.050> would<00:03:31.170> have<00:03:31.260> been<00:03:31.320> awesome<00:03:31.500> if<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
but it would have been awesome if the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.300 
but it would have been awesome if the
prestige<00:03:32.340> system<00:03:32.940> was<00:03:33.150> there<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.260> before<00:03:34.530> he

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
prestige system was there just before he

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
prestige system was there just before he
reached<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:36.570> X<00:03:36.840> amount<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.200> XP<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.459> don't

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
reached that X amount of XP so I don't

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.120

believe<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:39.720> fair<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.410> course<00:03:40.769> that's<00:03:40.890> my

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
believe it's fair of course that's my

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.440 
believe it's fair of course that's my
