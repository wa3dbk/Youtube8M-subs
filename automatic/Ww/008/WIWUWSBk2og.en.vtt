here<00:00:41.730> remember<00:00:42.510> torque<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> really

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
here remember torque is a really

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
here remember torque is a really
important<00:00:44.670> number<00:00:44.850> because<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.510> what

have<00:02:06.640> driven<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.000> vehicle<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.510> it's

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
have driven the vehicle that it's

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.970 
have driven the vehicle that it's
actually<00:02:08.050> quieter<00:02:08.680> than<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.700> gasoline<00:02:10.300> vehicle

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
actually quieter than a gasoline vehicle

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.670 
actually quieter than a gasoline vehicle
it's<00:02:11.980> also<00:02:12.160> not<00:02:12.850> smelly<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:14.020> Diesel's<00:02:14.440> used

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
it's also not smelly like Diesel's used

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.220 
it's also not smelly like Diesel's used
to<00:02:14.860> be<00:02:14.980> there's<00:02:15.640> no<00:02:15.790> slack<00:02:16.360> smoke<00:02:16.750> coming<00:02:17.140> out

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
to be there's no slack smoke coming out

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.140 
to be there's no slack smoke coming out
of<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.440> back<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.890> that's<00:02:18.070> because<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
of the back and that's because we have a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150 
of the back and that's because we have a
diesel<00:02:19.510> exhaust<00:02:19.810> filter<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.710> vehicle

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
diesel exhaust filter on this vehicle

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.430 
diesel exhaust filter on this vehicle
and<00:02:21.490> what<00:02:21.730> that's<00:02:21.940> designed<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.450> do<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.870> clean

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
and what that's designed to do is clean

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.200 
and what that's designed to do is clean
out<00:02:23.620> all<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.070> soot<00:02:24.430> from<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.600> filter<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:28.030> that

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
out all the soot from the filter so that

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.560 
out all the soot from the filter so that
makes<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.690> much<00:02:29.140> less<00:02:29.670> stinky<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.060> much<00:02:31.360> less

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
makes it much less stinky and much less

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.780 
makes it much less stinky and much less
dirty<00:02:31.840> than<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.410> diesels<00:02:32.740> that<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.070> maybe

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
dirty than the diesels that you maybe

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.420 
dirty than the diesels that you maybe
knew<00:02:34.209> about<00:02:34.330> at<00:02:34.630> one<00:02:34.810> point<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:36.310> other

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
knew about at one point the other

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.740 
knew about at one point the other
advantage<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.360> diesel<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.420> said<00:02:40.630> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
advantage of a diesel is as I said the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.080 
advantage of a diesel is as I said the
fuel<00:02:41.050> economy<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:42.100> some<00:02:42.340> people<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:42.700> also

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
fuel economy but some people will also

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.970 
fuel economy but some people will also
ask<00:02:43.240> me<00:02:43.420> what<00:02:44.110> about<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.380> price<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.830> diesel

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
ask me what about the price of diesel

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.940 
ask me what about the price of diesel
isn't<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.490> really<00:02:45.820> expensive<00:02:46.300> well<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.709> does

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
isn't it really expensive well that does

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.290 
isn't it really expensive well that does
depend<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.490> market<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.030> live<00:02:49.270> in

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
depend on the market that you live in

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.140 
depend on the market that you live in
however<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:51.130> month<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.430> June<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.940> took<00:02:52.090> a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
however in the month of June we took a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.540 
however in the month of June we took a
look<00:02:52.330> at<00:02:52.510> what<00:02:52.620> national<00:02:53.620> average<00:02:54.010> prices

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
look at what national average prices

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.760 
look at what national average prices
were<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.750> price<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.140> diesel<00:02:56.290> actually

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
were and the price of diesel actually

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.730 
were and the price of diesel actually
came<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.280> right<00:02:57.550> in<00:02:57.700> between<00:02:58.170> regular<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.350> mid

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
came in right in between regular and mid

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.180 
came in right in between regular and mid
grade<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.730> for<00:03:00.910> those<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.209> drivers<00:03:01.780> who

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
grade so for those of you drivers who

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.650 
grade so for those of you drivers who
typically<00:03:03.190> put<00:03:03.400> premium<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:04.150> your<00:03:04.300> vehicle

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
typically put premium in your vehicle

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.240 
typically put premium in your vehicle
you're<00:03:04.810> actually<00:03:05.110> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.350> be<00:03:05.500> saving<00:03:05.980> money

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
you're actually going to be saving money

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.850 
you're actually going to be saving money
on<00:03:06.519> fuel

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
on fuel

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.920 
on fuel
all<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:08.490> let's<00:03:08.730> see<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.120> kind<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.480> pickup

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
all right let's see what kind of pickup

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.140 
all right let's see what kind of pickup
this<00:03:10.170> little<00:03:10.470> baby<00:03:10.680> has<00:03:10.980> remember<00:03:11.820> it's<00:03:11.970> all

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
this little baby has remember it's all

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.360 
this little baby has remember it's all
about<00:03:12.180> torque<00:03:12.870> here<00:03:13.170> I'm<00:03:13.770> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> punch<00:03:14.220> it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
about torque here I'm going to punch it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.220 
about torque here I'm going to punch it
now<00:03:14.550> because<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.420> want<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.720> get<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> highway

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
now because I want to get on the highway

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.980 
now because I want to get on the highway
this<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.740> also<00:03:16.890> excellent<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.580> passing

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.990 

let<00:03:25.530> him<00:03:25.680> get<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> little<00:03:26.040> distance<00:03:26.490> in<00:03:26.670> between

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
let him get a little distance in between

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.360 
let him get a little distance in between
us<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.230> we're<00:03:28.350> talking<00:03:28.470> about<00:03:28.680> torque<00:03:29.190> here

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
us so we're talking about torque here

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.520 
us so we're talking about torque here
because<00:03:29.640> that's<00:03:29.820> where<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.270> real<00:03:30.450> story<00:03:30.900> is<00:03:31.050> a

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
because that's where the real story is a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.080 
because that's where the real story is a
lot<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.070> people<00:03:32.310> ask<00:03:32.460> me<00:03:32.580> we're<00:03:32.790> gonna<00:03:32.880> what's

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
lot of people ask me we're gonna what's

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.600 
lot of people ask me we're gonna what's
the<00:03:33.180> difference<00:03:33.510> between<00:03:34.340> horsepower<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
the difference between horsepower and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.090 
the difference between horsepower and
torque<00:03:35.940> torque<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.110> actually<00:03:37.440> what<00:03:37.590> gets<00:03:37.860> you

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
torque torque is actually what gets you

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.810 
torque torque is actually what gets you
going

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
going

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.840 
going
horsepower<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:40.140> what<00:03:40.440> keeps<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.280> think

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
horsepower is what keeps you going think

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.030 
horsepower is what keeps you going think
of<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.030> bottle<00:03:42.420> when<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.020> twist<00:03:43.230> open<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.770> cap

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
of a bottle when you twist open that cap

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.270 
of a bottle when you twist open that cap
that<00:03:44.370> torque<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.210> that<00:03:45.390> initial<00:03:45.950> turn<00:03:46.950> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
that torque is that initial turn and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.220 
that torque is that initial turn and
then<00:03:47.790> horsepower<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.480> what<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.720> keep<00:03:48.840> doing

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
then horsepower is what you keep doing

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.759 
then horsepower is what you keep doing
to<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:49.860> open

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
to get it to open

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.470 
to get it to open
we're<00:03:52.189> gonna<00:03:52.280> let<00:03:52.459> myself<00:03:52.609> have<00:03:52.939> a<00:03:52.969> little<00:03:53.359> bit

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
we're gonna let myself have a little bit

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.539 
we're gonna let myself have a little bit
of<00:03:53.569> distance<00:03:53.810> between<00:03:53.930> myself<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.370> car

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
of distance between myself and the car

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.860 
of distance between myself and the car
in<00:03:55.640> front<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.879> me<00:03:55.939> because<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.180> really<00:03:56.569> want<00:03:56.750> you

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
in front of me because I really want you

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.509 
in front of me because I really want you
to<00:03:56.930> be<00:03:57.019> able<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.319> see<00:03:57.680> what<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.129> torque<00:03:58.400> is

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
to be able to see what that torque is

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.480 
to be able to see what that torque is
like<00:03:58.760> this<00:03:59.299> is<00:03:59.450> also<00:03:59.629> great<00:04:00.019> for<00:04:00.049> passing
