 in tax fraud and the other 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.670

 politicians the president otto pérez 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.100

 vice president this involved her 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.450
 she and the answer I was forceful 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.369
 by saying no then that does not tell me 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.229
 ask me why I was not the one 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.020
 I did the research and they said it 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.360
 there and it was the very strong answer 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 that there was not any kind of 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.500
 involvement the head of the commission 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.830

 guatemala cicig pointed out that the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.950
 research indicates that this structure 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.320
 was defrauding the treasury for several 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.500
 years 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.200
 in that process of building a 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.250
 investigation we finally arrived at 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.250
 unveil the from the maximum direction of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.950
 the whole organization structure and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.560
 we hope that with the procedures that 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.729
 they are still getting ahead we can 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 get a lot more information than 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.680
 allow with absolute certainty the absolute 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.440
 disarticulation of this structure the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.320
 National civil police is located 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.330

 against persons designated to belong 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.420
 to a structure of fiscal relationship and 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.980
 contraband good look what we have 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.950
 to take into consideration that once 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.170
 the first phase is exhausted and we can go 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.490
 preliminary investigation like the one 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.090
 carried out the yes yes 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:47.080

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.730
 raids of making captures follows 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 a second phase of research a lot 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.740
 deeper truth and that obviously in 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.990
 most of the cases will derive to 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.700
 other captures to other raids is 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.990
 part of all the development of the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.730
 criminal investigation

 superintendence show tributary 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.960
 that nothing the best profiles without 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.420
 But he could not know what else 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.080
 ahead they were going to get corrupted from
