00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.480
 very well and well I bring you this video 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.000
 that is teaching them some things that I 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 They sent part of the page 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 roseworld and good is showing up 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 he contacted me to see if 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.650
 I wanted to collaborate with them, sending me 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.949
 some little things that they offer 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.289
 or they sell and I accepted to bring them 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.900
 to you this option to buy them 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.230
 sell accessories makeup bags 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.390
 even clothes and shoes 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.450
 then both for gentleman and for 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.600
 lady and then they told me that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.989
 I picked some little things to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.430
 can I send them and make a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.140
 review and then I chose the little things 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.520
 so if you want to know what they are 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.730
 come into this video 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.120
 I picked up on that page the four tidbits 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.190
 first two are rings and then they 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.550
 I will teach them the first one is this 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 is here 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.530
 It is rare but at the same time is not father 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.680
 I liked it a lot 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.229
 they are the ones with the finger here 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.490
 discovered that they are not complete and therefore 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.490
 It is very good 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.560
 and I love nothing but positive there 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.240
 be careful because you can 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.189
 scrape or chop or something that is very father 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.320
 you finish in the information box I'm going 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.360
 to leave the link of all the products 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.939
 who teach in this video if you 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.380
 They want to check and good for this is the 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.340
 first thing 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.320
 the coi and then it's this child that I already 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.950
 I had seen before but I do not know why not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.070
 I had bought it and right now I 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.560
 I have it because I loved it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.759
 turned one of my favorites and it is this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.070
 scissors ring see what is 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.820
 gigantic the ring 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.990
 and it's very very nice to me I loved it 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.990
 this double ring 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.010
 and then to cost them that for us 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.810
 we have for those like me that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.829
 we have the crimes the rites because it goes 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.829
 very well and I loved this and I put it 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.709
 Saturday I do not remember yesterday and it looks very 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.040
 nice expectant those who have with 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.800
 this success but it is beautiful 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.040
 then 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.350
 I chose this bag that when I saw it I 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.440
 I fell in love with her because it's the style that 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.610
 I was looking for and it is this one that is 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.840
 here 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.840
 yes, squared 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.640
 although it widens below so what 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.260
 you can put the mixture very well and do not 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.489
 falls off 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.489
 comes with these little things 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.640
 and the sauce vÃ­ctor 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.370
 inside is very wide 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.780
 you can appreciate that it has 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.560
 the little droplet 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.970
 and I also came with this big strap 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.230
 and that is fair 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.690
 and well I loved it I really liked it 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.740
 the only one that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.640
 I did not like 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.640
 that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.790
 these cases are here the plan too 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.860
 too small and then I have a 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.730
 little fat arms then 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.490
 as it does not fit at all but it was 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.790
 good choice or good ideal that you put 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.530
 the right one then, well, well, not the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.580
 I will be able to use without any problem 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.840
 then I loved this bag this 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.680
 I think it cut like 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.390
 22 dollars between 2022 you already know the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.470
 I'm going to leave the link because 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.049
 see this product in more detail 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.959
 and then of course I'm going to use because I 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.340
 loved it and already to finish clear that 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.960
 I had to choose some makeup 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:29.070
 Well, that's what I like the most, so 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.040
 I ordered this palette that does not say name but 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.810
 according to here it says it's a beating with 28 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.810
 shadows increase their colors 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:47.340
 and well, it came with this protector 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:50.740
 inside the box and this is the palette 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.410
 it's generic does not say the name or anything 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.020
 and I loved this palette have many 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.190
 varieties of color palettes but 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.380
 This is the one that caught my attention 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.880
 because I saw colors that I use a lot 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.340
 purple gray green star and I do not know 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.940
 I loved the colors are very usable 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.940
 it's because of me 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.729
 with this see what beauty of colors 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.009
 in fact this gray that is here 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.600
 this is what he's been using since I 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.700
 it came because I loved it is 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.400
 the color in fact I bring it right now 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.940
 I do not know if it can be appreciated well 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.850
 for the lighting but I hope so and 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.370
 I love really I loved the 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.180
 shadows I'm going to make you a little 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.180
 user 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.159
 Then there are the colors 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.240
 and so they pigment 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.470
 is so precious the only thing that is 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.590
 one or another color are very very dusty 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.169
 He cited especially 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.409
 of vanilla but 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:15.229
 they are very parents as I tell them they are 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:17.779
 colors that I use quite then 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.229
