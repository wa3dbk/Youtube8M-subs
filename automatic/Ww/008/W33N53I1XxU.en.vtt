00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so this is my camera that's right but I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.530 
so this is my camera that's right but I
do<00:01:12.990> use<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.619> try<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.310> close<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
do use I try to have it as close to the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.350 
do use I try to have it as close to the
camera<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.799> possible<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.970> basically

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
camera as possible so you get basically

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
camera as possible so you get basically
the<00:01:18.479> lighting<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> view<00:01:19.950> behind<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the lighting of the view behind the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.030 
the lighting of the view behind the
camera<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.150> yes<00:01:22.110> actually<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.740> old

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
camera and yes actually a really old

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.670 
camera and yes actually a really old
lamp<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.790> course<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.479> bulb<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.990> quite<00:01:25.259> new<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
lamp of course the bulb is quite new is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580 
lamp of course the bulb is quite new is
there<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:26.670> an<00:01:26.790> LED<00:01:27.030> bulb<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> lamp

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
there it's got an LED bulb but the lamp

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.120 
there it's got an LED bulb but the lamp
itself<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.360> old<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.619> yeah<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> does

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
itself is very very old but yeah it does

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
itself is very very old but yeah it does
the<00:01:32.280> job<00:01:32.460> perfectly<00:01:32.759> because<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.689> reach

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the job perfectly because it can reach

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.440 
the job perfectly because it can reach
out<00:01:34.170> without<00:01:34.530> having<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> stand<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.180> anything

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
out without having to stand on anything

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
out without having to stand on anything
and<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.680> basically<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:39.000> behind

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and it can basically get right behind

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.230 
and it can basically get right behind
the<00:01:39.990> camera<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the camera and you can see there and it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
the camera and you can see there and it
does<00:01:42.420> make<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> big<00:01:42.960> difference<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
does make a big difference to the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
does make a big difference to the
quality<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:45.570> my<00:01:45.899> videos<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> cut<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
quality of my videos so if I cut the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.679 
quality of my videos so if I cut the
camera<00:01:49.229> view<00:01:49.439> now<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:51.030> that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
camera view now then you can see that

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.649 
camera view now then you can see that
without<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.560> lamp<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
without the lamp on if we just get a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.740 
without the lamp on if we just get a
trading<00:01:55.110> card<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:56.100> okay<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.540> then

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
trading card it's okay but it's then

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.109 
trading card it's okay but it's then
when<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.020> turn<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> lamp<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.610> see<00:01:59.820> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
when we turn the lamp on you can see it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.680 
don't have to wait the daylight
like<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.250> would<00:02:12.459> have<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.849> if<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.239> use<00:02:13.450> natural

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.199 
like I would have to if I use natural
light<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:14.739> probably<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.519> final<00:02:16.000> thing

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
light and then probably the final thing

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.130 
light and then probably the final thing
to<00:02:16.239> Joseph<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.379> my<00:02:17.709> backdrop<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.480> as<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.900> see

to Joseph is my backdrop and as you see
at<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.319> moment<00:02:20.349> we've<00:02:20.739> got<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.920> match<00:02:21.190> text

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
at the moment we've got a match text

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.759 
at the moment we've got a match text
backdrop<00:02:22.030> what<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.659> do<00:02:22.720> as<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:22.989> have<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.260> pretty

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
backdrop what I do as you have a pretty

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.250 
backdrop what I do as you have a pretty
quick<00:02:24.099> way<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.519> switching<00:02:25.269> out<00:02:25.659> the<00:02:25.690> backdrops

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
quick way of switching out the backdrops

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.530 
quick way of switching out the backdrops
and<00:02:26.500> as<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.400> see<00:02:27.459> we've<00:02:27.879> got<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.330> dry

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and as you can see we've got the a dry

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.280 
and as you can see we've got the a dry
Excel<00:02:29.670> backdrop<00:02:30.670> which<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.360> on<00:02:31.629> this<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.200> of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
Excel backdrop which is on this kind of

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.309 
Excel backdrop which is on this kind of
plank<00:02:32.680> type<00:02:33.549> thing<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.450> used<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.080> lid

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
plank type thing it used to be the lid

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.559 
plank type thing it used to be the lid
of<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:36.069> little<00:02:36.519> box<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.440> now<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.879> broke<00:02:40.090> off<00:02:40.299> and

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
of a little box but now it broke off and

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.149 
of a little box but now it broke off and
I<00:02:40.659> think<00:02:40.900> I've<00:02:41.049> found<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.319> better<00:02:41.470> use<00:02:41.769> for<00:02:41.799> it

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
I think I've found a better use for it

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.339 
I think I've found a better use for it
other<00:02:42.610> stands<00:02:43.060> against<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.690> wall<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:44.079> that

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
other stands against the wall like that

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.470 
other stands against the wall like that
by<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.530> way<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.769> match<00:02:44.950> tax<00:02:45.250> setup<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:46.209> it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
by the way the match tax setup is it

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.289 
by the way the match tax setup is it
blue<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:47.379> blue<00:02:47.650> taxable<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.090> goes

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
blue is blue taxable and so that goes

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.619 
blue is blue taxable and so that goes
against<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.989> word<00:02:50.260> like<00:02:51.129> so<00:02:51.609> and<00:02:52.329> then

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
against the word like so and then

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.920 
against the word like so and then
alright<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.650> resume<00:02:54.040> right<00:02:54.370> then<00:02:55.209> there<00:02:55.810> you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
alright that resume right then there you

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.470 
alright that resume right then there you
can<00:02:56.109> see<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.859> the<00:02:57.040> set<00:02:57.340> for<00:02:58.090> nerd<00:02:58.269> Ron

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
can see that is the set for nerd Ron

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.650 
can see that is the set for nerd Ron
exhale<00:02:58.989> video<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.129> yeah<00:03:00.579> that's<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.299> backdrop

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
exhale video so yeah that's a backdrop

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.110 
exhale video so yeah that's a backdrop
so<00:03:02.079> I'd<00:03:02.230> say<00:03:02.349> there's<00:03:02.590> three<00:03:02.799> main<00:03:03.190> stages<00:03:03.609> to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
so I'd say there's three main stages to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.150 
so I'd say there's three main stages to
me<00:03:04.239> making<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.780> my<00:03:04.810> videos<00:03:05.200> stage<00:03:05.829> one

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
me making one of my videos stage one

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.960 
me making one of my videos stage one
where<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.579> do<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.200> item<00:03:09.099> and<00:03:09.370> setting<00:03:09.879> up

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
where I do get the item and setting up

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.630 
where I do get the item and setting up
the<00:03:10.090> backdrop<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.810> everything<00:03:11.590> then<00:03:12.310> stage

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
the backdrop and everything then stage

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.360 
the backdrop and everything then stage
two<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:13.420> actually<00:03:14.109> filming<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> video<00:03:14.859> that's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
two is actually filming the video that's

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:31.229 
two is actually filming the video that's
probably<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.760> shortest<00:03:16.060> stage

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.149 

and<00:03:31.810> then<00:03:31.959> stage<00:03:32.230> three<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
and then stage three is the

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.940 
and then stage three is the
post-production<00:03:34.049> or<00:03:35.049> add<00:03:35.200> together<00:03:35.349> footage
