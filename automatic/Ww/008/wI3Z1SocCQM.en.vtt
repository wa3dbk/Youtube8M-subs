on<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.319> first<00:02:41.590> floor<00:02:41.680> we<00:02:41.980> utilize<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
on the first floor we utilize the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.390 
on the first floor we utilize the
horizontal<00:02:43.480> sidewall<00:02:43.900> sprinklers<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.769> the

horizontal sidewall sprinklers and the

horizontal sidewall sprinklers and the
reason<00:02:45.849> being<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.269> that<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.719> order<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.019> use<00:02:47.579> say

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
reason being is that in order to use say

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.220 
reason being is that in order to use say
a<00:02:48.609> different<00:02:49.030> type<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.420> type<00:02:49.569> in<00:02:49.689> the<00:02:49.780> ceiling

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
a different type the type in the ceiling

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.899 
a different type the type in the ceiling
we<00:02:50.439> would<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.680> had<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.129> go<00:02:51.340> up<00:02:51.459> into<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
we would have had to go up into the

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.869 
we would have had to go up into the
ceiling<00:02:52.299> joist<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.780> open<00:02:53.079> up<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.290> ceilings

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
ceiling joist and open up the ceilings

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.629 
ceiling joist and open up the ceilings
so<00:02:54.879> this<00:02:55.180> becomes<00:02:55.629> a<00:02:55.870> much<00:02:56.739> quicker<00:02:57.340> and

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
so this becomes a much quicker and

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.270 
so this becomes a much quicker and
easier<00:02:57.849> way<00:02:58.329> to<00:02:58.389> still<00:02:59.349> provide<00:02:59.530> sprinkler

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
easier way to still provide sprinkler

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.629 
easier way to still provide sprinkler
protection<00:03:03.239> then<00:03:04.239> we<00:03:04.709> located<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:06.159> couple

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
protection then we located a couple

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.729 
protection then we located a couple
spots<00:03:07.030> where<00:03:07.389> we<00:03:07.420> could<00:03:07.629> run<00:03:07.810> piping<00:03:08.290> up<00:03:08.470> to

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
spots where we could run piping up to

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.770 
spots where we could run piping up to
the<00:03:08.889> second<00:03:09.340> floor<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.939> actually<00:03:10.450> through

the second floor into the attic and at
that<00:03:13.480> point<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:13.900> were<00:03:14.019> looking<00:03:14.349> for<00:03:14.590> closets

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
that point we were looking for closets

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.020 
that point we were looking for closets
to<00:03:15.489> utilize<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.739> closets<00:03:18.280> being<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.730> space

where we could hide the piping running

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.319 
where we could hide the piping running
up<00:03:20.919> through<00:03:21.189> and<00:03:21.370> not<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.730> open<00:03:21.909> up<00:03:22.120> any

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
once we get into the Attic we had some

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.270 
once we get into the Attic we had some
wall<00:04:08.140> boards<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.620> we<00:04:08.739> have<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.040> deal<00:04:09.250> with

but it was attic flooring it was

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.960 
but it was attic flooring it was
something<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.530> we<00:04:11.739> could<00:04:11.920> cut<00:04:12.190> channels<00:04:12.519> out

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
something that we could cut channels out

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.660 
something that we could cut channels out
and<00:04:13.480> actually<00:04:13.989> reinstall<00:04:14.830> some<00:04:15.159> of<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.340> attic

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
and actually reinstall some of the attic

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.210 
and actually reinstall some of the attic
floorboards<00:04:16.359> once<00:04:16.600> we<00:04:16.810> were<00:04:16.930> completed<00:04:17.530> so

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
floorboards once we were completed so

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.530 
floorboards once we were completed so
you<00:04:18.639> almost<00:04:18.850> didn't<00:04:19.060> even<00:04:19.150> know<00:04:19.329> we<00:04:19.510> were

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
you almost didn't even know we were

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.600 
you almost didn't even know we were
there<00:04:19.919> at<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.010> end<00:04:21.280> but<00:04:22.229> any<00:04:23.229> attic<00:04:23.680> allows<00:04:24.370> us

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
there at the end but any attic allows us

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.540 
there at the end but any attic allows us
to<00:04:24.760> do<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:25.210> lot<00:04:25.389> of<00:04:25.449> our<00:04:25.690> piping<00:04:26.199> even<00:04:26.770> if<00:04:27.460> you

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
to do a lot of our piping even if you

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.860 
to do a lot of our piping even if you
have<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.760> expose<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.419> we<00:04:28.570> know<00:04:28.690> we're<00:04:28.840> going

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
have to expose that we know we're going

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.340 
have to expose that we know we're going

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
to insulate it later on and that allows

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.260 
to insulate it later on and that allows
us<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:32.590> pipe<00:04:32.979> all<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.310> heads<00:04:33.639> down<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:34.180> the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
us to pipe all the heads down to the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.150 
us to pipe all the heads down to the

to<00:06:17.960> leave<00:06:18.139> the<00:06:18.229> insulation<00:06:18.740> exposed<00:06:19.159> we'll

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339 
to leave the insulation exposed we'll

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.249 
to leave the insulation exposed we'll
put<00:06:19.490> like<00:06:19.639> a<00:06:19.669> poultry<00:06:20.300> netting<00:06:20.330> or<00:06:20.749> sometimes

put like a poultry netting or sometimes

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.320 
put like a poultry netting or sometimes
they<00:06:21.379> call<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.680> chicken<00:06:21.919> wire<00:06:22.219> over<00:06:22.999> that

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
just is kind of little insurance policy

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.409 
just is kind of little insurance policy
to<00:06:27.439> make<00:06:27.589> sure<00:06:27.729> someone<00:06:28.729> doesn't<00:06:29.060> kick<00:06:29.270> the

annually to do a test and I'll say it

would be a flow test and basically going

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.010 
would be a flow test and basically going

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
we'll do is start the pump up start

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.439 
we'll do is start the pump up start
moving<00:07:17.779> some<00:07:17.930> water<00:07:18.229> through<00:07:18.499> the<00:07:18.620> piping

activate your flow alarm switch at that

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.649 
activate your flow alarm switch at that

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 
down at the valve the pump should shut

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.420 
down at the valve the pump should shut
off<00:07:29.029> on<00:07:29.270> its<00:07:29.419> own<00:07:29.629> and<00:07:30.620> then<00:07:30.770> after<00:07:31.099> that<00:07:31.189> you

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.430 
off on its own and then after that you

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.790 
off on its own and then after that you
can<00:07:31.460> top<00:07:32.029> off<00:07:32.270> the<00:07:32.479> tank<00:07:32.749> and<00:07:33.050> you'll<00:07:33.439> be<00:07:33.589> ready

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 
can top off the tank and you'll be ready

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.339 
can top off the tank and you'll be ready
for<00:07:33.860> next<00:07:34.069> time<00:07:34.749> the<00:07:35.749> other<00:07:35.899> thing<00:07:36.080> you<00:07:36.199> may
