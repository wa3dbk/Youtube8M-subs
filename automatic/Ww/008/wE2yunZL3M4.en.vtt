order<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.119> start<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.570> effect<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.380> need<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
order to start this effect we need to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.650 
order to start this effect we need to
take<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> cards<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.699> case<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.480> way

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
take the cards from the case that way

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
take the cards from the case that way
the<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.930> trick<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.680> easier<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.550> we'll<00:00:27.240> lose

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the the trick is easier to do we'll lose

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
the the trick is easier to do we'll lose
the<00:00:27.660> case<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> second<00:00:28.529> here<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:29.189> you'll

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the case for a second here now you'll

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
the case for a second here now you'll
notice<00:00:29.580> all<00:00:29.910> by<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> way<00:00:30.779> before<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.230> start<00:00:31.590> we

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
notice all by the way before we start we

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.229 
notice all by the way before we start we
should<00:00:32.070> remove<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> Joker's<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.120> you
