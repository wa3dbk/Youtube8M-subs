00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.860
 do not 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.580
 but in front 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.150
 tell us this visitor age 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.619
 and then at night in light of the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 candles 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.280
 good summarizing 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.000
 it goes 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.610
 every time and a new country but I think that 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.870
 it's like looking to buy this plane 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.129
 to take 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.129
 and not because I buy it 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 ace 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.329
 and already an uncle with goals that has all 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.329
 the papers in order but 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.280
 It can be done in a manual way but 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.220
 the one who had no idea 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.220
 he got so nervous he did not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 and good they were losing altitude 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.659
 losing altitude until they had to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.009
 landing did not really come by 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.469
 equatorial guinea was like bill for 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.119
 cameroon like this and right now we are like 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.869
 a near the cameroon border 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.299
 so what happened was that he asked 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.190
 mayday mayday at the airport 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.890
 batam to be able to land 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.170
 there was the colonel the commander who 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.430
 I had to authorize and you could not do anything 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.650
 and began to lose before a person 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.170
 tall height dude says thinking 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.390
 in their children 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.360
 praying just because I only saw forest 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.560
 trees until suddenly witches 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.200
 straight 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.200
 a while and landed the road 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.649
 he had a car he said he had seen how 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.989
 a car in front of the print 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.140
 imagine suddenly more driving and 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.140
 see your car behind and then the jail 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 do not
