VIP floor before okay so this will in my

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.070 
VIP floor before okay so this will in my
translation<00:00:11.580> here<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.690> then<00:00:12.870> there

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
translation here I have and then there

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.959 
translation here I have and then there
was<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> whole<00:00:13.620> but<00:00:13.889> from<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> understand

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
was a whole but from what I understand

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.570 
was a whole but from what I understand
parley<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.450> then<00:00:15.690> there<00:00:15.929> was<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.490> could<00:00:17.490> be

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
parley and then there was a could be

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700 
parley and then there was a could be
read<00:00:17.730> as<00:00:17.760> dato<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.109> would<00:00:19.439> be

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
read as dato and that would be

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.950 
read as dato and that would be
essentially<00:00:20.279> Yoshi<00:00:20.550> hole<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.810> would

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
essentially Yoshi hole and that would

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.689 
essentially Yoshi hole and that would
make<00:00:22.140> sense<00:00:22.350> considering<00:00:22.890> why<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> level<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
make sense considering why the level is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.670 
make sense considering why the level is
because<00:00:23.939> as<00:00:24.090> you'll<00:00:24.269> see<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.080> level<00:00:25.470> where

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
because as you'll see it's a level where

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.859 
because as you'll see it's a level where
there's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.130> Yoshi<00:00:26.460> around<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
there's a Yoshi around that there is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
there's a Yoshi around that there is
text<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.410> read<00:00:28.590> cuz<00:00:28.890> look<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.160> it's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
text to be read cuz look at that it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.740 
text to be read cuz look at that it's
that<00:00:29.369> wow<00:00:29.550> there's<00:00:29.849> text<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.240> there's<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.570> up

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that wow there's text and there's one up

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.650 
that wow there's text and there's one up
so<00:00:31.410> yeah<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.769> level<00:00:32.160> well<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> spoil

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
so yeah this level well not to spoil

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.930 
so yeah this level well not to spoil
anything<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.980> using<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> four

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
anything it's all about using the four

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
anything it's all about using the four
different<00:00:36.270> kinds<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> Yoshi<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.530> of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
different kinds of Yoshi and I kind of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.790 
different kinds of Yoshi and I kind of
let<00:00:37.860> down<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.370> run<00:00:38.550> button<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.680> fully<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
blue shell when when you know you're

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
blue shell when when you know you're
you're<00:00:56.879> using<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.270> blue<00:00:57.449> Yoshi<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> he<00:00:58.140> can

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you're using the blue Yoshi and he can
