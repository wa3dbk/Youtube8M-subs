you

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:15.480 

you

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.480 

hey<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.890> white<00:00:18.890> sphere<00:00:19.189> has<00:00:19.279> been<00:00:19.460> a

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
hey so white sphere has been a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.190 
hey so white sphere has been a
phenomenal<00:00:20.000> all<00:00:20.150> around<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.510> world<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.110> the

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
phenomenal all around the world and the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.740 
phenomenal all around the world and the
reason<00:00:21.470> is<00:00:21.619> is<00:00:21.770> because<00:00:22.599> physics<00:00:23.599> of<00:00:23.720> light

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
reason is is because physics of light

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.380 
reason is is because physics of light
looks<00:00:24.680> like<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:24.980> lampshade<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.150> quality

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
looks like the lampshade so the quality

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.019 
looks like the lampshade so the quality
of<00:00:26.599> light<00:00:26.779> is<00:00:26.900> very<00:00:27.110> very<00:00:27.349> soft<00:00:27.650> also<00:00:28.279> people

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
of light is very very soft also people

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.740 
of light is very very soft also people
usually<00:00:30.020> use<00:00:30.559> like<00:00:30.950> a<00:00:31.099> flash<00:00:31.430> racket<00:00:32.029> what's

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
usually use like a flash racket what's

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.799 
usually use like a flash racket what's
cool<00:00:32.960> about<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.380> in<00:00:34.309> sideways<00:00:34.790> now<00:00:35.570> you've

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
cool about this in sideways now you've

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
cool about this in sideways now you've
got<00:00:35.960> vertical<00:00:36.290> or<00:00:36.890> horizontal

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 

that's<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.180> fight<00:00:42.480> club<00:00:42.629> we've<00:00:43.620> added<00:00:43.829> some

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that's a fight club we've added some

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.430 
that's a fight club we've added some
really<00:00:44.219> cool<00:00:44.460> modifiers<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.199> one

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
really cool modifiers now this one

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.319 
really cool modifiers now this one
doubles<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.070> power<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
doubles the power this is a see when I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.720 
doubles the power this is a see when I
slide<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.860> light<00:00:50.040> goes<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
slide it in here the light goes up to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.030 
slide it in here the light goes up to
the<00:00:50.850> flash<00:00:51.199> reflexive<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.410> gold<00:00:52.710> which

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
the flash reflexive it is gold which

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.189 
the flash reflexive it is gold which
makes<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.940> much<00:00:54.149> more<00:00:54.360> powerful<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.050> I've

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
makes this much more powerful and I've

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:55.840 
makes this much more powerful and I've
got

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
got

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.119 
got
so<00:00:56.420> when<00:00:56.539> I<00:00:56.570> stick<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:56.989> on<00:00:57.199> here<00:00:57.469> now<00:00:57.920> this

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
so when I stick this on here now this

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.160 
so when I stick this on here now this
doubles<00:00:58.579> in<00:00:58.699> power<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.449> now<00:00:59.600> you're<00:00:59.750> basically

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
doubles in power so now you're basically

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.139 
doubles in power so now you're basically
at<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.350> same<00:01:00.559> flash<00:01:00.859> power<00:01:01.160> as<00:01:01.640> without<00:01:02.030> it

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
at the same flash power as without it

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.810 
at the same flash power as without it
you're<00:01:02.570> going<00:01:02.839> to<00:01:03.050> be<00:01:03.320> signing<00:01:03.769> people<00:01:04.519> ask

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
you're going to be signing people ask

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.180 
you're going to be signing people ask
you<00:01:05.000> what<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.330> one's<00:01:05.570> all<00:01:05.720> about<00:01:06.040> tell<00:01:07.040> me

tungsten<00:01:12.979> lighting<00:01:13.390> stick<00:01:14.390> this<00:01:14.570> on<00:01:14.890> change

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
tungsten lighting stick this on change

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.160 
tungsten lighting stick this on change
your<00:01:16.100> white<00:01:16.340> balance<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:17.030> tungsten<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.720> what

your white balance to tungsten and what

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.270 
your white balance to tungsten and what
ends<00:01:18.350> up<00:01:18.409> happening<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.039> flash

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
ends up happening is the flash

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.700 
ends up happening is the flash
disappears<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.119> becomes<00:01:20.509> invisible<00:01:20.840> because

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
disappears it becomes invisible because

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.279 
disappears it becomes invisible because
the<00:01:21.950> lighting<00:01:22.299> temperature<00:01:23.299> of<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.600> flash<00:01:23.840> in

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
the lighting temperature of the flash in

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:25.840 
the lighting temperature of the flash in
the<00:01:24.320> background<00:01:24.860> all<00:01:25.100> become<00:01:25.430> tungsten

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
the background all become tungsten

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.080 
the background all become tungsten
literacy<00:01:26.799> so<00:01:27.799> that's<00:01:28.039> basically<00:01:28.159> how<00:01:28.670> it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
literacy so that's basically how it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.740 
literacy so that's basically how it
works<00:01:29.390> but<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:30.740> look<00:01:30.890> around<00:01:31.009> here<00:01:31.659> we<00:01:32.659> have
