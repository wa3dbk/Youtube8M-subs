00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it's funny because like um the entire

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's funny because like um the entire
cart<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.350> blows<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:34.980> get

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
explosions and it's just I don't know

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.450 
explosions and it's just I don't know
why<00:02:37.380> would<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.620> even<00:02:37.740> get<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.010> ride<00:02:38.250> like

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
why would you even get on the ride like

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.360

trying to make one the ones that the
game<00:03:27.900> already<00:03:28.140> comes<00:03:28.440> with<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.820> then<00:03:29.940> I'm

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
game already comes with and then I'm

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.199 
game already comes with and then I'm
gonna<00:03:30.120> alter<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:32.280> see<00:03:32.580> what<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:33.000> do<00:03:33.120> to

so<00:03:41.190> let's<00:03:41.550> go<00:03:41.760> into<00:03:41.940> construction<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:43.010> don't

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
so let's go into construction I don't

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.560 
so let's go into construction I don't
know<00:03:44.070> what<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.340> piece<00:03:44.580> does<00:03:44.850> right<00:03:45.060> here<00:03:45.420> I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
know what this piece does right here I

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.550 
know what this piece does right here I
don't<00:03:45.720> even<00:03:45.870> know<00:03:46.020> what<00:03:46.170> your<00:03:46.290> side<00:03:46.440> they're

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
don't even know what your side they're

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.870 
don't even know what your side they're
gonna<00:03:46.650> be<00:03:46.830> approaching<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.430> from<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:47.790> I'm

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
gonna be approaching it from but I'm

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.830 
gonna be approaching it from but I'm
gonna<00:03:48.030> lead<00:03:48.270> it<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:51.060> don't<00:03:51.390> think<00:03:51.570> that's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.300 
gonna lead it and I don't think that's
gonna<00:03:51.989> add<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.410> well<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> can't<00:03:52.950> wait<00:03:53.010> till<00:03:53.250> I

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
gonna add to well I can't wait till I

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.199 
gonna add to well I can't wait till I
get<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:53.730> bitch<00:03:54.140> alright<00:03:55.140> um<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:56.150> need<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
get on that bitch alright um I need a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.670 
get on that bitch alright um I need a
path<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.630> get<00:03:57.750> into<00:03:57.989> this<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:03.200> as<00:04:04.200> always<00:04:04.500> you

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
path to get into this and as always you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.820 
path to get into this and as always you
don't<00:04:04.800> need<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.100> exit<00:04:06.200> I'll<00:04:07.200> have<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.590> finish

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
don't need the exit I'll have to finish

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.949 
don't need the exit I'll have to finish
the<00:04:08.160> circuit<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.850> guess<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.360> don't<00:04:09.630> know<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:09.900> I

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
the circuit I guess I don't know if I

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.800 
the circuit I guess I don't know if I
make<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.140> power<00:04:10.410> launch<00:04:10.650> right<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:14.750> don't<00:04:15.750> know

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
make a power launch right I don't know

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.270 
make a power launch right I don't know
how<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.019> works<00:04:16.230> cuz<00:04:16.440> I've<00:04:16.560> never<00:04:16.769> made<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:16.980> on

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
how that works cuz I've never made a on

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.849 
how that works cuz I've never made a on
power<00:04:17.519> launch<00:04:17.730> mob<00:04:17.970> cuz<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:18.989> ended<00:04:19.530> before<00:04:19.830> I

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
power launch mob cuz that ended before I

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.960 
power launch mob cuz that ended before I
guess<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.250> would<00:04:20.340> work<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:21.479> work<00:04:21.860> yeah<00:04:22.970> our

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
guess it would work so work yeah our

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.010 
guess it would work so work yeah our
hands

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
hands

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.420 
hands
check<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.259> price<00:04:25.500> uh<00:04:25.530> make<00:04:25.889> these<00:04:26.009> guys<00:04:26.220> pay
