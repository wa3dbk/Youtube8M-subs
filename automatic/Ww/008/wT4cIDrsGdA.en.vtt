00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.260 

I<00:00:09.260> went<00:00:10.260> on<00:00:10.350> YouTube<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.100> looked<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> lot<00:00:12.150> of

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:12.270 
I went on YouTube and looked at a lot of

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.390 
I went on YouTube and looked at a lot of
videos<00:00:12.660> for<00:00:13.879> self<00:00:14.879> watering<00:00:15.150> planners<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.400> I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
videos for self watering planners and I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.760 
videos for self watering planners and I
had<00:00:17.670> already<00:00:17.789> made<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.900> nobody<00:00:19.350> really

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
had already made these and nobody really

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.890 
had already made these and nobody really
did<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> same<00:00:20.310> way<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> did<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.779> I'm

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
did it the same way I did it so I'm

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.110 
did it the same way I did it so I'm
making<00:00:22.110> a<00:00:22.320> video<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> show<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.220> how<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> did<00:00:24.030> it

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
making a video to show you how I did it

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.610 
making a video to show you how I did it
because<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:24.450> it's<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.780> lot<00:00:24.960> easier<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 
because I think it's a lot easier and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.920 
because I think it's a lot easier and
cheaper<00:00:26.210> cuz<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.300> only<00:00:27.330> need<00:00:27.600> one

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
cheaper cuz you only need one

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.529 
cheaper cuz you only need one
five-gallon<00:00:28.620> bucket<00:00:29.040> and<00:00:30.410> one<00:00:32.210> milk<00:00:33.210> jug

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
five-gallon bucket and one milk jug

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:40.160 
five-gallon bucket and one milk jug
container<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:35.420> about<00:00:36.420> 8<00:00:36.780> inches<00:00:37.760> long<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.900> 1

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
container and about 8 inches long of a 1

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.520 
container and about 8 inches long of a 1
inch<00:00:40.440> diameter<00:00:41.000> PVC<00:00:42.000> pipe<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:43.860> nail

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
inch diameter PVC pipe and a nail

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.430 
inch diameter PVC pipe and a nail
basically<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> did<00:00:47.000> is<00:00:48.020> I<00:00:49.020> took<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.230> five

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
basically what I did is I took a five

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.530 
basically what I did is I took a five
gallon<00:00:49.649> bucket<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:52.220> cut<00:00:53.220> holes<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> bottom

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
gallon bucket I cut holes in the bottom

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.350 
gallon bucket I cut holes in the bottom
with<00:00:55.200> a<00:00:55.620> drill

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
with a drill

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.650 
with a drill
I<00:00:57.420> used<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.020> quarter<00:00:58.260> inch<00:00:58.559> drill<00:00:59.010> bit<00:00:59.329> I<00:01:00.329> don't

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
I used a quarter inch drill bit I don't

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.180 
I used a quarter inch drill bit I don't
think<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.230> matters<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.770> long<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.040> it's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
think it really matters as long as it's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.340 
think it really matters as long as it's
large<00:01:03.030> enough<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.870> water<00:01:04.079> to<00:01:04.320> drain

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
large enough for the water to drain

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.670 
large enough for the water to drain
through<00:01:05.570> when<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.630> drained<00:01:06.869> enough<00:01:07.110> hole<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
through when I drained enough hole so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.020 
through when I drained enough hole so
that<00:01:07.829> it<00:01:07.950> could<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> rain<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that it could be out in the rain and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
that it could be out in the rain and
drain<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.020> quickly<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:10.829> fill<00:01:11.100> with

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
drain as quickly as it would fill with

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.609 
drain as quickly as it would fill with
rainwater<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.299> don't<00:01:13.170> want<00:01:13.289> to<00:01:13.380> flood<00:01:13.590> my

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
rainwater I don't want to flood my

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.069 
rainwater I don't want to flood my
plants<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.079> then<00:01:16.079> basically<00:01:17.039> all<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.219> do<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:18.079> I

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
plants and then basically all I do is I

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.050 
plants and then basically all I do is I
stick<00:01:19.319> the<00:01:19.499> milk<00:01:19.709> jug<00:01:19.950> inside<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.789> this<00:01:20.939> is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
stick the milk jug inside and this is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.419 
stick the milk jug inside and this is
also<00:01:21.240> nice<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.749> shallow<00:01:22.109> rooted<00:01:22.709> plants<00:01:23.249> I

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
also nice for shallow rooted plants I

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.969 
also nice for shallow rooted plants I
have<00:01:23.999> some<00:01:24.329> strawberries<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.049> mine<00:01:25.469> right

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
have some strawberries and mine right

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.629 
have some strawberries and mine right
now<00:01:27.229> because<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.529> higher<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.249> the<00:01:29.459> roots

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
now because it's higher up so the roots

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.249 
now because it's higher up so the roots
don't<00:01:29.789> have<00:01:29.969> to<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.179> down<00:01:30.359> as<00:01:30.569> deep<00:01:30.779> to<00:01:30.959> get<00:01:31.109> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't have to go down as deep to get to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.789 
don't have to go down as deep to get to
the<00:01:31.350> water<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.789> I<00:01:33.149> stick<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> PVC<00:01:34.590> pipe

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the water and then I stick the PVC pipe

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.580 
the water and then I stick the PVC pipe
in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> top<00:01:35.279> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> milk<00:01:36.179> jug<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.749> have<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
in the top of the milk jug and have a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.879 
in the top of the milk jug and have a
little<00:01:37.770> strip<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.159> cloth<00:01:38.429> to<00:01:38.819> wick<00:01:39.810> water<00:01:40.139> you

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
little strip of cloth to wick water you

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.459 
little strip of cloth to wick water you
know<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.039> some<00:01:41.670> soil<00:01:41.999> around<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.959> milk<00:01:43.200> jug

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
know to some soil around the milk jug

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.919 
know to some soil around the milk jug
and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.819> nail<00:01:44.999> holds<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.539> from<00:01:45.689> going

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
and then the nail holds it from going

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.039 
and then the nail holds it from going
all<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.229> way<00:01:46.319> down<00:01:46.499> into<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> milk<00:01:47.189> jug<00:01:48.049> then

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
all the way down into the milk jug then

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.989 
all the way down into the milk jug then
basically<00:01:49.529> all<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.310> fill<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.639> up<00:01:50.729> with

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
basically all I do is I fill it up with

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.409 
basically all I do is I fill it up with
dirt<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.249> fill<00:01:53.249> the<00:01:53.819> milk<00:01:54.029> jug<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.389> water

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:54.419 
dirt and fill the milk jug with water

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:56.480 
dirt and fill the milk jug with water
either<00:01:55.349> before<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> fill<00:01:55.889> it<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.099> dirt<00:01:56.310> or

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
either before I fill it with dirt or

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.109 
either before I fill it with dirt or
after<00:01:56.819> I<00:01:56.849> fill<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.179> with<00:01:57.299> dirt<00:01:57.539> and<00:01:58.880> then<00:01:59.880> put<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
after I fill it with dirt and then put a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
after I fill it with dirt and then put a
plant<00:02:00.389> in<00:02:00.569> it<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
plant in it and that is really it so it

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.489 
plant in it and that is really it so it
makes<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.179> lot<00:02:03.389> easier<00:02:04.399> than<00:02:05.399> using<00:02:05.969> 2<00:02:06.499> 5

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
makes it a lot easier than using 2 5

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:12.320 
makes it a lot easier than using 2 5
gallon<00:02:07.950> containers<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.849> I'm<00:02:11.849> trying<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.209> think

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
gallon containers so I'm trying to think

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.020 
gallon containers so I'm trying to think
there's<00:02:12.569> anything<00:02:12.900> else<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.580> could<00:02:14.640> tell

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
there's anything else that I could tell

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.420 
there's anything else that I could tell
you<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:16.020> help<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.380> out<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.010> make<00:02:17.160> yours

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you to help you out when you make yours

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.010 
you to help you out when you make yours
the<00:02:17.970> only<00:02:18.150> other<00:02:18.240> thing<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.600> did

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the only other thing I did
