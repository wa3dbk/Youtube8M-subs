 delicious bread and the walken bread 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.710
 the bread is perfect for 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.599
 barbecue or as a side dish of salad and 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.630
 What you need for that I say now 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.379
 for the dough you need 600 grams 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.540

 sugar two teaspoons salt and 50 grams 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.940
 First you have to make a yeast dough now 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.980
 create this is your ingredients now 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.960
 in your kitchen machine or italy 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.940
 by hand I do it today in one 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.879
 conference band just goes much faster 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.449
 and I have less work to take 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.199
 I just give the lid off all 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.199
 ingredients 3 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.770
 before that happens, you betray as the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.400
 other ingredients make the rule better 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.400
 can work 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.150
 then I switch to two minutes 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.229
 closes the machine and pieces on 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.229
 the kneading button 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.700
 and now I'll give it to you for a moment 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:47.040
 and if he is chained it brings 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.040
 he is from ash some support 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.000
 and then the day comes in and 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.140
 again covered at a were places in 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.140
 total already given 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.080
 while totally it can work out 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.390
 in the meantime, once the herb butter 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 produce and the ingredients constantly 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.760
 Make yourselves shortly for the herbal butter 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.460
 you need 120g of soft butter then 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.490
 some spices so sat pepper here 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.620
 I three toes garlic something oregano 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.720
 and chili and I like to give one more 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.720
 some fresh herbs with it and that 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.820
 parsley peppermint and basil 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.190
 the fresh herbs and the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.660
 garlic cloves must now laugh and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.040
 are then mixed with the butter 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.750
 I'll get this in pretty quickly 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.340
 He does not make a kitchen machine 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.240
 kitchen machine hate the press the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.520
 cloves of garlic through a 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.900
 garlic press or cuts everything by 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.500
 hand and then mix everything in 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.850
 Tempelhof first gives you the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.810
 garlic cloves and the herbs in the 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.090
 mix pot and the whole is now at 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.810
 Level 8 is small in eight seconds 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.810
 chopped 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.210
 and then there's the butter 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.970
 to it and the remaining spices and that 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.540
 is now in 25 seconds on stage 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.860
 six mulled 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.350
 when the sky day has gone then 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.150
 and the filling is prepared must 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.660
 their bread is still forming and how the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.900
 does not show here 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.830
 to that you put yours that dough gives something 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.090
 more work surface then comes 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.090
 because the dough on it 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.810
 and the dough now rolls out rectangular 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.580
 and on the dough is now the butter 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.580
 water 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.170
 and now comes the part like the red 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.160
 front and that you cut about 5 cm 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.160
 wider strip 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:33.639
 and I keep it and time 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.310
 These stripes are laid out like this 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:44.160
 together like an accordion just 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.160
 fold up like that 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.090
 minute to all have through the reform 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.290
 You can also take a springform 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.640
 or him like me a little 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.800
 glass box in front 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.920
 and then he puts it quite arbitrarily 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.160
 your folded bread parts rows 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.170
 either could put in that way 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.050
 the time knew up here is to be seen 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.760
 or he puts her out looking 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.530
 and that could be quite arbitrary now 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.530
 as he messed wildly 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.550
 The boat has to be ready before baking 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.440
 once I leave it about 20 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.080
 minutes again in the warm place 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.670
 and after that when it is about 30 degrees at 200 degrees 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.670
 baked to 35 minutes 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.040
 that both are used to look like this 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.630
 After that, reform now also supports if you 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:14.810
 Of course you can have springform quite 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:16.280
 just the edge and the bread still 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.150
 you can not cut yourself 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.030
 just here 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.140
 tear off the pieces I hope so 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.180
 recipe in space 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.770
 Personally, I think it's great because it is 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.870
 Just go fast I need you 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.270
 again ingredients with and besides 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.130
 it is also very easy then wishes 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.300
 I have a lot of fun baking and 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.920
 about him again next time 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.920
 Turn my day keeps
