00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.860
 drive the roads 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.750
 to be autonomous go to the adventurous while 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.849
 it makes you want and if you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 let try by a caravan more 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.430
 modern and always offer more 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.859
 potential 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.480
 the caravans have changed well then 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.130
 how to choose your model 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.199
 do I need a driver's license 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 specific we talk about it with our 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.369
 expert claude golliard member of the committee 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.529
 Director of the French Federation of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.530
 camping and caravanning responsible for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.510
 the caravan commission 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.070
 hello claude a good day to the first 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.129
 simple question what a difference 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.010
 between the caravans and motorhomes 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 motorhome is autonomous but 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
 parking problems currently 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 in tourist places 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.210
 the caravan is obliged to 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.030
 park on a campsite 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.680
 but we are autonomous with the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.690
 car since we can 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.690
 to travel from tourist circles with the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 car next to the caravan how many 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.680
 caravans sold in 2012 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.659
 a little over 9700 is what it takes 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 have a special driver's license 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.630
 to tow a caravan then between 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.400
 3,35 and cape town 250 I'm talking about 3,35 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.229
 the weight of the two vehicles that is to say 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.590
 of tractors and caravan 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.320
 we need the new license b 96 which 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.979
 corresponds to 7 hours of training in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.409
 a car school but without a medical examination 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 and without examination while she caravan 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.079
 for what use 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.909
 for sure if they did it 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.650
 the itinerant it will take a little 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.750
 caravan 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.150
 they are easy to pull if you 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.980
 make fixed is sure we can have 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.840
 a larger caravan with a 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.950
 awning and welcome a lot more 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.290
 people inside this 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 caravan in terms of price how much does that 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.210
 worth a caravan is about 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.190
 from 10000 euros to 25000 euros 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.110
 of course high end caravans 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.140
 so it's a lot cheaper than 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.120
 canton because the building combines because it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.620
 will have to put fifty thousand euros either 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.229
 the price of a caravan of a car 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.119
 new then cars side 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.300
 what a privileged model to tow a 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.820
 caravan favor a car well 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.590
 sure all that depends on the traction torque 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.220
 of this car plus the nail raining this 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.400
 will be important more the car easier 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.160
 to pull this caravan for gasoline to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.470
 what to focus on diesel everything 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.630
 it depends on the number of kilometers that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.680
 you will do in the year if you 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.629
 make a friend km 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.019
 there is no use using a 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.590
 diesel if you make more than 20000 km 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.599
 diesel will be better to be able to 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.219
 pull lagarde tow a caravan is 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.069
 this entails additional costs for the 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:51.280
 car is a premature measure we're going 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.569
 see above all a fuel surcharge 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.810
 sometimes clutch problems 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.389
 have led that we have a load to shoot 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.909
 behind a toll car 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.280
 if you have a caravan less than 2 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.750
 meters you pay the normal rate 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.329
 insurance side how is it put 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.120
 on his caravan when the vehicle is rolling 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.370
 its insured as the car is in 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.329
 more insurance of the car when 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.180
 the vehicle is stopped 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.919
 it's a holiday resort then
