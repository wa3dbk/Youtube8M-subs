00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.000
 hello to you all shamans today show 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:16.379
 you forelock mod wild craft for this 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 dupe we need a little bit 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.050
 I will say, and Alan will be required for everything 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.869
 one mechanical engine he craft 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 that's the way we also need 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.130
 chest think chest you know how 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.690
 crafting a red torch is also wooden 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.340
 pipe crafted like this and we need 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.090
 iron transport pipe crafted 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 It's in this way as well so I 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.610
 here already done this but let shemku 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.129
 after all this we will remove and redo it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.739
 means set and let's high here 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.440
 closer here we have a thing which 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.579
 we want to dump, because where 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.559
 there is a bolt craft mod means there is and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.510
 industrial craft possible advanced 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.299
 advanced solar panels 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.850
 here we are fashion set to find out what 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.090
 so the chest can be either side like 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.509
 want a pipe 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:20.280
 engine red torch exactly red 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.210
 the torch that is, do not put what 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 circuit there 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.670
 to wise in general nothing over just 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 put a red torch and also iron 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.829
 transport pipe do this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.490
 You can also do so much 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.720
 who has no resources here you have 8 pieces 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.570
 five times two three 4 5 six 7 8 you can 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.460
 do and 2 and 3 not we will do 8 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.220
 let's say so 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.620
 so here we remove it to us now 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.900
 will not need 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.900
 although no, that's what we need 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:05.710
 we take our resources now we 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:09.920
 turn off daimond they all stand 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.700
 although the water is not like this engine is better 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.300
 warm up the engine so that it works 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.830
 much faster so he doesn't pull out 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.150
 on one thing after all he is already slowly 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.070
 starts to blush 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.520
 so now we put a thing here 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:33.260
 well let's start with the usual sunny 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:37.520
 sockets everything he starts to deflate we 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.950
 break and get three pieces here 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:47.360
 let's do it again so here they come out 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.959
 you break them and 5 see 5 pieces only 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.930
 because I myself am honestly this oak tree 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.130
 I can't explain it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.330
 very strange it's just sucked 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.170
 on the sly here let's even they all 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.560
 come here iron pipe see 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.170
 allow does not allow them to go further and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.770
 block them not the way and now we have it 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.410
 breaking nine nine pieces all with this we 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.590
 let's finish our favorite diamonds 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.630
 take with diamonds the same thing happens 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.269
 here they start pumped out 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.720
 there is no 100k there you saw it was nine 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.440
 pieces of everything we break it all 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.650
 it turns out 16 pieces here 16 pieces of diamond 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.680
 I think a very good oak and it is not very 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.720
 requires a lot to develop that is 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.350
 python is generally completely completely 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.730
 any thing though stop and let's us 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.730
 let's try 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:54.590
 so we don't take it badly mean we 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.739
 let's take something that doesn't 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.069
 stacks and see if he will 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.310
 mock well let's say we take 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:12.069
 quantum bibs turn gi off 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:12.069
 mod all the breasts and go try 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:21.360
 how much we honestly honestly I do not remember 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.480
 let's try again like this 4 so 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.560
 four of them all remembered everything 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.810
 the engine is fast enough 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.920
 overclocked and breaking no you see things 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.290
 who do not stack their dupnut 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:42.090
 even if it is possible but very difficult, let's 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:48.260
 we will make uterus as they are called 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:52.830
 Duke him nine nine pieces so not 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:57.600
 let's go over that all of them though not 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:01.680
 Be sure to watch 15 pieces very 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.050
 good dupe costs are minimal not that 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.770
 it will be difficult for you to craft such 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:14.180
 small circuit so this is very very 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:20.070
 profitable good nuke and also look 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:23.030
 let us do it like this 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.760
 so that they all go 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.630
 although why in principle we did it 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.630
 I do not know 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.550
 now they okay we 'll take the whole 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.040
 our ultimate panel went here you see 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:46.500
 they start coming back and we them 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.200
 we break 20 20 pieces and here there are 4 others 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.730
 also they they don't disappear here in 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.880
 principle we can put them 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:59.750
 and we put all of them and also other 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.550
 panels to everyone and we can put them with them 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.919
 nothing happens to them they don't 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.270
 disappear 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:10.350
 here diamonds well damn diamond can be like this 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.280
 leave them 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.480
 they are not going to disappear 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.880
 pick up that also 16 pieces and will remain 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.390
 so try on some servers 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.250
 This of course has long been fixed but 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.590
 still there are servers that are 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.460
 recently opened and in which very 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.360
 full dupe 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.960
 you just need to go on such 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.870
 sites like um si go to 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:44.010
 any 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.660
 page say 15 rubles from the server but 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.130
 I don't say exactly you can 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:52.729
 page go and forest and if it says 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:56.850
 new server there let it week or 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:07:00.110
 two weeks here recently opened these 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:03.419
 dupe and of course work on it so 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:06.419
 try experimenting can you 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:10.110
 make another super chain with dupom 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:13.710
 and will be there to sleep on endless 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.640
 items but not falling here on endless 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.729
 items 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.419
 I think they are already very young 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.900
 no 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:24.840
 There is a dupe which only copies 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.590
 things give all the same last last 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:33.480
 time stop god 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:41.340
 4 they disappear but oh well let's try everything 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:45.980
 here is the last time to dump them if you take 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.980
 more we we can't okay okay 

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:52.950
 no how do you see things that don't 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.710
 stack I will repeat not du so sung 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.360
 what was the shaman with you if you 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.580
 like this video then you can 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.350
 like to subscribe the channel to everyone 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.350
 good luck and all bye
