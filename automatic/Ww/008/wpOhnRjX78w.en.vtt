from your seventh first of all I played
it<00:00:50.640> already<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.090> few<00:00:51.480> times<00:00:52.230> few<00:00:52.590> assessments

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it already a few times few assessments

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.540 
it already a few times few assessments
with<00:00:53.579> them<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.140> it's<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.410> turn-based<00:00:56.070> part

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
with them and it's more turn-based part

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
with them and it's more turn-based part
of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> game<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:58.079> sent<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of the game and you sent them out on a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.490 
of the game and you sent them out on a
mission<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.550> come<00:00:59.789> back<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.329> success<00:01:01.230> or

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
mission they come back with success or

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.349 
mission they come back with success or
they<00:01:01.649> die<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.579> give<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:03.090> their

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
they die and you give them their

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990 
they die and you give them their
upgrades<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.799> earn<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:05.670> level

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
upgrades which they earn and they level

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
upgrades which they earn and they level
up<00:01:06.170> also<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
up also so that's the bit of the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
up also so that's the bit of the
upgrades<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.869> later<00:01:13.320> again

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
upgrades because in that later again

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
upgrades because in that later again
then<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> screen<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.659> mission

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
then you go to the screen with mission

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.570 
then you go to the screen with mission
selects<00:01:16.909> find<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.119> mission<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:19.049> me<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.340> what

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
selects find a mission like me like what

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.600 
selects find a mission like me like what
i<00:01:20.610> did<00:01:20.939> was<00:01:21.150> my<00:01:21.780> assassins<00:01:22.290> were<00:01:22.610> weren't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
i did was my assassins were weren't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.670 
i did was my assassins were weren't
rookie<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.509> still<00:01:24.960> rookies<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.740> hadn't

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
rookie were still rookies they hadn't

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
rookie were still rookies they hadn't
they<00:01:28.680> didn't<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.280> any<00:01:29.490> experience<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:31.259> they

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
they didn't have any experience so they

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
they didn't have any experience so they
needed<00:01:31.770> experience<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.490> look<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> mission

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
needed experience so look for a mission

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.499 
needed experience so look for a mission
with<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.170> red<00:01:34.409> dot<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.820> means<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
with one red dot so that means when you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
with one red dot so that means when you
get<00:01:36.750> an<00:01:36.869> assistant<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.439> level<00:01:37.799> 2<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
get an assistant like level 2 and you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
get an assistant like level 2 and you
put<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.450> mission<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.200> one

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
put it on that mission you get one

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.310 
put it on that mission you get one
hundred<00:01:40.740> percent<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.759> hundred<00:01:42.150> percent

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
hundred percent one hundred percent

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.789 
hundred percent one hundred percent
chance<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:44.040> succeed<00:01:45.110> then<00:01:46.110> also

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
chance that it will succeed then also

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.760 
chance that it will succeed then also
look<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.909> other<00:01:48.270> missions<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.680> have

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
look for other missions because you have

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.889 
look for other missions because you have
six<00:01:50.070> assessments<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.759> every<00:01:51.479> time<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> take

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
six assessments and every time you take

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.960 
six assessments and every time you take
a<00:01:51.960> budget<00:01:52.409> tower<00:01:52.619> down<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.340> earn<00:01:53.579> another

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
a budget tower down you can earn another

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.310 
a budget tower down you can earn another
assassin<00:01:55.909> give<00:01:56.909> them<00:01:57.119> also<00:01:57.360> missions<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.140> do

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
assassin give them also missions but do

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.200 
assassin give them also missions but do
look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> percentage<00:01:59.369> how<00:01:59.729> much<00:01:59.969> sense

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
look at the percentage how much sense

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.289 
look at the percentage how much sense
they<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:01.259> succeed<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.969> also

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
they have to succeed and you can also

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.429 
they have to succeed and you can also
look<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.710> mission<00:02:05.540> where<00:02:06.540> there<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.960> both

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
look for a mission where there are both

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.540 
look for a mission where there are both
two<00:02:07.799> stars<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.879> read

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
two stars to read

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.790 
two stars to read
then<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.510> need<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:12.340> more<00:02:12.580> assassins<00:02:13.000> at

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
then you need to get more assassins at

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.550 
then you need to get more assassins at
the<00:02:14.800> mission<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.880> can<00:02:16.180> do<00:02:16.660> five<00:02:17.020> assassins

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the mission you can do five assassins

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.330 
the mission you can do five assassins
permission<00:02:18.160> but<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.090> also<00:02:19.270> do<00:02:19.540> like<00:02:19.930> an

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
permission but you can also do like an

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.890 
permission but you can also do like an
experienced<00:02:21.340> assassin<00:02:21.610> whose<00:02:22.090> level<00:02:22.420> 2<00:02:22.540> or<00:02:22.570> 3

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
experienced assassin whose level 2 or 3

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.920 
experienced assassin whose level 2 or 3
and<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.340> single<00:02:24.670> mission<00:02:24.850> at<00:02:25.210> but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
and do it on the single mission at but

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.050 
and do it on the single mission at but
it<00:02:26.140> all<00:02:26.350> depends<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.950> how<00:02:27.190> much<00:02:27.610> percent

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
it all depends on how much percent

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.900 
it all depends on how much percent
chance<00:02:28.330> they've<00:02:28.720> got<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.200> succeed<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.730> we

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
chance they've got to succeed then we

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.880 
chance they've got to succeed then we
are<00:02:33.970> now<00:02:34.120> looking<00:02:34.480> for<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.750> mission<00:02:34.960> very<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.560> can

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
are now looking for a mission very I can

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.150 
are now looking for a mission very I can
put<00:02:36.100> two<00:02:36.490> assessments<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.330> two<00:02:37.930> dots<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.950> that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
put two assessments on two dots so that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.310 
put two assessments on two dots so that
means<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.610> need<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.880> assessments<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.930> succeed

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
means you need to assessments to succeed

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.720 
means you need to assessments to succeed
I<00:02:41.610> could<00:02:42.610> send<00:02:42.850> one<00:02:43.030> assassin<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:43.990> got<00:02:44.860> one

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
I could send one assassin it's got one

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.550 
I could send one assassin it's got one
ninety<00:02:46.330> one-percent<00:02:46.480> chance<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:47.230> succeeding

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
ninety one-percent chance of succeeding

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.830 
ninety one-percent chance of succeeding
but<00:02:48.190> I'm<00:02:48.400> going<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.880> send<00:02:49.210> my<00:02:49.300> two<00:02:49.600> most

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
but I'm going to send my two most

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.200 
but I'm going to send my two most
experienced<00:02:50.560> assassins<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.460> mission<00:02:51.850> so

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
experienced assassins on the mission so

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.270 
experienced assassins on the mission so
I<00:02:52.240> got<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.780> hundred<00:02:53.140> percent<00:02:53.170> chance<00:02:53.950> of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
I got one hundred percent chance of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.230 
I got one hundred percent chance of
success<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.980> experience<00:02:57.520> points<00:02:57.700> during

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
success and the experience points during

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.360 
success and the experience points during
such<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.570> mission<00:02:58.870> will<00:02:59.230> be<00:02:59.380> split<00:03:00.060> between<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
such a mission will be split between the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.420 
such a mission will be split between the
assassins<00:03:03.370> who<00:03:03.640> take<00:03:03.940> care<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:05.650> contract

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
assassins who take care of that contract

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.930 
assassins who take care of that contract
they<00:03:07.210> split<00:03:07.750> each<00:03:08.290> equal<00:03:09.070> share<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.490> their

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
they split each equal share of their

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.170 
they split each equal share of their
experience<00:03:10.690> points<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.580> ss<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.030> get<00:03:13.150> a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
experience points so one ss and get a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.390 
experience points so one ss and get a
lot<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.440> experience<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:14.739> he's<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.100> his<00:03:15.190> own

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
lot of experience but he's on his own

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.470 
lot of experience but he's on his own
and<00:03:15.730> he<00:03:15.820> might<00:03:16.000> not<00:03:16.209> live<00:03:17.610> but<00:03:18.610> send<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.209> lot<00:03:19.360> of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
and he might not live but send a lot of

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.960 
and he might not live but send a lot of
them<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:20.140> succeed<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.680> they<00:03:21.190> all<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.730> to

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
them you succeed and they all have to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.520 
them you succeed and they all have to
split<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:23.190> also<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.459> may<00:03:25.330> take<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:26.050> few<00:03:26.110> minutes

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
split it also it may take a few minutes

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.940 
split it also it may take a few minutes
to<00:03:27.250> succeed<00:03:27.700> with<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.239> tasks<00:03:29.020> like<00:03:29.650> 10

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
to succeed with the tasks like 10

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.800 
to succeed with the tasks like 10
minutes<00:03:30.160> or<00:03:30.520> 12<00:03:31.000> minutes<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:31.510> then<00:03:31.660> they<00:03:31.780> come

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
minutes or 12 minutes and then they come

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.470 
minutes or 12 minutes and then they come
back<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.380> go<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.590> again<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.520> carrier<00:03:34.000> pigeons

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
back you go to again the carrier pigeons

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.350 
back you go to again the carrier pigeons
again<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.340> look<00:03:36.340> at<00:03:36.459> them<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.880> see<00:03:37.120> all

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
again and look at them and you see all

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.410 
again and look at them and you see all
the<00:03:37.570> deck<00:03:37.780> on<00:03:37.989> your<00:03:38.170> screen<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:39.180> which<00:03:40.180> one

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
the deck on your screen like which one

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.150 
the deck on your screen like which one
died<00:03:40.660> in<00:03:40.690> which<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.290> them<00:03:41.470> had<00:03:41.650> success<00:03:41.980> now

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
died in which of them had success now

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
died in which of them had success now
they<00:03:42.459> all<00:03:42.580> live<00:03:42.790> by<00:03:43.780> my<00:03:43.989> by<00:03:44.620> my<00:03:44.650> choices

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
they all live by my by my choices

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.720 
they all live by my by my choices
because<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.590> looked<00:03:47.590> around<00:03:47.770> for<00:03:48.220> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
because I looked around for the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.120 
because I looked around for the
percentage<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.480> succession<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.230> that's<00:03:50.950> how

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
percentage of succession and that's how

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.180 
percentage of succession and that's how
I<00:03:51.540> send<00:03:52.540> them<00:03:52.690> on<00:03:52.870> their<00:03:52.900> missions<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:53.950> that's

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
I send them on their missions so that's

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.040 
I send them on their missions so that's
why<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.370> got<00:03:54.670> them<00:03:54.820> all<00:03:54.970> back<00:03:55.120> then<00:03:55.810> their

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
why I got them all back then their

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.040 
why I got them all back then their
experience<00:03:56.709> they<00:03:57.520> can<00:03:57.820> upgrade<00:03:58.060> them<00:03:58.330> armor

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
experience they can upgrade them armor

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.300 
experience they can upgrade them armor
and<00:03:59.230> weapons<00:03:59.940> as<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.959> see<00:04:02.170> on<00:04:02.440> your<00:04:03.070> screen

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
and weapons as you see on your screen

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.199 
and weapons as you see on your screen
now<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:05.260> that's<00:04:05.590> how<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.830> do<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.190> upgrade<00:04:07.000> them

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
now so that's how you do it upgrade them

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.750 
now so that's how you do it upgrade them
sentiment<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.019> missions<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.890> wait<00:04:09.310> till<00:04:09.610> they

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
sentiment on missions and wait till they

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.509 
sentiment on missions and wait till they
come<00:04:09.790> back<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:10.720> also<00:04:10.930> watch<00:04:11.890> how<00:04:12.310> much

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
come back but also watch how much

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.520 
come back but also watch how much
percentage<00:04:13.180> your<00:04:13.480> assassin<00:04:13.959> has<00:04:14.140> for<00:04:14.440> the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
percentage your assassin has for the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.260 
percentage your assassin has for the
mission<00:04:14.709> that's<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.489> most<00:04:15.640> important<00:04:16.180> thing

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.270 

and<00:04:19.270> once<00:04:20.200> you've<00:04:20.350> done<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.890> can<00:04:21.040> send

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
and once you've done that you can send

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.430 
and once you've done that you can send
them<00:04:21.490> out<00:04:21.700> on<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.150> mission<00:04:22.630> again<00:04:23.050> they<00:04:23.230> also

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
them out on a mission again they also

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.770 
them out on a mission again they also
earn<00:04:23.860> experience<00:04:24.130> on<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.090> streets<00:04:25.450> when

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
earn experience on the streets when

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.210 
earn experience on the streets when
they're<00:04:25.960> walking<00:04:26.110> with<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.680> or<00:04:26.920> you<00:04:27.040> give

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
not on the mission you can send them

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.240 
not on the mission you can send them
