lightsaber from episode 2 the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.420 
lightsaber from episode 2 the
specificness<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.660> request<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
specificness of this request is

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.950 
specificness of this request is
ridiculous<00:00:32.430> how<00:00:32.730> many<00:00:32.790> times<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.930> been

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
ridiculous how many times I have been

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
ridiculous how many times I have been
asked<00:00:34.590> for<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:36.059> been<00:00:36.300> asked<00:00:36.540> for

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
asked for this one I have been asked for

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.720 
asked for this one I have been asked for
anakin<00:00:36.989> lightsaber<00:00:37.440> before<00:00:37.920> without<00:00:38.460> an

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
anakin lightsaber before without an

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.170 
anakin lightsaber before without an
episode<00:00:39.360> title<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.480> there<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:44.180> possible

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
episode title to it there is a possible

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850 
episode title to it there is a possible
reason<00:00:45.450> why<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.110> requested<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
reason why this one is requested so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
reason why this one is requested so
often<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:47.910> that's<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.690> was

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
often and I think that's because it was

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.400 
often and I think that's because it was
smashed<00:00:49.399> but<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.820> don't<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.960> sure<00:00:52.020> if

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
smashed but I don't know for sure if

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
smashed but I don't know for sure if
that<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.039> reasoning<00:00:53.430> behind<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.059> what

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that is the reasoning behind it or what

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930 
that is the reasoning behind it or what
I<00:00:54.600> did<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> smashed<00:00:56.309> version<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I did not make a smashed version of it I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
I did not make a smashed version of it I
made<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> made<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.829> complete<00:00:58.829> version<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
made it made a complete version of it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.389 
made it made a complete version of it
and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.840> tried<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> follow<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.770> best<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.160> could

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and I tried to follow as best I could

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.080 
and I tried to follow as best I could
everything<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.320> scale<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.129> odd<00:01:05.309> part<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.939> me

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
everything in scale the odd part to me

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
everything in scale the odd part to me
on<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.350> seems<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
on this one is that it seems to be a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.649 
on this one is that it seems to be a
little<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.159> larger<00:01:08.640> than<00:01:08.790> most

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
little bit larger than most

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.440 
little bit larger than most
lightsabers<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.740> maybe<00:01:10.950> I'm<00:01:11.159> just

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
lightsabers but maybe I'm just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
lightsabers but maybe I'm just
referencing<00:01:12.450> things<00:01:12.689> incorrectly<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.860> have

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
referencing things incorrectly and have

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
referencing things incorrectly and have
been<00:01:14.460> getting<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> size<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:16.170> bit<00:01:16.409> off

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
been getting the size a little bit off

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
been getting the size a little bit off
because<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.490> massive<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> do

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
because this one is massive now I do

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.490 
because this one is massive now I do
understand<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.100> anakin<00:01:20.689> also<00:01:21.689> Darth<00:01:22.200> Vader

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
understand the anakin also Darth Vader

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.520 
understand the anakin also Darth Vader
happened<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.520> large<00:01:23.790> person<00:01:24.659> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
happened to be a pretty large person so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.530 
happened to be a pretty large person so
maybe<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> reasoning<00:01:26.850> behind<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
maybe that was the reasoning behind the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.810 
maybe that was the reasoning behind the
lightsaber<00:01:28.110> itself<00:01:28.470> looking<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.040> large<00:01:29.369> but

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
lightsaber itself looking so large but

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.840 
lightsaber itself looking so large but
when<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.930> seeing<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.280> reference<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
when when seeing it in reference to

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.020 
when when seeing it in reference to
somebody<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.619> someone<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.400> an<00:01:35.490> object<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
somebody or or someone or an object that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.810 
somebody or or someone or an object that
I<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.420> size<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.259> seemed<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> become

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
I know the size of it seemed to become

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.270 
I know the size of it seemed to become
quite<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.000> large<00:01:39.299> scale<00:01:39.780> item<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:41.100> works

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
quite a large scale item it works

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.639 
quite a large scale item it works
perfectly<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.909> me<00:01:42.090> being<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.720> person<00:01:43.290> who's<00:01:43.380> 6

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
perfectly for me being a person who's 6

most lightsabers this being the process
of<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.500> kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.799> curious<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:57.360> other

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
of it I'm kind of curious as to my other

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.639 
of it I'm kind of curious as to my other
skills<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.530> how<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:59.130> work<00:01:59.990> versus<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
skills and how they work versus the the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.999 
skills and how they work versus the the
real<00:02:01.890> size<00:02:02.250> model<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.360> lot<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.590> will<00:02:04.890> be

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
real size model a lot of them will be

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.469 
real size model a lot of them will be
great<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.630> younger<00:02:06.630> folks<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.259> use<00:02:07.469> but

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
great for younger folks to use but

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.630 
great for younger folks to use but
when<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.780> comes<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.500> actual<00:02:09.649> replicas<00:02:10.459> I

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
when it comes to the actual replicas I

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.880 
when it comes to the actual replicas I
don't<00:02:10.819> know<00:02:10.940> I'm<00:02:11.840> very<00:02:12.140> very<00:02:12.319> interested<00:02:12.860> to

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
don't know I'm very very interested to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.270 
don't know I'm very very interested to
know<00:02:13.180> anyway<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.770> way<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.920> turned<00:02:16.069> out

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
know anyway I like the way it turned out

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.710 
know anyway I like the way it turned out
as<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:16.880> see<00:02:17.090> there<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> lot<00:02:17.690> of

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
as you can see there is a lot of

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.240 
as you can see there is a lot of
roughness<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.380> which<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.739> could<00:02:18.860> not<00:02:19.040> get

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
roughness to it which I could not get

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.580 
roughness to it which I could not get
smooth<00:02:19.610> all<00:02:19.880> out<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.690> had<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> couple<00:02:21.440> of

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
smooth all out I had a couple of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.870 
smooth all out I had a couple of
different<00:02:21.890> ideas<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.459> thought<00:02:22.610> was<00:02:22.760> gonna

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
different ideas that I thought was gonna

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.699 
different ideas that I thought was gonna
be<00:02:22.970> able<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.180> implement<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.989> based

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
be able to implement in this one based

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.820 
be able to implement in this one based
off<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.100> experience<00:02:25.940> from<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.450> last<00:02:26.690> few<00:02:27.080> but

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
off of experience from the last few but

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.920 
off of experience from the last few but
it<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.220> didn't<00:02:28.430> work<00:02:28.489> out<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:28.850> me<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.810> went

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
it just didn't work out for me so I went

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.360 
it just didn't work out for me so I went
with<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.739> version<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.550> idea<00:02:32.260> as<00:02:33.370> you

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
with this version and this idea as you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.759 
with this version and this idea as you
will<00:02:34.580> see<00:02:34.819> is<00:02:35.060> very<00:02:35.390> very<00:02:35.720> stable<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.650> is

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
will see is very very stable and that is

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.830 
will see is very very stable and that is
the<00:02:36.890> best<00:02:37.100> part<00:02:37.310> about<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:38.000> could<00:02:38.180> very

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
the best part about it you could very

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.830 
the best part about it you could very
much<00:02:39.080> use<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:39.500> as<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:40.220> play<00:02:40.519> play<00:02:41.180> thing<00:02:41.480> going

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
much use this as a play play thing going

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.120 
much use this as a play play thing going
around<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.019> house<00:02:42.200> swinging<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.650> around<00:02:42.709> and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
around the house swinging it around and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.259 
around the house swinging it around and
you're<00:02:43.220> not<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.430> worry<00:02:43.489> about<00:02:43.670> stuff<00:02:43.970> breaking

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
you're not to worry about stuff breaking

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.410 
you're not to worry about stuff breaking
off<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:45.580> usual<00:02:46.580> folks<00:02:46.819> thanks<00:02:47.299> for
