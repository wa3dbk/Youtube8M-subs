this<00:01:23.930> when<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.170> first<00:01:24.350> start<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.310> was

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
this when you first start so that was

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.460 
this when you first start so that was
fine<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:26.090> clip<00:01:26.270> this<00:01:26.390> on<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.840> after<00:01:27.140> my<00:01:27.229> turn

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
fine I clip this on and after my turn

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.170 
fine I clip this on and after my turn
for<00:01:27.650> time<00:01:27.890> using<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.340> decided<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.729> take<00:01:28.940> off

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
for time using it I decided to take off

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.359 
for time using it I decided to take off
this<00:01:29.510> contraption<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.290> just<00:01:30.920> use<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.130> without

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
this contraption and just use it without

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.130 
this contraption and just use it without
this<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:31.760> did<00:01:32.000> notice<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.360> huge<00:01:32.540> difference<00:01:32.630> in

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
this I did notice a huge difference in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.980 
this I did notice a huge difference in
that<00:01:33.320> my<00:01:33.860> hair<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.909> just<00:01:35.150> got<00:01:35.450> curly<00:01:35.689> way

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
that my hair it just got curly way

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.840 
that my hair it just got curly way
quicker<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:37.100> think<00:01:37.490> that's<00:01:37.640> obviously

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
quicker and I think that's obviously

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.969 
quicker and I think that's obviously
because<00:01:38.090> more<00:01:38.450> surface<00:01:39.020> area<00:01:39.140> for<00:01:39.500> your<00:01:39.619> hair

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
because more surface area for your hair

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.760 
because more surface area for your hair
to<00:01:40.159> touch<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.549> actual<00:01:40.670> barrel<00:01:41.119> I<00:01:41.560> will<00:01:42.560> say

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
to touch the actual barrel I will say

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.469 
to touch the actual barrel I will say
the<00:01:42.979> first<00:01:43.130> two<00:01:43.369> times<00:01:43.549> are<00:01:43.790> using<00:01:44.030> eyes<00:01:44.150> or

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
the first two times are using eyes or

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.600 
the first two times are using eyes or
whatever<00:01:44.780> definitely<00:01:45.320> use<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.740> safety<00:01:46.070> thing

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
whatever definitely use the safety thing

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.940 
whatever definitely use the safety thing
but<00:01:47.270> after<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:48.020> once<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.380> get<00:01:48.530> used<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.860> it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
but after that once you get used to it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.770 
but after that once you get used to it
then<00:01:49.369> definitely<00:01:49.700> take<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.090> off<00:01:50.210> because<00:01:50.509> it's

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
then definitely take it off because it's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.539 
then definitely take it off because it's
much<00:01:50.900> better<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.560> gist<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:51.979> basically<00:01:52.340> that

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
much better the gist is basically that

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.460 
much better the gist is basically that
you<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.880> curl<00:01:53.570> your<00:01:53.659> hair<00:01:53.840> around<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.320> and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
you just curl your hair around it and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.050 
you just curl your hair around it and
you<00:01:54.590> hold<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.040> like<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.549> then<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.880> thing

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
you hold it like this and then the thing

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.880 
you hold it like this and then the thing
will<00:01:56.240> start<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.259> barrel<00:01:57.500> will<00:01:57.650> start<00:01:57.829> to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
will start to the barrel will start to

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.859 
will start to the barrel will start to
spin<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.369> then<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.790> just<00:01:58.939> let<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.299> go<00:01:59.420> and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
spin and then you just let it go and

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.630 
spin and then you just let it go and
it'll<00:02:00.079> be<00:02:00.140> curly<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.860> can<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.490> my

a really good plus because I just can

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.559 
a really good plus because I just can
never<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.519> that<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:24.670> with<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:24.970> ght<00:02:25.390> it

never get that right with the ght it

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.600 
never get that right with the ght it
leaves<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.900> loads<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.200> dents<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:27.160> curling

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
leaves like loads of dents the curling

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.640 
leaves like loads of dents the curling
want<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.480> curling<00:02:28.810> aspect<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.290> love<00:02:29.530> it

and like nice soft curls also a huge
plus<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.970> think<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.660> adding

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
plus with this I think is the adding

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.229 
plus with this I think is the adding
volume<00:02:35.530> which<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.489> know<00:02:36.550> is<00:02:36.790> such<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> problem

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
volume which I know is such a problem

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.809 
volume which I know is such a problem
for<00:02:37.360> most<00:02:37.599> people<00:02:37.930> luckily<00:02:38.230> for<00:02:38.739> me<00:02:38.819> volume

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
for most people luckily for me volume

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.309 
for most people luckily for me volume
isn't<00:02:40.000> really<00:02:40.269> an<00:02:40.330> issue<00:02:40.420> because<00:02:40.780> as<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.230> can

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
isn't really an issue because as you can

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.619 
isn't really an issue because as you can
see<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.560> have<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> lot<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.220> hair<00:02:42.549> in<00:02:42.580> my<00:02:42.760> head<00:02:42.940> and

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
see I have a lot of hair in my head and

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.780 
see I have a lot of hair in my head and
that<00:02:43.930> being<00:02:44.560> said<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.950> find<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:45.580> my

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
that being said I find that because my

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.759 
that being said I find that because my
side<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.180> parting<00:02:46.510> us<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:46.810> far<00:02:47.019> over<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.530> side

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
side is parting us so far over this side

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.890 
side is parting us so far over this side
of<00:02:47.890> my<00:02:47.950> hair<00:02:48.130> does<00:02:48.459> look<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.730> bit<00:02:48.760> flat<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.299> what

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
of my hair does look a bit flat so what

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.890 
of my hair does look a bit flat so what
you<00:02:50.019> do<00:02:50.230> for<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:51.130> get<00:02:51.250> volume<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:51.900> you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
you do for it to get volume is you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.170 
you do for it to get volume is you
literally<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.410> put<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.769> under<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.519> roof

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
literally just put this under the roof

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.240 
literally just put this under the roof
and<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.599> just<00:02:56.170> kind<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.380> hold<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.860> like<00:02:57.040> that

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
and you just kind of hold it like that

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.520 
and you just kind of hold it like that
so<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.420> set<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.049> then<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.230> just<00:02:59.410> let

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
so if you set in and then you just let

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.740 
so if you set in and then you just let
it<00:02:59.620> go<00:02:59.769> let<00:03:00.280> make<00:03:00.519> sure<00:03:00.640> hair<00:03:00.760> bouncy<00:03:01.239> so<00:03:01.690> I

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
it go let make sure hair bouncy so I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.120 
it go let make sure hair bouncy so I
think<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.200> were<00:03:02.290> somebody<00:03:02.620> who<00:03:02.650> had<00:03:02.860> like

fine in her hair or layered hair I think

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.809

heavy<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.360> even<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:08.049> can<00:03:08.170> see<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.590> like

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
heavy and even you can see that like

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.620 
heavy and even you can see that like
it's<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.069> bit<00:03:09.220> plumper<00:03:09.579> than<00:03:09.700> usual<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.299> I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
it's a bit plumper than usual and I

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.270 
it's a bit plumper than usual and I
didn't<00:03:10.900> even<00:03:10.989> try<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.560> really<00:03:11.890> do<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.160> that

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
didn't even try and really do with that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.530 
didn't even try and really do with that
much<00:03:12.400> volume<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.819> live<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.209> did<00:03:13.329> for<00:03:13.480> a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
much volume I live you just did for a

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.030 
much volume I live you just did for a
few<00:03:13.660> seconds<00:03:14.019> there<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.290> little<00:03:14.620> bit<00:03:14.860> there

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
few seconds there a little bit there

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.940 
few seconds there a little bit there
another<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.910> pro<00:03:16.209> is<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.840> curls<00:03:17.109> last<00:03:17.319> for

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
another a pro is that the curls last for

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.530 
another a pro is that the curls last for
so<00:03:18.130> long<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.000> say<00:03:19.120> they're<00:03:19.299> really

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
so long I have to say they're really

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.539 
so long I have to say they're really
really<00:03:19.780> long<00:03:19.989> lasting<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:21.100> put<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> bit<00:03:21.459> of

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
really long lasting and I put a bit of

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.979 
really long lasting and I put a bit of
hairspray<00:03:21.700> in<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.180> then<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.299> literally<00:03:22.750> last

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
hairspray in and then I literally last

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.539 
hairspray in and then I literally last
the<00:03:23.260> whole<00:03:23.410> day<00:03:23.440> with<00:03:24.130> all<00:03:24.220> those<00:03:24.340> things

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
the whole day with all those things

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.099 
the whole day with all those things
combined<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:25.120> have<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.359> say<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.630> I'm<00:03:25.720> really

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
combined I have to say that I'm really

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.410 
combined I have to say that I'm really
really<00:03:26.470> really<00:03:26.680> happy<00:03:26.950> with<00:03:27.069> this<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.239> the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
really really happy with this and the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.150 
really really happy with this and the
one<00:03:28.810> con<00:03:29.319> or<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.069> few<00:03:30.280> cons<00:03:30.519> I'd<00:03:30.790> say<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.299> that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
one con or the few cons I'd say is that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.280 
one con or the few cons I'd say is that
for<00:03:33.160> me<00:03:33.310> from<00:03:33.790> my<00:03:33.910> hair<00:03:34.150> type<00:03:34.359> which<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.780> curly

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
for me from my hair type which is curly

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.650 
for me from my hair type which is curly
and<00:03:35.470> thick<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.880> not<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.180> good<00:03:37.450> hair

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
and thick this is not a good hair

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.569 
and thick this is not a good hair
straightener<00:03:38.049> for<00:03:38.170> me<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.440> mean<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:39.069> does<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
straightener for me I mean it does the

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.360 
straightener for me I mean it does the
job<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.269> no<00:03:40.600> way<00:03:40.630> compares<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.380> GHD<00:03:41.920> for

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
job but in no way compares the GHD for

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.030 
job but in no way compares the GHD for
straightening<00:03:42.760> my<00:03:43.150> hair<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.530> have<00:03:44.560> just

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
straightening my hair if you have just

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800 
straightening my hair if you have just
slightly<00:03:45.280> wavy<00:03:45.519> thin<00:03:45.940> hair<00:03:46.180> or<00:03:46.480> fine<00:03:46.780> hair

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
slightly wavy thin hair or fine hair

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.180 
slightly wavy thin hair or fine hair
then<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.319> think<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:47.709> will<00:03:47.859> straighten<00:03:48.040> your

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
then I think this will straighten your

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.500 
then I think this will straighten your
hair<00:03:48.250> really<00:03:48.579> well<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.150> nice<00:03:49.329> because

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
hair really well and it is nice because

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.020 
hair really well and it is nice because
it<00:03:49.600> has<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> brush<00:03:50.049> in<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.889> so<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.280> can<00:03:51.639> you

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
it has the brush in it so you can you

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.400 
it has the brush in it so you can you
know<00:03:52.060> brush<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.600> as<00:03:52.720> you're<00:03:52.930> straightening<00:03:53.170> it

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
know brush it as you're straightening it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.430 
know brush it as you're straightening it
but<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.519> just<00:03:54.970> find<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.480> GHD<00:03:56.049> doesn't

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
but I just find that the GHD doesn't

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.750 
but I just find that the GHD doesn't
much<00:03:56.560> better<00:03:56.799> job<00:03:57.010> I'm<00:03:57.250> making<00:03:57.519> my<00:03:57.609> hair

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
much better job I'm making my hair

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.819 
much better job I'm making my hair
really<00:03:58.000> straighter<00:03:58.420> than<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.560> I

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
really straighter than this so I

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.890 
really straighter than this so I
definitely<00:04:00.040> wouldn't<00:04:00.430> get<00:04:00.609> this<00:04:00.819> just<00:04:01.780> for

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
definitely wouldn't get this just for

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.390 
definitely wouldn't get this just for
the<00:04:01.959> straightening<00:04:02.440> purposes<00:04:02.829> at<00:04:02.980> all<00:04:03.160> I

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
the straightening purposes at all I

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.500 
the straightening purposes at all I
didn't<00:04:03.700> get<00:04:03.819> this<00:04:03.970> for<00:04:04.180> our<00:04:04.299> hair

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
didn't get this for our hair

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.690 
didn't get this for our hair
straightener<00:04:04.959> because<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.260> have<00:04:05.620> one<00:04:05.769> but<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
straightener because I have one but the

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.180 
straightener because I have one but the
curling<00:04:07.120> aspect<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.019> is<00:04:08.470> great<00:04:08.980> and

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
curling aspect of this is great and

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.740 
curling aspect of this is great and
probably<00:04:09.669> the<00:04:09.730> best<00:04:09.910> curler<00:04:10.269> I<00:04:10.419> have<00:04:10.569> ever

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
probably the best curler I have ever

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.559 
probably the best curler I have ever
used<00:04:11.220> another<00:04:12.220> con<00:04:12.519> would<00:04:12.760> be<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:13.419> it's

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
used another con would be that it's

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.479 
used another con would be that it's
quite<00:04:13.750> finicky<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.859> literally<00:04:15.160> cannot

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
quite finicky and you literally cannot

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.180 
quite finicky and you literally cannot
touch<00:04:15.819> anywhere<00:04:16.630> here<00:04:16.959> because<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:17.979> hot

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
touch anywhere here because it is so hot

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.460 
touch anywhere here because it is so hot
so<00:04:18.849> like<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.299> did<00:04:19.599> find<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.079> kind<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.320> have

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
so like I did find that you kind of have

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.140 
so like I did find that you kind of have
to<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.650> get<00:04:20.950> used<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.549> where<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.849> put<00:04:22.030> your

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
to just get used to where you put your

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.650 
to just get used to where you put your
hand

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
hand

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.330 
hand
I<00:04:22.720> know<00:04:23.380> with<00:04:23.590> other<00:04:23.740> hair<00:04:23.950> straighteners

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
I know with other hair straighteners

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.190 
I know with other hair straighteners
with<00:04:24.670> her<00:04:24.910> curlers<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.390> can<00:04:25.510> kind<00:04:25.720> of<00:04:25.780> hold

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
with her curlers you can kind of hold

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.290 
with her curlers you can kind of hold
the<00:04:26.470> top<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.890> might<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.670> that<00:04:27.700> but<00:04:28.000> you

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
the top I might do this and that but you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.060 
the top I might do this and that but you
come<00:04:28.480> out<00:04:28.510> with<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.870> so<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.140> can<00:04:29.290> only<00:04:29.680> hold<00:04:29.950> it

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
come out with it so you can only hold it

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.540 
come out with it so you can only hold it
here<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.060> do<00:04:31.330> find<00:04:31.870> that<00:04:32.290> that's<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.400> bit

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
here so I do find that that's a bit

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.430 
here so I do find that that's a bit
finicky<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.060> just<00:04:34.450> but<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:34.840> think<00:04:35.170> that's<00:04:35.350> just

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
finicky and just but I think that's just

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.600 
finicky and just but I think that's just
a<00:04:35.530> case<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.710> getting<00:04:35.860> used<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.430> and

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
a case of getting used to it and

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.850 
a case of getting used to it and
practicing<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.240> think<00:04:37.930> it'd<00:04:38.230> be<00:04:38.260> great<00:04:38.470> if<00:04:38.560> they

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
practicing I think it'd be great if they

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.340 
practicing I think it'd be great if they
did<00:04:39.010> add<00:04:39.250> like<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.820> bit<00:04:40.480> here<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.140> could

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
did add like a bit here that you could

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.100 
did add like a bit here that you could
hold<00:04:41.530> on<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:42.180> but<00:04:43.180> yeah<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:43.540> that<00:04:43.690> was<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:43.870> guess

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
hold on to but yeah so that was I guess

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.020 
hold on to but yeah so that was I guess
just<00:04:44.350> one<00:04:44.590> con<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.130> just<00:04:45.340> thought<00:04:45.460> was

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
just one con that I just thought was

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.820 
just one con that I just thought was
quite<00:04:46.240> annoying<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:46.990> just<00:04:47.380> your<00:04:47.590> hand

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
quite annoying is that just your hand

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.620 
quite annoying is that just your hand
positioning<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:48.970> just<00:04:49.150> takes<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.360> little<00:04:49.510> while

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
positioning so just takes a little while

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.300 
positioning so just takes a little while
to<00:04:49.780> get<00:04:49.870> used<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.230> but<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.830> didn't<00:04:50.980> want<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.130> stop

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
to get used to but I didn't want to stop

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.100 
to get used to but I didn't want to stop
holding<00:04:51.460> myself<00:04:51.970> because<00:04:52.270> I'm<00:04:52.570> kind<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.870> feel

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
holding myself because I'm kind of feel

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.310
