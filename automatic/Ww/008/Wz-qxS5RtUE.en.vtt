 in his group 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:54.420
 I want it to have started 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.420
 research I believe myself to black on black 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:04.620
 I was not good 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.599
 it was cats hearing these words at 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.599
 movement 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:38.370
 gold is not good to go up hair 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.270
 at the end 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.819
 before this announcement that will carry my 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:18.730

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.940
 never know when we pause 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.680
 video and games why not so here it is 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.980
 so I managed to find what we 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:39.220
 have played because we know what 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.370
 he does to find the best 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:53.440
 videos 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:04:07.560
 so what do we need to understand 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:07.560
 charge three names often seem 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:33.070
 and that's what we think so I 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:33.070
 follow us 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:48.749

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:50.459
 movement so look at these fees have 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:54.139
 behaved credit in 15 minutes 

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.139
 so the first black lady 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.370
 ok I will vote other than that they are not 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:11.319
 everything I choose to go 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.569
 train by test because I know 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:18.129
 not even why I summoned it 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:21.699
 sometimes lacking that's the quantity but 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:25.930
 rock what these votes or choose them for 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:30.729
 account and after I see it's not even 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.399
 that what you needed in fact you see 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:39.029
 she was born your if not because he 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:39.029
 needs to genre in three themes evoke 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:06:12.839
 a little bit and chorus parade 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:06:12.839
 evoked a program in play 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:21.569

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.520

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.500
 point music was but only imposes that 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.150
 that they show me so I 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.860
 impose me we find ourselves quickly we get 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:47.750
 find some 15 thousand this meal 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:49.790

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.910
 after 15 minutes but 22:21 and when 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.180
 there is a death that is their strength and 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.440
 22:14 I think I have more than their gifts 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.730
 we were waiting for and that is to find 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:08.560
 her lands that she offers I believe they 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.560
 have not removed and that we have them must 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.020
