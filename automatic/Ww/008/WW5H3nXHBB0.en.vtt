00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
to the tabs it actually saves a live

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.100 
to the tabs it actually saves a live
thumbnail<00:02:45.700> tile<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.420> where<00:02:46.570> if<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.959> were<00:02:47.080> to

scroll down a bit it just saves it where
you<00:02:49.630> are<00:02:49.810> let's<00:02:50.140> say<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.500> example<00:02:50.830> if<00:02:50.920> I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
you are let's say for example if I

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.740 
you are let's say for example if I
wanted<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.280> go<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.580> star<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.209> can<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
wanted to go in and star that I can and

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.360 
wanted to go in and star that I can and
if<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.930> wanted<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.320> go<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.500> infinite<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.100> also

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
if I wanted to go to infinite it also

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.800 
if I wanted to go to infinite it also
gives<00:02:54.670> me<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.850> option<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.270> go<00:02:55.480> ahead<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.690> name

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.300 
gives me the option to go ahead and name
it<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.320> if<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.590> wanted<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.040> could<00:02:57.280> put
