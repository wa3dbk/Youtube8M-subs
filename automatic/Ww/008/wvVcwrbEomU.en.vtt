00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
look but unless it's a street shark why

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.550 
look but unless it's a street shark why
do<00:01:41.490> sharks<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.939> legs<00:01:42.259> at<00:01:43.259> least<00:01:43.439> they

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
do sharks have legs at least they

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.160 
do sharks have legs at least they
included<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> fin<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:45.420> make<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> seem<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
included like a fin to make it seem that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.160 
included like a fin to make it seem that
way<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.770> am<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.820> too<00:01:48.119> terribly<00:01:48.509> upset<00:01:48.810> over<00:01:49.079> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
way I am not too terribly upset over it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
way I am not too terribly upset over it
I<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.470> think<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.009> funny<00:01:50.220> but

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I just think it's kind of funny but

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.670 
I just think it's kind of funny but
overall<00:01:51.329> he's<00:01:51.540> pretty<00:01:51.780> small<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.470> have

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
overall he's pretty small I don't have

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.740 
overall he's pretty small I don't have
Giroux<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.310> compare<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:53.939> he's<00:01:54.570> like

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
Giroux to compare it to but he's like

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.080 
Giroux to compare it to but he's like
really<00:01:54.869> big<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> size<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.729> actual

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
really big like the size of the actual

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.510 
really big like the size of the actual
swords<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.899> he's<00:01:58.409> pretty<00:01:58.590> small<00:01:59.009> compared<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
swords so he's pretty small compared to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.880 
swords so he's pretty small compared to
it<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.570> still<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:00.960> he<00:02:01.049> doesn't<00:02:01.229> look<00:02:01.619> too

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it but I still think he doesn't look too

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.649 
it but I still think he doesn't look too
bad<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> pain<00:02:02.759> details<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.420> him<00:02:03.540> are

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
end which actually looks kind of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.840 
end which actually looks kind of
different<00:02:55.800> but<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.310> might<00:02:56.520> be<00:02:56.610> reading<00:02:56.730> too

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
different but I might be reading too

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.300 
different but I might be reading too
much<00:02:56.970> into<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.360> overall<00:02:58.170> not<00:02:58.350> bad<00:02:58.620> when<00:02:59.280> I

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
much into that overall not bad when I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.699 
much into that overall not bad when I
first<00:02:59.580> saw<00:02:59.760> these<00:03:00.000> um<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.840> thought<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.650> was

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
first saw these um I thought that it was

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.140 
first saw these um I thought that it was
a<00:03:01.770> swappable<00:03:02.130> head<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.730> actually<00:03:02.850> put

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
a swappable head but you actually put

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.479 
a swappable head but you actually put
the<00:03:03.180> helmet<00:03:03.360> on<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.709> looks<00:03:04.890> kind<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.160> derpy

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the helmet on and it looks kind of derpy

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.699 
the helmet on and it looks kind of derpy
to<00:03:05.610> me<00:03:05.760> like<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> doesn't<00:03:06.300> look<00:03:06.450> too<00:03:06.750> bad<00:03:06.780> but

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
to me like it doesn't look too bad but

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.780 
to me like it doesn't look too bad but
it<00:03:07.800> almost<00:03:07.920> looks<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.340> little<00:03:08.489> kid

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
it almost looks like a little kid

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.100 
it almost looks like a little kid
dressed<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.270> or<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> female<00:03:10.080> version

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
dressed up or like the female version

and<00:06:28.650> let<00:06:29.650> it<00:06:29.770> up<00:06:29.889> proper<00:06:30.449> there<00:06:31.449> we<00:06:31.510> go<00:06:31.690> and

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
and let it up proper there we go and

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.469 
and let it up proper there we go and

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
then you just snap these holes and pegs

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.870 
then you just snap these holes and pegs
on<00:06:34.660> the<00:06:34.690> sides<00:06:36.540> there<00:06:37.540> you<00:06:37.600> go

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
on the sides there you go

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.920 
on the sides there you go
ironically<00:06:39.880> there<00:06:40.180> I<00:06:40.210> don't<00:06:40.660> know<00:06:40.750> if<00:06:40.810> it's

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
ironically there I don't know if it's

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.300 
ironically there I don't know if it's
ironic<00:06:41.110> but<00:06:41.350> it's<00:06:41.530> pretty<00:06:41.680> funny<00:06:41.889> this<00:06:42.040> review

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
ironic but it's pretty funny this review

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
will probably come out before my review

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.260 
will probably come out before my review
of<00:06:43.840> the<00:06:44.440> rest<00:06:44.650> of<00:06:44.860> the<00:06:44.919> samurai<00:06:45.130> line<00:06:45.550> which<00:06:46.150> I

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
of the rest of the samurai line which I

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.879 
of the rest of the samurai line which I
still<00:06:46.510> make<00:06:46.690> that<00:06:46.870> it<00:06:47.020> here<00:06:47.260> I'm<00:06:47.470> not<00:06:47.710> sure

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
still make that it here I'm not sure

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:48.840 
still make that it here I'm not sure
where<00:06:48.040> I'm<00:06:48.130> going<00:06:48.160> to<00:06:48.340> stick<00:06:48.520> this<00:06:48.610> in<00:06:48.790> the

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
where I'm going to stick this in the

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.070 
where I'm going to stick this in the
review<00:06:49.090> but<00:06:49.180> it's<00:06:49.270> going<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.419> be<00:06:49.510> edited<00:06:49.930> in

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
review but it's going to be edited in

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.170 
review but it's going to be edited in
the<00:06:50.290> shark<00:06:51.010> sword<00:06:51.310> came<00:06:51.580> with<00:06:51.729> this<00:06:51.910> little

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
the shark sword came with this little

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.969 
the shark sword came with this little
origami<00:06:52.510> paper<00:06:52.960> thing<00:06:53.320> which<00:06:53.470> I<00:06:53.620> think<00:06:53.860> I've

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
origami paper thing which I think I've

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.680 
origami paper thing which I think I've
done<00:06:54.190> right<00:06:54.430> just<00:06:55.120> a<00:06:55.210> bunch<00:06:55.360> of<00:06:55.419> different

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
done right just a bunch of different

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.810 
done right just a bunch of different
pieces<00:06:55.810> you<00:06:56.080> stick<00:06:56.320> together<00:06:56.470> of<00:06:56.860> the<00:06:57.550> shark

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
pieces you stick together of the shark

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.520 
pieces you stick together of the shark
sword<00:06:58.120> which<00:06:58.360> is<00:06:58.540> I<00:06:58.750> guess<00:06:58.780> kind<00:06:59.169> of<00:06:59.260> a<00:06:59.350> neat

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
sword which is I guess kind of a neat

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.890 
sword which is I guess kind of a neat
and<00:06:59.740> including<00:07:00.400> inclusion<00:07:01.060> and<00:07:01.240> right<00:07:01.720> here

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
and including inclusion and right here

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.200 
and including inclusion and right here
actually<00:07:02.199> says<00:07:02.350> origami<00:07:02.919> shark<00:07:03.310> sword<00:07:03.610> which

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
actually says origami shark sword which

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.510 
actually says origami shark sword which
i<00:07:04.330> think<00:07:04.389> is<00:07:04.600> funny<00:07:04.840> because<00:07:05.370> they're<00:07:06.370> not

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
i think is funny because they're not

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.620 
i think is funny because they're not
using<00:07:06.669> the<00:07:06.850> word<00:07:06.970> origami<00:07:07.300> in<00:07:07.449> the<00:07:07.510> show

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
using the word origami in the show

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.790 
using the word origami in the show
they're<00:07:07.780> calling<00:07:07.990> it<00:07:08.080> foldingzord<00:07:08.560> which<00:07:08.710> I

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
they're calling it foldingzord which I

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.469 
they're calling it foldingzord which I
thought<00:07:08.949> was<00:07:09.039> stupid<00:07:09.430> but<00:07:10.000> so<00:07:10.090> yeah<00:07:10.210> this<00:07:10.330> is<00:07:10.389> a

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
thought was stupid but so yeah this is a

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.210 
thought was stupid but so yeah this is a
little<00:07:10.690> extra<00:07:10.930> alright<00:07:11.590> back<00:07:11.860> to<00:07:12.010> the<00:07:12.100> review

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.220 
little extra alright back to the review

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.129 
little extra alright back to the review
all<00:07:12.610> right<00:07:12.729> so<00:07:12.880> it<00:07:13.030> looks<00:07:13.270> I<00:07:13.539> still<00:07:13.840> think<00:07:14.080> that

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
all right so it looks I still think that

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:15.870 
all right so it looks I still think that
the<00:07:14.410> obviously<00:07:14.830> the<00:07:14.919> regular<00:07:15.280> battling<00:07:15.699> looks

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
the obviously the regular battling looks

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.430 
the obviously the regular battling looks
better<00:07:16.090> because<00:07:16.720> of<00:07:16.960> how<00:07:17.050> well<00:07:17.260> it<00:07:17.350> was

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
better because of how well it was

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.070 
better because of how well it was
designed<00:07:17.800> streamlined<00:07:18.400> wise<00:07:18.580> at<00:07:19.510> least<00:07:19.660> like

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
designed streamlined wise at least like

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.480 
designed streamlined wise at least like
in<00:07:20.199> the<00:07:20.320> Japanese<00:07:20.710> version<00:07:21.010> and<00:07:21.070> then<00:07:21.250> in<00:07:21.370> that

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 
in the Japanese version and then in that

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.400 
in the Japanese version and then in that
version<00:07:21.669> but<00:07:22.360> it<00:07:22.449> still<00:07:22.690> looks<00:07:22.810> kind<00:07:23.080> of<00:07:23.139> neat

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410 
version but it still looks kind of neat

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.140 
version but it still looks kind of neat
like<00:07:23.590> the<00:07:23.710> way<00:07:23.800> these<00:07:23.949> are<00:07:24.100> all<00:07:24.160> pointed<00:07:24.639> and

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
like the way these are all pointed and

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.400 
like the way these are all pointed and
it's<00:07:25.270> just<00:07:25.419> kind<00:07:25.570> of<00:07:25.630> a<00:07:25.750> cool<00:07:25.900> neat<00:07:26.169> thing<00:07:26.380> to

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
it's just kind of a cool neat thing to

of<00:07:39.700> this<00:07:39.789> filming<00:07:39.970> I<00:07:40.240> might<00:07:40.389> wait<00:07:40.510> for<00:07:40.539> it<00:07:40.750> to

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
of this filming I might wait for it to

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.350 
of this filming I might wait for it to
go<00:07:40.900> to<00:07:40.960> like<00:07:41.080> Walmart<00:07:41.440> or<00:07:41.560> Kmart<00:07:42.000> but<00:07:43.000> I<00:07:43.030> still

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 
go to like Walmart or Kmart but I still

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.670 
go to like Walmart or Kmart but I still
think<00:07:43.539> it's<00:07:43.630> it's<00:07:43.870> a<00:07:43.960> fun<00:07:44.139> addition<00:07:44.380> to<00:07:44.590> the

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
think it's it's a fun addition to the

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.800 
think it's it's a fun addition to the
line<00:07:44.919> and<00:07:45.880> it<00:07:46.030> doesn't<00:07:46.300> look<00:07:46.389> bad<00:07:46.510> on<00:07:46.690> the

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810 
line and it doesn't look bad on the

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.029 
line and it doesn't look bad on the
Shelf<00:07:47.050> and<00:07:47.200> it<00:07:47.260> certainly<00:07:47.470> saves<00:07:47.800> you<00:07:47.919> money

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 
Shelf and it certainly saves you money

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:50.460 
Shelf and it certainly saves you money
because<00:07:49.030> of<00:07:49.270> how<00:07:49.360> expensive<00:07:49.570> cure<00:07:50.050> can<00:07:50.260> be<00:07:50.349> to

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:50.470 
because of how expensive cure can be to

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.070 
because of how expensive cure can be to
ship<00:07:50.680> so<00:07:50.919> it's<00:07:51.520> not<00:07:51.729> like<00:07:52.090> the<00:07:52.270> up<00:07:52.750> there<00:07:52.900> with

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 
ship so it's not like the up there with

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.050 
ship so it's not like the up there with
my<00:07:53.200> greatest<00:07:53.470> Megazord<00:07:54.190> figures<00:07:54.580> hour<00:07:54.760> but<00:07:55.030> I

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
my greatest Megazord figures hour but I
