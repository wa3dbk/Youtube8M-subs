here<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.260> brief<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> point<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
here it's brief to the point you have to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
here it's brief to the point you have to
close<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.260> screws<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.010> mounting

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
close and two screws here for mounting

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.400 
close and two screws here for mounting
and<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.550> receiving<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.600> also<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and it receiving and also then if you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.630 
and it receiving and also then if you
look<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.739> picture<00:00:55.980> spoke<00:00:56.460> around<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
look at this picture spoke around and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.849 
look at this picture spoke around and
just<00:00:59.640> really<00:01:00.000> exactly<00:01:00.510> okay<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.710> see

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
just really exactly okay so you can see

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.920 
just really exactly okay so you can see
basically<00:01:02.370> anyway<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.090> first<00:01:03.270> thing<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
basically anyway the first thing here is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.200 
basically anyway the first thing here is
a<00:01:03.960> two<00:01:04.260> point<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.129> black<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> two

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a two point one the black one is a two

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.100 
a two point one the black one is a two
point<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.659> millimeter<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.470> twelve<00:01:08.369> volt<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
point one millimeter and twelve volt and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.980 
point one millimeter and twelve volt and
70<00:01:10.110> milliamps<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.740> powered<00:01:11.729> feed<00:01:11.970> okay<00:01:12.600> let's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
70 milliamps and powered feed okay let's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.230 
70 milliamps and powered feed okay let's
actually<00:01:13.200> parity<00:01:13.680> camera<00:01:13.950> itself<00:01:14.189> next<00:01:15.030> in

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
actually parity camera itself next in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.719 
actually parity camera itself next in
the<00:01:15.360> yellow<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> BNC<00:01:16.560> type<00:01:17.009> connection<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the yellow is a BNC type connection I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.670 
the yellow is a BNC type connection I
make<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> purpose<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.259> able<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> come

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
make the purpose is to be able to come

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.969 
make the purpose is to be able to come
along<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.700> feed<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.500> picture<00:01:22.500> from

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
along and actually feed the picture from

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
along and actually feed the picture from
the<00:01:23.130> camera<00:01:23.159> directly<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> TV<00:01:24.450> such<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.869> we

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the camera directly to a TV such as we

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
the camera directly to a TV such as we
have<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> final<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.430> an<00:01:26.549> optional

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
have here and the final is an optional

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
have here and the final is an optional
one<00:01:27.119> where<00:01:27.330> he<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:28.049> built-in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
one where he can actually just built-in

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.289 
one where he can actually just built-in
microphone<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.000> actually

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
microphone into this so you can actually

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
microphone into this so you can actually
pick<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> sound<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.979> will<00:01:32.100> be

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
pick up the sound for it now will be

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
pick up the sound for it now will be
popular<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.360> certain<00:01:33.689> monies<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
popular for a certain monies of the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.920 
popular for a certain monies of the
covert<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.710> surely<00:01:35.640> its<00:01:35.850> people<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.659> usually

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
covert and surely its people are usually

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.749 
covert and surely its people are usually
higher<00:01:37.350> than<00:01:37.380> sometimes<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.159> businesses<00:01:38.579> as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
higher than sometimes in businesses as

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
higher than sometimes in businesses as
well<00:01:38.939> I'm<00:01:39.600> actually<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
well I'm actually going to do now is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.240 
well I'm actually going to do now is
just<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> quick<00:01:41.100> overview

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
just do a quick overview

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.650 
just do a quick overview
so<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.640> first<00:01:43.850> thing<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.030> do<00:01:44.150> is<00:01:44.270> actually<00:01:44.390> to

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
so the first thing to do is actually to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.620 
so the first thing to do is actually to
give<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:44.900> power<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:45.620> what<00:01:45.710> we<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:46.010> here<00:01:46.040> is<00:01:46.580> a

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
give it power so what we have here is a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.350 
give it power so what we have here is a
2m<00:01:47.630> 12<00:01:48.020> volt<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.470> power<00:01:48.890> supply<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.910> actually

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
2m 12 volt and power supply so actually

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.940 
2m 12 volt and power supply so actually
the<00:01:50.480> camera<00:01:50.660> powered<00:01:51.110> up<00:01:51.200> at<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.410> point

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
the camera powered up at this point

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.680 
the camera powered up at this point
the<00:01:52.430> next<00:01:52.700> thing<00:01:52.850> here<00:01:53.030> is<00:01:53.120> actually<00:01:53.420> take<00:01:53.570> the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
the next thing here is actually take the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.630 
the next thing here is actually take the
picture<00:01:54.080> from<00:01:54.290> camera<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.100> run<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.460> directly

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
picture from camera and run it directly

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
see actually the resolution picture is

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.740 
see actually the resolution picture is
extremely<00:02:09.619> good<00:02:09.830> okay<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:11.150> we're<00:02:11.330> going<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.600> do

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
extremely good okay so we're going to do

that one time is what we try to do is
you<00:02:15.080> can<00:02:15.230> try<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.470> actually<00:02:16.459> connect<00:02:16.790> this

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
you can try to actually connect this

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.330 
you can try to actually connect this
lead<00:02:17.510> here<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.380> what<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.740> here<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.130> lead

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
lead here so what I have here is a lead

lead here so what I have here is a lead
you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.060> see<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:22.610> not<00:02:22.850> see<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.240> or

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
see a pie plate and what we can do this

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.860 
see a pie plate and what we can do this
is<00:02:25.490> just<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.760> connect<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.390> extra<00:02:26.690> microphone

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
is just to connect the extra microphone

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.350 
thing back into the back of TV I'm going
to<00:02:29.990> do<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.230> rotate<00:02:30.950> around<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:31.670> basically<00:02:32.030> I

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
to do is rotate around but basically I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.510 
to do is rotate around but basically I
cannot<00:02:32.840> yet<00:02:33.140> expect<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> bureau<00:02:34.220> I'm

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
cannot yet expect that the bureau I'm

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.760 
cannot yet expect that the bureau I'm
just<00:02:35.209> going<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> push<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:35.780> lead<00:02:36.050> in<00:02:36.230> here<00:02:38.770> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
just going to push this lead in here and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.890 
just going to push this lead in here and
normally<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.670> pretty<00:02:40.850> obviously<00:02:41.450> you

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
normally this is pretty obviously you

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.850 
normally this is pretty obviously you
would<00:02:42.050> not<00:02:42.290> normally<00:02:42.560> have<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:45.440> camera

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
would not normally have the camera

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:56.650 
would not normally have the camera
microphone<00:02:46.580> very<00:02:47.360> close<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:54.730> am<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.850> camera<00:02:56.269> or

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
microphone very close I am a camera or

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.060 
microphone very close I am a camera or
something<00:02:56.989> like<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.590> might<00:02:57.769> be<00:02:57.860> able<00:02:57.920> to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
something like this you might be able to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.150 
something like this you might be able to
hear<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.200> camera<00:03:03.530> itself<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:04.010> actually

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
hear so the camera itself it's actually

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.220 
hear so the camera itself it's actually
quite<00:03:04.550> popular<00:03:04.820> it's<00:03:05.269> just<00:03:05.420> unique<00:03:05.720> ever

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
quite popular it's just unique ever

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.080 
quite popular it's just unique ever
design<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:07.040> relatively<00:03:07.459> simple<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.910> install

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
design it's relatively simple to install

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.449 
design it's relatively simple to install
it<00:03:08.690> meant<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.410> could<00:03:09.560> feed<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.860> directly<00:03:09.950> with

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
it meant you could feed it directly with

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.850 
it meant you could feed it directly with
EDR<00:03:10.880> bukhari<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.019> look<00:03:12.320> back<00:03:12.530> at<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.739> later

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
EDR bukhari and look back at a later

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.360 
EDR bukhari and look back at a later
point<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.400> see<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.940> check<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.040> not

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
point to see and check that so not
