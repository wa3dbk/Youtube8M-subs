 greeting to all of you and good as 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.410

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.180
 my smash channel sees the easy trick 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.090
 Well I is coming out a little of what 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.329
 that I am doing so far in the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:39.720
 canal maya trick easy that about magic 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:44.100
 that teaches good magic because of what 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:48.240
 I asked friends Barcelona 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.020
 Spain and Argentina that I eat 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.620
 Argentinian 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.850
 as no no I do not make a video videos for 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.910
 teach to play the Argentine trick and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.960
 well then I liked the idea and I took 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.170
 the decision and good and in the next 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.320
 videos I will be teaching this 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.350
 remember the Argentine trick that I do not 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.600
 was going has clarified this good here the most or 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.299
 less this one 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.350
 tell him about this game about 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.860
 Argentine trick is a game very very 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.690
 fun to play the friend that in 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 families that we play 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:41.330
 after a good roast this and it 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.550
 they play with cards with 40 cards that I 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.320
 then I'll be showing him the mallet 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.119
 of cards with which one plays and plays 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.619
 for points 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.740
 that is to play for points but 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:03.410
 how nice of this game putting this 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.020
 game is not just say in winning the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.020
 points 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.200
 if not 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.110
 if you are going to have a particular 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.080
 particularity that is nice because it is a 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.540
 game where one shows all his 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.379
 skill I'll give you an example 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.459
 the player saw when the player plays 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:31.909
 soccer likes to excel likes 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.280
 we must demonstrate their skills in the 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:38.629
 center feels important because 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.310
 demonstrates his ability to play at 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.140
 football 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.340
 doing good this is pretty much what 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.379
 same 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.370
 because here you have to have skill but 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.190
 good not physical but if we say mentally 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.670
 you have to be a little bit chopped to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.550
 to lie because it's based on knowing 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.680
 lie very well that's what I want to clarify 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.680
 it's a game of mischief is pretty much 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.120
 as 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.189
 the poker that poker has what 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.280
 enemy 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:19.040
 would have you believe that has 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.680
 letters better than then in that 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.230
 is also the trick in making him 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.450
 believe our opposite that we 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.879
 we have 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.400
 better letters than him even though he does not 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.639
 we have although we have letters that do not 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.840
 they're worth nothing but that's pizza is 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.840
 let say 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.830
 the key point let's say what is cute 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.200
 of the trick to lie but know how to lie 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.750
 fine true try to lie to our 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.900
 enemy to make him believe that we 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.629
 we have more letters than him or better 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.560
 letters the best value versus then 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.680
 that's that's the nice thing about this this 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.400
 game there are friends that's why I'm going to 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.540
 try to make it more explicit 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.569
 possible for you to learn it 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.180
 and you appreciate this game, it's not 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.910
 worry if they are not yet 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.389
 understanding nothing do not worry because 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.360
 in the course of the next video 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.539
 I 'm going to explain 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.840
 step by step and there you are going to give 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:37.680
 text account of what I just did 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:42.479
 say that it is a game of mischief 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.260
 of knowing how to lie very well and good to me 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.450
 personal taste 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.250
 I can tell you that I love myself 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.620
 love playing this game by trick 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.409
 because good as I say to me 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.929
 like 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.220
 and prove that I am better than 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:04.800
 other than I am more intelligent 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.090
 and this is where we have shown all my 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:13.220
 cunning to be able to lie they understand 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:17.040
 then I tell you my personal opinion 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.950
