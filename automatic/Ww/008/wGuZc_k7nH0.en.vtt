00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.130 

this<00:00:22.040> is<00:00:22.190> what<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:22.430> looks<00:00:22.610> like<00:00:22.700> just<00:00:23.240> draping

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
this is what it looks like just draping

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.170 
this is what it looks like just draping
it<00:00:24.260> over<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:25.130> I<00:00:25.250> had<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.490> cut<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.670> raw<00:00:25.910> edges

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
it over and I had to cut the raw edges

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.720 
it over and I had to cut the raw edges
off<00:00:26.510> and<00:00:26.800> this<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:27.950> just<00:00:28.160> a<00:00:28.279> piece<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.580> material

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
off and this is just a piece of material

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.560 
off and this is just a piece of material
that<00:00:29.060> I<00:00:29.420> had<00:00:29.750> laying<00:00:30.529> around<00:00:30.710> just<00:00:31.070> extra<00:00:31.820> so

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
that I had laying around just extra so

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.290 
that I had laying around just extra so
as<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.559> can<00:00:33.680> see<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:34.220> is<00:00:34.400> a<00:00:34.430> little<00:00:34.610> bit<00:00:34.850> short

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
as you can see it is a little bit short

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.990 
as you can see it is a little bit short
but<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.500> feel<00:00:36.739> like<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.129> stretchy<00:00:37.580> enough

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
but I feel like it is stretchy enough

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.210 
but I feel like it is stretchy enough
where<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:38.629> can<00:00:39.199> stretch<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.180> so<00:00:41.860> I'm<00:00:42.860> gonna<00:00:43.040> make

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
where I can stretch it so I'm gonna make

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.360 
where I can stretch it so I'm gonna make
this<00:00:43.460> work<00:00:43.699> so<00:00:44.090> 10<00:00:45.050> inches<00:00:45.440> seems<00:00:46.070> about<00:00:46.309> right

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
this work so 10 inches seems about right

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.540 
this work so 10 inches seems about right
so<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:48.140> was<00:00:48.530> thinking<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.070> was<00:00:49.130> going<00:00:49.399> to

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
so I was thinking that it was going to

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.340 
so I was thinking that it was going to
be<00:00:49.640> much<00:00:49.910> too<00:00:51.130> too<00:00:52.130> long<00:00:52.360> but<00:00:53.360> 10<00:00:53.780> inches<00:00:54.110> seems

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
be much too too long but 10 inches seems

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
be much too too long but 10 inches seems
good<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.309> what<00:00:55.850> I'm<00:00:55.970> going<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.329> do<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:57.370> I'm

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
good so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
good so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:58.640> cut<00:00:58.910> this<00:00:59.530> right<00:01:00.530> here<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.390> then

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
I'll just see what it looks like I might

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.680 
I'll just see what it looks like I might
just<00:01:22.850> end<00:01:23.299> up<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:23.690> cutting<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.170> right<00:01:24.350> off

one is done now this one is really tight
where<00:02:28.550> I<00:02:28.580> did<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.080> sides<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.590> little<00:02:30.710> bit

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
where I did the sides a little bit

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.190 
where I did the sides a little bit
different<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:33.580> now<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.880> I'm<00:02:35.030> like<00:02:35.690> really

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
um no this one's tighter than that back

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.120 
um no this one's tighter than that back
one<00:02:43.250> but<00:02:44.210> it's<00:02:44.450> good<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:44.870> today<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.620> I'll<00:02:45.980> just

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130
