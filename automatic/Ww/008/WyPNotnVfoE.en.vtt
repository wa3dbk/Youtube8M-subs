and they've had huge constructions of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.619 
and they've had huge constructions of
them<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> trying<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
them and this is trying to be a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.190

that doesn't have a dome though but then

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
that doesn't have a dome though but then
they<00:01:08.820> thought<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.720> reconstructed<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
they thought when they reconstructed to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.780 
they thought when they reconstructed to
had<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> dome<00:01:11.040> something<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.640> looked

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
had to have a dome something that looked

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.260 
had to have a dome something that looked
kind<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> wasn't<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.619> and

kind of like that but it wasn't that and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
kind of like that but it wasn't that and
