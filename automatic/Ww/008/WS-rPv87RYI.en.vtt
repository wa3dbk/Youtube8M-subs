00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.660
 min 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.270
 victim 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.479
 min 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.479
 min 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.309
 I'm going to show you a tool with which you will be able to perform very good 

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.529
 finished on the contrary 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.550
 leave of welfare regrets is the milling machine with it said not to be able to prey 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.050
 You will be able to perform different jobs as assemblies 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.910
 in shrouds all kinds of profiling on boards but good the truth well today 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.920
 let's do 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.270
 a profiling on this tablet could be the cover of one of our tables 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.850
 but let's take 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.710
 this dam is a prey 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.630
 of contour with a bearing 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.380
 in the upper part what is going to do to the bearing the profiling all the board 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.589
 and doing touch so that the machine does not go away let's ride it 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.010
 p 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.030
 we introduce a spindle and we squeeze 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.680
 it's very important that you make sure churches also pressed there 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.330
 once we have it assembled what we have to do now is adjust the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.720
 depth you'll see when we're going to do a profiling on a board min 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 let's lower the machine and down the bottom 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.750
 let's decide the amount of board that we are going to present 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.590
 skay 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.680
 Well, once Latinas adjusted, we only have two things left. 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.230
 the shofar the tool does not 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 the premises where they were placed perón 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 to the output of the entire ram 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.209
 you do not have to hold the board well 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.399
 talking about work this is important 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.399
 Do it always so that the board is not removed 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.479
 this indicated 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.479
 dyn 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.279
 very well 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:31.629
 and finally d simply a pair of glasses and we can start working 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.199
 mm 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:59.939
 let's now turn the board around so that only the other one can work 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:00.849
 part 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.819
 I love 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 toché 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.949
 p 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
 min 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.419
 Well, you see, it was a result 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.509
 impeccable 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.139
 if you liked this of the milling machine, showing much more tricks with 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.370
 what you can do 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.460
 countless projects
