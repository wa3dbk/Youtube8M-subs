00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
these than on the Authentics but this is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.300 
these than on the Authentics but this is
a<00:02:31.340> question<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.460> taste<00:02:33.260> whether<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:35.280> it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
a question of taste whether you like it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.180 
a question of taste whether you like it
or<00:02:35.580> not<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.210> not<00:02:36.480> really<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.380> quality

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
or not it's not really a like quality

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.130 
or not it's not really a like quality
difference<00:02:38.670> because<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> build<00:02:39.270> quality<00:02:39.480> is

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
difference because the build quality is

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.850 
difference because the build quality is
actually<00:02:40.830> pretty<00:02:41.400> nice<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:43.110> material

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
actually pretty nice and the material

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.640 
actually pretty nice and the material
here<00:02:44.550> I'm<00:02:44.850> not<00:02:45.180> really<00:02:45.450> sure<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.020> if<00:02:46.200> this

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
here I'm not really sure but if this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.780 
here I'm not really sure but if this
might<00:02:46.980> actually<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.670> genuine<00:02:48.660> leather<00:02:49.790> well

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
might actually be genuine leather well

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.410 
might actually be genuine leather well
according<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.720> smell<00:02:51.990> doesn't<00:02:52.860> really

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
according to the smell doesn't really

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.840 
according to the smell doesn't really
feel<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.480> genuine<00:02:55.140> leather<00:02:55.380> but<00:02:55.680> um<00:02:56.010> but

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
feel like genuine leather but um but

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.170 
feel like genuine leather but um but
