I've<00:00:00.539> been<00:00:00.690> assembling<00:00:01.110> a<00:00:01.170> custom<00:00:01.560> setup<00:00:01.770> for

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I've been assembling a custom setup for

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.980 
I've been assembling a custom setup for
a<00:00:01.949> while<00:00:02.129> now<00:00:02.340> it<00:00:03.149> almost<00:00:03.300> completes<00:00:03.780> time

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
a while now it almost completes time

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.420 
a while now it almost completes time
start<00:00:04.259> making<00:00:04.410> some<00:00:04.529> patterns<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:04.980> can<00:00:05.190> cast

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
start making some patterns I can cast

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.789 
start making some patterns I can cast
something<00:00:06.140> one<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.290> things<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.529> want<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
something one of the things we want the

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.799 
something one of the things we want the
caster<00:00:08.250> parts<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> zipper<00:00:09.059> style<00:00:09.389> banjo

so<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.500> video<00:00:10.650> I'm<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.099> make<00:00:11.190> some

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
so in this video I'm going to make some

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.999 
so in this video I'm going to make some
patterns<00:00:11.639> for<00:00:11.820> them<00:00:12.620> I'm<00:00:13.620> making<00:00:13.889> this

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
patterns for them I'm making this

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.470 
patterns for them I'm making this

the<00:00:33.420> inner<00:00:33.540> patterns<00:00:33.900> 30<00:00:34.110> millimeter<00:00:34.530> tall

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the inner patterns 30 millimeter tall

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.320 
the inner patterns 30 millimeter tall
that<00:00:35.460> requires<00:00:35.760> two<00:00:36.030> layers<00:00:36.239> a

the center holes being drilled to locate

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:53.119 
the center holes being drilled to locate
the<00:00:40.080> layers<00:00:51.470> patterns<00:00:52.470> require<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> draft

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the layers patterns require a draft

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.130 
the layers patterns require a draft
angle<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.580> get<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> mattes<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
angle to get the mattes and this is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.390 
angle to get the mattes and this is
probably<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.590> makes<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.100> awkward<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
probably what makes them so awkward to

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.119 
probably what makes them so awkward to
construct<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.500> board's<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.010> used

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
construct the board's going to be used

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.220 
construct the board's going to be used

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
as a table for the belt sander it's

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.119 
as a table for the belt sander it's
angled<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.769> 4<00:01:01.980> degrees<00:01:03.979> spindles<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
angled to about 4 degrees spindles and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.270 
angled to about 4 degrees spindles and
stuck<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:05.489> another<00:01:05.760> scrap<00:01:06.000> board<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:08.100> nails

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
stuck into another scrap board the nails

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.899 
stuck into another scrap board the nails
used<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> pivot<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:11.310> allows<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.790> be

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
used as a pivot this allows it to be

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
used as a pivot this allows it to be

the<00:01:21.030> safest<00:01:21.210> setup

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.620 

again<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.490> inside<00:01:32.820> after<00:01:33.060> drilled<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
again the inside after drilled all the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.120 
again the inside after drilled all the
way<00:01:33.720> around<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.830> have<00:01:34.890> been<00:01:34.950> better

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
way around but it would have been better

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.940 
way around but it would have been better
to<00:01:35.220> use<00:01:35.370> a<00:01:35.400> jigsaw

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.230 

the<00:01:42.950> inside<00:01:43.250> needs<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.490> be<00:01:43.549> Table<00:01:43.880> two

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the inside needs to be Table two

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.399 
the inside needs to be Table two
so<00:01:44.450> I'm<00:01:44.540> setting<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.869> angle<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.259> drill

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
so I'm setting the angle of the drill

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.910 
so I'm setting the angle of the drill
press<00:01:45.650> table<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:48.080> here's<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.350> set<00:01:48.530> up<00:01:48.619> for<00:01:48.770> true
