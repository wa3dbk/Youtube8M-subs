00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.840 

yeah<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.429> looks<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:08.850> right<00:02:13.670> I'll<00:02:14.670> put

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
yeah that one looks about right I'll put

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.750 
yeah that one looks about right I'll put
this<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.270> side<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.520> need<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
this to the side here and you need to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.440 
this to the side here and you need to
take<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.150> screw<00:02:18.570> out<00:02:21.950> there<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.300> that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
take this screw out there we go so that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.500 
take this screw out there we go so that
comes<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.020> there<00:02:25.610> I'll<00:02:26.610> pop<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.060> on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
comes out of there I'll pop that on

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.449 
comes out of there I'll pop that on
there<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.930> won't<00:02:28.170> go<00:02:28.380> missing<00:02:28.770> all<00:02:29.280> right

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
there so that won't go missing all right

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.430 
there so that won't go missing all right
so<00:02:29.640> that's<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.000> first<00:02:30.300> step<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:30.959> you're<00:02:31.350> just

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
so that's the first step now you're just

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.590 
so that's the first step now you're just
going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> slide<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.100> cover<00:02:32.370> off<00:02:32.510> all<00:02:33.510> right

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
going to slide this cover off all right

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.730 
going to slide this cover off all right
so<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.080> off<00:02:34.320> that's<00:02:34.920> literally<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.520> a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
so that's off that's literally just a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.520 
so that's off that's literally just a
external<00:02:37.740> shell<00:02:38.120> all<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.270> then<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:40.020> top

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
external shell all right then on top

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.990 
external shell all right then on top
when<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.860> hold<00:02:41.010> these<00:02:41.190> up<00:02:41.430> you've<00:02:41.610> got<00:02:41.820> these
