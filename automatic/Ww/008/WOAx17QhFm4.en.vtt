00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hey people what is going on here be ex with 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.100
 another comments today once a 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.870
 very short video about the patch day 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 leased trader and that only for now 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.330
 for the playstation 3 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.889
 I think that is very interesting 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 probably because of that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.849
 Playstation has a lot of problems with it 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.170
 bugs had frieses I've heard 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.220
 and now everything has been fixed 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 had to be us not today 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.910
 but look at what we look at 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.380
 are the game balancing changes 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.180
 that's what they call themselves, of course 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.310
 I transfer to all consoles, I hope 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.320
 relatively soon so on the xbox on the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.519
 wii and hopefully also on the pc and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.359
 I'm curious when that will be 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.219
 but there are some very interesting ones 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.450
 things are definitely looking forward to it 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.680
 about yours and write on everyone 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.270
 case in the comments what you to the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.649
 single things hold am there very much 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.610
 looking forward to being straight with the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.140
 squash mix on 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 And this is about the drone 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 was now annoyed namely namely the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.680
 you have to cost around one now 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.860
 drone to get instead of 350 as before 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.579
 now get 425 score points then it is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 of course, of course 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.969
 Merck wants all this threatening spam 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.199
 little damper and I am whole 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.460
 curious how this affects the game 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.320
 the people would always be impacted 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 still drone so much or if now too 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.690
 seeing something different is like me 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.180
 understood how that is still in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.790
 head has the atx dk is cheaper now 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.680
 as a drone what I already relatively na 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.270
 yes weird but it is already 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.530
 right because the drone is extremely strong 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.390
 especially not only in the opponents 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 using a drone is really a lot 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.750
 very overboard and for not 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.549
 relatively right from heavy that there 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 now the drone was a bit more difficult 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.799
 In any case it is somewhat more difficult 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.150
 to get these 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.530
 then also the lightning was 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.869
 strike something annoyed and that the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.189
 delay from the second to where you 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.619
 on this game pad the coordinates 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.119
 enters you are the seconds where where 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.700
 this line strike arrives and that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.900
 is now increased by .75 seconds 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.500
 means the whole now takes almost one 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.210
 second longer 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040
 until this explosion really is on the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.329
 Soil will not be big now 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.250
 not be but you can not do that anymore 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.540
 set the slums track so precisely 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.850
 and I think that's okay because 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.259
 the washing fire was not really 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.220
 bad so you can say that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.840
 I'm all right 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.610
 Because I always drone hunter 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.720
 killer drone lightning strike here and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.759
 Now two of the three things became 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.689
 annoyed so I think so too 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.159
 someday why I do that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.570
 but have taken to the now 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.369
 message I believe all of you 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.590
 to find the best of all the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.180
 bouncing betty got annoyed and that 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.460
 that's a bit more complicated the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.200
 time of this the bouncing bettina 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.490
 is recognizes that opponents near 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.260
 So click this 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.450
 until the time when the bouncing betty 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.120
 exploded this whole process was around 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.170
 02 seconds extends that means you 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.360
 have now definitely sounds 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.800
 not so much but you have like now 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.120
 I find much more time for you 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.590
 look where we do not hurt any more 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.030
 gets or even lie down 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.590
 or just when you 're at the moment 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 sprinting is this dolphin safe too 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.160
 do as before and I think so 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.270
 However, the in our bed is a whole 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.190
 a lot of the nerves will now 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.210
 Hopefully, it's the right one now 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.170
 this area will hopefully not 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.220
 be weak hopefully not 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.690
 still too strong again 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.310
 but I'm very excited I will 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.750
 equal to first a nice round gamble 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.310
 pity I would not do that because 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.600
 on the xbox is not there stupid 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.800
 but I am running time 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.170
 curious what the whole playstation 3 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.160
 make people there if now the patch 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.210
 have recorded then write me 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.650
 please in the comments 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.120
 how is the baumbeete now still 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.040
 much weaker than all other things 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.960
 or just right now that would be times 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.340
 really great were the hand grenades 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.480
 I also find something annoyed 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.830
 Every case was very good because they were too 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.570
 tense as I think 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.700
 and this effect of this learned 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.290
 effects has now been weakened a bit 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.430
 that does not pay now though 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.620
 apparently you are not like that anymore 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.600
 slowly at gwg stand and one is 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 not anymore so this one can 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.240
 Do not move so much from 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.290
 which, by sight , that is apparently 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.000
 not so strong anymore 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.740
 So we come to the weapons and that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.200
 the smbs were annoyed and all 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.670
 All right exact numbers are there 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.260
 bigger here than not everybody 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 If there is an increased recoil 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.460
 The hip is very ingenious that I am 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.930
 curious how this will affect 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.640
 and how strong that is then there's one 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.020
 increased spread from the hip that became 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.160
 Yes, I am required by many people 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.770
 very curious how that affect 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.110
 and that is the factor of 4 75 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.390
 given to 5 now hears relatively little 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.920
 but you also have to remember that 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.140
 whole circle is the hit fire is a 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.000
 circle and that all let me wings 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.380
 I think square with pr 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.700
 that means you can not do that now 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.660
 just in percentage so that's enough 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.690
 works a little differently 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.090
 I think that's something 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.380
 stronger than you think from 4.75 to 5 has 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.420
 Not that much am 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.500
 It will be very exciting 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.150
 I am very interested in people too 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.710
 hear how the whole thing plays 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.630
 have recorded patch you look please 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.160
 in the comments as it is and one 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.630
 find reduced damage through walls 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.370
 I definitely cool everyone at that time 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.750
 has played knows that the snb 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.820
 a lot of damage through the walls 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.900
 So I think I can find that 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.520
 just done that right 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.690
 but when was also curious how strong 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.120
 that's all because it's easy here 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.699
 No figures are given to us 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.580
 many people believe that bothering is that 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.169
 the ms mmc and the pgw 750 now one 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.699
 have slightly increased recoil respectively 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.810
 the recoil again increases of course 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.490
 had the previous recoil 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.840
 but to be honest relative 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.460
 I'm curious how strong 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.690
 that is now whether the weapons are still 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.000
 as popular as before 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.440
 us goes one should without doubt is 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.060
 There is now when one aims a deer 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.110
 dual less so a reduced 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.520
 tremble when aiming 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.660
 that is if you do not shoot and 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.800
 just goal then there is still 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.810
 a little tremble that was again 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.030
 removes the blame for distance 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.310
 now even stronger and the or 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.870
 let's say more competitive and the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.100
 ämter now has the same auto aiming 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.660
 on consoles like everyone else 's 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.010
 doubt does not ask me if the before 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.389
 better or worse was there then stood 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.470
 not I know it is no longer 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.050
 not noticed is crucial 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.120
 the doubt now at all on 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.500
 the level everyone else it should be like that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.880
 last but not least, last but not least 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.229
 I chose from this one 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.820
 patch is still very interesting to me 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.229
 think that the lemmings so very 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.570
 strong scotland like me too for one 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.340
 ghost town then something annoyed 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.380
 and that is the one hit range so 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.690
 the range where you go with a shot 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.160
 The opponent also kills directly at 1 1 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.349
 meter has been reduced that should now 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.639
 from six seven meters to five to six 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.990
 meter had been reduced 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.130
 if you are curious how this affects 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.599
 I guess that does not matter now 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.430
 a lot from there as already said 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.900
 before that was relatively strong that were at 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.190
 far from all the changes I wanted 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.660
 It will appeal to you as soon as possible 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.130
 Please write me your opinion in the 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.090
 comments especially the people the 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.690
 have patched up on the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.490
 playstation 3 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.110
 in the description is a link 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.669
 all patches I'm curious what you are 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.930
 this it tells me the comments
