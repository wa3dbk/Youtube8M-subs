00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.590
 hello who was my reason finn and 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.480
 if you have not yet decided to go 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.700
 you travel through the game witcher 3 wild 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.650
 hunt and help you decide 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.140
 telling all the fun that you 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.660
 still may not know about the game 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.640
 The Witcher's game world is just huge. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.579
 exceeds the entire territory of the previous one 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.040
 parts of the game are 35 times greater than wish 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.020
 that is by the san andreas 5 times 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.420
 and if you add up the area for centuries to 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.059
 tantrums then only they will exceed all 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.490
 Skyrim card three and a half times 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.120
 with most of the game world 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.030
 witch 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.610
 landscape elements flora and fauna were 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.550
 created by hand what makes the world around 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.560
 very atmospheric and alive the same 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.210
 concerns assignments in the game each 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.180
 was created separately and is 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.500
 absolutely unique weather as well as change 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.020
 day and night witch 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.310
 has a dynamic loop if you 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 dare on a small boat 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.680
 go sailing in strong 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.390
 storm 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.509
 then most likely such a trip 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.610
 end very badly all the characters 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.829
 games reacts to the weather like the most 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.869
 ordinary people in life are hiding from the cold 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.389
 and rain and happy walking 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.819
 during a sunny and sunny day all 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:21.439
 side quests in the game can be closely 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.689
 linked to the main plot 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.579
 for example, a saved son miller might 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.859
 change the fate of crowned heads 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.319
 the same principle can be observed in 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.509
 the economic system of the game world than 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.899
 further settlement from the water the more expensive there 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.600
 a fish 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.060
 any decision you make will affect 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.670
 on the world on an event in it and on characters 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.549
 the combat system of the new witch became 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.619
 much more interesting now battles 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.039
 will have to pay more attention to tactics 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.990
 It was 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.029
 and the use of magic marks on 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.429
 Geralt the opportunity to apply 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:54.590
 on the weapon the drug and a variety of oil 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.869
 thanks to which inflicted on the enemy early 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.759
 it becomes more dangerous you can add 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.009
 corresponding runes that can 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.999
 increase the chance to set fire to an opponent or 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.490
 knock him down 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.439
 improve stamina or strengthen 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.660
 effect of magical herald signs 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.660
 another nice moment of the combat system 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.880
 battle on horseback right without dismounting 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.830
 from the right horse you can fight like 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.590
 hurry adversary so from the whole 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.490
 cavalry is also in his system witch 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 3 there are consumable items 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.230
 for example homemade bombs they of course 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.670
 available in limited quantities but 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.460
 their effect is excellent 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.620
 such shells are able to freeze burning 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.990
 or disorient entire groups of enemies 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.390
 that will allow to seize the initiative in 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.580
 Witcher 3 battle certainly will not do 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 no girls but now the relationship is bigger 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.220
 biased in favor of romance nonetheless 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.400
 18 plus limit anyway the game doesn't 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.650
 just like that the mini games will be very 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.810
 varied everything will depend on 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.000
 areas or from the area where you decide 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.980
 you can play for example skelege 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.350
 brag about throwing knives 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.210
 you don't have to be familiar with the world 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.180
 Witcher to start playing Witcher 3 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.010
 wild hunt game designed in this way 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.870
 that beginners will not need knowledge of 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.540
 past games to take a dip and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.730
 enjoy the story of heralt same time 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.710
 if you already played witcher 2 then you 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.140
 You can continue the game in the third part with 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.060
 your saves in the second dependency 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.130
 what choice was made by you 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.770
 Witcher 2 characters will be different 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.690
 treat the main character along with 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.760
 by saving from the second part you can 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.310
 move in the third gear and gold 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.560
 which you had time to accumulate 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.050
 the important thing you need to know about the Witcher 3 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.670
 the third part of the witcher is the last 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.950
 part where you have the opportunity 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.050
 play for genes to until the developers 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.480
 cafes open and do not say what will happen 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.520
 series after apparently x3 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.040
 senior screenwriter cd projekt red yakush 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.290
 Malik so told the completion of the saga 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.510
 witch we felt we should 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.490
 say goodbye to geralt properly 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.100
 and decided to part with it effectively 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.490
 I think good stories should have 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.230
 end 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.390
 you cannot renew them 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.520
 infinity and heralt had such 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.620
 exciting adventure and high already 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.330
 so long and complicated that came up 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.670
 good moment to think about 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.890
 suitable completion of this gel 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.840
 travel came to an end but it is not 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.450
 means the end to the universe quite like 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.430
 video games this universe is very large 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.799
 npc space 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.320
 characters a lot of places that we 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.030
 until it is too late to say smolik so 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.100
 at some point we can to her 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.230
 come back but we think that now 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.340
 time will allow Geralt to retire 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.889
 she try something but 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.780
 nevertheless after the release of the witcher 3 of us 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.090
 waits were fought on dons and add-ons 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.860
 which will extend our pleasures as well 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.199
 conclusion I would like to note that 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.120
 it is better to play the witcher once than a hundred 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.650
 Once about him to listen with you was 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.650
 Kristina Fink, until the cats
