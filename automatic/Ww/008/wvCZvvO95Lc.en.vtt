I'm making this video there's an app

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.469 
I'm making this video there's an app
called<00:04:28.550> link2sd<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.860> I'm<00:04:31.669> not<00:04:31.880> well-versed

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
called link2sd and I'm not well-versed

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.920 
called link2sd and I'm not well-versed
with<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:32.900> only<00:04:33.320> zoom<00:04:34.040> out

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
with it only zoom out

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.040 
with it only zoom out
it's<00:04:35.930> basically<00:04:36.970> what<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.270> asking<00:04:38.660> you

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
it's basically what it is asking you

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.870 
it's basically what it is asking you
doing<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.380> don't<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:39.650> think<00:04:40.040> you<00:04:40.370> have<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.760> be

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
doing I don't I think you have to be

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.760 
doing I don't I think you have to be
rooted<00:04:41.330> I'm<00:04:43.300> about<00:04:44.300> 80<00:04:44.600> percent<00:04:45.080> sure<00:04:45.380> but<00:04:45.710> I

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
rooted I'm about 80 percent sure but I

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.230 
rooted I'm about 80 percent sure but I
think<00:04:46.070> some<00:04:46.220> people<00:04:46.340> did<00:04:46.639> it<00:04:46.729> without<00:04:46.940> it

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
think some people did it without it

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.540 
think some people did it without it
being<00:04:47.300> rooted<00:04:48.020> but<00:04:48.200> you<00:04:48.710> have<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:49.070> partition

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
being rooted but you have to partition

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.980 
being rooted but you have to partition
partition<00:04:50.270> your<00:04:51.370> your<00:04:52.370> memory<00:04:52.700> card<00:04:52.970> not<00:04:53.720> for

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
partition your your memory card not for

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.440 
partition your your memory card not for
this<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.290> work<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.800> haven't<00:04:55.190> gone<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.729> far

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.440 

but<00:04:59.680> they<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.190> far<00:05:01.490> that's<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:01.910> only<00:05:02.210> thing

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
but they so far that's the only thing

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.070 
but they so far that's the only thing
that<00:05:02.660> I'm<00:05:02.810> hearing<00:05:03.200> that<00:05:03.440> works<00:05:03.770> without

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
that I'm hearing that works without

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.040 
that I'm hearing that works without
rooting<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.289> so<00:05:06.620> well<00:05:07.190> maybe<00:05:07.600> maybe<00:05:08.600> you<00:05:08.840> guys

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
rooting it so well maybe maybe you guys

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.219 
rooting it so well maybe maybe you guys
may<00:05:09.380> know<00:05:09.590> something<00:05:10.070> else<00:05:10.870> but<00:05:11.870> let<00:05:12.080> me<00:05:12.199> just

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
may know something else but let me just

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.170 
may know something else but let me just
show<00:05:12.620> you<00:05:12.650> what<00:05:13.070> it<00:05:13.190> looks<00:05:13.400> like<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:13.760> I<00:05:13.820> click

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
show you what it looks like so I click

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.659 
show you what it looks like so I click
on<00:05:14.449> that<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:15.470> see<00:05:17.860> see<00:05:18.860> says<00:05:19.190> second

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
on that and see see says second

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.260 
on that and see see says second
partition<00:05:20.210> not<00:05:20.570> found<00:05:20.870> I<00:05:21.169> didn't<00:05:21.620> do<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:21.950> so

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
partition not found I didn't do that so

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.440 
partition not found I didn't do that so
I<00:05:23.560> don't<00:05:24.560> know<00:05:24.650> maybe<00:05:24.950> you<00:05:25.100> guys<00:05:25.310> can<00:05:25.729> pick<00:05:26.240> up

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
I don't know maybe you guys can pick up

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.529 
I don't know maybe you guys can pick up
where<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.660> left<00:05:26.750> off<00:05:27.229> and<00:05:27.700> maybe<00:05:28.700> find<00:05:29.419> a

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
where I left off and maybe find a

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.900 
where I left off and maybe find a
workaround<00:05:29.990> without<00:05:30.560> rooting<00:05:31.070> it<00:05:31.190> but<00:05:31.639> I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
workaround without rooting it but I

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.510 
workaround without rooting it but I
really<00:05:32.780> don't<00:05:32.990> want<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:33.349> root<00:05:33.560> this<00:05:33.770> I'm<00:05:34.070> tired

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
really don't want to root this I'm tired

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.190 
really don't want to root this I'm tired
of<00:05:34.729> doing<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.090> type<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.360> stuff<00:05:35.750> that<00:05:35.780> that

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
of doing that type of stuff that that

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.650 
of doing that type of stuff that that
type<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.470> stuff<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:36.919> me<00:05:37.039> is<00:05:37.099> played<00:05:37.490> out<00:05:37.660> we've

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
type of stuff to me is played out we've

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.290 
type of stuff to me is played out we've
come<00:05:39.050> past<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.919> week<00:05:40.130> we<00:05:40.700> used<00:05:40.849> to<00:05:40.940> route<00:05:41.150> our

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
come past that week we used to route our

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.940 
come past that week we used to route our
devices<00:05:41.660> so<00:05:42.020> it<00:05:42.139> could<00:05:42.289> look<00:05:42.410> like<00:05:42.470> an<00:05:42.770> iPhone

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
devices so it could look like an iPhone

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.050 
devices so it could look like an iPhone
or<00:05:43.310> so<00:05:43.760> it<00:05:43.880> could<00:05:44.030> do<00:05:44.210> some<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:46.220> know<00:05:46.250> extra

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
or so it could do some you know extra

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.810 
or so it could do some you know extra
functions<00:05:47.960> that<00:05:48.289> I<00:05:48.680> don't<00:05:49.220> think<00:05:49.460> we<00:05:49.610> need<00:05:49.789> to

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
functions that I don't think we need to

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.060 
functions that I don't think we need to
do<00:05:50.030> we've<00:05:50.180> come<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.389> long<00:05:50.479> way<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.320> don't<00:05:51.530> I'm
