and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.489> want<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> sensor<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.750> prefer<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and you want the sensor I prefer this

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.750 
and you want the sensor I prefer this
just<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> goodwin<00:00:50.579> laser

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
just because it has the goodwin laser

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
just because it has the goodwin laser
sight<00:00:51.030> which<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.360> can't<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.199> never

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
sight which you can't actually got never

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.290 
sight which you can't actually got never
weapons<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.550> add<00:00:53.670> stated<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
weapons and then you can add stated that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
weapons and then you can add stated that
anyway<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> super<00:00:55.649> laser<00:00:55.800> sight

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
anyway and get like a super laser sight

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.260 
anyway and get like a super laser sight
that<00:00:56.219> makes<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> better<00:00:56.520> than<00:00:56.969> even<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that makes it better than even the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.639 
that makes it better than even the
submachine<00:00:57.539> gun<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.109> why<00:00:58.230> i<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.440> this

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
submachine gun so that's why i like this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
submachine gun so that's why i like this
gun<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> other<00:00:59.789> two<00:01:00.000> might<00:01:00.570> throw<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
gun over the other two might throw the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.420 
gun over the other two might throw the
opportunist<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.469> probably<00:01:01.800> my<00:01:01.920> favorite<00:01:01.949> plus

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.700 
opportunist is probably my favorite plus
it's<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:03.180> expensive<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.019> unique<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it's it's expensive and it's unique it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.960 
it's it's expensive and it's unique it
seems<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> quirky<00:01:05.489> gun<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> lot

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.640 
the SMG assault rifle hybrid way it's
about<00:01:17.100> first<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.820> attachments<00:01:18.090> are

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
about first of all your attachments are

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.630 
about first of all your attachments are
you<00:01:19.650> obviously<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> built-in<00:01:20.340> laser

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you obviously have the built-in laser

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.340 
you obviously have the built-in laser
sight<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.210> let's<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.630> packed<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.229> in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
sight so let's not packed that in

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.420 
sight so let's not packed that in
because<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.619> doesn't<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:22.860> take<00:01:23.130> away<00:01:23.280> p

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
because it doesn't actually take away p

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.679 
because it doesn't actually take away p
attachments<00:01:23.909> some<00:01:24.030> people<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> does

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
attachments some people think it does

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
attachments some people think it does
and<00:01:25.439> basically<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.340> add<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> grip<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and basically you can add a grip and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
and basically you can add a grip and
excellent<00:01:27.990> mags<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.500> assigned<00:01:29.159> subsequent

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
excellent mags and assigned subsequent

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.340 
excellent mags and assigned subsequent
handle<00:01:30.090> free<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.750> could<00:01:30.930> wickstrom

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
handle free or you could wickstrom

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
handle free or you could wickstrom
catchments<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.340> basically<00:01:32.579> picking<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
catchments but basically picking one of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
catchments but basically picking one of
those<00:01:33.390> free<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> probably<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.439> best<00:01:34.619> bet<00:01:34.740> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
those free is probably your best bet I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.200 
those free is probably your best bet I
mean<00:01:35.130> Kiefer<00:01:35.250> Red<00:01:35.520> Dawn<00:01:35.670> they're<00:01:35.759> thinking

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
mean Kiefer Red Dawn they're thinking

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
mean Kiefer Red Dawn they're thinking
long<00:01:36.360> range<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.500> personal

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
long range that's not really my personal

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
long range that's not really my personal
preference<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> short-range<00:01:38.579> world<00:01:38.909> oh

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
preference for the short-range world oh

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
preference for the short-range world oh
so<00:01:39.659> basically<00:01:40.110> Sancho<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.619> grip<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.890> why<00:01:41.009> I'm

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so basically Sancho and grip is why I'm

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
so basically Sancho and grip is why I'm
using<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:41.430> allows<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.180> low<00:01:42.689> recoil

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
using here allows you to get low recoil

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
using here allows you to get low recoil
at<00:01:43.170> long<00:01:43.259> distance<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.740> i<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.280> long

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
at long distance so i can get those long

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
at long distance so i can get those long
distance<00:01:44.759> kills<00:01:44.909> money<00:01:45.180> too<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.049> mainly

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
distance kills money too but mainly

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.480 
distance kills money too but mainly
allows<00:01:46.500> me<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.920> kill<00:01:47.070> people<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.340> close

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
allows me to just kill people at close

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.980 
allows me to just kill people at close
range<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.119> feed<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.750> completely

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
range and feed you know completely

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.240 
range and feed you know completely
hidden<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.189> about

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
hidden so what people don't know about

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.130 
hidden so what people don't know about
me<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.700> playing<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> sense<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.659> kind<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.990> useful

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
me I playing the sense a kind of useful

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
me I playing the sense a kind of useful
at<00:01:52.350> close<00:01:52.500> range<00:01:52.770> sometimes<00:01:53.729> especially<00:01:54.180> when

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
at close range sometimes especially when

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.300 
at close range sometimes especially when
you<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.780> much<00:01:54.960> range<00:01:55.200> anyway<00:01:55.530> losing

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you have this much range anyway losing

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.679 
you have this much range anyway losing
twenty<00:01:56.549> percent<00:01:56.790> off<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> arrange<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> have

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
twenty percent off the arrange you have

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.120 
twenty percent off the arrange you have
an<00:01:57.750> assault<00:01:57.990> rifle<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> big<00:01:59.100> deal

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
an assault rifle not really a big deal

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.469 
an assault rifle not really a big deal
since<00:01:59.490> there's<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> close-range<00:02:00.030> build<00:02:00.240> anyway

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
since there's a close-range build anyway

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.450 
since there's a close-range build anyway
so<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.350> why<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.710> using<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> silencer<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
so that's why I'm using the silencer the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
so that's why I'm using the silencer the
grip<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.540> nice<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.990> allows<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> go

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
grip is just nice it allows you to go

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.749 
grip is just nice it allows you to go
people<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> distance<00:02:05.070> without<00:02:05.430> too<00:02:05.670> much

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
people of distance without too much

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.520 
people of distance without too much
difficulty<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> grip<00:02:06.960> does<00:02:07.170> work<00:02:07.380> in

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
difficulty because the grip does work in

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440 
difficulty because the grip does work in
this<00:02:07.619> game<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.550> once<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
this game for once which is really a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.080 
this game for once which is really a
nice<00:02:09.569> thick<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.530> finally<00:02:10.800> what<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.489> wanted<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
nice thick so finally what I wanted to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.370 
nice thick so finally what I wanted to
say<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
say is the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380 
say is the
equipment<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.640> important<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.180> close

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
equipment is really important on close

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.900 
equipment is really important on close
range<00:02:15.600> build<00:02:15.840> most<00:02:16.680> people<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.460> do<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.730> don't

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
range build most people you do I don't

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190 
range build most people you do I don't
think<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.120> need<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.510> tactical<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
think you need a tactical on a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.630 
think you need a tactical on a
close-range<00:02:19.680> build<00:02:19.920> some<00:02:20.160> people<00:02:20.370> think<00:02:20.460> of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
close-range build some people think of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.610 
close-range build some people think of
words<00:02:20.820> but<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.480> think<00:02:21.690> most<00:02:21.930> people<00:02:22.170> agree<00:02:22.410> that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
words but I think most people agree that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.780 
words but I think most people agree that
tactical<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.250> don't<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.490> need<00:02:23.640> more

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
tactical you don't really need more

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.300 
tactical you don't really need more
closure<00:02:24.030> felt<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:25.320> really<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.950> can

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
closure felt like it's it really you can

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.920 
closure felt like it's it really you can
suffice<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.150> seat<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:27.540> even<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
suffice with just a seat for even a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.390 
suffice with just a seat for even a
lethal<00:02:28.260> wits<00:02:28.410> kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.710> questionable<00:02:29.010> you've

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
lethal wits kind of questionable you've

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
lethal wits kind of questionable you've
got<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> seat<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.210> covers<00:02:30.510> pretty<00:02:30.690> much

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
got a seat for that covers pretty much

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.090 
got a seat for that covers pretty much
everything<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.290> need<00:02:31.440> stone<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.740> close-range

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
everything I need stone a close-range

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.770 
everything I need stone a close-range
build<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.550> that's<00:02:32.700> why<00:02:33.180> i'd<00:02:33.270> recommend<00:02:33.600> there

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
build so that's why i'd recommend there

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.570 
build so that's why i'd recommend there
obviously<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.800> prefer<00:02:35.070> something<00:02:35.370> else

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
obviously if you prefer something else

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.520 
obviously if you prefer something else
you<00:02:35.820> could<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.510> i<00:02:36.540> think<00:02:36.600> c4<00:02:37.440> is

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530

reeked<00:05:16.470> of<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.740> first<00:05:16.920> reports<00:05:17.250> too<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:18.270> you

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
reeked of the first reports too so you

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.900 
reeked of the first reports too so you
can<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.870> know<00:05:19.340> youtubers<00:05:20.340> people<00:05:20.730> pretty

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
can you know youtubers people pretty

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.790 
can you know youtubers people pretty
quickly<00:05:21.180> as<00:05:21.480> well<00:05:21.960> as<00:05:22.050> having<00:05:22.260> low<00:05:22.380> recall

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
quickly as well as having low recall

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.170 
quickly as well as having low recall
than<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.130> MSBs<00:05:23.580> which<00:05:23.790> kind<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.090> actually

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
than the MSBs which kind of actually

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.300 
than the MSBs which kind of actually
suffers<00:05:24.600> a<00:05:24.630> long<00:05:24.840> range<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.800> find<00:05:26.070> it<00:05:26.190> really

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
suffers a long range so I find it really

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.520 
suffers a long range so I find it really
works<00:05:26.580> for<00:05:26.760> that<00:05:26.850> I<00:05:26.940> think<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:27.690> not<00:05:28.050> quite<00:05:28.410> as

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
works for that I think it's not quite as

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.380 
works for that I think it's not quite as
good<00:05:28.650> as<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.860> MSBs<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.340> all<00:05:29.430> situations<00:05:29.640> I'm

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
good as the MSBs in all situations I'm

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.060 
good as the MSBs in all situations I'm
sorry<00:05:30.720> nice<00:05:30.870> alternative<00:05:31.050> if<00:05:31.560> you<00:05:31.800> want<00:05:31.980> a

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
this burst fire if you want a pretty

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.810 
this burst fire if you want a pretty
interesting<00:05:37.530> class<00:05:37.890> is<00:05:38.160> ten<00:05:38.460> points<00:05:38.760> to

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
interesting class is ten points to

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.220 
interesting class is ten points to
unlock<00:05:39.090> so<00:05:39.300> it<00:05:39.390> does<00:05:39.600> kind<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:39.900> suck<00:05:40.050> in<00:05:40.200> that

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
unlock so it does kind of suck in that

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.260 
unlock so it does kind of suck in that
regard<00:05:40.590> but<00:05:41.280> it's<00:05:41.430> definitely<00:05:41.610> worth<00:05:41.970> paying

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
regard but it's definitely worth paying

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.670 
regard but it's definitely worth paying
the<00:05:42.390> ten<00:05:42.540> points<00:05:42.780> but<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:43.080> really<00:05:43.530> really

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
the ten points but I really really

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.130 
the ten points but I really really
enjoyed<00:05:44.010> my<00:05:44.160> time<00:05:44.190> of<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.580> hour<00:05:44.669> except<00:05:45.140> 160

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
enjoyed my time of the hour except 160

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.140 
enjoyed my time of the hour except 160
and<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:46.380> think<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.190> next<00:05:47.220> uploading<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:48.000> video

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
and I think the next uploading a video

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.420 
and I think the next uploading a video
it's<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.630> k7<00:05:49.169> so<00:05:49.410> that's<00:05:49.800> that's<00:05:50.070> gun<00:05:50.340> you

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
it's the k7 so that's that's gun you

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.950 
it's the k7 so that's that's gun you
