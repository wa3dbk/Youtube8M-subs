00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
momentum it doesn't make sense yeah I've

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.680

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.790 
Xbox into like a platform with PC gaming
where<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.330> would<00:04:32.480> just<00:04:32.690> make<00:04:32.810> your<00:04:32.990> PC<00:04:33.590> be<00:04:33.740> in

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
where it would just make your PC be in

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.040 
where it would just make your PC be in
your<00:04:33.980> living<00:04:34.310> room<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.790> all<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.450> crap<00:04:35.750> I

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
your living room and all that crap I

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.960 
your living room and all that crap I
don't<00:04:36.230> buy<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.470> you<00:04:37.010> know<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.580> gets<00:04:37.760> into

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
don't buy that you know that gets into

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.700 
don't buy that you know that gets into
the<00:04:38.060> whole<00:04:38.210> thing<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.660> varying<00:04:39.200> Hardware

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the whole thing of varying Hardware

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.710 
the whole thing of varying Hardware
again<00:04:40.070> yes<00:04:40.820> I'm<00:04:41.030> sure<00:04:41.060> they<00:04:41.300> would<00:04:41.450> create<00:04:41.630> a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
again yes I'm sure they would create a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.930 
again yes I'm sure they would create a
standard<00:04:42.260> but<00:04:42.500> you<00:04:42.530> know<00:04:42.800> not<00:04:43.010> every<00:04:43.310> PC<00:04:43.760> is

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
standard but you know not every PC is

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.390 
standard but you know not every PC is
gonna<00:04:44.120> be<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.510> same<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.110> that's<00:04:45.890> not<00:04:46.160> what

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
gonna be the same and that's not what

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.430 
gonna be the same and that's not what
console<00:04:46.850> gaming<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.420> about<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.170> would

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
console gaming is about and that would

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.320 
console gaming is about and that would
turn<00:04:48.650> off<00:04:48.860> people<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.460> doubt<00:04:49.880> that's<00:04:50.150> what

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
turn off people so I doubt that's what

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.850 
turn off people so I doubt that's what
they're<00:04:50.480> gonna<00:04:50.630> do<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.590> would<00:04:51.680> make<00:04:51.830> no

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
they're gonna do and it would make no

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.040 
they're gonna do and it would make no
sense<00:04:52.160> for<00:04:52.310> Microsoft<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:52.940> leave<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.510> Xbox

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
sense for Microsoft to leave the Xbox

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.890 
sense for Microsoft to leave the Xbox

unveiled it at e3 2011 but I'm gonna sum

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.800 
unveiled it at e3 2011 but I'm gonna sum
them<00:05:03.010> together<00:05:03.160> because<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:04.270> effect<00:05:04.660> would

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
them together because the effect would

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.230 
them together because the effect would
be<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.990> same<00:05:05.140> if<00:05:05.620> either<00:05:06.280> of<00:05:06.610> those<00:05:06.760> companies

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
be the same if either of those companies

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.810 
be the same if either of those companies
quit<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.110> console<00:05:08.590> race<00:05:08.830> they<00:05:09.520> will<00:05:09.700> be

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
and Sony identifies himself big time

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.050 
and Sony identifies himself big time
with<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.390> PlayStation<00:05:40.720> brand<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:41.740> yeah<00:05:42.670> they

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
with the PlayStation brand and yeah they

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.730 
with the PlayStation brand and yeah they
might<00:05:43.600> survive<00:05:44.170> if<00:05:44.760> PlayStation<00:05:45.760> died<00:05:46.080> but<00:05:47.080> it

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
might survive if PlayStation died but it

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.100 
might survive if PlayStation died but it
would<00:05:47.950> be<00:05:48.100> an<00:05:48.220> epic<00:05:48.640> restructuring<00:05:49.480> Sony

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
would be an epic restructuring Sony

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.590 
would be an epic restructuring Sony
would<00:05:50.410> change<00:05:50.770> forever<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.520> not<00:05:52.150> for<00:05:52.480> the

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
would change forever and not for the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.360 
would change forever and not for the
better<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:53.140> honestly<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.620> don't<00:05:53.770> think<00:05:54.190> they

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
better and honestly I don't think they

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.520 
better and honestly I don't think they
would<00:05:54.580> survive<00:05:54.970> if<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.780> PlayStation<00:05:56.380> brand

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
would survive if the PlayStation brand

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.070 
would survive if the PlayStation brand
fails<00:05:57.160> but<00:05:57.640> this<00:05:57.790> is<00:05:57.940> all<00:05:58.090> speculation<00:05:58.630> anyway

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
fails but this is all speculation anyway

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.080 
fails but this is all speculation anyway
