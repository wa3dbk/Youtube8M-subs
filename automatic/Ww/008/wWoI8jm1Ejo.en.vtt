00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:16.130
 my name is niklas you know me on 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.350
 heat or and this is starcraft 2 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.109
 This time we take a first look 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.800
 on the differences of the three streets 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.250
 namely the Terrans the factory and the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.050
 Start the process at the beginning of a game 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.399
 We are independent of the chosen breed 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.800
 with the main building and 6 workers 1 1 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.550
 which in turn can gather resources 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.440
 and buildings can produce from there 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.170
 The three races are different 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 in their way of playing the terrans are 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.910
 the most difficult phase for a stone 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.800
 in bills so the series are following 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.430
 very complicated and include 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.940
 a lot of small details you have to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.890
 start as a coach early 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.260
 basic steps in the micro 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.680
 So management of the army 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.680
 Teran requires a lot 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 multi-tasking as terraner has 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.799
 Hardly a quiet second at a time 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.000
 durchzuschnaufen 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.130
 the zerg put on mass instead of class 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.960
 they are like one up 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.229
 the whole map spreads and everything in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.360
 into it before the zerg begins 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.360
 his opponent in waves and waves of 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.670
 he wants to wear down units of storm 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.250
 As many as possible bases so one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.380
 secure the strongest possible economy 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.869
 the focus of the zerg is on the macro 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.450
 So everything with basic building units 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.420
 production and business has to do and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.220
 less on the micro so the control 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.110
 the army 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.330
 the greatest strength of the zerg lies in it 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.159
 a lost army by one 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.830
 especially fast units production 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.090
 to replace in no time the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.619
 potters rely on technology and 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.410
 less but especially valuable 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.720
 units are defensive for a very long time 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.000
 and defend that with big enough 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.090
 and the switch is on and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.190
 they are still very much 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.470
 Beginner friendly as you first 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.930
 stop being really fast 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.300
 So image must follow the series 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.700
 very linear and relatively simple 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.590
 perform 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.470
 Michael management and multitasking is 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.930
 hardly necessary at the beginning and that 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.540
 most comfortable at the protoss army is 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.300
 that she is strongest when she is 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.150
 compact stands together now you are 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.760
 Which of the three races do you want? 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.440
 First learn it is best to learn 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.420
 little time and try all three out 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.790
 then you can always know immediately if 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.269
 a trainer a dwarf or a protoss 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.269
 in her
