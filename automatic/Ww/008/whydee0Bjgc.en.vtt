00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.640 
check it out welcome back guys so here
we<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.869> 2nd<00:01:25.159> position<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.930> stacking

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
we have 2nd position of the stacking

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:39.590 
we have 2nd position of the stacking
combination<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:29.909> here

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:02:08.809 

I<00:02:02.720> think<00:02:03.920> after<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.539> hear<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.780> sounds<00:02:07.819> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
I think after we hear the sounds the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.640 
I think after we hear the sounds the
balance<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:10.850> getting<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.480> first<00:02:13.140> position

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
balance is getting on the first position

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.590 
balance is getting on the first position
so<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.910> current<00:02:15.650> position<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:18.000> not

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
so in this current position it's not

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.040 
so in this current position it's not
sound<00:02:19.050> best<00:02:19.430> okay<00:02:21.230> pretty<00:02:22.230> cool<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.840> up

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050
