something else but what even makes Ceres
more<00:01:57.180> weird<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.079> pyramid<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.799> mountain

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.360 

okay<00:02:14.990> well<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.290> might<00:02:15.440> not<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.860> Illuminati

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
okay well it might not be the Illuminati

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.100 
okay well it might not be the Illuminati
but<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> only<00:02:17.120> mountain<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.720> its<00:02:17.870> kind

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
but it is the only mountain of its kind

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.560 
but it is the only mountain of its kind
on<00:02:18.260> Ceres<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.520> fifteen<00:02:20.000> thousand<00:02:20.480> feet

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
on Ceres it is fifteen thousand feet

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.480 
on Ceres it is fifteen thousand feet
high<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.170> not<00:02:21.500> made<00:02:21.680> from<00:02:21.890> any<00:02:22.040> impact
