00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 people what is going on here is the restauration 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.080
 and I have another video for 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 you and it goes this time as it in the title 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 already it is about the learned pater sabu 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.570
 blue or just yes, I just got that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.600
 I just bought it at Amazon 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.400
 actually I wanted the box now 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.930
 in this video to box more or 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.630
 less but the problem is I have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.929
 me this box with the week and the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 merchandise stuff this little box and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.540
 I have ordered what he is in there 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.250
 problem is amazon has not on 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.100
 I had stock shortly but order 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.200
 really big cinema amazon in any case 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.149
 but it is so I read the pre-order 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.020
 I will activate the video if I have the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.920
 then maybe still upload 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.329
 that 's just what the us write 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.699
 Comments might see something in there 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.260
 is what man actually is because then 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.320
 steak one more or there are already 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.559
 about 500 unboxing videos of this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.750
 box on youtube good plan failed 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.060
 nothing is about the music and not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.610
 what is there and there I have to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:17.340
 I have always been no fan though 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.100
 also seen so I think the art 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.330
 the rape he does is great 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 I just like it 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.000
 I think the style is good, I think that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.130
 accentuation is something very, very different 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.340
 and that's easy from the first pre 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.320
 safe ipo or from the critical duration 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.990
 that's exactly the same 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.479
 style has not changed 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.390
 in the album it's mostly about skipping 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.270
 and more or less from us 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.790
 German rappers or the rap scene 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.030
 general without someone like her now 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.710
 for example flair or something 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.649
 to address someone directly 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:01.079
 generally and personally 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.880
 I think that's really what he thinks 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.240
 So right, so I have now 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.130
 completely listened to three times and am the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.360
 opinion that he too 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.270
 i'm right with what he has in the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.060
 So videos say he does not have a rap style 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.739
 which actually I think he is for 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.000
 somewhere unique in germany 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.510
 Germany had never heard anyone 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.489
 works as well with emphases and 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.980
 now every second song 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.090
 completely double time or its or 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.310
 Whatever it is but it really is 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.080
 something unique and he does that too 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.459
 in this whole album a bit 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.500
 he simply says that embody 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.069
 whole german or the whole rap-scene 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.750
 generally everyone has become bored 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.299
 somehow wants a trial period around 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.610
 Everybody offends anyone 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.400
 everyone to normal he would have double time 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.989
 or 1003 syllables or something else 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.690
 make or is just wide 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.120
 kicked and the community speaks too 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.280
 to say that we are going to stop 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.560
 that's because the animals do sponge bobs 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.900
 500 words of a second 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.590
 and that's why he's over rapper 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.640
 Whats up with what looks like the album 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.880
 also has the case is sometime 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.950
 just keep the text content completely 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.540
 from asus this is my personal 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.290
 Opinion and opinion is also represented 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.049
 many contentless texts which extreme 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.609
 good and quickly awakened are good 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.230
 what's nice, I have a seesaw too 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.980
 to the album could also be a 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.430
 find a job 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.260
 and he's gone he has the rail i like 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.989
 my style I have to go with him I have to 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.430
 500 chains or film chains or 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.630
 otherwise somehow shit but I have 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.910
 keep my style and he 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.030
 works because he can do something 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.870
 something not everyone in the market can and 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.420
 I like that too 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.190
 that was then it's just like in all 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.549
 other songs as he actually does 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.819
 a lot about skip but also really the 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.019
 fixed on saying German is 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.940
 actually boring and i have now 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.859
 the album belongs 34 times rat i know 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.709
 no longer run casually 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.130
 run my favorite song I 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:07.050
 now like to pack here 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:10.110
 a mobile hero da amazon music is like that 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.050
 beautiful on amazon music dance 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.250
 So my favorite song is where I am 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.990
 I really have to say that 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.080
 really cool that I find very much 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:23.910
 well done it means draws I pull 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.720
 and fit made extremely cool because then 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.820
 also has meaningful text content 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.350
 and that also gives video to that must 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.940
 but you always here at youtube always 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.610
 search 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.680
 The video is very first cream videos 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.270
 really made really cool and me 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.610
 think that is also an improved 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.620
 I think that's on the album otherwise 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.900
 the songs before that 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.290
 have been known had been known 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.300
 have been known turn 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.620
 I find otherwise very well find 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.160
 I still all the other songs 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:00.960
 really really the only one 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.960
 What I do not like is daddy can do that 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.130
 But you do not have to listen to it 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.390
 but I still think that's good 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.620
 I want to be on each one now 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.570
 received as 30 so the song number 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.630
 three lorry but 30 each as a 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.490
 bit a bit private 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.800
 with one but to that right off again 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.440
 cards and says okay here I want 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.730
 my album the entertainment and me 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.860
 would like with private welded so 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.360
 that you are not interested in speaking 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.950
 one very briefly something private at 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.450
 lets that fall directly again find that 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.490
 I also really bad because of that 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.630
 just would not do that person 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.330
 if you are quite honest 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.680
 So I have to say I bought it 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.390
 finds a bit disappointed that the 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.190
 boxer is there with but has 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.050
 luckily about amazon about this 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.270
 Amazon cloud player the thing now 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:51.270
 meanwhile my name is down 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:55.080
 loaded and was on vox could big 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:59.970
 I have to say who the cvp and the 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.620
 bdp who liked this rap is definitely 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.570
 not disappointed with the album 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.220
 I really think first tip 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.990
 But you have to say you really have to 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.100
 first of all a few songs maybe 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.720
 Listen to youtube 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.729
 maybe a few battle rap rounds 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.500
 to look at it from him is it 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.760
 because at all my music style because 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.990
 this style 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.070
 I know a lot of the german web 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.830
 they all say I can not do that 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.560
 that's not for me 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.640
 and accordingly also people said 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.820
 they say hey that's something 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.620
 other that's it too and with field and 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.930
 that's just where you want to go 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.110
 i say i like it is really good 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.420
 I can not do it very much yet 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.040
 two more companies and industries again 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.750
 Someday I will do it 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.340
 Just come back because if you do not 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.710
 really this emphasis and this 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.300
 music style in the long run, I believe 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.730
 Your tips on how to annoy 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.650
 but all in all very very successful 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.610
 album and superior for the people 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:59.370
 It is really possible to beat the purchase 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.100
 top so there is not more to say 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.960
 you got the album you have 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.520
 the alps already heard how do you think 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.560
 it was the video you looked at 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.610
 tell me your opinion in the 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.370
 Comments
