00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
properly you will need your filled

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.369 
properly you will need your filled

your<00:00:52.920> liners<00:00:55.160> before<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.309> start<00:00:56.609> here<00:00:57.120> are

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
your liners before we start here are

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
your liners before we start here are
some<00:00:57.420> things<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> consider<00:00:57.980> first<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.460> have

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
some things to consider first you have

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.040 
some things to consider first you have
to<00:00:59.699> let<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.030> liner<00:01:00.269> suggests<00:01:00.870> your

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to let your liner suggests your

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
to let your liner suggests your
processing<00:01:01.649> room<00:01:01.859> temperature<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.059> 48

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
processing room temperature for about 48

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
processing room temperature for about 48
hours<00:01:04.050> for<00:01:04.590> best<00:01:04.830> results<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> room

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
hours for best results the room

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
hours for best results the room
temperature<00:01:06.600> should<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:06.960> anywhere<00:01:07.530> from

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
temperature should be anywhere from

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.850 
temperature should be anywhere from
sixty<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> eighty<00:01:08.940> degrees<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.140> also<00:01:10.470> best

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
sixty to eighty degrees it's also best

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
sixty to eighty degrees it's also best
to<00:01:11.130> keep<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> liners<00:01:11.820> away<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.540> direct<00:01:12.900> heat

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to keep the liners away from direct heat

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
to keep the liners away from direct heat
and<00:01:13.350> sunlight<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.190> have<00:01:14.370> to<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.700> sure<00:01:14.730> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and sunlight you have to make sure that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.910 
and sunlight you have to make sure that
your<00:01:15.540> camp<00:01:15.750> measurements<00:01:16.350> matches<00:01:16.800> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
your camp measurements matches the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
your camp measurements matches the
bottles<00:01:17.340> measurements<00:01:17.940> for<00:01:18.390> example<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:19.050> 38

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
bottles measurements for example a 38

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.700 
bottles measurements for example a 38
400<00:01:20.250> cap<00:01:20.460> needs<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.120> bottle<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> 38<00:01:22.050> 400

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
400 cap needs a bottle with a 38 400

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
400 cap needs a bottle with a 38 400
opening<00:01:23.160> we're<00:01:23.550> relying<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> pressure

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
opening we're relying on the pressure

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
opening we're relying on the pressure
created<00:01:24.750> by<00:01:24.990> screwing<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.980> cap<00:01:26.220> into

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
created by screwing down the cap into

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
created by screwing down the cap into
the<00:01:26.760> bottle<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.540> activate<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.230> adhesive

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the bottle to activate the adhesive

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.970 
the bottle to activate the adhesive
hence<00:01:29.190> a<00:01:29.550> pressure<00:01:30.090> sensitive<00:01:30.540> liner

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
hence a pressure sensitive liner

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.620 
hence a pressure sensitive liner
therefore<00:01:31.980> you'll<00:01:32.460> want<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> use<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.360> best

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
therefore you'll want to use the best

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.110 
therefore you'll want to use the best
fit<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.380> another<00:01:35.040> thing<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> consider<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
fit here another thing to consider is

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.610 
fit here another thing to consider is
the<00:01:36.270> type<00:01:36.480> of<00:01:36.510> product<00:01:37.050> you're<00:01:37.140> putting<00:01:37.500> into

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
the type of product you're putting into

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.890 
the type of product you're putting into
the<00:01:37.770> bottle<00:01:38.160> because<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.850> will<00:01:39.180> affect<00:01:39.660> how<00:01:39.870> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
pressure-sensitive liner works this

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
liner works best with powder based

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.790 
liner works best with powder based
products<00:01:44.550> dry<00:01:45.240> products<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.560> sometimes
