00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and a remote here's the sensor let's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.640 
and a remote here's the sensor let's
take<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> look<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.350> center<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.500> a

take a look at the center this is a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.190 
take a look at the center this is a
super<00:02:37.890> 35<00:02:38.250> sensor<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.720> you're<00:02:39.900> probably

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
super 35 sensor so you're probably

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.160 
super 35 sensor so you're probably
dealing<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> 1.6<00:02:41.550> crap<00:02:41.880> again<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.080> know
