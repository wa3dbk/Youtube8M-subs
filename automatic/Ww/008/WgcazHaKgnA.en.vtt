00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.000
 what would that part be long-well-groomed hair 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.799
 to have 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.650
 but it is always so much work though 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.949
 let's not wait that much 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.949
 job 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.820
 hello people i wanted you mine today 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.160
 make hair routine that was one of the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.269
 requested videos and therefore catch 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.679
 We wish you much fun 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.089
 ok I'll show you my normal one 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.619
 and once for every two weeks my 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.099
 routine and bedroom on with the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.409
 take a shower 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.419
 so that nivea blond care 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.920
 shampoo and the right conditioner 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.410
 I do not think it's that good now 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.120
 not if it's better than kainz and wife 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.900
 I'm the one from the nivea series is that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.080
 also the best 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.880
 ok then i wash my hair and 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.390
 then it goes out again from the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.239
 shower out 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.190
 after the shower at the moro can in my 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.190
 hair tips and massive one there is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.150
 just so the resin so pliability 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 claims my hair again the break 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.870
 in her that's so gm so her easier 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.820
 comes through your hair and then becomes 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:08.759
 first in the tips of my hair 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:10.590
 I'll do it for a week as well 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.360
 another hour mask namely that of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.310
 immediately let him go get her 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.080
 douglas and that is a hamas feeling 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.910
 long valley and also for hair with it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.160
 faster and I'll say it now 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.250
 how I use that and massive 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.869
 the hamas even in my approach 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.000
 and on my scalp and also in the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 No, no, until I feel like it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.690
 that it is evenly distributed throughout 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.550
 and until I just think so that's it 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.590
 is enough and then I leave that 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.030
 to act for 10 to 15 minutes 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.220
 otherwise only three minutes 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.470
 but I always do it like that 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.470
 and also helps me super good 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.390
 After 15 minutes I was the mask then 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.970
 just over the bar vanni over head out 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.500
 with lukewarm water because you want a lot 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.360
 if you have masks out of washes me 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.979
 someone tells not to take hot water 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.009
 that is why it is always lukewarm 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.009
 water 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.650
 then I first share my hair 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.770
 bit up and then give that to mine 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.770
 hair 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.730
 Finally , I have to big again 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
 interrogate that is such a pattern for the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.880
 trading volumes and I give that 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.300
 then again my hair and fill it 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.070
 then 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.600
 I'll take that to my approach and 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.790
 He always turns my hair back on 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.050
 game that then go and circuit 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.180
 then again through the whole 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.190
 Hair and I just do it 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.190
 and then fill it halfway dry 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.010
 the movie broich just the longest but 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.560
 after ten to 15 minutes are mine 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.760
 Hair then dry well and that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.260
 I do not always use but I wanted 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.959
 show you how the german beer 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.760
 This will mermaid on the beach and I feel 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.260
 easy in my hair, however 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.660
 indicates that the hair is very much me 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.980
 I do not use that often but I have to 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.840
 you just fine that and 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.459
 either although I want my hair because 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.459
 one or braid them 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.170
 and then I'll find her again 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.910
 dry so a bit dry or 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.770
 just leave the job in there and 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.660
 but then did the next day but 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.890
 then I should go for a venture 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.200
 I do not have my hair all that right now 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.580
 Allow time to dry when filling so 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.350
 in the job but you have after a time 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.510
 opened up because that's really very 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.730
 takes a long time but I have a bit 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.350
 if in the hair a bit volume that 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.510
 I really like it now 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.820
 I use my tea tree oil and give it 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.630
 just on my neck and down on 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.880
 and of it 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.560
 the hair really does not because the oil is on 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.580
 The scalp feeds and does not open 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.580
 the hair starts 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.810
 At the end if my hair then 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.430
 dry 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.740
 I still have to separately hold the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.580
 reminds volume spam my hair and 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.580
 then it was already 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.220
 yes and that's it, I hope so 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.900
 You liked it and I hope you 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.900
 that's good bye my life
