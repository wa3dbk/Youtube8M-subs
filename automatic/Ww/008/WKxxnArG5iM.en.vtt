00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
actually video a little bit because it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.150 
actually video a little bit because it
takes<00:00:59.399> quite<00:01:00.239> long<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> install<00:01:00.870> over<00:01:01.739> 15

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.370 
takes quite long to install over 15
minutes<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:04.729> my<00:01:05.729> video<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.330> takes<00:01:06.689> only<00:01:07.020> 3

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
minutes and my video it takes only 3

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
minutes and my video it takes only 3
minutes<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.460> whole<00:01:09.080> solution<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
minutes the whole solution so as you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
minutes the whole solution so as you
could<00:01:12.090> see<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.570> could<00:01:15.200> start<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> installation

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
could see I could start the installation

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.749 
could see I could start the installation
wizard<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.810> tell<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:20.119> default<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.840> all

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
wizard and tell the default is all

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.499 
wizard and tell the default is all
passwords<00:01:24.710> start<00:01:25.710> installation<00:01:29.509> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
passwords start installation the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.530 
passwords start installation the
Installer<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:32.759> installs<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
Installer then just installs the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.060 
Installer then just installs the
