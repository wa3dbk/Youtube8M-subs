that he warranted that kind of a level
of<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> fight<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> thought<00:00:55.500> he's<00:00:55.620> done<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.040 
of a fight but I thought he's done that
now<00:00:56.100> he<00:00:56.160> has<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:57.000> excellent<00:00:57.510> victory<00:00:57.780> against

and shutting down the Devon Alexander in

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
and shutting down the Devon Alexander in
December<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.300> those<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
December so those are the kind of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.420 
December so those are the kind of
victories<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.559> my<00:01:04.650> mind<00:01:04.860> puts<00:01:05.100> him<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.309> that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
victories and my mind puts him in that

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.190 
victories and my mind puts him in that
position<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.909> weathers<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.810> actually

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
position now weathers if I can actually

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
position now weathers if I can actually
happen<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.619> remains<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.280> seen<00:01:08.520> there's

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
happen or not remains to be seen there's

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
happen or not remains to be seen there's
still<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.240> question<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.409> ask<00:01:10.560> both<00:01:10.799> sides

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
still a question if you ask both sides

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
still a question if you ask both sides
about<00:01:11.670> whether<00:01:11.880> he's<00:01:12.090> still<00:01:12.270> under<00:01:12.390> contract

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630

about whether he's still under contract
to<00:01:13.110> Showtime<00:01:13.530> Showtime<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.850> believe<00:01:15.150> says<00:01:15.330> he

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to Showtime Showtime I believe says he

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.630 
to Showtime Showtime I believe says he
is<00:01:15.630> Khan<00:01:16.229> says<00:01:16.500> he's<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.549> are

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
is Khan says he's not there are

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.850 
is Khan says he's not there are
definitely<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> lot<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.330> questions<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.869> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
definitely a lot of questions there but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740 
definitely a lot of questions there but
if<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> mayweather-pacquiao<00:01:21.060> fight<00:01:21.390> does

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
if the mayweather-pacquiao fight does

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
if the mayweather-pacquiao fight does
not<00:01:21.930> happen<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> fights<00:01:23.159> i<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:23.580> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
not happen it's the fights i think is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
not happen it's the fights i think is
probably<00:01:24.090> doable<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.780> long<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> contract

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
probably doable as long as the contract

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.830 
probably doable as long as the contract
situation<00:01:25.710> sorted<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> while<00:01:27.390> again<00:01:27.630> not

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
situation sorted out and while again not
