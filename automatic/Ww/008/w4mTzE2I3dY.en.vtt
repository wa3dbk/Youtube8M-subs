00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.660
 good friends today let's try the 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.460
 performance of this sterling and well you already 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.260
 the day came for those who are not 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.120
 familiar with what I do in these 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.830
 tests because basically it is to travel 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.049
 this circuit that is called back to 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.330
 lake with the cars in this case are the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.950
 classic sports cars and we record the 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.630
 times from which more time does 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.120
 even the least time for 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.650
 register them in a top so to speak and 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.200
 well, as this car is of recent 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.320
 introduction then let's see how 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.210
 behaves in this circuit we start 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.670
 the return that registered the shortest time and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.899
 we basically see that it is an amount 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.329
 that in reality to me what I 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.690
 was very surprised was that he has 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.800
 good acceleration stability 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 it also has a bit of acceleration 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.269
 but you can not tell because they are cars 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.460
 their performance is less than 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.079
 supercars however I think 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.269
 that I was left with the feeling of the pegasus 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.429
 city and that's why this teacher suddenly 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.710
 encouraged but not when I saw the times that 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.949
 compare against the other sports 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.859
 classics with feints really is a good 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.839
 car has a very good balance has 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.969
 acceleration is also not the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.810
 I recommend now when we get to 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:09.729
 the curves 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.950
 let's also demand let's say it 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.720
 puts it up and does not make some 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.210
 strangers that can reach you 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.159
 worry does not have no oversteer 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.869
 has understeer, so I liked the 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.539
 balance that keeps this car the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.880
 it really makes me thumb up and let's say 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.740
 that rival the cars 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.740
 classic sports cars that are in the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.530
 first places and then let's see here 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.689
 we have already finished our return more 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.579
 quick let's see the time here 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:42.819
 we have the time is 56 seconds with 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.490
 356 thousandths this tells us that it is in 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:50.049
 first place the sternum is in first 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.909
 place 56 45 56 and we see that he won the z 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.069
 type that I had also in the same 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.130
 second in 56 but he was in 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:00.459
 eight hundred ninety not really if it's 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.009
 with a performance far above all 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:06.039
 the other classic sports the truth 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.200
 he won the pigalle al mondo to the helmet 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.899
 flirtatious or has 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.420
 in a very good performance then as 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.879
 conclusion I recommend that you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620
 buy and keep it for those 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.709
 careers that can be made of accounts 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.989
 present on online keep it up because 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.540
 this is a winning car is a car that 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.849
 he likes circuits does not make you 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.530
 strangers that very old that you do not 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.950
 we make strangers that make you lose the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.140
 auto is not a very reliable car and therefore 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.870
 above all you can demand it or you know that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.519
 it's not a car like others that suddenly 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.780
 you have to take care of it like the helmet 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.010
 you have to take care of it when you 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.349
 you get on the curves because suddenly 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.970
 but you can not miss it and this one does not 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.319
 I like for example here in this 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.110
 you can see it 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.819
 totally and in no time loses in 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.980
 the back in no time does 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.349
 his turn and he goes in front he does not know 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.090
 get attached to the curves because now 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.060
 this was the video to see the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.060
 performance of this external goodbye friends 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.060
 Y 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.500
 and if not
