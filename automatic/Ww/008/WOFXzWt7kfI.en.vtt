00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
opinion but I have to point out that it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.100 
opinion but I have to point out that it
is<00:01:04.710> forged<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.820> can't<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
is forged so you can't use it on a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.190 
is forged so you can't use it on a
regular<00:01:07.680> client<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.520> guess<00:01:08.729> origin<00:01:09.570> PvP<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
