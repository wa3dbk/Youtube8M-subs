now I showed you in the last lesson how

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.509 
now I showed you in the last lesson how
to<00:00:06.620> do<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.799> pole<00:00:08.040> vectors<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.760> foot<00:00:09.330> controls

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
to do the pole vectors and foot controls

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.310 
to do the pole vectors and foot controls
now<00:00:11.519> we're<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> start<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> back<00:00:12.480> go

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
now we're going to start on the back go

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.950 
now we're going to start on the back go
to<00:00:13.380> your<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.769> views<00:00:14.599> like<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.719> said<00:00:15.929> earlier

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
to your for views like I said earlier

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.800 
to your for views like I said earlier
you<00:00:16.560> don't<00:00:16.740> create<00:00:16.980> any<00:00:17.510> joints<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
you don't create any joints in the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.920 
you don't create any joints in the
perspective<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.930> side

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
perspective you have to be in the side

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.429 
perspective you have to be in the side
or<00:00:21.960> top<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:22.859> front<00:00:23.820> view<00:00:24.090> go<00:00:24.900> back<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.410> your

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
or top or front view go back to your

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.120 
or top or front view go back to your
skeleton<00:00:26.400> joint<00:00:26.880> tool<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:29.539> now<00:00:30.710> start<00:00:31.710> by

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
skeleton joint tool get it now start by

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.660 
skeleton joint tool get it now start by
making<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.610> root<00:00:32.790> joint<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:34.430> I'm<00:00:35.430> gonna

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
making the root joint and I'm gonna

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.410 
making the root joint and I'm gonna
create<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.090> root<00:00:36.300> joint<00:00:36.510> about<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:37.530> there

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
create as root joint about right there

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.340 
create as root joint about right there
and<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:42.290> i'll<00:00:43.290> create<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.950> next<00:00:45.170> joint<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and then i'll create the next joint in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
and then i'll create the next joint in
the<00:00:46.379> chain<00:00:46.770> i<00:00:47.160> guess<00:00:47.910> about<00:00:48.059> their<00:00:48.570> whereas

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the chain i guess about their whereas

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.880 
the chain i guess about their whereas
hip<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:50.809> now<00:00:51.809> i<00:00:51.840> can't<00:00:52.320> remember<00:00:52.500> how

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
hip would be now i can't remember how

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.299 
hip would be now i can't remember how
many<00:00:52.920> joints<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> said<00:00:54.890> need<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
many joints the I said need to be in the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459 
many joints the I said need to be in the
chain<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> think<00:00:56.910> he's<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.149> eight<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.230> try

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
chain I think he's at eight so let's try

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.410 
chain I think he's at eight so let's try
to<00:00:58.530> create<00:00:58.829> eight<00:00:59.129> joints<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.059> his<00:01:00.180> back

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
to create eight joints going up his back

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.560 
to create eight joints going up his back
this<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:04.400> kind<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.640> small<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
this would be to kind of in the small of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
this would be to kind of in the small of
the<00:01:06.810> back<00:01:07.790> go<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:09.350> three<00:01:10.610> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:13.100> kind<00:01:14.100> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the back go up three kind of kind of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.850 
the back go up three kind of kind of
where<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> rib<00:01:14.549> cage<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:15.180> start<00:01:18.860> fourth

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
where the rib cage would start fourth

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.390 
where the rib cage would start fourth
one<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.159> chain<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.530> armpit<00:01:25.400> five

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
one and chain kind of in the armpit five

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.770 
one and chain kind of in the armpit five
let's<00:01:26.970> put<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:28.610> were<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:35.299> dog<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.570> can't

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
let's put it that were the dog I can't

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.240 
let's put it that were the dog I can't
think<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.049> name<00:01:38.150> collarbone<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:40.159> put<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
think of the name collarbone I put it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.149 
think of the name collarbone I put it
back<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:41.610> his<00:01:41.729> collarbone<00:01:42.090> he<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:43.159> sixth

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
back where his collarbone he is sixth

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.050 
back where his collarbone he is sixth
let's<00:01:45.500> go<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.740> i<00:01:46.890> guess<00:01:47.070> about<00:01:47.220> mid<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:48.000> the
