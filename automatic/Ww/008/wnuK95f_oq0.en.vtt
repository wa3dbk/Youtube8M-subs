top coat i can wear the manager for i

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.990 
top coat i can wear the manager for i
guess<00:03:56.290> for<00:03:57.280> five<00:03:57.879> days<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.659> then<00:03:59.609> it<00:04:00.609> begins

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
guess for five days and then it begins

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.920 
guess for five days and then it begins
to<00:04:01.239> look<00:04:01.389> not<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.689> fresh<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:03.099> begins<00:04:03.549> to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
to look not that fresh and it begins to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:11.129 
to look not that fresh and it begins to
like<00:04:04.930> chop<00:04:06.479> off<00:04:07.479> and<00:04:08.519> stuff<00:04:09.519> like<00:04:09.699> that<00:04:09.759> but<00:04:10.209> it

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
like chop off and stuff like that but it

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.899 
like chop off and stuff like that but it
dries<00:04:11.409> really<00:04:11.680> quickly<00:04:11.859> so<00:04:12.250> if<00:04:12.609> you<00:04:12.759> are<00:04:12.819> in

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
dries really quickly so if you are in

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.610 
dries really quickly so if you are in
hurry<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:14.560> want<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:16.109> color<00:04:17.109> your<00:04:17.199> nails

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
hurry and you want to color your nails

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.640 
hurry and you want to color your nails
so<00:04:18.250> use<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.849> top<00:04:19.239> coat<00:04:19.509> and<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.349> minute

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
so use this top coat and in the minute

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.960 
so use this top coat and in the minute
you<00:04:20.799> can<00:04:21.010> do<00:04:21.849> your<00:04:22.330> things

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.370 

so<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.000> guess<00:04:28.330> that's<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.140> can<00:04:29.530> not<00:04:30.340> say

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
so I guess that's it I can not say

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.650 
so I guess that's it I can not say
anything<00:04:32.380> else<00:04:32.740> about<00:04:32.950> this<00:04:33.340> products<00:04:34.030> except

for they are eleven dollars each and and

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.200
