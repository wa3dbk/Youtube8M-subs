00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.000
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: Ugh ... disgusting. 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
 Santana Lopez was not afraid of anything. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.800
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: They love me. I speak with the truth and I am very funny. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.000
 And then he met Brittany. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.950
 &gt;&gt;&gt; MR. SCHUE: How appropriate. 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.600
 &gt;&gt;&gt; KURT: You're brave with your fists but a coward when it comes to the truth. 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.950
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: The truth about what? 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.950
 [MUSIC] Let this be our little secret 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.500
 [MUSIC] Nobody needs to know that we're feeling 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.300
 [MUSIC] Up, up, up, up, up, up 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.000
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: The only "straight" (heterosexual) that I am is "straight up" (a total) witch. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.500
 &gt;&gt;&gt; QUINN: Oh ... Oh my God! So, are you gay? 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.900
 [MUSIC] Hey Hey Hey you and me, we keep dancing in the dark 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.250
 [MUSIC] He's been destroying me, never knowing what we are 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.400
 [MUSIC] Hey Hey Hey you and me, I try to keep quiet 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 [MUSIC] Now it's time to do something, and that's what I'll do 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.250
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: You did this to me. Did you tell everyone that I play for another team? 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.500
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: They must have felt that I am a lesbian. Do I smell golf? 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.200
 &gt;&gt;&gt; BRITTANY: They do not know what you're hiding, but they know you're not being yourself. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 &gt;&gt;&gt; BRITTANY: You're the most wonderful girl in this school. Why hide all that? 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.200
 (SANTANA VOZ): I'm afraid of the rumors, of the looks. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.900
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: I'm fine, I'm fine. (SANTANA VOZ): People have already started to treat me differently. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.400
 &gt;&gt;&gt; JACOB: So, are you in love? Are they soul mates, so to speak? 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: I'm not ready for that kind of public announcement. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 &gt;&gt;&gt; BRITTANY: Clearly you do not love yourself as much as I love you or you would wear your shirt and dance with me. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
 &gt;&gt;&gt; BRITTANY: I believe in you, Santana. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 &gt;&gt;&gt; BRITTANY: Honey, I'm so proud of you. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200
 PROUDLY 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.800
 Soon 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.900
 &gt;&gt;&gt; SANTANA: That's how we do it in Lima Heights.
