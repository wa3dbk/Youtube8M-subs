00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
and different shapes and things we're

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.440 
and different shapes and things we're
going<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:20.950> use<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.190> color<00:01:21.399> paper<00:01:21.789> and<00:01:22.149> then

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
going to use the color paper and then

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.559 
going to use the color paper and then
we're<00:01:22.750> going<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.130> cut<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.399> little<00:01:24.460> strip<00:01:25.240> of

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
we're going to cut a little strip of

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.830 
we're going to cut a little strip of
paper<00:01:25.780> by<00:01:26.590> using<00:01:26.830> our<00:01:27.130> scissors<00:01:27.640> now<00:01:28.479> if<00:01:28.720> we

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
paper by using our scissors now if we

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.990 
paper by using our scissors now if we
want<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.140> make<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.470> even<00:01:29.679> we<00:01:30.220> can<00:01:30.399> take<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> ruler

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
want to make it even we can take a ruler

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.169 
want to make it even we can take a ruler
and<00:01:31.330> then<00:01:31.600> Mark<00:01:31.960> along<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.590> paper<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.819> length

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
and then Mark along the paper the length

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.870 
and then Mark along the paper the length
and<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.810> width<00:01:35.049> of<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.500> paper<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:36.220> we<00:01:36.640> want

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
and the width of the paper that we want

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.779 
and the width of the paper that we want
to<00:01:36.970> cut<00:01:37.240> I<00:01:37.890> am<00:01:38.890> going<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.340> use<00:01:39.429> a<00:01:39.459> paper

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
to cut I am going to use a paper

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.149 
to cut I am going to use a paper
guillotine<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.020> show<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:41.350> what<00:01:41.560> will<00:01:41.979> be

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
guillotine here to show you what will be

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.340 
guillotine here to show you what will be
the<00:01:42.310> process<00:01:42.819> basically<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:44.140> paper

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
the process basically the paper

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.200 
the process basically the paper
guillotine<00:01:44.920> has<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.130> little<00:01:45.490> ruler<00:01:45.729> at<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.090> top

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
guillotine has a little ruler at the top

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.039 
guillotine has a little ruler at the top
and<00:01:46.659> so<00:01:47.469> I<00:01:47.680> know<00:01:47.799> what<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.759> length<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.210> each

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
and so I know what is the length of each

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.609 
and so I know what is the length of each
one<00:01:50.439> of<00:01:50.649> my<00:01:51.479> pulling<00:01:52.479> papers<00:01:52.930> as<00:01:53.170> well<00:01:53.469> as<00:01:53.590> a

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
one of my pulling papers as well as a

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.230 
one of my pulling papers as well as a
whisk<00:01:54.009> then<00:01:54.969> you<00:01:55.600> call<00:01:56.049> along<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.850> line<00:01:57.850> or

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
whisk then you call along the line or

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.349 
whisk then you call along the line or
along<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:59.460> measurement<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.579> you<00:02:00.640> want<00:02:01.000> and

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
along the measurement that you want and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.450 
along the measurement that you want and
you<00:02:01.960> will<00:02:02.079> get<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.289> strip<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.740> paper<00:02:02.890> like<00:02:03.250> this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
you will get a strip of paper like this

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.170 
you will get a strip of paper like this
you<00:02:04.240> can<00:02:04.420> also<00:02:04.600> use<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.869> paper<00:02:05.170> shredder<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:06.640> cut

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
you can also use a paper shredder to cut

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.859 
you can also use a paper shredder to cut
your<00:02:07.539> paper<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.700> has<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.910> drawback<00:02:10.359> and

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
your paper but it has a drawback and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.900 
your paper but it has a drawback and
that<00:02:11.079> is<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.680> cannot<00:02:12.010> call<00:02:12.370> different

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
that is that you cannot call different

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.810 
that is that you cannot call different
widths<00:02:13.359> of<00:02:13.510> paper<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.680> also<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.370> sometimes

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
widths of paper and also that sometimes

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.940 
widths of paper and also that sometimes
shredders<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.690> damage<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.200> paper<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.920> I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
shredders can damage the paper so I

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.910 
shredders can damage the paper so I
prefer<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.489> use<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.180> manual<00:02:20.049> shredder<00:02:20.470> rather

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
prefer to use a manual shredder rather

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.330 
prefer to use a manual shredder rather
than<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.220> mechanical<00:02:21.910> one<00:02:22.320> now<00:02:23.320> here<00:02:23.859> we<00:02:24.070> have

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
than a mechanical one now here we have

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.110 
than a mechanical one now here we have
two<00:02:25.030> different<00:02:25.060> ways<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.350> pulling<00:02:26.799> paper<00:02:27.190> but

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
two different ways of pulling paper but

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.690 
two different ways of pulling paper but
this<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.930> one<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.590> used<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.980> most<00:02:30.010> as

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
this is the one that is used the most as

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.840 
this is the one that is used the most as
you<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.269> see<00:02:31.480> here<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:33.250> will<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.670> one

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
you can see here and it will be the one

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.729 
you can see here and it will be the one
that<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.180> will<00:02:34.239> be<00:02:34.329> using<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.930> our<00:02:34.959> upcoming

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
that we will be using on our upcoming

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.550 
that we will be using on our upcoming
projects<00:02:36.280> well<00:02:37.000> that's<00:02:37.510> all<00:02:37.810> there<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.410> it

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
