that we can just get Sony's attention a

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
little bit quicker and whatever is going

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.230

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.390 
side of things here really does need
tightening<00:04:24.370> up<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.669> think<00:04:24.849> a<00:04:24.909> little<00:04:25.030> bit<00:04:25.210> of

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
tightening up I think a little bit of

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.150 
tightening up I think a little bit of
more<00:04:26.850> open<00:04:27.300> communication<00:04:28.110> for<00:04:28.380> between<00:04:28.650> Sony

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
more open communication for between Sony

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.770 
more open communication for between Sony
