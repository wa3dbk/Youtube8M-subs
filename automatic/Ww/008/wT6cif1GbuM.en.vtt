00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hi, my princesses, how are you? Good with you. 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.550
 Another dae for Valentine's Day I 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.460
 I know it 's tomorrow but it gives people time 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.719
 They are cute things and very easy to do. 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.289
 so let's see what we're going 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.689
 need we will need comic 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:25.019
 ink of him having scissors brush and photos 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.449
 Good, I started riding like I wanted to. 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.789
 my comic I thought of several things 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.079
 but space does not allow then I cut it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.460
 only one photo I passed glue with law nÃ© 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.920
 and made a heart up between him and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 put a little glitter on the wall 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.460
 chanan 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.600
 remembering that everything is the inspiration of the people 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.640
 So you make the color that you 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.530
 Prefer the way you do 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.680
 I wish they could put it in a comic 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.680
 bigger and everything is at the option of you 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.890
 It stays that way and I'll put it in a sentence that 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.340
 marked a lot of people that is for everything 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.820
 whenever it is a phrase from the movie of 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.140
 disney also people i 'm beautiful has 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.420
 up a song to both always 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.370
 and then I did another because the idea is 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.979
 put one on each bedside table 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.560
 So I put this is mine and that one. 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.460
 the doubt is so in my I put a 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.690
 uncut photo even and the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.509
 The photos I took were moments. 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.340
 specials we love are in the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.210
 I then put this source well 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.910
 cute 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.100
 I made a contour with the people I 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.850
 I am in love with me I've told to 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 you 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.040
 Look how cute I got there. 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.110
 A pink heart full of glitter for 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.979
 get my face still, right? 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.690
 Since you're going to stay on my side of the bed, but 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.790
 You can do as you do. 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.770
 I want proof to put in the office. 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.399
 put on the wall even make four 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.140
 lines 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.910
 I still have not decided how I'm going to do more 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.070
 I'll show you in voting 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.160
 the enzyme I put my life that is the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.989
 way I call it heart and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.060
 I put it love the way he told me 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.450
 call the mood is always call me this way 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.450
 people 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.840
 and now I'll show you what you have 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.819
 within this time which is then in 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.610
 normal little nag, right? 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.450
 Good, we're going to make a zig zag with 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.519
 phrases 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.200
 so we're going to first cut into one 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.120
 sulphite sheet put the bis or ranches 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.700
 is that my husband likes the green river more 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.650
 so you can understand but you can use the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.319
 base that is the same color stays up 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.599
 Beautiful and then you will make zigzag 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.840
 with a sulphite sheet also 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.849
 Winning way back and forth I 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.590
 I do not know if I want to see how it goes. 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.720
 But that was how I understood it. 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.489
 in the video that there was also that I go 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.989
 leave the channel of the princess I saw 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.150
 down here that I do not remember the name 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.189
 now but I leave the link for you 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.909
 and in these spaces we will put 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:13.400
 Phrases people are very cool and I 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.720
 to date your love or wait when 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.459
 opened it 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.720
 As it turned out sulfite sheet I had to 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.349
 neither gives in the other and that's how it is 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.590
 that I did put duct tape brings 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.769
 people are in the video she shows putting 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.269
 with a hot glue only as it does not have 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.060
 how do you like to put it? 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.150
 congress than with white glue since 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.639
 food can not even taste like I do not know 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.340
 I put it with the same durex or you 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.260
 you can also use double-sided tape and there 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.030
 You're putting it zigzag and 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.750
 leaving space for you to place the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.750
 sentence after 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.060
 And then how did you write the sentences by hand? 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.680
 to ask medina is the space of the other me and 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.920
 kind of so 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.460
 Then I put the phrase and put it there. 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:34.880
 to be with you something inexplicable I love you 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.740
 I'm always talking to you a lot 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.830
 because I came from the screen in the room and I'm 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.130
 narrating he has not seen this gift yet 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.350
 but now that he's listening and then you 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.720
 goes putting you can print that 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.120
 it's also softer or you make the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.190
 Even though it shows more affection I know 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.730
 there I made the hand because it is priceless 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.130
 House 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.580
 Who stays that way when you open leaves? 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.690
 whole phrase and you close it tightly 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.160
 puts in the pot he cares people in 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.620
 time to open not to rip the 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.810
 packing when closing you too 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.600
 He said it right and said trust 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.570
 Did you change the packaging? 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.810
 I closed with stick glue even though 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.100
 enough quantity and mayor in more 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.070
 this can also close with hot glue 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.410
 double-sided any way you prefer 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.229
 this is it people stay like this, it does not seem like 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.870
 You opened this is the end result. 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.790
