00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.660
 ah 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.100
 the sportiest version of the model 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.260
 ibiza is called cover a denomination 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.050
 that comes from the abbreviation that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.360
 racing cup races in English 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 it's a reminder that you have achieved 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.739
 on three occasions the championship or cup 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.030
 of the world of rallies in the category of 2 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.190
 liters 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.559
 the Spanish brand that belongs to the group 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.809
 German Volkswagen presented in February 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.730
 of 2013 the fourth generation of ibiza 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.500
 Cupra and has endowed her with 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.899
 benefits that improve the already 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.570
 brilliant figures of its predecessor as 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.269
 Enjoy an acceleration from 0 to 100 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.180
 kilometers per hour in only 69 seconds 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.989
 and with a maximum speed of 228 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.989
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 the cupra 2013 engine is a small 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.630
 turbo petrol four- cylinder in 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.580
 line and 1.4 liters of displacement with 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 four valves per turbo cylinder 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.770
 intercooler and injection compressor 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.770
 direct 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.070
 offers a maximum power of 180 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.049
 horses and a high torque that 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.090
 reaches the maximum value at only 2 thousand 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.759
 revolutions per minute and keeps it 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.759
 up to 4500 revolutions per minute 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.440
 the 1.4 tsi engine is coupled as standard 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.410
 the double automatic gearbox 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.900
 dsg clutch seven speeds 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.030
 volkswagen group has some 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.130
 well-stepped relationships and ones 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.960
 really short change intervals 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 very appropriate for the character 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.130
 sporting cupra 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.400
 the gear changes can also be 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.620
 performed sequentially by 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.600
 lever located in the central tunnel or 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.819
 driving the steering wheel cams 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.310
 the average consumption approved by is 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.560
 of 5.9 liters per 100 kilometers who 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.600
 it is not proof we have measured 7 liters 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.550
 every 100 kilometers it is a 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.380
 still reasonable figure for a car of 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.819
 this approach and benefits but 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.819
 quite superior to the approved one 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.519
 the cupra version is made on the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.910
 three-door body variant 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.629
 that are called sc and have a length 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.030
 of 401 meters with a width of 169 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.030
 meters and a height of 142 meters 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.390
 It is approved for five seats although 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.400
 access to later ones is cumbersome 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.400
 and the back center is uncomfortable 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.500
 the morons and adjustments of the suspension 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.360
 the springs are clearly sporting and 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.310
 shock absorbers have a hard tarados 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.440
 and also the body is 15 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.810
 millimeters lower 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.030
 these adjustments decrease the tilt 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.130
 side of the car and lower the center 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.840
 seriousness two aspects that affect 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.000
 positive way in the dynamics of 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.920
 driving especially at the time of 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.290
 trace curves 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.620
 the self-locking electronic differential 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.000
 xds decreases understeer which is the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.980
 trend that traction have 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.170
 front to rotate lower what you brand 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.770
 the direction and improves the behavior 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.770
 in tight curves 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.900
 the xds optimizes the traction capacity 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.270
 of the car when braking the losing wheel 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.860
 adherence works together with 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.470
 the electronic stability control 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.390
 dsc and provides the car with a 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.310
 extraordinary agility 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.170
 its size allows it to circulate with 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.330
 fluency through cities although the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.580
 double clutch dsg change is a bit 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.500
 brusque of reactions and it is convenient to extreme 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.209
 the precautions and speed up with a lot 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.720
 softness when circulating these 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.550
 terms 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.680
 when the engine works at regimes 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.510
 raised the sound comes clearly to 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.840
 interior what can be annoying 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.970
 on long trips if we choose the program 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.400
 That's the most sporty sound 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.400
 increases and is evident at all times 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.800
 The practical function is offered as standard 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.800
 boot on slopes 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.900
 17- inch alloy wheels 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.550
 in diameter are of exclusive design and 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.639
 combine with profile tires 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.639
 low and measures 215 40 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.350
 the brake system has been dimensioned 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.400
 to ensure an effective response in 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.400
 any circumstance 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.669
 the front grille has been lengthened and there 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.710
 additional air intakes adapted to 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.840
 the greatest cooling needs 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.210
 of the engine and that contribute to the appearance 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.340
 aggressive cupra 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.630
 the front is completed with some headlights 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.880
 bi-xenon with led day series lights 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.710
 the exterior mirrors go in color 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.070
 bright black in contrast to the 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.070
 bodywork 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.089
 the powerful rear includes a bumper 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.430
 wider than a diffuser marks 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.619
 oversized aerodynamic in black 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.789
 mate and shows a tube exit from 

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.789
 Trapezoidal escape 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.610
 inside are mounted a 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.260
 sports design seats that offer 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.830
 a great subject and a remarkable 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.830
 comfort
