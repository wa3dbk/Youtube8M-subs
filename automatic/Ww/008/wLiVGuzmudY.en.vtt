the in the relegation battle yeah
pretty<00:00:04.589> low<00:00:04.830> at<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.069> moment<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.460> must<00:00:05.640> say<00:00:05.819> that

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
pretty low at the moment I must say that

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.259 
pretty low at the moment I must say that
the<00:00:07.799> only<00:00:07.919> thing<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.250> our<00:00:08.370> favor<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.910> suppose

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the only thing in our favor I suppose

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.879 
the only thing in our favor I suppose
was<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.719> we're<00:00:09.929> still<00:00:10.170> six<00:00:10.440> points<00:00:10.769> behind

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
was that we're still six points behind

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.999 
was that we're still six points behind
we<00:00:11.309> were<00:00:11.460> game<00:00:12.150> less<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.630> play<00:00:12.750> but<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.860> was<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
we were game less to play but it was a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.950 
we were game less to play but it was a
bitter<00:00:14.219> blow<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:15.210> difficult<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.690> me<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
bitter blow and it's difficult for me to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.630 
bitter blow and it's difficult for me to
say<00:00:16.109> too<00:00:16.170> much<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.770> moment<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.250> time<00:00:17.279> I'm

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
say too much of this moment in time I'm

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.019 
say too much of this moment in time I'm
still<00:00:17.880> grieving<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.140> suppose<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:20.699> didn't

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
still grieving I suppose that we didn't

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.029 
still grieving I suppose that we didn't
get<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> result<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.720> hoped<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.470> dreamt

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
get the result we all hoped and dreamt

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.939 
get the result we all hoped and dreamt
that<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:25.320> know<00:00:25.439> in

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that we that we would and you know in

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
that we that we would and you know in
the<00:00:26.039> first<00:00:26.220> half<00:00:26.720> until<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> minute<00:00:27.960> before

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the first half until a minute before

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.470 
the first half until a minute before
half-time<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.369> had<00:00:29.580> every<00:00:29.880> hoped<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.269> our

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
half-time I I had every hoped that our

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.880 
half-time I I had every hoped that our
performance<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> give<00:00:31.679> us<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
performance was going to give us the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.569 
performance was going to give us the
result<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.780> we<00:00:34.040> conceded<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.130> goal<00:00:35.399> just

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
result but we conceded that goal just

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
result but we conceded that goal just
before<00:00:35.969> half-time<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
before half-time and then can see that a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
before half-time and then can see that a
very<00:00:37.530> bad<00:00:37.980> second<00:00:38.460> goal<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.820> waiting<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
very bad second goal I was waiting the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
very bad second goal I was waiting the
site<00:00:39.770> short<00:00:40.770> lead<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> second<00:00:41.520> half<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
site short lead that a second half and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.160 
site short lead that a second half and
he<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.030> certainly<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.930> uphill

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
he was certainly gonna be all uphill

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.040 
he was certainly gonna be all uphill
from<00:00:43.559> from<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
from from then on in and it was the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.779 
from from then on in and it was the
first<00:00:46.289> half<00:00:46.500> some<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.460> midfield

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
first half some of the the midfield

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
first half some of the the midfield
football<00:00:48.059> was<00:00:48.149> attracting<00:00:48.660> without<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.350> don't

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
football was attracting without we don't

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
football was attracting without we don't
real<00:00:49.829> penetration<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.489> end<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
real penetration at the end of it I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.069 
real penetration at the end of it I
think<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.390> got<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:51.690> good<00:00:51.840> crossing

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
think we got into good crossing

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
think we got into good crossing
positions<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.739> thought<00:00:52.890> maybe<00:00:53.210> criticism

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
positions I thought maybe criticism

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.330 
positions I thought maybe criticism
could<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.410> quality<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.829> our<00:00:55.890> crosses

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
could be that the quality of our crosses

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.799 
could be that the quality of our crosses
wasn't<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.699> good<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> should<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.360> been<00:00:57.480> or

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
wasn't as good as it should have been or

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.930 
wasn't as good as it should have been or
the<00:00:57.840> quality<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> our<00:00:58.379> final<00:00:58.800> ball<00:00:59.010> wasn't

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the quality of our final ball wasn't

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.569 
the quality of our final ball wasn't
because<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.300> could<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.289> been<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.920> must

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
because it could have been but I must

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
because it could have been but I must
say<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> didn't<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.480> anything<00:01:03.840> coming

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
say I didn't really see anything coming

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
say I didn't really see anything coming
up<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.769> halftime<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:06.299> led<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
up to halftime that really led me to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.280 
up to halftime that really led me to
believe<00:01:06.960> I'd<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.380> standing<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:07.830> once<00:01:08.490> again

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
believe I'd be standing here once again

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
believe I'd be standing here once again
talking<00:01:10.290> about<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.830> bitter<00:01:11.189> defeat<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.000> game

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
talking about a bitter defeat in a game

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.719 
talking about a bitter defeat in a game
that<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.930> had<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.290> win<00:01:13.549> you've<00:01:14.549> still

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that really we had to win you've still

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.830 
that really we had to win you've still
got<00:01:14.850> running<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> play<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.570> still<00:01:15.780> got

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
got running to play he still got

Birmingham<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.650> play<00:01:16.890> lifelines<00:01:17.990> well<00:01:18.990> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
Birmingham to play lifelines well this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.600 
Birmingham to play lifelines well this
was<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> big<00:01:19.409> lifeline<00:01:20.040> today<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.460> haven't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
was a big lifeline today we haven't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.140 
was a big lifeline today we haven't
taken<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.479> understand<00:01:21.960> when<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:23.150> say

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
taken it so I can understand when I say

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
taken it so I can understand when I say
yes<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.840> question<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.470> thank<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
yes to your question and thank you for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.609 
yes to your question and thank you for
being<00:01:26.340> positive<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:28.259> understand

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
being positive about it I can understand

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
being positive about it I can understand
people<00:01:28.650> being<00:01:28.979> very<00:01:29.070> cynical<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.909> but

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
people being very cynical about that but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.830 
people being very cynical about that but
I<00:01:30.509> suppose<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.590> only<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.130> only<00:01:32.659> lifeline<00:01:33.659> or

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I suppose the only the only lifeline or

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
I suppose the only the only lifeline or
the<00:01:34.110> only<00:01:34.439> consolation<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.400> foot<00:01:35.700> was

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the only consolation is that foot was

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.390 
the only consolation is that foot was
not<00:01:35.880> played<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.509> paper<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.200> paper<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.189> looks

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
not played on paper on paper it looks

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
not played on paper on paper it looks
very<00:01:38.579> very<00:01:38.729> bad<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.180> us<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:39.900> five

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
very very bad for us but there are five

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.800 
very very bad for us but there are five
matches<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:41.150> four<00:01:42.150> hundred<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.540> fifty

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
matches there are four hundred and fifty

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.460 
matches there are four hundred and fifty
minutes<00:01:42.990> plus<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.009> extra<00:01:44.310> time<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.759> play

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
minutes plus a bit of extra time to play

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.929 
minutes plus a bit of extra time to play
and<00:01:46.470> certainly<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.520> need<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.790> win

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and certainly we're going to need to win

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.160 
and certainly we're going to need to win
a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.299> those<00:01:48.420> games<00:01:48.659> you're<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
a lot of those games you're going to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.710 
a lot of those games you're going to
survive<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:51.090> opportunity<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:51.689> be

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
survive but the opportunity will be

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
survive but the opportunity will be
there<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> only<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.040> only<00:01:53.159> thing

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there and that's the only the only thing

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
there and that's the only the only thing
I<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.640> say<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> moment<00:01:54.329> would<00:01:55.259> even<00:01:55.530> come

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
I can say the moment would even come

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.289 
I can say the moment would even come
close<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.310> putting<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.640> smile<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.000> my<00:01:57.270> face

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
close to putting a smile on my face

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.480 
close to putting a smile on my face
alive<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.439> other<00:01:58.799> than<00:01:58.950> tears

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
alive and I think other than tears

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.490 
alive and I think other than tears
rolling<00:02:00.119> down<00:02:00.270> my<00:02:00.450> cheeks<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.079> guess<00:02:01.290> we're<00:02:01.439> all

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
rolling down my cheeks I guess we're all

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.090 
rolling down my cheeks I guess we're all
their<00:02:01.649> smiles

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
their smiles

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740 
their smiles
you<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.030> enough<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.420> warrant<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you really do enough to warrant a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.840 
you really do enough to warrant a
starting<00:02:04.170> place<00:02:04.380> where<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> wondergirl

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
starting place where the wondergirl

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
starting place where the wondergirl
wasn't<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.420> he<00:02:06.509> did<00:02:06.719> he<00:02:06.840> did<00:02:07.049> do<00:02:07.200> very<00:02:07.469> well

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
wasn't it and he did he did do very well

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.770 
wasn't it and he did he did do very well
and<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.039> think<00:02:08.069> he<00:02:08.429> he's<00:02:08.759> been<00:02:09.149> playing<00:02:09.420> well<00:02:09.629> in

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and I think he he's been playing well in

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.190 
and I think he he's been playing well in
training<00:02:10.200> he's<00:02:10.319> he's<00:02:11.099> really<00:02:11.510> accepted<00:02:12.510> not

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
training he's he's really accepted not

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.619 
training he's he's really accepted not
being<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.560> team<00:02:13.800> very<00:02:14.190> very<00:02:14.970> well<00:02:15.239> I've<00:02:15.420> been

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
being the team very very well I've been

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.080 
being the team very very well I've been
very<00:02:15.870> impressed<00:02:16.500> by<00:02:16.709> his<00:02:17.090> professionalism

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
very impressed by his professionalism

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.720 
very impressed by his professionalism
and<00:02:18.420> certainly<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.620> haven't<00:02:19.890> had<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.340> many

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and certainly we haven't had that many

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.970 
and certainly we haven't had that many
goals<00:02:21.140> scored<00:02:22.140> we<00:02:22.440> haven't<00:02:22.680> had<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.800> many

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
goals scored we haven't had that many

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.520 
goals scored we haven't had that many
players<00:02:23.540> pushing<00:02:24.540> themselves<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:25.200> front<00:02:25.379> of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
players pushing themselves in front of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.830 
players pushing themselves in front of
me<00:02:25.650> saying<00:02:25.920> use<00:02:26.280> me<00:02:26.550> I'm<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:27.000> goal<00:02:27.180> scorer<00:02:27.480> so

me saying use me I'm your goal scorer so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
me saying use me I'm your goal scorer so
I<00:02:28.140> suppose<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> simple<00:02:29.310> answer<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.640> your

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
I suppose a simple answer to your

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.330 
I suppose a simple answer to your
question<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.330> yes<00:02:30.480> he's<00:02:30.720> he<00:02:31.440> shares<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.890> vision

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
question is yes he's he shares a vision

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.040 
question is yes he's he shares a vision
enormously<00:02:32.819> today<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.480> wonder<00:02:33.810> gold

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
and the fact that he also almost got a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.390 
and the fact that he also almost got a
second<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> head<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.830> later<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.310> the
