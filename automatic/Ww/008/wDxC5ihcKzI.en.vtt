00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.680
 blue saw 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.400
 with this hard party text 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.750
 very hard no no 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.750
 at the beginning especially at very specific moments 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.929
 they are not all the moments 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.279
 at the beginning the city 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.240
 the city has been easy enough for him 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380
 behind the world 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.599
 despite being a mentally tough match throughout the game because it was very 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.819
 difficult to have options to the rest of the very difficult 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.909
 but the feeling of being able to play a few hours in a row with 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.949
 with address eat everything because I had a pretty fast pump 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.680
 nor and that made everything difficult did not operate 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 go to be very attentive with 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.950
 You can not make mistakes with the service and that has been the best thing 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.270
 done once the serve in him 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.690
 I relax from the party 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 abortion but the important thing of this city has been decisive the party 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.930
 and client that the moments that he had of would take advantage and when he had to 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.460
 play aggressive also two 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 he has done it especially to the poor that especially in moments that are left 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.480
 needy 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.640
 because of the difficulty 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.950
 subsequently had specialties party or eventually while 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.860
 it's because it was very difficult 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.800
 4 in the match 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.290
 in the Serbian against had 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.120
 the typical with 25 snowballs and other La Mancha 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.390
 the parade is gone 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.210
 very hard 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.750
 He said that the subject was very tight 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.600
 of almagro and you took all this 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.990
 we are in the quarterfinals of a grand slam no no no no matches 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.830
 easy or not very rare estepona in counterparts simple in conception 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.380
 a slam for those who are there is because they deserve it and because they have played 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.240
 well and it's been playing well 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.780
 I tell you because he decided on details 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.020
 and me in front 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 I played better and I the two trains said better I wanted and been party in the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.530
 third set is also playing at a very high level 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.820
 and leisure where he played better also because he kept up very well with my service and 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.680
 vials that I was playing I think that better than this one started the match up 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.280
 four guards arrived tucked 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.570
 your mistakes and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.920
 read 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 has helped me Japanese is the match 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.690
 it was time that you are not going to play or in all kinds the time does it in the 5 4 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.139
 days ago 2 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.649
 of 5 4 degrees at the most 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:19.259
 Carlos I 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.259
 it was for the time another fact some 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:23.990
 CD 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.979
 I have spoken with 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 moncada because I got into a mess 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.659
 I'm the first one who does tourne first 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.229
 When I deserve it I deserve to go 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.699
 and I think it was a tad soonwash world that made me play 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.249
 too much time with 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.859
 with the pressure 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.819
 weather 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.249
 I do not think you could see any problems waiting for me to get it worked 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.889
 but I understand that it was 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.789
 that the rules are the rules and if of month with the people have to pull 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.389
 He had previously told me before 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.609
 to look at a talent and 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.279
 said what was said 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.180
 will try to improve but you see that you have not done it if you ask me to address how you play 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:04.689
 then in 5 4 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.519
 the second one is believed to have been and so we have put 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.730
 speak because he has warned me to let them start a slower and I 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.739
 there I believe that no 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.170
 he was not right because he was all the time called three thousand in a business 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.179
 current and just compared to what usual 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:23.639
 and I can keep myself vary but that time to be able to think about moving forward 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.679
 to equity in September 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.419
 but the party was going 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.219
 as with the water around my neck because I'm tired when they do not give me a penalty 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.219
 notify and when the volta warn and I thought 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.769
 that is making an effort to erratic and what to see 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.379
 Santano so I said that 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.239
 I thought that faster I could not go wrong that I did not deserve emc 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.959
 second and healthy question 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.919
 in that order 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.919
 I also have to see them but I did not entertain myself with energy 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.570
 min the sotón 20 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.509
 for his part of the bunch of temporary work I mean 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:06.549
 a few years prepare the brethas very shortly before you deserve it s12 one in 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.229
 Rome 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.829
 and then télam at &amp; t suddenly happened though hundred of soderling that 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.799
 the apartment that has already played very well 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.309
 until the arc match 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.400
 a federer who wants is a kind of 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.409
 from o corgo 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:23.770
 in it appears Don Miguel Min in that everything has changed but changed everything 

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:26.769
 delay 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.509
 probably mental like as 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.490
 as it happens most times not 20 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.530
 he took the confidence that the party took confidence to play the final 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.800
 someone in Roland Garros and see what 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.180
 who will see me if they extend from high parana 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.849
 to opt for important things 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.880
 because I can always tea time long ago 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.880
 until the circuit in the locker room you know 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.960
 with the stroke service that he really had 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.930
 it will be very strange that it was found after the Franco regime 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.469
 you have to do it was very big for everyone 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.469
 and it's in summer and matures a tad later 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.419
 let's see an important example in Spain you also earn 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.620
 verdasco 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.370
 that we always knew that it had a very high potential but what a lover 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.320
 a little later he left his best level now when he is 26 and 27 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.539
 years 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.259
 there are people who are changing 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.509
 see later generated also soon 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.669
 robben has made the truck put later 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.669
 not for that reason it remains dangerous and in it 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.960
 the fact the fact to happen to semifinals for you that knew of them 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.370
 I know it's not going to be the one that people do not think if in number one either 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.740
 I do not suppose 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.150
 it's not so healthy to move forward 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.099
 It is there but it is that I 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.099
 it did not look more important contest is number one number one 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.439
 Catalan to be able to be 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.029
 roland garros until next year there will be no others 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.060
 are the reality of the 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.059
 the situation of madrid 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.489
 neither opposite and very focused on my semifinal game of his party 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.460
 very important 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.749
 very difficult also could not be seen for very well against living 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:10.080
 Colombian port and 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.839
 in the end 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.819
 they are rivals 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.819
 a priori it may seem like a surprise is in the semifinals and 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.759
 but if it is because they have played 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.959
 before the one that played better from its zone of sand I go I have of end 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.020
 we do not know about the dangerous teleplay that is that you can stop semifinals 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.460
 do not 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.839
 I'm telling you 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.839
 As always, he wants to do his best 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.199
 positive also we already stop the commissary today here no matter what happens 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.330
 if we talk 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.800
 with the rivals and with we are direct to yield to djokovic 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.409
 the morgue because this fact better result than 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:49.979
 that all of them 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.569
 also if we talk about the race of champions and the answers moby also 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.749
 adding more points they collect a 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.659
 a small mattress so everything will also depend on how I end up 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.139
 the tournament is 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:03.509
 probably 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:07.229
 extends part although we play despite the fact that the final is the voice on issues of 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.759
 points at stake and many points to make an important step forward
