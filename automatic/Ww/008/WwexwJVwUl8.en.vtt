to be in a classroom sitting next to a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.100 
to be in a classroom sitting next to a
student<00:03:11.850> maybe<00:03:12.060> you're<00:03:12.269> studying<00:03:12.690> linear

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
student maybe you're studying linear

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.319 
student maybe you're studying linear
equations<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.549> person<00:03:14.910> next<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.269> is
