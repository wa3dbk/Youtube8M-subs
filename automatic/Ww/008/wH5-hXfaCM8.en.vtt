I<00:00:03.230> once<00:00:04.230> drove<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.560> Jeep<00:00:04.740> that<00:00:04.920> had<00:00:04.980> no<00:00:05.339> brakes

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
I once drove a Jeep that had no brakes

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.670 
I once drove a Jeep that had no brakes
whatsoever<00:00:06.210> whenever<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.049> had<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.319> stop<00:00:07.500> for<00:00:07.529> a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
whatsoever whenever I had to stop for a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.440 
whatsoever whenever I had to stop for a
light<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.099> passenger<00:00:08.550> would<00:00:08.730> hop<00:00:09.030> out<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.330> put

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
light my passenger would hop out and put

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.600 
light my passenger would hop out and put
a<00:00:09.480> brick<00:00:09.690> under<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.019> front<00:00:10.200> tire<00:00:10.519> matter<00:00:11.519> of

a brick under the front tire matter of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.160 
a brick under the front tire matter of
fact<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.120> only<00:00:12.150> accessory<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.690> did<00:00:12.990> work

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
fact the only accessory that did work

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.799 
fact the only accessory that did work
was<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> horn<00:00:13.880> if<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> vehicle<00:00:15.509> with

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
was the horn if you have a vehicle with

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.390 
was the horn if you have a vehicle with
no<00:00:15.900> brakes<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.410> highly<00:00:16.770> recommend<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.310> you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
no brakes I highly recommend that you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.390 
no brakes I highly recommend that you
have<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> functional<00:00:18.150> horn<00:00:18.650> now<00:00:19.650> sometimes

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
have a functional horn now sometimes

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.160 
have a functional horn now sometimes
it's<00:00:20.640> inconvenient<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> passenger

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it's inconvenient to have the passenger

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
it's inconvenient to have the passenger
hop<00:00:22.590> out<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> time<00:00:23.300> sometimes<00:00:24.300> you

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
hop out all the time sometimes you

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.450 
hop out all the time sometimes you
haven't<00:00:24.570> got<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> passenger<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:26.160> those<00:00:26.250> two

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
haven't got a passenger so for those two

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
haven't got a passenger so for those two
