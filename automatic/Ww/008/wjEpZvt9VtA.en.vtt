00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.160
 hi hairs and welcome to 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.260
 this video of sunday 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.139
 so today I will facilitate you 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.999
 life why am I going to talk to you about 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.549
 hair that tends to quickly 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.829
 to get involved to form nodes of the nodes 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.260
 who gets drunk in general and who 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.250
 unfortunately causes breakage and 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.170
 forks 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.580
 so it's simple today 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.859
 will not be a homemade recipe 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.500
 but it will be products close to 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.179
 small price that will make it easier for you 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.560
 task 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.820
 so I'm going to talk to you so little to 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.210
 small of its two brands 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.449
 so that's what loan are from the brand 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.430
 aubree organics and organic cure this 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.469
 don that are both brands 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.329
 totally different but who 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.280
 offer exceptional products 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.760
 so we'll talk a little bit more about it 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.760
 in details 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.950
 for which hair types are located 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.530
 these products so obviously for the 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.500
 tangled hair which form sets do 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 not just normal hair dry and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 fat can also use them so 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 there is no specially hair type 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.530
 it's just that in general 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.420
 I like it I do not necessarily have not 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.850
 explains you but after shampooing 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 I like the task because 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 necessarily there is the comb or the brush 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.070
 that block a little bit but without 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.010
 necessarily have knots so 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.860
 actually the texture of its products 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.880
 allows for simpler mixtures more 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.880
 faster more efficient 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.980
 to her chosen to use products 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.410
 nearby and not products to prepare 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.420
 myself then I explain to you 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.200
 in one of my previous videos 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.210
 I had formulated this loan detangler at the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.580
 mature that you can find 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.500
 so far so that was not bad at all 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.210
 but I'll admit that right now 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.590
 I have the very big laziness to make me 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.270
 homemade products so that I 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.830
 I told myself why not test 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.080
 already made products that have a 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.520
 excellent composition so some 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.470
 of you will agree with me 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 because not necessarily the time to prepare 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.720
 to prepare products yourself at the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.580
 cosmeto house so a quick product 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.440
 which is easily transportable small 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.440
 in the wine bag it's really great 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.810
 when can I use this 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.180
 produced then there is no specificity 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.610
 it may be the morning noon evening 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.350
 rise as you lay on hair 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.910
 wet on dry hair before 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.110
 shampoo after the shampoo so 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.340
 rather still after shampooing 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.570
 because before shampooing down it's a 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.430
 little bit silly because you have the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.370
 rinse but it's true that there is no 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.810
 especially of use I want 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 say you can use it as a 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.960
 mixtures on wet hair you 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.340
 can use it in the morning after the 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.580
 wake up for a little bit of 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.190
 brush 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.810
 because despite all these products are 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.260
 composed of fruit extracts from 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.660
 plants of vegetable oil so mine of 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 nothing is a little care that is this pack 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.750
 is pretty good everyday so I want 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.430
 say why deprive ourselves when we can 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.940
 put every day or twice 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.940
 per day 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.270
 so you can find these 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.430
 products so it's simple I have them 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.470
 purchased on the site america grass 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.150
 so he offers you brands all 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.870
 also different from each other 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.760
 but beware beware because this site does 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.470
 not only sell natural products 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.810
 pay attention to the compositions 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.700
 because well I'm going to speak in a 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.160
 little bit more detail you can 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.130
 buy the closed eyes mark aubry 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.720
 organics by cons I would tell you to 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.480
 put you on the reserve with regard to 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.090
 regards to cure organics because everything 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.110
 is not 100% natural sometimes 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.220
 go find some phenoxyethanol 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.630
 little things like that so that's 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.989
 not necessarily cool 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.060
 you will find excerpts from 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.370
 guar hydroxy clean skin it trime 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.200
 wannian chloride the famous word I have 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.329
 hard to say you're going to find 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.160
 some components that are not tip-top 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.780
 so be careful to watch if 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.900
 never want to use other 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.930
 mas's products from the brand a cure 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.610
 then at the level of the number of 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.209
 activists so you have 118 thousand 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:09.200
 liters at aubrée and you have you 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:11.269
 calculate 4 oz so 4 oz ok that's cool I 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.220
 think it's kif kif saw the size 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.709
 of the product I think that good there is no 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.840
 the more I do not have 3000 near me 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.590
 mean we are not we are not that 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.650
 near then the aubrée will cost you 5 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.370
 euros 0.7 and on the other side the to curci 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.510
 euros 38 then we find 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.970
 equally different compositions 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.950
 each other 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.080
 knowing that aubrée and weygand and do not 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.930
 do not test on animals it is well put 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.770
 prominently on the bottle 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:47.630
 here we have nothing special we have nothing 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.970
 of special what is written gluten weygand 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.590
 free sulfate free by ben free phthalates 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.300
 free alley tiff fruit so 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.220
 actually not on animals 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.500
 also free silicone so 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.780
 actually 100% biodegradable so this 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.910
 are two excellent products then in 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.669
 the aubrée we find two witch hazel 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.460
 aloe vera glycerin from 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.780
 the camellia oil of the pantanal know 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.180
 what is the pantheon 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.740
 tired of provitamin b5 a product 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.230
 that you can find on the site as 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.490
 roma zone so also quote that me 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.930
 allows you to buy all materials 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.620
 first to make my products 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.320
 cosmetics 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.419
 then you have vegetable oil from 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.270
 jojoba and so it's an excellent 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.280
 aubre product is really a very good 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.840
 product well formulated by the way 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.880
 remains almost over so I must 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.980
 want me to redeem so as you 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.040
 see camellia and jazzman at the club you 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.350
 say wow it's still not bad 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.330
 but does it smell good so I pour 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.300
 neither done but hey I would tell you that at 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.410
 the smell started me a little surprise 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.700
 me that's what I say smell me a 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.380
 little surprise because I was expecting 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.190
 really a smell of jasmine and 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.840
 camellia but we go personally I 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.660
 not particularly find these smells good 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.820
 actually it does not feel extremely 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.350
 good but it does not stink it stinks and 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.580
 frankly the smell whistled at the end 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.290
 of a moment but after that it is only a 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.440
 personal opinion so what makes that 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.410
 some of you love round the smell 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.450
 then what's the cure and he composes 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.460
 and in the case of 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.979
 the extract of pomegranate rose hips 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.919
 of provitamin glycerin aloe vera 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:23.710
 b5 also olive oil and 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.710
 Argan which is not bad at all 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.819
 talk a little bit more about the 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.369
 provitamin b5 know that this one 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.710
 fortify your hair embellishes them the 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:34.539
 strengthens shine and fight 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.039
 against scalp problems 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.680
 so this is a great product that 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.849
 found in most products 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.289
 capillaries because it's true that 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:43.569
 it's a product that does not cost much 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.050
 and which ultimately brings a lot to our 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.550
 hair 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.930
 so here it was a little point that I 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.699
 wanted to do with you so the one who 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.889

 because provitamin b5 is really
