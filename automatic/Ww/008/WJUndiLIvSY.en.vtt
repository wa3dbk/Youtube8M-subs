00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.900
 if you approach this phenomenon 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 dzhulsruda collection unbiased that is 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 refuse to postulate it can not 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.989
 to be because there can never be 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.690
 forget that dinosaurs are not extinct 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.140
 there are tens of millions of years ago 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 but just look at this collection as 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.199
 on the empirical fact but it is not holy 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.350
 empirical fact is not scientific that is 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.089
 things were on earth were 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.010
 from there found but they are not 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.440
 scientific facts because they are not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.409
 explained as part of modern scientific 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 exact age theory cannot be established 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.420
 but on the other hand ceramics 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.250
 can't lie a million years in the earth 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.619
 that is, here we are talking about a few 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.380
 millennia maximum there a 10 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.299
 millennia because the soil in this 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.060
 areas in central mexico and very 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.490
 offensive dry and organics there persists 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.420
 fairly well with ground water there 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 well very insignificant it contributes 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.780
 preserving organic 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.619
 products in particular ceramics therefore 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.929
 here you can talk about a few 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.130
 thousands of years and then it turns out that 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:36.640
 literally here in the recent past 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.360
 this territory of central Mexico 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.960
 near people lived huge 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.200
 quantity in primarily by 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.409
 diversity of species of ancient reptiles and not 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.420
 only lived well and people were with 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.350
 their interactions because 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 among 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.000
 the julsrud collection is not alone 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.700
 a dozen 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.009
 sculptures where people are depicted tops on 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.409
 dinosaur to the point that the warrior with 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.750
 shield helmet 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.170
 use the pangolin as a mount 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.620
 as used in the old world horse 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.450
 people out there on the raptor though it may 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.590
 be some legendary motives yes yes 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.680
 nonetheless these things exist and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.830
 they can be seen with my own eyes 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.250
 bright travels unique 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.250
 research 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.240
 incredible discoveries each of us 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.060
 dreamed about them in childhood but only a few 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.060
 able to make this dream come true 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.730
 the wealth of the planet connect to those for 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.780
 whom the dream has become a reality 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.819
