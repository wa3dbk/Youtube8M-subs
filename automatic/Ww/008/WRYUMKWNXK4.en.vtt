 There is something like Chinese characters below toward you 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.820
 Then, this is China and it looks like a moon pad here 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.870
 Even if I write quite dirty, I feel that it will come to feel that this left end is a little search on the web in consultation

 How to read it is also included in iphone by default 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.250
 You can search easily because there is no need to add new apps separately 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.480

 Down the keyboard

 When you select the keyboard, there is a new keyboard added here 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.280
 Mr. Uzu has an extra end there, so I 'm going to put only Japanese, English and China or come 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.500

 Callao recommend the handwriting of the Chinese man has words full entered in this kind of form 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:58.300
 Keyboard It feels like it was particularly good in 5th place , and it makes you to search easily 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.270
 When I can not find my feeling, I will find out where to go and how to read it 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.659
 Since it is a small skill to the last, if you have an iphone, look up 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.880
 There is nobody, so it 's a moving image I think we can do the same thing with android 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:13.210
 But it is a feeling that I used the house in Android 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.720
 By the way, it is a long time ago here that it is pc 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.930

 Yes, I can look up to how to read it by saying that Han's examination properly 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.889
 Of course I think that there are many other ways than this one 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:48.060
 Tteyuu smartphones and personal computers are also studied thought Chinese characters can not be read if 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:49.060

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.810

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.810
 It feels good to be able to read it
