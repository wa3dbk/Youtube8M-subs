00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
situation from one of the themes that I

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.680 
situation from one of the themes that I
think<00:04:14.590> I've<00:04:14.770> added<00:04:15.130> good<00:04:15.520> affirmation<00:04:16.270> for

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
think I've added good affirmation for

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.060 
think I've added good affirmation for
this<00:04:16.840> card<00:04:17.169> is<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.989> person<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.229> not<00:04:20.560> a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
this card is that a person is not a

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.650 
this card is that a person is not a
seeing<00:04:21.489> or<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.850> cross

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
seeing or a cross

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.150 
seeing or a cross
that<00:04:23.380> we<00:04:24.070> are<00:04:24.490> like<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.690> star<00:04:26.050> gate<00:04:26.410> through

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
that we are like a star gate through

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.000 
that we are like a star gate through
which<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.760> absolute<00:04:27.910> can<00:04:28.750> manifest<00:04:29.260> into

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
which the absolute can manifest into

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.840 
which the absolute can manifest into
this<00:04:30.160> dimension<00:04:30.790> I<00:04:31.030> think<00:04:31.840> that's<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.230> good

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
this dimension I think that's a good

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.000 
this dimension I think that's a good
sort<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.940> idea<00:04:34.390> to<00:04:34.720> reflect<00:04:35.170> on<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.440> good

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
sort of idea to reflect on a good

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.460 
sort of idea to reflect on a good
affirmation<00:04:36.790> it's<00:04:37.030> your<00:04:37.270> number<00:04:37.450> know<00:04:38.260> where

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
affirmation it's your number know where

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.700 
affirmation it's your number know where
a<00:04:38.500> little<00:04:38.920> star<00:04:39.370> portal<00:04:39.940> through<00:04:40.690> which<00:04:40.720> the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
a little star portal through which the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.530 
a little star portal through which the
god<00:04:41.950> essence<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:44.670> always<00:04:45.670> creating<00:04:46.330> and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
god essence is always creating and

card and I have the reversal from let's

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.240 
card and I have the reversal from let's
log<00:05:31.230> reversals<00:05:32.230> are<00:05:32.380> very<00:05:32.560> important<00:05:33.130> because

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
log reversals are very important because

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.720 
log reversals are very important because
if<00:05:33.640> this<00:05:33.790> car<00:05:34.090> is<00:05:34.120> upside<00:05:34.540> down<00:05:35.080> then<00:05:35.980> you<00:05:36.520> need

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
if this car is upside down then you need

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.540 
if this car is upside down then you need
to<00:05:36.940> know<00:05:36.970> why<00:05:37.480> is<00:05:37.540> upside<00:05:38.290> down<00:05:38.320> so<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.340> you

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
to know why is upside down so that you

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.420 
to know why is upside down so that you
can<00:05:39.730> take<00:05:39.970> measures<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.870> get<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.740> card<00:05:42.100> and

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
can take measures to get that card and

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.350 
can take measures to get that card and
therefore<00:05:43.390> get<00:05:43.630> that<00:05:43.840> energy<00:05:44.380> up<00:05:45.120> write<00:05:46.120> it

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
therefore get that energy up write it

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.110 
therefore get that energy up write it
again<00:05:46.720> so<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.830> reversals<00:05:48.460> are<00:05:48.610> on<00:05:48.700> my<00:05:48.850> blog
