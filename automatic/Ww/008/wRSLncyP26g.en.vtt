loss of control of the vehicle and when
that<00:00:51.659> happens<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.159> about<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
that happens all you have is about a

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.549 
that happens all you have is about a
split<00:00:53.699> second<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> react<00:00:54.690> before<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:55.140> vehicle

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
split second to react before the vehicle

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.039 
split second to react before the vehicle
spins<00:00:55.859> out<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> control<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.780> why

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
spins out of control and that is why

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:59.779 
spins out of control and that is why
it's<00:00:58.289> extremely<00:00:58.979> important<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.519> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's extremely important that the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
it's extremely important that the
drivers<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.269> adequately<00:01:00.839> trained<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.769> react

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
drivers are adequately trained to react

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.359 
drivers are adequately trained to react
to<00:01:02.250> skip<00:01:02.519> situations<00:01:03.299> and<00:01:03.710> this<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to skip situations and this is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.310 
to skip situations and this is
definitely<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.119> lesson<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.720> will<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.990> taking

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
definitely a lesson I will be taking

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.420 
definitely a lesson I will be taking
with<00:01:07.470> me<00:01:07.680> whenever<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.640> behind<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> wheel

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
with me whenever I get behind the wheel

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
with me whenever I get behind the wheel
due<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.759> need<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> LS<00:01:12.509> v<00:01:12.539> to<00:01:12.899> be<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

here<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.890> team<00:01:20.100> works<00:01:20.369> quickly<00:01:20.670> together<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
here the team works quickly together to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
here the team works quickly together to

which varies them together with their

count<00:01:41.790> on

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.410 

but<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:45.980> course<00:01:46.280> when<00:01:46.820> you're<00:01:46.970> out<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.120> a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
but of course when you're out of a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.570 
but of course when you're out of a
convoy<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:47.870> friendlies<00:01:48.470> help<00:01:49.010> is<00:01:49.220> always

close<00:01:49.940> by

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.800 

so<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.520> next<00:01:56.730> time<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.150> see<00:01:57.300> some<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.660> these

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so the next time you see some of these

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.960 
so the next time you see some of these
vehicles<00:01:58.410> on<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> road<00:01:58.890> hopefully<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.850> won't

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
vehicles on the road hopefully you won't

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.940 
vehicles on the road hopefully you won't
think<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.390> them<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:01.050> some<00:02:01.320> cool-looking

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
think of them as just some cool-looking

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.250 
think of them as just some cool-looking
dune<00:02:02.190> buggy<00:02:02.430> type<00:02:02.730> cars<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:03.990> like

stray vehicles are often employed by
various<00:02:06.780> forces<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:09.270> should<00:02:09.960> suggest

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
various forces and I should suggest

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.190 
various forces and I should suggest
