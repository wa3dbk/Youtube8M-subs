00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
 work overtime of workers and causes of death 

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.790
 &lt;union united Shenzhen&gt; we want the families of the victims to receive greater compensation 

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:18.111
 Foxconn also contributes funds to Justice and its economic situation 

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:21.290
 On the same day of this press conference, in April 

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:24.902
 The Social and Humanitarian Service office in Shenzhen City also made a statement for the first time 

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:32.536
 the research he did did not discover any evidence linking managerial practices with suicides 

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:37.207
 this week, the chain of suicides of Foxconn employees 

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.217
 Once again it attacks the minimum threshold of public tolerance. 

00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:43.632
 even when the same Foxconn requested the intervention of society and the state 

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.137
 the population demands clear answers 

00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:53.844
 What is certain is that the Shenzhen United union and the Labor Protection Agency still remain silent 

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.930
 Regarding local governments 

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:59.067
 GDP are the profits, but in reality 

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:06.202
 if the social and population issues were actively and promptly answered 

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:08.608
 and it will truly improve the life of ordinary people 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.523
 record gains would also be obtained, perhaps even higher than GDP 

00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:16.554
 Foxconn went from being an unknown electronic workshop in 1988 

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.575
 to the "king of the OEMs", in the technology and IT market. 

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:25.009
 what made Foxconn are precisely these young workers, looking for a better life in Shenzhen 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.774
 they were captured by the "low cost, high efficiency" development model at its maximum exponent. 

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:34.528
 Guo Taiming, head of a large Chinese company, was taken to the throne of "Genghis Khan of electronics" 

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:38.358
 Turning the company into one of the 500 richest 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.769
 At present, 20% of Shenzen exports are made by Foxconn 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.937
 also becoming an important contributor to the tax collection of the city government, which is in total 88 billion Yuan, or 12 million USD 

00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:53.898
 But the fact of so many young people jumping towards death has become an almost insoluble social problem 

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:58.471
 The Chinese population is under great stress, as they were before 

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:02.011
 the inhabitants of London, after the population of Hong Kong was under stress pressure. 

00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:07.148
 Today, compared to the inhabitants of Beijing or the people of China in general, these people lead a relaxed life. 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.084
 Therefore this is a social problem 

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:16.540
 However, if guilt is charged in the changing times, then nothing will be done. 

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.891
 we can not do anything about macro-trends 

00:02:19.892 --> 00:02:22.690
 but individual actions are micro-decisions 

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:26.442
 We have to face this as people, (more than things or trends) 

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:31.464
 Therefore, since it actually happened, we have to try to stop them, seriously. 

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:33.151
 More than continue saying that this is the world 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.188
 The Shagqui appeals court decided on the compensation of "Shangfa" 

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:49.681
 The compensation to Zhao Zouhai is 650 thousand in concept of "national reparation" 

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:52.700
 What do you want to do after this? 

00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:58.141
 I will return to trade, to be a businessman. 

00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:02.801
 What do you think of the researchers and the people involved in the case? 

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:05.780
 Do you consider them responsible? 

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:08.361
 This is a job that corresponds to the government. 

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:12.911
 The Bureau of Investigation on Henan Shanquiu officially issued a case on the wrongful conviction of Zhao Zouhai 

00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:18.126
 the police have helped 3 officers suspected of illegal interrogation methods, in the time they remained in custody 

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:27.366
 After chain suicides, Foxconn must adjust its management practices and suicide prevention 

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:31.323
 Naturally this will increase the cost per capita in the company 

00:03:31.324 --> 00:03:35.145
 This challenge is not only faced by Foxconn 

00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:39.265
 labor-intensive industries are our most intensive weapon 

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:43.016
 but times are changing, people are changing, and expectations are changing too 50 00: 03: 43,017 -&gt; 00: 03: 46,930 the age of competing with low wages ends slowly 

00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:51.359
 Despite the Foxconn incidents or the incidents of Zhao Zouhai, we remember 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.279
 not only the operational form of the companies but also that of society in general. 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.180
 It should add value to people's health, happiness and dignity. 

00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:00.444
 this time is beginning to arrive. 

00:04:00.445 --> 00:04:05.110
