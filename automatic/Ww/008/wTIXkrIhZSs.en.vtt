strength<00:02:33.780> bonus<00:02:34.260> which<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.160> lot<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.370> people<00:02:35.490> on

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
strength bonus which a lot of people on

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
strength bonus which a lot of people on
her<00:02:35.910> escape<00:02:36.420> thought<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> dragon

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
her escape thought that a dragon

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.949 
her escape thought that a dragon
offender<00:02:38.220> would<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.550> more<00:02:38.790> or<00:02:39.060> would<00:02:39.780> have

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
offender would have more or would have

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.310 
offender would have more or would have
the<00:02:40.170> equal<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:40.980> more<00:02:41.300> strength<00:02:42.300> bonus<00:02:42.690> so

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
the equal or more strength bonus so

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.600 
the equal or more strength bonus so
therefore<00:02:43.500> that's<00:02:43.830> why<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.040> ton<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.370> people

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
therefore that's why I ton of people

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.680 
therefore that's why I ton of people
sold<00:02:44.850> their<00:02:45.000> shit<00:02:45.770> but<00:02:46.770> now<00:02:46.950> DFS's<00:02:47.670> are<00:02:48.000> going

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
sold their shit but now DFS's are going

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.400 
sold their shit but now DFS's are going
back<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.890> therefore<00:02:50.190> yeah<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.320> you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
back up so therefore yeah because if you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.110 
back up so therefore yeah because if you
want<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> bigger<00:02:52.830> strength<00:02:53.160> bonus<00:02:53.550> which<00:02:53.730> isn't
