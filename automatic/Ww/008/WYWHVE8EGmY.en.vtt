00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.230
 some collaborations with others 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.230
 singers 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.900
 ah 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.240
 m 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.300
 of the four mornings 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.059
 with all that teacher and that are with me 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.040
 because there is so early to stack 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.710
 make the first ones good what is your 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.809
 favorite drink is the frappuccino of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.809
 what is your name 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.809
 LOL 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.210
 the unusual stories the corridor 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.210
 the food 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 good 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.520
 because I think we all already knew him 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.590
 from before we do not know the quality and we 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.270
 basically like we present 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.000
 here we came early we took advantage of the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:35.060
 today's breakfast to come here is a 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.270
 experience exactly come and sit 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.490
 the place the product the people are the ones 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.530
 it is known in your name that they know what 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.150
 you are going to take them to worry because 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.619
 you are well and well understood that today you are 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.940
 note that we do not have napkins and 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.590
 he misses him and I think that makes him very 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.360
 many of the coastal businesses are missing 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.780
 rich for that is that one look for 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.880
 international chains and pitifully 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.700
 Ticos to show them everything 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.590
 that we need to arrive with the consumer 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.330
 prefer to pay a little more for a 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.270
 excellent service instead of saving 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.190
 a couple of colones there your name in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.899
 this kind of chains to enjoy the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.740
 moment of the product and the service that 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.460
 it is not given 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.460
 constantly
