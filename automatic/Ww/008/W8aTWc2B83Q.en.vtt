see and in this case this steering wheel

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.130 
see and in this case this steering wheel
it's<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.799> tiny<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> writing<00:01:59.820> is

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
it's really tiny in the writing is

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.740 
it's really tiny in the writing is
really<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.380> miniscule<00:02:02.299> but<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> remains

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
really really miniscule but it remains

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.910 
really really miniscule but it remains
in<00:02:03.899> proportion
