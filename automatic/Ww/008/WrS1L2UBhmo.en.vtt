00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.690 
okay so let me break this one down first
we're<00:00:27.290> gonna<00:00:27.440> get<00:00:27.680> used<00:00:27.980> to<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.310> Bakken

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
we're gonna get used to the Bakken

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.850 
we're gonna get used to the Bakken
motion<00:00:29.060> but<00:00:29.330> in<00:00:29.420> this<00:00:29.570> case<00:00:29.810> it's<00:00:30.410> gonna<00:00:30.590> be<00:00:30.830> a

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
motion but in this case it's gonna be a

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.380 
motion but in this case it's gonna be a
little<00:00:31.160> bit<00:00:31.430> different<00:00:31.670> we're<00:00:32.060> gonna<00:00:32.180> be

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
little bit different we're gonna be

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.270 
little bit different we're gonna be
doing<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.780> slower<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:33.710> we're<00:00:33.920> gonna<00:00:34.040> start

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
doing it slower so we're gonna start

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.970 
doing it slower so we're gonna start
with<00:00:34.430> these<00:00:34.550> fins<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.720> one<00:00:36.410> two<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.700> one<00:00:38.210> two

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
with these fins so one two and one two

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.790 
with these fins so one two and one two
one<00:00:39.980> two<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.910> one<00:00:41.510> two<00:00:41.620> all<00:00:42.620> right

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
one two and one two all right

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.210 
one two and one two all right
so<00:00:43.129> instead<00:00:43.430> of<00:00:43.489> single<00:00:43.879> counts<00:00:44.210> like<00:00:44.330> 1<00:00:44.690> &amp;<00:00:44.989> 2<00:00:45.470> 1

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
so instead of single counts like 1 &amp; 2 1

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.260 
so instead of single counts like 1 &amp; 2 1
&amp;<00:00:46.280> 2<00:00:46.970> we're<00:00:47.540> gonna<00:00:47.720> go<00:00:47.900> up<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.710> pause<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:49.820> up
