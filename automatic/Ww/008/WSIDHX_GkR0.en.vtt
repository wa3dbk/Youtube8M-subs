00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
just basically logs all the way up all

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.250 
just basically logs all the way up all
the<00:00:29.490> way<00:00:29.580> across<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.570> same<00:00:30.750> over<00:00:31.019> there

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260

also<00:00:32.160> inside<00:00:32.460> I've<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.700> added<00:00:32.969> some<00:00:33.120> grass

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
also inside I've just added some grass

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
also inside I've just added some grass
and<00:00:33.600> also<00:00:33.989> these<00:00:34.140> little<00:00:34.200> salt<00:00:34.620> trenches<00:00:35.280> I'm

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and also these little salt trenches I'm

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.910 
and also these little salt trenches I'm
just<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:36.510> can't<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.960> some<00:00:37.110> water<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
just so they can't get some water you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.200 
just so they can't get some water you
just<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.190> give<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.760> look<00:00:38.969> through

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
just to give a little bit look through

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
just to give a little bit look through
these<00:00:39.390> obviously<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.200> don't<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.920> not<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
these obviously you don't it's not a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
these obviously you don't it's not a
necessity<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.940> don't<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.540> anything<00:00:42.840> it's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
necessity they don't do anything it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.049 
necessity they don't do anything it's
just<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.950> make<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.129> look<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.489> little<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.879> nicer

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
just to make it look a little bit nicer

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.889 
just to make it look a little bit nicer
than<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> actually<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:47.629> I<00:00:48.629> think

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
than what it actually is and I think

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.170 
than what it actually is and I think
that<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> did<00:00:50.789> tell<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.030> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
that is it really but I did tell you I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.510 
that is it really but I did tell you I
would<00:00:51.480> basically<00:00:51.949> come<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> design

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
would basically come up with a design

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
would basically come up with a design
for<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.239> storage<00:00:54.510> area<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.870> then

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
for the little storage area and then

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
for the little storage area and then
sort<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.289> tell<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.039> he

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
sort of tell you about it because he

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
sort of tell you about it because he
took<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.329> ages<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.960> figure<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> wanted

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
took me ages to figure out what I wanted

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.950 
took me ages to figure out what I wanted
to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.219> basically<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.210> stairs<00:01:00.480> I've

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to do so basically the stairs I've

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.049 
to do so basically the stairs I've
believed<00:01:01.800> he<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.039> sort<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.489> before<00:01:02.670> I've

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
believed he was sort of here before I've

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.410 
believed he was sort of here before I've
just<00:01:03.539> moved<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.070> up

upstairs in a sec and then I've just put
logs<00:01:10.260> either<00:01:10.560> side<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:12.000> put<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
logs either side and then just put a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.670 
logs either side and then just put a
couple<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.479> fences<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> give<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
couple of fences just to give it a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.999 
couple of fences just to give it a
little<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.250> barrier<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.799> then<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
little bit of a barrier and then if you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.890 
little bit of a barrier and then if you
go<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.220> back<00:01:17.400> wall<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.330> from<00:01:18.780> the

just changed it to a half block there
just<00:01:34.350> above<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.860> can't<00:01:35.130> militar<00:01:35.460> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
just above so you can't militar that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.399 
just above so you can't militar that
much<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.720> actually<00:01:36.840> open<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
much just so you can actually open the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
much just so you can actually open the
top<00:01:37.619> chest<00:01:37.920> otherwise<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> four

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
top chest otherwise if you have a four

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.310 
top chest otherwise if you have a four
block<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.479> you're<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.810> gonna<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.170> on

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
block there you're not gonna be up on

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.800 
block there you're not gonna be up on
the<00:01:40.439> top<00:01:40.770> chest<00:01:41.220> basically<00:01:42.210> mirrored<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the top chest basically mirrored that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.359 
the top chest basically mirrored that
buddy<00:01:43.020> fish<00:01:43.290> built<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.829> I'll<00:01:44.009> except

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
buddy fish built on this I'll except

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.980 
buddy fish built on this I'll except
obviously<00:01:44.579> instead<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> furnaces

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
obviously instead of the furnaces

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.200 
obviously instead of the furnaces
just<00:01:46.649> added<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> blocks<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:47.939> sort<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
just added the blocks and then sort of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550 
just added the blocks and then sort of
swung<00:01:48.420> around<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> corner<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.259> done<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
swung around the corner and done that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
swung around the corner and done that
and<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.130> also<00:01:50.310> put<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.030> item<00:01:51.450> frames<00:01:51.659> on

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and then also put the item frames on

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.210 
and then also put the item frames on
either<00:01:51.960> side<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.740> name<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.950> if

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
either side just so you can name it if

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.420 
either side just so you can name it if
you<00:01:53.670> prefer<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.920> signs<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.100> by<00:01:56.340> all

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you prefer to use the signs that by all

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
you prefer to use the signs that by all
means<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.689> did<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> exact<00:01:58.170> same

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
means do I just did the exact same

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.450 
means do I just did the exact same
pictures<00:01:58.770> over<00:01:59.070> there

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
pictures over there

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
pictures over there
over<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.719> felt<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
over here because it kind of felt a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.539 
over here because it kind of felt a
little<00:02:01.079> bit<00:02:01.259> dead<00:02:01.409> space<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> tried<00:02:02.250> knock<00:02:02.399> out

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
little bit dead space I tried knock out

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209 
little bit dead space I tried knock out
a<00:02:02.579> window<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.930> doesn't<00:02:04.770> work<00:02:04.920> here

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
a window but it doesn't work here

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.029 
a window but it doesn't work here
because<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.780> it's<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.869> too<00:02:07.079> close<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.500> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
because it's it's just too close to that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.020 
because it's it's just too close to that
edge

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
edge

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.760 
edge
but<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.990> downstairs<00:02:10.350> complete

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
but that's the downstairs complete

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.880 
but that's the downstairs complete
basically<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.090> we're<00:02:12.720> gonna<00:02:12.840> I'm<00:02:13.530> gonna<00:02:13.650> show

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
basically and we're gonna I'm gonna show

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.230 
basically and we're gonna I'm gonna show
you<00:02:13.950> upstairs<00:02:14.130> now<00:02:14.490> one<00:02:14.760> thing<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.030> actually

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
you upstairs now one thing I actually

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.540 
you upstairs now one thing I actually
didn't<00:02:15.750> do<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.440> one<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.190> these<00:02:17.280> little

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
didn't do is do one of these little

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.480 
didn't do is do one of these little
trench<00:02:17.790> things<00:02:18.090> inside<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.810> sheep<00:02:19.020> farm

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
trench things inside the sheep farm

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.100 
trench things inside the sheep farm
because<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.700> kind<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.330> didn't<00:02:21.569> know<00:02:21.660> whether<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because I kind of didn't know whether it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.620 
because I kind of didn't know whether it
worked<00:02:22.380> or<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.920> pull<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:24.270> you

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
worked or not to pull it there but you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.120 
worked or not to pull it there but you
guys<00:02:25.170> let<00:02:25.410> me<00:02:25.440> know<00:02:25.530> what<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.739> think<00:02:25.860> if<00:02:26.010> I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
guys let me know what you think if I

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.000 
guys let me know what you think if I
should<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.310> add<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.819> there<00:02:27.000> after<00:02:28.010> but

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
should just add it in there after but

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.550 
should just add it in there after but
here<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.640> our<00:02:29.760> chicken<00:02:29.970> farm<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.600> haven't

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
here we have our chicken farm I haven't

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.260 
here we have our chicken farm I haven't
studied<00:02:31.650> animals<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.280> yet<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:32.760> I've<00:02:32.819> left<00:02:32.970> one

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
studied animals in yet but I've left one

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030 
studied animals in yet but I've left one
because<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.720> Italian<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.260> will<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.800> all<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
because it is Italian I will do all the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.530 
because it is Italian I will do all the
rest<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.520> show<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.790> exactly<00:02:36.239> how<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
rest and then show you exactly how to

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.729 
rest and then show you exactly how to
build<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:37.950> very<00:02:38.190> very<00:02:39.000> simple<00:02:39.360> as

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
build one so it's very very simple as

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.130 
build one so it's very very simple as
very<00:02:40.739> very<00:02:40.890> similar<00:02:41.220> as<00:02:41.430> well<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:42.080> probably<00:02:43.080> a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
very very similar as well to probably a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.479 
very very similar as well to probably a
few<00:02:43.320> chicken<00:02:43.620> farms<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.070> you've<00:02:44.220> seen

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
few chicken farms that you've seen

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.420 
few chicken farms that you've seen
plenty<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.570> storage<00:02:45.959> space<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.920> haven't

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
plenty of storage space here I haven't

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.720 
plenty of storage space here I haven't
put<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:49.200> item<00:02:50.070> frames<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.400> other<00:02:50.489> side

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
put the the item frames and other side

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.490 
put the the item frames and other side
because<00:02:51.000> there's<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.480> gonna<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:51.989> eggs<00:02:52.290> and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
because there's just gonna be eggs and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.290 
because there's just gonna be eggs and
he's<00:02:52.709> considering<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:53.550> sort<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.970> chicken

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
he's considering it's sort of a chicken

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300 
he's considering it's sort of a chicken
farm<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.590> instead<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:55.950> doing

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
farm and on this one instead of doing

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.059 
farm and on this one instead of doing
the<00:02:56.459> M<00:02:56.930> half<00:02:57.930> block<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.290> put<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> stair<00:02:58.830> cause<00:02:59.040> I

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
the M half block I put a stair cause I

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.350 
the M half block I put a stair cause I
thought<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.370> looked<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.610> little<00:02:59.730> bit<00:02:59.910> different

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
thought it looked a little bit different

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.930 
thought it looked a little bit different
kind<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.260> broke<00:03:01.620> broke<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:02.760> did

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
kind of broke broke up and then just did

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.210 
kind of broke broke up and then just did
these<00:03:03.090> lights<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:04.260> obviously<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.739> your<00:03:04.980> mobs

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
these lights just obviously so your mobs

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.660 
these lights just obviously so your mobs
don't<00:03:05.459> spawn<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:07.200> let's<00:03:07.830> get<00:03:07.950> into<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.370> how<00:03:08.610> to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
don't spawn but let's get into it how to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.729 
don't spawn but let's get into it how to
build<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.209> these<00:03:09.360> basically<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.590> what

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
build one of these basically so what

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.090 
build one of these basically so what
you're<00:03:10.860> gonna<00:03:10.980> need<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.459> three<00:03:12.239> by<00:03:12.690> two<00:03:13.100> sort

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
you're gonna need is a three by two sort

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.660 
you're gonna need is a three by two sort
of<00:03:14.190> space<00:03:14.900> m<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.320> then<00:03:16.829> obviously<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
of space m and then obviously I have a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.850 
of space m and then obviously I have a
size<00:03:17.880> I've<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:18.510> sort<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.230> decorated<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.829> with

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
size I've just sort of decorated it with

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.060 
size I've just sort of decorated it with
my<00:03:20.280> spruce<00:03:20.790> wood<00:03:21.090> logs<00:03:21.570> well<00:03:22.470> let's<00:03:22.650> go<00:03:22.799> ahead

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
my spruce wood logs well let's go ahead

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.960 
my spruce wood logs well let's go ahead
and<00:03:23.310> get<00:03:23.519> some<00:03:23.730> not<00:03:24.769> not<00:03:25.769> Dimond<00:03:26.280> get<00:03:26.790> some

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
and get some not not Dimond get some

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.170 
and get some not not Dimond get some
glowstone<00:03:27.360> put<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.690> there<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.140> put<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.500> there

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
glowstone put it there and put it there

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.170 
glowstone put it there and put it there
get<00:03:30.180> some<00:03:30.360> red<00:03:30.540> wall<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.890> then<00:03:32.000> put<00:03:33.000> two

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
get some red wall and then put two

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.530 
get some red wall and then put two
blocks<00:03:33.480> on<00:03:33.660> either<00:03:33.720> side<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.540> then

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
blocks on either side there and then

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240 
blocks on either side there and then
before<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:36.930> do<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.170> middle<00:03:37.320> one<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:37.890> kind<00:03:38.160> of

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
before we do the middle one we kind of

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.560 
before we do the middle one we kind of
need<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.459> do<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.790> front<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.150> little<00:03:39.269> bit<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
need to do this front a little bit a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.050 
need to do this front a little bit a
little<00:03:39.720> bit<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.170> get<00:03:40.829> yourself<00:03:41.250> some<00:03:41.760> pressure

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
little bit so get yourself some pressure

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.990 
little bit so get yourself some pressure
plates<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.660> some<00:03:42.959> wooden<00:03:43.590> stairs<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
plates and some wooden stairs but the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.990 
plates and some wooden stairs but the
wooden<00:03:45.269> stairs<00:03:45.570> where<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:47.190> sort<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.489> okay<00:03:47.940> is

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
wooden stairs where the sort of okay is

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.180 
wooden stairs where the sort of okay is
and<00:03:48.299> then<00:03:48.720> put<00:03:48.900> your<00:03:49.200> pressure<00:03:49.470> plate<00:03:49.769> either

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
and then put your pressure plate either

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.840 
and then put your pressure plate either
side<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:52.320> also<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:53.519> need<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.730> get

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
side and then also you need to get

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.940 
side and then also you need to get
yourself<00:03:54.180> some<00:03:54.269> water<00:03:54.650> because<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:55.799> is

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
yourself some water because this is

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.110 
yourself some water because this is
obviously<00:03:56.220> where<00:03:56.340> chickens<00:03:56.730> are<00:03:56.820> we<00:03:56.880> float

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
obviously where chickens are we float

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.690 
obviously where chickens are we float
until<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.510> put<00:03:57.690> one<00:03:57.930> water<00:03:58.230> source<00:03:58.650> there<00:03:58.890> one

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
until you put one water source there one

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.940 
until you put one water source there one
water<00:03:59.940> source<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:01.260> pretty<00:04:01.620> much<00:04:01.709> does

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
water source there that pretty much does

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.500 
water source there that pretty much does
turn<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.400> into<00:04:02.579> an<00:04:02.730> infinite<00:04:03.209> water<00:04:03.359> source

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
turn this into an infinite water source

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.310 
turn this into an infinite water source
I<00:04:04.019> believe<00:04:04.650> um<00:04:05.510> but<00:04:06.510> I'll<00:04:06.660> see<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.019> know<00:04:07.140> your

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
I believe um but I'll see you know your

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.690 
I believe um but I'll see you know your
chickens<00:04:07.620> will<00:04:07.709> stay<00:04:07.890> on<00:04:08.010> top<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.220> there<00:04:08.489> and

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
chickens will stay on top of there and

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.610 
chickens will stay on top of there and
then<00:04:08.850> get<00:04:09.030> your<00:04:09.120> red<00:04:09.269> wall<00:04:09.510> close<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.290> and

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
then get your red wall close that and

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.900 
then get your red wall close that and
then<00:04:10.890> basically<00:04:11.220> your<00:04:11.430> eggs<00:04:11.579> are<00:04:11.670> going<00:04:11.850> to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
then basically your eggs are going to

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.319 
then basically your eggs are going to
pop<00:04:12.090> out<00:04:12.239> here<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.890> then<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.060> where<00:04:15.209> you

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
pop out here and then this is where you

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.750 
pop out here and then this is where you
just<00:04:15.480> put<00:04:15.630> your<00:04:15.720> glass<00:04:16.099> but<00:04:17.099> before<00:04:17.459> that<00:04:17.609> only

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
just put your glass but before that only

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.029

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
know if you are building this on

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.410 
know if you are building this on
survival<00:04:45.740> it's<00:04:46.100> gonna<00:04:46.280> be<00:04:46.430> extremely

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
survival it's gonna be extremely

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.210 
survival it's gonna be extremely
extremely<00:04:47.900> hard<00:04:48.170> for<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.590> do<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:49.010> I'm

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
extremely hard for you to do this I'm

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.300 
extremely hard for you to do this I'm
not<00:04:49.250> sure<00:04:49.430> if<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.900> even<00:04:50.960> get<00:04:51.320> just<00:04:52.130> born

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
not sure if you can even get just born

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.900 
not sure if you can even get just born
eggs<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.730> survival<00:04:53.150> I<00:04:53.210> don't<00:04:53.390> believe<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.720> can

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
eggs in survival I don't believe you can

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.430 
eggs in survival I don't believe you can
but<00:04:55.910> yeah<00:04:56.060> let's<00:04:56.720> just<00:04:56.870> go<00:04:56.990> up<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.170> this<00:04:57.290> little

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
but yeah let's just go up to this little

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.140 
but yeah let's just go up to this little
bitty<00:04:57.680> obviously<00:04:58.250> wood<00:04:58.400> with<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:58.880> stairs

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
bitty obviously wood with the stairs

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.940 
bitty obviously wood with the stairs
coming<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.600> here<00:04:59.840> I<00:05:00.020> thought<00:05:00.470> well<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.650> can't

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
coming to here I thought well I can't

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.110 
coming to here I thought well I can't
carry<00:05:01.160> this<00:05:01.190> all<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.460> way<00:05:01.520> long<00:05:01.730> so<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:01.970> just

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
carry this all the way long so I just

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.170 
carry this all the way long so I just
decided<00:05:02.420> to<00:05:02.540> build<00:05:02.780> this<00:05:02.900> little<00:05:03.170> opening

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
decided to build this little opening

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.870 
decided to build this little opening
little<00:05:05.180> seat<00:05:05.410> so<00:05:06.410> it's<00:05:06.800> very<00:05:07.340> simple<00:05:07.760> it's

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
little seat so it's very simple it's

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.120 
little seat so it's very simple it's
just<00:05:08.000> one<00:05:08.210> away<00:05:08.420> from<00:05:08.600> either<00:05:08.750> side<00:05:08.870> do<00:05:09.860> your

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
just one away from either side do your

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.630 
just one away from either side do your
little<00:05:10.660> spruce<00:05:11.660> oak<00:05:12.140> wood<00:05:12.530> thing<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.430> then

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
little spruce oak wood thing and then

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.460 
little spruce oak wood thing and then
this<00:05:14.180> wasn't<00:05:14.450> here<00:05:14.690> before<00:05:14.780> obviously

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
this wasn't here before obviously

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.040 
this wasn't here before obviously
because<00:05:16.160> this<00:05:16.250> was<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.490> full<00:05:16.790> block<00:05:17.060> of<00:05:17.300> wood<00:05:17.720> so

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
because this was a full block of wood so

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.140 
because this was a full block of wood so
I've<00:05:18.140> just<00:05:18.200> got<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.470> half<00:05:18.800> block<00:05:19.040> just<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.340> sort

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
I've just got a half block just to sort

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.350 
I've just got a half block just to sort
of<00:05:20.270> feed<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:21.020> in<00:05:21.110> a<00:05:21.140> little<00:05:21.470> bit<00:05:22.030> gone<00:05:23.030> out<00:05:23.180> gone

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
of feed it in a little bit gone out gone

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.880 
of feed it in a little bit gone out gone
all<00:05:23.480> the<00:05:23.600> way<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.960> edge<00:05:24.050> apart<00:05:24.590> from<00:05:24.710> this

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
all the way to the edge apart from this

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.640 
all the way to the edge apart from this
one<00:05:25.190> put<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.000> fence<00:05:26.270> across<00:05:26.480> did<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:27.170> little<00:05:27.380> seat

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
one put a fence across did a little seat

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.150 
one put a fence across did a little seat
and<00:05:28.450> then<00:05:29.450> on<00:05:29.750> this<00:05:30.140> bit<00:05:30.350> here<00:05:30.500> obviously<00:05:30.800> just

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
and then on this bit here obviously just

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.600 
and then on this bit here obviously just
added<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.580> red<00:05:31.880> wool<00:05:32.180> for<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.420> wall<00:05:33.610> just

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
added the red wool for the wall just

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.640 
added the red wool for the wall just
like<00:05:34.730> that<00:05:35.150> and<00:05:35.900> then<00:05:36.050> I<00:05:36.080> kind<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.440> came<00:05:36.620> up

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
like that and then I kind of came up

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.000 
like that and then I kind of came up
with<00:05:36.980> this<00:05:37.190> little<00:05:37.550> whim<00:05:38.410> sort<00:05:39.410> of<00:05:39.500> pokey<00:05:39.920> out

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
with this little whim sort of pokey out

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.500 
with this little whim sort of pokey out
roof<00:05:40.750> basically<00:05:41.750> what<00:05:42.230> I<00:05:42.260> did<00:05:42.380> always<00:05:43.010> say

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
roof basically what I did always say

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.550 
roof basically what I did always say
where<00:05:44.510> it<00:05:44.600> was<00:05:44.690> meant<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:44.870> be<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.020> half<00:05:45.200> pop<00:05:45.410> just

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
where it was meant to be a half pop just

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.870 
where it was meant to be a half pop just
a<00:05:45.650> full<00:05:45.890> block<00:05:46.070> therefore<00:05:46.460> what<00:05:46.610> better<00:05:46.820> than

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
a full block therefore what better than

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.030 
a full block therefore what better than
a<00:05:47.000> half<00:05:47.210> blocks<00:05:47.510> and<00:05:48.260> three<00:05:48.560> half<00:05:48.740> blocks

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
a half blocks and three half blocks

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.150 
a half blocks and three half blocks
three<00:05:49.370> half<00:05:49.550> blocks<00:05:49.820> than<00:05:50.090> one<00:05:50.240> then<00:05:50.690> one<00:05:51.160> and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
three half blocks than one then one and

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.310 
three half blocks than one then one and
then<00:05:52.400> sort<00:05:52.700> of<00:05:52.730> just<00:05:52.970> went<00:05:53.600> in<00:05:53.810> on<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.080> sides

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
then sort of just went in on the sides

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.530 
then sort of just went in on the sides
it<00:05:55.010> kind<00:05:55.340> of<00:05:55.400> looks<00:05:55.580> a<00:05:55.700> little<00:05:55.790> bit<00:05:56.000> weird<00:05:56.030> I

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
it kind of looks a little bit weird I

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.780 
it kind of looks a little bit weird I
kind<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:56.960> like<00:05:57.170> it<00:05:57.200> from<00:05:57.530> like<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:58.280> angle

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
kind of like it from like this angle

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.190 
kind of like it from like this angle
because<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.390> kind<00:05:59.570> of<00:05:59.600> feels<00:05:59.810> like<00:05:59.900> there's<00:06:00.170> a

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
because it kind of feels like there's a

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.290 
because it kind of feels like there's a
little<00:06:00.290> pokey<00:06:00.740> out<00:06:00.860> bit<00:06:01.160> but<00:06:01.850> I'm<00:06:01.970> not<00:06:02.090> too

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
little pokey out bit but I'm not too

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.490 
little pokey out bit but I'm not too
sure<00:06:02.480> when<00:06:02.660> I<00:06:02.720> look<00:06:02.870> at<00:06:03.020> it<00:06:03.140> from<00:06:03.230> this<00:06:03.350> angle

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
sure when I look at it from this angle

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.990 
sure when I look at it from this angle
let<00:06:03.710> me<00:06:03.920> guys<00:06:04.130> know<00:06:04.280> what<00:06:04.370> you<00:06:04.430> think<00:06:04.670> of<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:04.910> if

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000

you want me to delete it and just leave
that<00:06:07.370> bit<00:06:07.610> is<00:06:07.730> just<00:06:07.910> a<00:06:07.970> blank<00:06:08.240> wall<00:06:08.570> where<00:06:09.260> we

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
that bit is just a blank wall where we

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.080 
that bit is just a blank wall where we
should<00:06:09.530> keep<00:06:09.650> it<00:06:09.860> then<00:06:10.460> also<00:06:10.640> what<00:06:10.880> I<00:06:10.910> did<00:06:11.060> I

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
should keep it then also what I did I

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.240 
should keep it then also what I did I
just<00:06:11.180> added<00:06:11.540> these<00:06:11.630> bushes<00:06:12.170> just<00:06:12.860> around<00:06:13.100> the

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
just added these bushes just around the

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.510 
just added these bushes just around the
edge<00:06:13.340> just<00:06:13.370> to<00:06:13.700> give<00:06:13.880> it<00:06:13.910> a<00:06:14.030> little<00:06:14.300> bit<00:06:14.720> of

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
edge just to give it a little bit of

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.400 
edge just to give it a little bit of
that's<00:06:16.520> it<00:06:16.670> sort<00:06:16.940> of<00:06:16.970> overgrown<00:06:17.690> feel<00:06:18.050> like

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
that's it sort of overgrown feel like

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.460 
that's it sort of overgrown feel like
proper<00:06:19.570> just<00:06:20.570> a<00:06:20.600> little<00:06:20.810> running<00:06:21.290> bit

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
proper just a little running bit

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.380 
proper just a little running bit
everywhere<00:06:22.040> I<00:06:22.070> mean<00:06:22.160> I<00:06:22.430> really<00:06:22.970> like<00:06:23.090> them<00:06:23.330> I

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
everywhere I mean I really like them I

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.820 
everywhere I mean I really like them I
think<00:06:23.450> it<00:06:23.690> adds<00:06:23.810> quite<00:06:24.080> a<00:06:24.260> lot<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.560> the<00:06:24.650> build

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
think it adds quite a lot to the build

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.690 
think it adds quite a lot to the build
just<00:06:25.370> adding<00:06:25.580> a<00:06:25.670> little<00:06:25.700> random<00:06:26.300> bushes<00:06:26.750> just

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
just adding a little random bushes just

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.860 
just adding a little random bushes just
like<00:06:28.700> this

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
like this

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.890 
like this
and<00:06:30.139> did<00:06:30.740> one<00:06:31.190> that<00:06:31.550> side<00:06:31.910> and<00:06:32.419> then<00:06:32.750> you

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
and did one that side and then you

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.570 
and did one that side and then you
probably<00:06:33.050> saw<00:06:33.230> the<00:06:33.440> ones<00:06:33.949> on<00:06:34.100> the<00:06:34.190> front<00:06:34.310> night

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
probably saw the ones on the front night
