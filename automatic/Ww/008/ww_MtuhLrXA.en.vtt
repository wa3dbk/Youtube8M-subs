00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.969 
early on in the fight maybe in the third
or<00:02:09.000> fourth<00:02:09.239> round<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.660> after<00:02:10.200> those<00:02:10.349> rounds<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
or fourth round and after those rounds I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.830 
or fourth round and after those rounds I
think<00:02:11.610> Floyd<00:02:11.819> will<00:02:12.000> take<00:02:12.150> over<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.660> why

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
think Floyd will take over that's why

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.610 
think Floyd will take over that's why
after

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
after

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
after
that's<00:02:13.860> why<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.099> like<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.489> said<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:14.790> last

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's why like like I said in my last

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.789 
that's why like like I said in my last
video<00:02:15.659> about<00:02:16.099> this<00:02:17.099> fight<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:18.440> said<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.590> Floyd

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
video about this fight I said that Floyd

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.160 
video about this fight I said that Floyd
will<00:02:20.040> beat<00:02:20.190> Canelo<00:02:21.030> easy<00:02:21.330> after<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.049> early

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
will beat Canelo easy after the early

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.080 
will beat Canelo easy after the early
rounds<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:23.760> see<00:02:24.260> Canelo<00:02:26.090> being

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
rounds I just don't see Canelo being

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.360 
rounds I just don't see Canelo being
consistent<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.900> fight<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:29.010> could<00:02:29.190> see

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
consistent this fight and I could see

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
consistent this fight and I could see
him<00:02:29.489> having<00:02:29.879> his<00:02:30.030> moments<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.659> could<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:31.049> him

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
him having his moments I could see him

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.899 
him having his moments I could see him
winning<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:31.950> fight<00:02:32.159> in<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.459> early<00:02:32.879> rounds

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
winning this fight in the early rounds

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.110 
winning this fight in the early rounds
but<00:02:33.329> he<00:02:33.390> has<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.310> get<00:02:35.310> at<00:02:35.489> Mayweather

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
but he has to really get at Mayweather

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.470 
but he has to really get at Mayweather
early<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.019> because<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.739> don't<00:02:38.730> think<00:02:38.940> he<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.239> I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
early on because I don't think he can I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.699 
early on because I don't think he can I
don't<00:02:39.959> think<00:02:40.110> he<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:42.930> prepared<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.440> have

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
don't think he can be prepared to have

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.059 
don't think he can be prepared to have
the<00:02:43.860> stamina<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:45.290> fight<00:02:46.290> club<00:02:46.560> grounds<00:02:46.769> for

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
the stamina to fight club grounds for

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.640 
the stamina to fight club grounds for
this<00:02:47.190> fight<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.720> Austin<00:02:49.019> trout<00:02:49.200> fight<00:02:49.470> he

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
this fight and the Austin trout fight he

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.160 
this fight and the Austin trout fight he
took<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.980> fight<00:02:50.190> very<00:02:50.459> seriously<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.170> he

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
took the fight very seriously and he

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.750 
took the fight very seriously and he
still<00:02:52.440> didn't<00:02:52.739> have<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:52.980> stamina<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.519> go<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
still didn't have the stamina to go to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.539 
still didn't have the stamina to go to
our<00:02:53.970> brands<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.420> fight<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.190> don't<00:02:56.459> know

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
our brands in that fight so I don't know

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.460 
our brands in that fight so I don't know
it's<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.269> stamina<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.049> thing<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
it's just the stamina that's the thing I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.270 
it's just the stamina that's the thing I
mean<00:02:58.950> flu<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.430> mean<00:02:59.730> Canelo<00:03:00.060> has<00:03:00.359> power<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
mean flu I mean Canelo has power and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.030 
mean flu I mean Canelo has power and
speed<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:03.239> his<00:03:03.540> stamina<00:03:03.810> isn't<00:03:04.470> there<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
speed but his stamina isn't there a

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.559 
speed but his stamina isn't there a
Floyd<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.819> think<00:03:06.629> we'll<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:08.150> make<00:03:09.150> him<00:03:09.329> tire

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
Floyd I think we'll just make him tire

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.899 
Floyd I think we'll just make him tire
out<00:03:09.780> early<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> fight<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.980> he'll<00:03:11.670> take

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
out early on in the fight and he'll take

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.699 
out early on in the fight and he'll take
over<00:03:12.680> that's<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.980> way<00:03:14.159> i<00:03:14.190> see<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.780> i<00:03:15.780> mean

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
over that's just the way i see it i mean

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.220 
over that's just the way i see it i mean
i<00:03:16.890> want<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:17.310> wanted<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.910> fight<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.269> happen<00:03:18.569> at

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
this time even though I think Canelo

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.370 
this time even though I think Canelo
needed<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:22.769> more<00:03:22.799> year<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.750> experienced<00:03:24.750> to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
needed one more year of experienced to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.190 
needed one more year of experienced to
actually<00:03:25.769> be<00:03:25.980> prepared<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.579> fight<00:03:27.200> but
