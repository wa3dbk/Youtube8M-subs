00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.029
 what do you want 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:14.040

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.870
 this gesture dance him dance dance dance dance 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 dance the sea the most the guys that such 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.810
 we are here already in quarterfinals of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.150
 Fate to the truth that I'm pretty 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.590
 quite nervous since I want to spend 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 from the group I say I want to play with these 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.849
 guiris there are better known as combats 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 they are with jet set and with all these people 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.660
 very positive so nervous because 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.679
 I want to pass and well a few 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 problems that we have had with this 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.440
 effect this that in this case is the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.000
 back or the way out is that he really 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280
 invited then this should be the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 return is worth the match but 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.300
 it really is the local party so 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.370
 say it well now I explain it is worth the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.890
 that takes as you know in each group of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.210
 fate there is a leader worth in this case of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.949
 our group is called sofÃ­a is worth it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.000
 I took the rules and all that as 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.890
 you know there have always been rules 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.420
 different with other groups and me 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.579
 he said that you had to play only one match 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 so then I played against my rival 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.719
 that's called x that's worth it and it's this 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.519
 party that you are going to see later so 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.840
 which will be seen in two games as the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.210
 other groups and we had 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.770
 from then on in this case this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 it's going to be the first game that I play 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.460
 as a visitor that is a bit strange and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.189
 the next match 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.319
 as a local although it goes up in the channel in 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.850
 your channel is worth x that's worth it so you go 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.189
 to have there the thanks that a book of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.439
 everything but but well this is what happened 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.759
 with faye as you know I'm in the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.619
 group of remnants of the world the great 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.509
 Most are Arab is quite difficult 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.159
 communicate with them because we are not 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.840
 speak in English and such but none of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.939
 the two English very good others deal 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.140
 difficult to communicate but good is worth it here 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.520
 is the important thing that we have 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.959
 matches here you are going to find the first 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 party on the x-men channel is going to 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.979
 find the second you are not going to see anymore 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.689
 finally who is classified and I tell you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.399
 that I'm quite nervous since I 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.599
 I want to classify because I want to go from 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.209
 group and you can meet me 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:53.159
 Spanish partners and good and strength 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.170
 also for both bond and for 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.030
 give and fifa so that they can pass and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.129
 although they have had to pass to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 face together but good and good 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:02.250
 here you see the first goal of the match 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 minute 2 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.940
 I combine very well in the center 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.860
 of the field and I get after here 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.240
 advance mine of minute 2 the truth is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.310
 that I have to say that this game the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.960
 first yes I noticed a little more the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.700
 connection not bad at all because as 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.230
 you see in the game there is no shot 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.000
 more important or nothing but yes that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.290
 we slow the players by the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.450
 connection theme or as a little 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.890
 loaded and that for me game style I 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.920
 it's a bit bad because you know I like it 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.440
 a lot of touching the dribble ball and all that 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.690
 and I noticed quite a bit here here minute 17 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.580
 what kind of water the stick and the bounce 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.350
 it does not lead him to get caught with 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.640
 glasses the truth is that good I had good 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.709
 Sometimes the truth is that and you will see 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.060
 another move is with ja ja is the pongo 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.190
 a short one this is a play that comes 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.320
 very well surely tobal will go up a 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.209
 tutorial of this look how the ball goes 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 very close to the stick with yesterday is a 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.150
 play that serves a lot and that you 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.310
 I recommend that the gaiba as another 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.080
 already play of minute 30 comes to him there 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.459
 fixed the defense charge as the raisin 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.300
 very bad for back and good stop and for 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.410
 courtois 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.320
 the truth is that courtois always 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.910
 is solving many problems and what 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.260
 It is very good and good, here it ends 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.190
 the first part as you see a match 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.660
 with few with few arrivals because 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.670
 I tell you that the connection is not fusion 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.830
 very good but but good here 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.050
 61 minute arrived with there is contest and is 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.110
 good for gdf line assistance and 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.739
 golito de omen or leave us safe let's go 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.630
 to see it now from harvard lets them give 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.690
 assistance of fellaini the tail is removed 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.760
 in both the two goals and two 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.500
 assists so there's a 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 fellaini as I told you for me 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.620
 fellaini was very important and if not 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.090
 bring the games because I play a lot 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.010
 I know him for a couple of 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.330
 years already playing in fifa and I know what 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.530
 I have to do with him every moment not 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.360
 here you see another very good pass 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.310
 fellaini I'm going to go with tiger and look 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.110
 here another stop for your goalie in this 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.120
 case he also had courtois and he 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.920
 note and the truth is that cultural takes out 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.370
 the tail a lot and good so here you see the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.440
 end of the minute 90 match and we finished 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.150
 20 winning in this case 0-2 because it was 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.530
 your party but I already tell you that good 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.330
 there were many problems with the subject of 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.739
 all parties and all that I know 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.860
 the game has been very bland but it is that 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.569
 has given for more between the topic that the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.209
 connection was not going very far there was no 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.100
 many options and all that and well then 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.420
 this is the match I can not win 0 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.519
 the truth is that it was a relief because 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.989
 we were very nervous in that game already 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.470
 which is very important because this is not 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.049
 as a league not going 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.970
 the points and such this is the one that loses 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.950
 it goes then it was very important to win 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.480
 this game and well then to see the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.890
 next game to see if I get 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.260
 they went to hotel ejido and the canal of 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.970

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.840
 problems that we have had so much in this 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.420
 video with him in this fate group 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.280
 aware with bully how to count and also 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.570
 to have those problems because the leader 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.970
 of our group is a bit stunned 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.430
 things as they are they do not find out or 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.430
 half and we have always followed 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.200
 countercurrent or you can say it 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.550
 as much as boom and as to give and that 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.130
 we have always had problems because 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.560
 it always goes wrong 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.910
 the leader always says rules that do not 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.710
 they have another group whenever they go to 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.510
 reverse of the whole world we have had 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.160
 many problems to record from the 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.470

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.820
