dog you got to think focus on the good
things<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.920> don't<00:03:36.070> focus<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.700> like<00:03:37.590> how<00:03:38.590> much

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
things you don't focus on like how much

things you don't focus on like how much
it<00:03:39.370> hurts<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.910> how<00:03:40.030> long<00:03:40.300> it's<00:03:40.510> going<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.720> take

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
it hurts and how long it's going to take

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:50.720 
it hurts and how long it's going to take
