positivity<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.160> when<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.030> stand<00:00:12.240> here<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
positivity but when we stand here the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.189 
positivity but when we stand here the
last<00:00:13.679> day<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.070> season<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.780> comes<00:00:15.780> second

last day of the season and comes second
that<00:00:16.320> that's<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.100> frustrating<00:00:17.720> you<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.840> it

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
that that's so frustrating you know it

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.090 
that that's so frustrating you know it
was<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.760> knew<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> will<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.859> tough

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
was we knew that that it will be tough

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.870 
was we knew that that it will be tough
to<00:00:23.160> order<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.090> stay<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> top<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.730> I<00:00:26.730> think

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to order to stay at the top and I think

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.700 
to order to stay at the top and I think
we<00:00:27.449> would<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.630> taken<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> second<00:00:28.830> place<00:00:30.710> how

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
we would have taken the second place how

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.340 
we would have taken the second place how
much<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.160> experience<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.880> season
