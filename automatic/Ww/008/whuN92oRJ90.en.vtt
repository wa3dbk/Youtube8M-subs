from distraction are distracting you but

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
from distraction are distracting you but
consistency<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.809> with

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
consistency that you go in at with

whatever momentum you carry through your

whatever momentum you carry through your
kills<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.540> sort<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.140> class<00:00:40.410> setup<00:00:40.829> gives

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
kills and this sort of class setup gives

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
kills and this sort of class setup gives
you<00:00:41.340> momentum<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> build<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.629> your

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you momentum as you build up your

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
you momentum as you build up your
killstreak<00:00:43.290> orgone<00:00:43.590> shriek<00:00:43.950> that's<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
killstreak orgone shriek that's the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.130 
killstreak orgone shriek that's the
whole<00:00:44.789> point<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> philosophy<00:00:45.719> behind<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
whole point the philosophy behind this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.869 
whole point the philosophy behind this
is<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.559> reduce<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:47.039> many<00:00:47.250> animations<00:00:47.610> as

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
is to reduce as many animations as

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.220 
is to reduce as many animations as
possible<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> come<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> screen

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
possible that come up in the screen

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
possible that come up in the screen
hence<00:00:49.710> why<00:00:49.920> there's<00:00:50.129> only<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.579> score<00:00:50.879> streak

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
hence why there's only one score streak

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
hence why there's only one score streak
which<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> UAV<00:00:51.930> which<00:00:52.079> pops<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.590> which<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> one

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
which is UAV which pops up which is one

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.979 
which is UAV which pops up which is one
of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> animations<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.329> animation<00:00:54.870> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of the animations the other animation is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.450 
of the animations the other animation is
to<00:00:55.079> reload<00:00:55.440> animation<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.219> can't

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to reload animation which you can't

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
to reload animation which you can't
really<00:00:56.579> stop<00:00:57.480> her<00:00:57.719> from<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> gun<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.620> anyway

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
really stop her from the gun so anyway

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.069 
really stop her from the gun so anyway
breaking<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> down<00:00:59.910> real<00:01:00.270> quick<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> initial

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
breaking it down real quick the initial

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380 
breaking it down real quick the initial
gun<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.440> k5<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.280> SMG<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.149> I've<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gun is the k5 first SMG but I've got a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.140 
gun is the k5 first SMG but I've got a
very<00:01:03.660> informative<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.519> Supply<00:01:06.090> Drop

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
very informative from the Supply Drop

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
very informative from the Supply Drop
that<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> managed<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> get<00:01:07.320> luckily<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.070> given

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that I managed to get luckily it given

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
that I managed to get luckily it given
me<00:01:08.729> extra<00:01:09.180> point<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.510> damage<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.020> accuracy

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
me extra point for damage and accuracy

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
me extra point for damage and accuracy
but<00:01:10.650> having<00:01:10.860> sacrificed<00:01:11.070> point<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.970> range

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
but having sacrificed point for a range

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
but having sacrificed point for a range
which<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.450> okay<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:12.960> we've<00:01:13.380> got<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
which is okay because we've got the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.740 
which is okay because we've got the
attachment<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.729> advanced<00:01:15.060> rifling<00:01:15.420> full

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
attachment for advanced rifling full

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.580 
attachment for advanced rifling full
grip<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.140> quick<00:01:17.070> draw<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.420> good

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
grip and quick draw so that's all good

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
grip and quick draw so that's all good
so<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> class<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
so this is the class this is one of the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
so this is the class this is one of the
best<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.890> opinion<00:01:23.330> constant<00:01:24.330> rushing

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
best in my opinion constant rushing

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
best in my opinion constant rushing
constant<00:01:25.170> pushing<00:01:25.590> non-stop<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.729> have

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
constant pushing non-stop as we have

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
constant pushing non-stop as we have
marathon<00:01:27.240> default<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:27.840> helps<00:01:28.229> us<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.650> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
marathon default which helps us for that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.940 
marathon default which helps us for that
so<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.530> gameplay

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so you see here a little bit gameplay

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
so you see here a little bit gameplay
footage<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.400> sharing<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> example<00:01:33.210> backing

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
footage of sharing the example backing

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.609 
footage of sharing the example backing
up<00:01:33.689> why<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.439> feel<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.640> best<00:01:35.790> SMG

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
up why I feel like this is the best SMG
