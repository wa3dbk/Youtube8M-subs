00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
due to your flaw on a side note i'm not

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.580 
due to your flaw on a side note i'm not
sure<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:20.820> miss<00:01:21.090> harsh<00:01:21.450> winnie<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.110> doing

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
sure what miss harsh winnie is doing
there<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.189> i'm<00:01:23.400> guessing<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.270> either

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
there but i'm guessing it has to either

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.109 
there but i'm guessing it has to either
do<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> play<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.189> Equestria<00:01:26.820> games

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
do with a play all the Equestria games

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
do with a play all the Equestria games
but<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.409> gonna<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> wait<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
but we are just gonna have to wait and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.370 
but we are just gonna have to wait and
see<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.750> episode<00:01:31.170> could

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
see I like the way this episode could

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.319 
see I like the way this episode could
play<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.650> around<00:01:32.159> Scootaloo<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.850> would

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
play out around Scootaloo and would

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.899 
play out around Scootaloo and would
definitely<00:01:33.960> offer<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.650> lot<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.189> depth<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
definitely offer a lot of depth for this

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
definitely offer a lot of depth for this
character<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.720> who<00:01:37.079> knows<00:01:37.259> she<00:01:37.320> might<00:01:37.710> even

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
character and who knows she might even

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
character and who knows she might even
be<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> full<00:01:38.670> CMC<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.600> own<00:01:39.780> her<00:01:40.020> cutie<00:01:40.439> mark

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
be the full CMC to own her cutie mark

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.580 
be the full CMC to own her cutie mark

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
instead to get a really amazing song by

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.080 
instead to get a really amazing song by
the<00:02:37.260> apples<00:02:37.740> singing<00:02:38.070> about<00:02:38.280> their<00:02:38.610> family

the apples singing about their family
being<00:02:39.270> together<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.840> Pinkie<00:02:40.110> Pie<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.620> it

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
being together and Pinkie Pie as in it

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.220 
being together and Pinkie Pie as in it
as<00:02:40.860> well<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:42.060> Pinkie<00:02:42.600> Pie<00:02:42.780> might<00:02:43.050> be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
as well I think Pinkie Pie might be

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.260 
as well I think Pinkie Pie might be
tagging<00:02:43.680> along<00:02:43.800> with<00:02:44.280> them<00:02:44.550> because<00:02:44.790> her

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
tagging along with them because her

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.910 
tagging along with them because her
sisters<00:02:45.780> might<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.470> same<00:02:46.710> direction

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
sisters might be in the same direction

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.250 
sisters might be in the same direction
they<00:02:47.610> are<00:02:47.760> heading<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.660> will<00:02:48.870> give<00:02:48.900> them

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
they are heading and this will give them

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.650 
they are heading and this will give them
more<00:02:49.530> time<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.860> spend<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.460> family<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:51.150> would

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
