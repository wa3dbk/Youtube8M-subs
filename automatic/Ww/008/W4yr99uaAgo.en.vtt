00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.180
 aeio cemex people comment on you 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.370
 listen to me it's great today 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.400
 is found for episode 2 to edit a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.050
 clip so I just saw a bias rather 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 enjoyed the first episode 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.320
 I'm sorry if it lasted 20 minutes I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 did not think it was going to last that much 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 of time I really talk a lot 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.930
 so today we will just see 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.730
 for this episode 2 the no fangs as well 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.580
 that the flashes so it was rather 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.379
 much faster than the first 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.059
 if I do not take too much otan so that's 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.790
 party we will go when you say 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.110
 so how is it not to chew this 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.590
 that his antics are simply the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.750
 zoom shots with the screen simply 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.980
 crazy how to explain that but you're going 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 see that right away you go 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 understand that directly then we will get 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 render in pan and crop 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.170
 of events so it's a kind of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.510
 white square that is here see a window 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.940
 which has just opened up and quite simply 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.340
 added a punk rock so it's 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 little zoom shots you see that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.050
 when the second flap it zooms 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 the worst we are happy so me I you 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.850
 involved a punk rock that I use 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.649
 especially for bulk banking all 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.539
 what is linked 300 species he saves weighs 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.740
 all that stuff 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.330
 no you are going to go on one of the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.890
 corners of the bus is here really need to do 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.959
 be careful that these two options 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.729
 silk ticked a look of goods so what 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.140
 is not already done you have you in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.360
 killing corners you 're going to maintain 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.869
 shift and you had to fold down three 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.060
 notches end of the es3 so that's for the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.229
 very first picture years and after you to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.400
 the advanced old 2 3 3 and you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.260
 have 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.850
 talking about two big kids while 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.450
 now a figure it does not take 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.080
 forget 1 and 2 so we see in three 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 images that make a big buzz 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.900
 so have there I do not know why 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.900
 with key screen 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.549
 this is your promising the other but not 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.209
 too bad because you do not want any paper 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:11.540
 ok so I said in three pictures that's fine 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.040
 to go from that to that, so it's really 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.830
 very very fast is almost not seen 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.599
 the walls but you will see after the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.349
 sq wafeer you will go all to 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.989
 the end to see a picture the business 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.670
 who needs to restore and that's all 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.950
 simply I create a punk rock we go 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.269
 apply it on all parts of the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.350
 clip so it's all the time the same 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.000
 thing 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.430
 this is basically it gives a good shot of 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.790
 hand bend screen is about right 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.530
 do one of the progressive zooms here you 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.130
 and then apply this technique to 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:48.319
 every piece of your party meditate 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:51.799
 1 2 3 but in advance 1 to 3 we'll see at 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.099
 mans 2-2 we put an image before a 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.480
 speeches et et cetera et cetera 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.000
 it's all the time the same thing between 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.769
 3 so it's not the most technical 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.019
 fast and technique 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.760
 I'm used to this one I do 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.590
 all the time c log it does not bother me too much 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.340
 I'm just when I said 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.950
 So I am all the time that it is 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.440
 eat not lose the hand let's say it's 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.250
 anytime same for at least 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:24.090
 two weeks can predict 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.590
 to restore after full of technique 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.750
 particular for the pacr gold I you 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.480
 let's search for one on youtube at 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.670
 cost of all hello my technique that 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.860
 I use most often three cases 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.510
 such tax a rejection maybe make a 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:49.130
 little trick an evening between the rooms 1 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:53.670
 2 3 to mount it said it at the end 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.280
 So here you go, listen to punk rock a 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.350
 been put especially she whole party 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.190
 that we edited the previous episode so 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.820
 now i'm going to show you a 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.870
 little preview 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.920
 so that's doing shift b hop 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.920
 we go there we go 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.879
 So here see what happens with the 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.160
 punk rock you see a better 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:22.780
 fluidity so I'm here the quality of 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.470
 preview not super super so here 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.740
 now we are just going 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.919
 apply flashes at the shots 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.570
 so it's very very simple that too 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.210
 so for those who in sony vegas pro 12 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.100
 you will see in hsl encoding in the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.630
 video effects and or for those who have a 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.169
 previous version you have you in 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.880
 less than buying hrt danced because 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.370
 was the one earlier i think it's tsl 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.949
 so here you go take the option 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.780
 by default you to apply them on the 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.419
 first shot but we will take care 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.000
 simply from the first bar 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.110
 luminance here is here that wholesale 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.710
 is going to be just increase the 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.949
 brightness 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.440
 so I confide to be ready in 3 800 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.580
 voice so I put a point like a 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.180
 shit 800 this is just we 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.530
 will save saved 7 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.789
 this preselection I already have 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.570
 recorded there all I have to do 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.710
 it's typing the aubade name of the effect that 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.169
 how you want to call it 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.970
 I have not already called flash for 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.610
 so many pitfalls it will start again 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.590
 I already called flash so here 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.300
 and learned and more than save on 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.880
 a small record is here and that's okay 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.699
 create it and now go animate so 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.090
 at the first image, you know, that's 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.820
 to be on one as soon as the first image is ok 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.940
 to be very very very very brilliant and to 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.440
 the end we will give it to a whole 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.930
 simply click here on a kit 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.949
 clock to animate so that's it remains 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.599
 a point 8 and at the end we put to 3 0 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.840
 here and my control over all this 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.750
 part of it it'll make a big flash and 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.130
 it usually comes back to the massif and 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.750
 here you have more than apply that to 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:06.630
 every moment of the shot 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.630
 it takes on this animated program 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:15.729
 impotent ac and the same for the last 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:17.500
 powerful shot the print is found 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.080
 that it's a bit too bright will you 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:25.390
 can pc after will have to see with the cc 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:33.740
 we add after so we're going to finish 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:36.920
 yes ok 1.85 and then we start 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.900
 Well here's that's all for this 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.150
 tutorial just makes it all I like 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.890
 simply with the crop pad and the 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.710
 flashes so I showed them a little 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.480
 preview 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.590
 good I will try a complete to see 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.590
 what does that give this party 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.330
 it was held that he held roughly the 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.450
 So here cost good ah that's it for 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.510
 this second tutorial to edit a clip 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.560
 and I hope this episode will be more 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.880
 do not hesitate to drop a little lite 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.230
 offers extremely pleasure and to put a 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.060
 comment and then we find ourselves for 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.370
 episode 3, or to next says 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.370
 it was mexes and then at the next
