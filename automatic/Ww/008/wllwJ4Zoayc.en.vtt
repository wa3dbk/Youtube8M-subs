00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.829
 few know that many of the technical solutions underlying the formula one of the 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.429
 nowadays they are children of the inventiveness of a man who has been missing for more than 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.689
 twenty years 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.869
 a real genius that he created 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.670
 which contributed to evolution 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 and the technical revolution of formula 1 which has left an indelible mark 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030
 in the car 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.069

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.740
 he's anthony captures in blues hello 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 or more simply by stumbling 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.470
 colin ciampone was a mechanical designer with a passion for engines 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.920
 for the aeronautics structural engineering graduates was part of the royal 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.950

 but the sofi station has always been to build a. 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.710
 in 1952 I founded the lotus engineering 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.410
 in addition to state-of-the-art road cars, colin also created cars 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.980
 from competition in 58 entran with the lotus team one of the most teams 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.910
 history winners 6 pilot titles ie 7 manufacturers 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.450
 the period that gave him the most satisfaction was the years with gin

 with the disappearance of the Scotsman some things changed gear hello man hands 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.780
 which was no longer the same does not luckily change the swan that 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.670

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.190
 you can pioneer some fundamental styles of the formula 1, some twenty 8 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.890
 with the lotus 25 he introduced the monocoque frame up with the 49 made it become 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.089
 the structural component engine 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:14.389
 the lotus 72 was the first car with side radiators the 78 exploited 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.529
 the ground effect 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.749
 the lotus 88 even had a double frame but was banned from the street before 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.889
 could take to the track because if it is true that this sent us the revolution 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.529
 of formula 1 it is also true that its winning solutions were bothersome and 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.529
 every opportunity is legal to attack it

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.550
 with the stumble he was such an extraordinary character 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.370
 that still today someone thinks 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.920
 or perhaps he points out that behind his mysterious death at the age of 54 there is a flight to 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.109
 the tranquility of a paradise island 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.289
 maybe true 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.919
 imagine him hidden somewhere with his pencil in his hand doing one of his
