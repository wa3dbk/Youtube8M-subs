00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.450
 and as a penalty is kicked I do not know me 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.590
 bored well it's fine I do not know but the 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.590
 federal or if you know 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.890
 it's very simple samba when it comes to kicking 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 a criminal the most important thing is to put the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:46.010
 goal not the most important thing is the look the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.659
 nothing if the most important thing is to know 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.769
 observe the signals that the 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.809
 archer to matÃ­as me not just before 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.089
 hit the ball the legs of the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.399
 Archer tell us which way to go 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.449
 to throw so we must think fast and 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.449
 kick to the opposite side 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.650
 good people I can kick still not 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.560
 samba another technique that gives good results 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.900
 is kicking very hard to the highest part 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.460
 of the arch preferably at the angles 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.240
 here and here and why because to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.220
 reach them 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.560
 the archer does not just have to guess the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.920
 address but you have to jump very 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.290
 high these shots have 40% more than 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.490
 chances of becoming a goal that 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.490
 those that are kicked down 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.400
 now I understand today I learned how they kicked 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.100
 criminal thanks to the child who knows everything and 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.480
 to the federated that are the best 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.450
 world 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.960
 it is true federated we are the best 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.960
 world 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.970
 it was not worth 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.970
 and amazing world
