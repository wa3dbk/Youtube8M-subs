00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hello, in today's video, we'll talk. 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.210
 about the dog and calopsita coexistence 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 cat and calopsita will that this is 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 possible 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.619
 the answer is depends it's a lot of you already 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.289
 must have seen several videos you have there 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 by youtube dog playing with 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.180
 kato calcite playing with calcite 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 there are several videos of them but this 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.439
 means that you for having a cat a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.800
 dog in your house you can have a 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.950
 conquer another life is not in the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 It really depends on your dog or 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.750
 Your cat depends on his behavior. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.219
 depends on the breed defended postage depends 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
 a lot of thing 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.899
 so people ask me breno has 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.180
 a dog and I can have a calopsita 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.550
 and I always tell you that you have to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 evaluate this because it will depend on how 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.940
 and your dog 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.610
 often depends on the size of the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.149
 dog usually these dogs 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.460
 little shih tzu maltese 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.320
 puppies for sale 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.189
 they care about calopsita if they are not 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
 do not care 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.990
 then these children do not usually 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.240
 pose too much problem 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.010
 besides these a very jealous dog 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.780
 so what can happen 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 the dog is not interested in picking up 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 fire if you have start what it needs 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.650
 but he can be jealous and jealous 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.110
 it ends up rusting so that's why I 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.250
 I say that the owner of the dog or the cat is 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 what do you have to evaluate 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.079
 at the same time there are breeds of dogs that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.610
 they are hunters 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.579
 so for example my mother has a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.979
 coke and coo the race with wanting any 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.900
 it's a hunter race 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.540
 so it's an instinct of the bird she stays 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.040
 crazy when you see me every time I go 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.140
 To my mother's house everything has to stay 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.649
 arrested it is not today that it gets stuck 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 to get stuck the dog a dream 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.149
 she is fit so yes it is the rafa is 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.149
 hunt los angeles and the instinct of the beast 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.950
 so there is no use the ciro not live 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.229
 it is possible but you will have to hire the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.290
 doctor pet to go to your house and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.840
 and is trained not to buy 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.720
 catch the foot of the instinct of other races 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.210
 not interested in what you quote do not go 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.630
 will arrive and return 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.690
 there is to grab the same thing most 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.170
 of cats is they want to catch because it is 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.660
 His nature now has cats. 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.520
 whole more silly spending so mouth 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.400
 I did not speak but they are quieter. 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.930
 more tired but he did not get me 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.790
 then there is also what the cat 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.160
 It's grown since the puppy grew up 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.560
 living with the water that he then quotes 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.120
 accustomed that right to live with 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.390
 word and not interested in picking up 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.040
 so the answer to that question is 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.560
 What I 'm saying at the beginning of the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.400
 video or media depends on the people depends 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.920
 depends on the cat and the breno does not 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.660
 Can you give me that answer, ah? 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.220
 I can have do not know if it has to 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.230
 to evaluate how your dog is like 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.680
 his temperament is a knowledge and 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.260
 not as it is to you same cat 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.240
 how is the cat to be repaired or is it 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.250
 he put a little bird on the windows 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.920
 and go crazy desperate are also 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.950
 So this is the owner of the bug that 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.500
 have to analyze not i breno no 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.140
 I can give you this answer, you have to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.110
 assess the coexistence is possible yes but 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.930
 has this got to be thought about before 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.520
 Why is the cat dog a mouthful? 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.810
 they give the same cheer that they do not have 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.050
 intention to kill even if it is of 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.370
 a joke will hurt, sometimes a 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.020
 Big Dog is whatever a goal yesterday by 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.510
 example is the big dog is a 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.910
 super dog docile but he is a bit 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.260
 a calopsita even though it is that each 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.850
 The club also cites and lets see if it is 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.670
 my friend a mouthful killed ACOLOP 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.010
 quotes then does not mean is 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.740
 necessarily that the dog that the dog 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.720
 what the dog that the cat wants to get the 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.750
 animal to eat but sometimes I play for 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.040
 to play so many people, you have something 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.530
 cats do not know what to evaluate 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.040
 by the behavior of the animal that you have 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.740
 House 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.900
 this is it remember that there is always this 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.690
 possibility because despite being called 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.910
 of this vaccine today is an animal that feels 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.410
 pain in them you can be hurt 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.600
 can even die 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.160
 So folks, I'm responsible, I'm not going 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.930
 buy an area because I think 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.820
 You're going to think of all this in the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.220
