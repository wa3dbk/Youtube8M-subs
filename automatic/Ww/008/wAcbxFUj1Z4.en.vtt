block<00:01:02.030> I'm<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.210> put<00:01:03.390> our<00:01:03.480> second<00:01:03.960> rivet

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
block I'm gonna put our second rivet

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.730 
block I'm gonna put our second rivet
gauge<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:05.010> top<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> little

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
gauge on top so now we have a little

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.450 
gauge on top so now we have a little
rivet<00:01:08.070> gauge<00:01:08.280> sandwich<00:01:09.920> with<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.130> flush
