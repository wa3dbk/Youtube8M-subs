00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.529
 friends of both scraps on TV well found 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.010
 this afternoon 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.929
 I want to introduce you I want to show you 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.379
 the type of trigger I use for 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.999
 catch bass normally if there 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.660
 we find at the beach would be preferable 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:21.360
 trigger the live in this case 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.310
 we will take a boxer and triggers we will do 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.800
 a trigger of a trance of mullet a 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.390
 trigger with the cuttlefish with 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 very simple multine tracks with 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.990
 a spectator 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.600
 let's take a part of the mood itself a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.489
 piece not too big not to make a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.269
 not too selective bait 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.839
 I've already prepared a hook bar 0 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.359
 clearly with a piece of material 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.879
 that will allow my enesco to be able to 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.519
 then fluctuate the oppositions I love in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.329
 this way we take ours here 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.429
 fillet of mullet and turn over 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.600
 of the internal pulp of the murgine towards 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.819
 the outside 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.449
 this to make sure that ours 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.890
 trigger has a greater appeal 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.049
 we block everything with a few turns of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.500
 elastic thread as you see is all very much 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.850
 simple there are no difficulties 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.979
 this is a trigger that can be performed 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.280
 quietly even on the beach in 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.680
 very fast neat and clean 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 with the elastic thread we try to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.799
 lock with a few turns of thread 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.719
 elastic our primer and it is ready 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.359
 let's break the elastic thread here it is a 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:34.350
 nice stretch of mullet triggered and not 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:37.950
 I love two bars at 0 with an armrest of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.810
 about a meter and a half two meters and with 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.789
 a piece of expanded polyurethane 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.450
 inside to make sure it can 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.689
 to float 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.469
 this is the typical and classic trigger 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.000
 that we defined as hello hello 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.369
 today we call it sausage of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.460
 mullet another very valid trigger 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.240
 for the bass it is that of the small one 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.789
 cuttlefish 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.920
 but if more lina can be found from 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.289
 fishermen of the port that has it 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.140
 possibility or fish market is easy 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.400
 find them here we already have a tied hook 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.260
 you see very wide because we know that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.540
 the jaws of the sea bass are very serious 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.459
 so we need to make gods 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.379
 full-bodied triggers if of DVDs a lot years 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.799
 great in this case I also do 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:26.159
 see how I prepare my piece of 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:29.069
 polyurethane I put it with a needle 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.340
 specially bought that in the part 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.829
 of the tail practically has an eyelet 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.549
 I put the outside of the 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:42.769
 armrest as you can see everything very much 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.140
 simple i run it up to the mo 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.879
 I run my piece of e 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.549
 polyurethane foam up to the year there 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.230
 I insert the part of the glue 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.480
 of the hook so that the brand trigger 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.209
 compact near the hook and all very much 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.420
 simple at this point we take the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.470
 our baby and let's do our best 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.859
 the same system 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.859
 we prick it with the needle you can see that 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:23.180
 here it is ours if more lina there 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:26.360
 thread the thread here unfortunately here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.610
 Sepia is part of fishing 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.350
 so if we go this afternoon 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.670
 getting dirty is completely normal 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.730
 let's slide the violin axis 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.640
 on the thread on the thread and we do it 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.250
 slip to where we have 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.590
 positioned our our part 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.260
 floater ata as you can see the cuttlefish 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.780
 of nava touch the in our float if 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.770
 we succeed in as in this case a 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.490
 puncturing the head in the mo we block 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.430
 also the part of the head 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.280
 everything is very simple, here it is e 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.780
 then with a few turns of thread we block 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.180
 our trigger this is a trigger 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.090
 particularly pleasing to sea bass 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.400
 however there are the classic variants that 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.160
 they are represented by some beautiful installment 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.410
 from some bream and why not if we are 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.350
 in the area of ​​cliffs even from some 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.450
 the trigger is made large tentacles 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.160
 little ones will go by and from ours 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.480
 call by hand from our home never to 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:36.680
 our seculin a go to be released 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:39.110
 the trigger is very simple and is ready there 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.500
 I therefore illustrated two very primers 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.810
 fast 1 with the mullet slice and one 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.770
 with sepina separately trigger clearly 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.940
 selective dedicated to hunting and ad 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.940
 exile the bass
