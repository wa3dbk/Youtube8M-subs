talking about reviving sets get the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.420 
talking about reviving sets get the
basics<00:00:15.599> over<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.139> regular<00:00:16.500> revive<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.279> any

basics over with a regular revive on any
player<00:00:17.670> takes<00:00:18.029> 3<00:00:18.330> seconds<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.779> time<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.320> while

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
player takes 3 seconds of time and while

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
player takes 3 seconds of time and while
that<00:00:20.160> seems<00:00:20.609> ludicrous<00:00:20.939> lee<00:00:21.359> shore<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.960> terms

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
that seems ludicrous lee shore in terms

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
that seems ludicrous lee shore in terms
of<00:00:22.320> zombies<00:00:22.800> even<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.640> half<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.970> second<00:00:24.330> makes

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
of zombies even the half a second makes

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.540 
of zombies even the half a second makes
a<00:00:24.930> big<00:00:25.080> difference<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.070> time<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.519> be

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
a big difference this time can be

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.240 
a big difference this time can be
shortened<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:27.330> two<00:00:27.390> separate<00:00:28.109> methods<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.980> if

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
shortened by two separate methods and if

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.460 
shortened by two separate methods and if
both<00:00:29.580> are<00:00:29.609> applied<00:00:30.119> then<00:00:30.599> reviving<00:00:31.170> someone

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
both are applied then reviving someone

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620 
both are applied then reviving someone
just<00:00:31.619> seems<00:00:31.800> instant<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:33.000> methods<00:00:33.510> are

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
just seems instant now these methods are

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
just seems instant now these methods are
of<00:00:33.960> course<00:00:34.290> quick<00:00:34.620> revive<00:00:34.920> which<00:00:35.160> costs<00:00:35.489> 2500

lift which is right next to the m14 and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.900 
lift which is right next to the m14 and
the<00:00:45.600> other<00:00:45.750> method<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> super<00:00:47.280> vibe<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the other method is super vibe which is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
the other method is super vibe which is
the<00:00:48.030> perk<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.690> which<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.840> much<00:00:49.079> like

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the perk that you get which is much like

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.529 
the perk that you get which is much like
super<00:00:50.129> jargon<00:00:50.520> heads<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> just

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
super jargon heads up and it just

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.389 
super jargon heads up and it just
happens<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> can't<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.649> bought<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> have

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
happens it can't be bought and you have

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.139 
happens it can't be bought and you have
to<00:00:53.600> get<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:55.110> reviving<00:00:55.590> 15<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.340> 20<00:00:56.730> people

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to get that by reviving 15 to 20 people

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.349 
to get that by reviving 15 to 20 people
in<00:00:57.350> one<00:00:58.350> game<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:59.309> both<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.670> these<00:00:59.760> cut<00:01:00.030> revive

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
in one game now both of these cut revive

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.209 
in one game now both of these cut revive
time<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.780> half<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.440> both<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.980> it's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
time in half so with both of them it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.280 
time in half so with both of them it's
times<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:03.030> speed<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> without<00:01:03.989> them<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
times for speed and without them it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
times for speed and without them it
takes<00:01:04.439> three<00:01:04.680> seconds<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.280> half<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.090> three

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
takes three seconds so half of three

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.230 
takes three seconds so half of three
seconds<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.840> 1.5<00:01:07.500> seconds<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.189> half<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
seconds is 1.5 seconds then half that is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.170 
seconds is 1.5 seconds then half that is
0.75<00:01:10.200> seconds<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.100> less<00:01:11.340> than<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.700> second

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
0.75 seconds that's less than one second

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.690 
0.75 seconds that's less than one second
it<00:01:12.600> takes<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.229> revive<00:01:13.530> someone<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it takes to revive someone and that is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
it takes to revive someone and that is
pretty<00:01:14.909> damn<00:01:15.119> quick<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.570> we're<00:01:16.170> super

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
pretty damn quick and we're super

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.230 
pretty damn quick and we're super
revived<00:01:16.799> something<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> lot<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> people<00:01:17.759> don't

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
revived something a lot of people don't

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.980 
revived something a lot of people don't
know<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.380> goes<00:01:19.560> away<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> fail

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
know is that it goes away if you fail

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.280 
know is that it goes away if you fail
125<00:01:21.990> revives<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.680> includes<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.670> people

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
125 revives that includes when people

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
125 revives that includes when people
fully<00:01:25.290> die<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> stop<00:01:26.549> providing

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
fully die and if you stop providing

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
fully die and if you stop providing
someone<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.020> start<00:01:28.290> reviving<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
someone is in you start reviving them to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.130 
someone is in you start reviving them to
move<00:01:29.070> away<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:29.400> them<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.689> counts<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
move away from them that counts as a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.980 
move away from them that counts as a
failed<00:01:31.350> revive<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.159> good<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.520> as

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
failed revive so that's good to know as

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.359 
failed revive so that's good to know as
well<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> fact<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.979> actually

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
well as the fact that you can actually

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
well as the fact that you can actually
revive<00:01:35.670> multiple<00:01:36.150> people<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:36.659> they're<00:01:36.869> close

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
revive multiple people if they're close

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.980 
revive multiple people if they're close
together<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.340> we'll<00:01:38.490> move<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
together so now we'll move on to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.270 
together so now we'll move on to
positioning<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.920> things<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
positioning which I have two things to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.100 
positioning which I have two things to
say<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.540> first<00:01:42.780> thing<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
say about that the first thing is that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
say about that the first thing is that
way<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:43.680> reviving<00:01:44.220> someone<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
way if you're reviving someone and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.039 
way if you're reviving someone and
you're<00:01:44.970> good<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.420> thumbs<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.930> can

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
you're good with your thumbs you can

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
you're good with your thumbs you can
actually<00:01:46.439> move<00:01:46.710> around<00:01:47.130> while<00:01:47.729> surviving

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
actually move around while surviving

actually move around while surviving
someone<00:01:48.720> which<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> good<00:01:49.770> way<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> buy<00:01:50.729> even

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
someone which is a good way to buy even

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
someone which is a good way to buy even
just<00:01:51.180> half<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.509> second<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.899> time<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
just half a second of time if you see a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.050 
just half a second of time if you see a
zombie<00:01:52.649> coming<00:01:53.310> close<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.880> edged

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
zombie coming close you can just edged

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
zombie coming close you can just edged
away<00:01:54.210> from<00:01:54.689> them<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> main<00:01:55.710> tip<00:01:56.219> i<00:01:56.369> have

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
away from them but the main tip i have

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.980 
away from them but the main tip i have
about<00:01:56.759> positioning<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.869> you're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
about positioning is that if you're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.539 
about positioning is that if you're
planning<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> revive<00:01:58.710> someone<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.340> should

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
planning to revive someone you should

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.880 
planning to revive someone you should
preferably<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> move<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> side<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
preferably have the move to the side of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.320 
preferably have the move to the side of
a<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.549> open<00:02:02.939> air

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
a more open air

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.560 
a more open air
and<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.980> can<00:02:05.120> train<00:02:06.120> up<00:02:06.240> zombies

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and with this you can train up zombies

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.760 
and with this you can train up zombies
like<00:02:06.690> if<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.900> take<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> Buddha<00:02:07.320> room<00:02:07.560> for

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
like if you take the Buddha room for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.680 
like if you take the Buddha room for

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
one but is you can train while the

one but is you can train while the
zombies<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.480> train<00:02:12.630> all<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.810> zombies

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
zombies you can train all the zombies
