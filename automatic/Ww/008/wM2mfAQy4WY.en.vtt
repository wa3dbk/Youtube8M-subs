absolutely massive and of course I'm
coming<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.140> first<00:00:31.320> idea<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.679> came<00:00:32.070> into<00:00:32.250> our

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
coming the first idea that came into our

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.860 
coming the first idea that came into our
head<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.700> how<00:00:32.850> exactly<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.450> he<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> get

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
head is how exactly is he going to get

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.600 
head is how exactly is he going to get
around<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.260> city<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.530> any<00:00:34.710> easy<00:00:34.950> way<00:00:35.070> well<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
answer to that is any number of

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
bomb move where he gains acceleration

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
bomb move where he gains acceleration
and<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> switch<00:00:46.739> back<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.789> allows

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and kind of switch back up which allows

them to gain altitude and fly through
the<00:00:49.469> air<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> where<00:00:50.219> he<00:00:50.280> needs<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> go

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the air and get to where he needs to go

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.360
