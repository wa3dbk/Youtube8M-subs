00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
also been enforced it with some of the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
also been enforced it with some of the
mono<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.350> used<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.650> tie<00:02:22.830> with<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.360> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
mono that I used to tie with and now to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.490 
mono that I used to tie with and now to
just<00:02:24.990> add<00:02:25.140> more<00:02:26.010> protection<00:02:26.900> just<00:02:27.900> go<00:02:28.230> across

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
just add more protection just go across

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.000 
just add more protection just go across
it<00:02:29.150> move<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.270> around<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.290> what<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.680> really

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
it move it around and what this really

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.880 
it move it around and what this really
does<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.670> really<00:02:36.570> does<00:02:36.780> protect<00:02:37.490> your

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
rattle from breaking if you take the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.000 
rattle from breaking if you take the
time<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.930> tie<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.380> rattles<00:02:43.800> and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
time that it's a tie with rattles and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
bouncing on rocks or across moisture

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.850 
bouncing on rocks or across moisture
beds<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.300> great<00:02:51.660> system<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.410> have

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.370 

because<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.950> really<00:02:56.130> does<00:02:56.220> protect<00:02:57.380> your

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.270 

and<00:03:12.280> you're<00:03:12.400> done<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:14.260> now<00:03:14.680> what<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.040> do

stuff from fouling around the hook but

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.690 
stuff from fouling around the hook but
the<00:03:33.640> big<00:03:33.850> big<00:03:34.120> thing<00:03:34.360> for<00:03:34.390> me<00:03:34.750> is<00:03:35.370> as<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.520> can

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700

really<00:03:36.910> take<00:03:37.600> some<00:03:37.780> beating<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:39.490> it<00:03:39.580> does<00:03:39.760> not

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
really take some beating and it does not

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.470 
really take some beating and it does not
break<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.400> really<00:03:42.550> protects<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.000> rattle

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
break and it really protects that rattle
