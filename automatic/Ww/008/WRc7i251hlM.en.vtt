00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.660
 hello to all friends of tom's hardware well 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.820
 we found the stand here in cement 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.230
 of cooler master that incredibly yes 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.029
 gives some product launches 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.880
 incredibly because the fair up 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.400
 now he has seen few then this 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.680
 z trigger will be sold at 119 euros and is 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.719
 the new master cooler keyboard has 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.309
 two particular characteristics the 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.410
 rests place on which one is very much 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.239
 pause at them but I don't know if the gamers did it 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.309
 will appreciate because it is a keyboard 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.050
 specifically dedicated to gamers 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.460
 also seen the price 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.429
 another feature has a processor 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.589
 inside its memory then the keys 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.670
 macros can be programmed 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.920
 directly on the keyboard 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.879
 using a key combination 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.219
 storing them by connecting them to one of 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.469
 these five buttons in this way the 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.089
 break without having to 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.069
 software often installed to players 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.940
 don't like installing a driver later 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.460
 the other 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.860
 then we remember trigger z 119 euros 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.420
 available soon with the switches of 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.100
 brown color that also affect the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.500
 backlighting available on all 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.960
 the models and soon on the German market 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.790
 we will also have the blue and red ones 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 switches are a very phenomenon 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.540
 detail that cooler master chief a 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.549
 study with this nice exhibitor 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.640
 then the brown we see in a 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.310
 trigger z is a switch that does not have the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.740
 click but tactile feedback by pressing yes 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.360
 feels a particular resistance that 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.939
 blue also gives a nice click that 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.840
 now I'll let you hear 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:40.880
 ok while the red one at the race that goes 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.219
 completely without tactile feedback and 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 not even the click below we see green 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.579
 black and white that practically are 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.479
 similar as typology then green with 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.609
 click but heavier from 50 45 grams per 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.250
 the activation we even look at 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.149
 on 80 g 85 grams for white 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.310
 then always talking about switches let's go 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.380
 to a novelty this is the new silence of 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.550
 master cooler or cm as you prefer 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.770
 their cm storm in this case is the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.260
 first keyboard with the switches of the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.450
 tower here messed up one to show 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.760
 one thing then the switches from the top e 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.580
 they are very particular have one 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.440
 feedback all of them are very expensive 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.860
 in fact this keyboard could cost you 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.960
 3 150 and 200 euros remaining with 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.840
 therefore the most economic top king keyboard 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.550
 on the market according to master coolers have 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.540
 the characteristic of being a street of 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.150
 between the switch cerri and the keyboard 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.350
 membrane could therefore lower 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.720
 many players 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.480
 other detail the underlying part 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.460
 therefore the connector is compatible with 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.800
 those of cerri this is a rate that 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.470
 I took it literally from the keyboard 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.660
 trigger ze goes perfectly then one 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.370
 can make himself a nice frankenstein or a 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.740
 harlequin putting everything together 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.390
 the price as I said is very high 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.770
 but it could excite many players 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.800
 because a situation completely 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.540
 new and we in the case of top kings do not 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.160
 they see a lot of keyboards 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.600
 so guys now I'll pass the line 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.610
 ad andrea for the next video that 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.989
 will present a new case here from cm 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.530
 storm for the keyboard part is really 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.530
 all
