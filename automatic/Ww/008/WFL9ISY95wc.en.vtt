00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
frost dk at the moment they're they're

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.599 
frost dk at the moment they're they're
pretty<00:00:23.340> good<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> said<00:00:26.160> I'd<00:00:26.279> bring<00:00:26.430> an

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
pretty good so I said I'd bring an

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.990 
pretty good so I said I'd bring an
instructional<00:00:27.210> PvP<00:00:28.109> video<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.800> these<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:29.970> my

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
instructional PvP video so these are my

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.790 
instructional PvP video so these are my
thoughts<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.949> what<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.360> frost<00:00:33.360> dk<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:34.649> look

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
thoughts on what a frost dk can look

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.660 
thoughts on what a frost dk can look
like<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.340> patch<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> did<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
like in this patch so what I did is I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.910 
like in this patch so what I did is I
reforged<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:40.290> mostly<00:00:40.980> haste<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.800> most<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
reforged into mostly haste and most of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.979 
reforged into mostly haste and most of
the<00:00:44.010> gear<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.640> pvp<00:00:45.390> resilience<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the gear now has the pvp resilience and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.529 
the gear now has the pvp resilience and
pvp<00:00:46.350> power<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> also<00:00:47.940> noticed<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
pvp power on it but I also noticed that

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
pvp power on it but I also noticed that
it<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:50.480> haste<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.780> mastery<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> everything

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
it has haste and mastery so everything

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.610 
it has haste and mastery so everything
that<00:00:53.550> wasn't<00:00:54.239> either<00:00:54.539> haste<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:54.960> mastery<00:00:55.379> ira

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that wasn't either haste or mastery ira

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
that wasn't either haste or mastery ira
forged<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.550> haste<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.390> mastery<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.379> for

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
forged to haste or mastery so for

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.369 
forged to haste or mastery so for
example<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:59.219> had<00:00:59.430> mastering<00:00:59.879> expertise<00:01:00.300> I

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
example this had mastering expertise I

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
example this had mastering expertise I
reforged<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> expertise<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> haste<00:01:02.340> which<00:01:03.090> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
reforged the expertise to haste which I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.039 
reforged the expertise to haste which I
might<00:01:03.780> end<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.379> taking<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> off<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
might end up taking that off in a

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
might end up taking that off in a
getting<00:01:07.250> expertise<00:01:08.250> capped<00:01:08.520> I'm<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
getting expertise capped I'm going to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.070 
getting expertise capped I'm going to
actually<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:11.010> um<00:01:11.280> a

actually go do that right now so um a
few<00:01:13.080> things<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> noticed<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.340> hit<00:01:15.090> chance

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
few things that I noticed the hit chance

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.280 
few things that I noticed the hit chance
it<00:01:15.689> went<00:01:16.020> down<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.090> three<00:01:18.090> percent<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.080> that's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it went down to three percent so that's

noticed in my BG that in the BG that i
did<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.799> frosty<00:01:28.799> case<00:01:28.979> should<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.189> expertise

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
did a frosty case should be expertise

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.210 
did a frosty case should be expertise
caps<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.470> parried<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
caps now because they get parried and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.090 
caps now because they get parried and
dodged<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.740> fix<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.450> oh

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
dodged a lot so I have to fix that oh

yes<00:01:48.130> frost<00:01:48.550> decays<00:01:48.940> need<00:01:49.390> expertise<00:01:50.140> now<00:01:50.350> so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
yes frost decays need expertise now so

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.190 
yes frost decays need expertise now so
I'm<00:01:51.100> going<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.250> give<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.670> try<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:52.390> how

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
I'm going to give that a try and see how

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.490 
I'm going to give that a try and see how
it<00:01:53.320> works<00:01:53.350> out<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.420> if<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.840> doesn't<00:01:56.170> work<00:01:56.200> out

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
it works out and if it doesn't work out

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.720 
it works out and if it doesn't work out
then<00:01:58.620> then<00:01:59.620> I'll<00:01:59.710> just<00:01:59.770> reforge<00:02:00.220> back<00:02:00.430> it's<00:02:00.610> no

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
then then I'll just reforge back it's no

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.800 
then then I'll just reforge back it's no
big<00:02:00.880> deal<00:02:00.910> so<00:02:03.150> I'm<00:02:04.150> going<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.360> try<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.570> fix

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
big deal so I'm going to try to fix

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.370 
big deal so I'm going to try to fix
these<00:02:04.990> uh<00:02:05.050> frame<00:02:05.890> rates<00:02:06.100> hold<00:02:06.580> on<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:08.229> better

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
these uh frame rates hold on it's better

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.530 
these uh frame rates hold on it's better
now<00:02:08.590> it's<00:02:09.280> like<00:02:09.399> every<00:02:09.640> time<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.820> move<00:02:11.250> so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
now it's like every time I move so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.720 
now it's like every time I move so
that's<00:02:13.540> mastery<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.380> think<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.100> want<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.370> go<00:02:15.460> more

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
that's mastery I think I want to go more

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.800 
that's mastery I think I want to go more
with<00:02:15.790> haste<00:02:16.770> because<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:19.000> seems<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.450> be<00:02:19.540> better

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
with haste because it seems to be better

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.730 
with haste because it seems to be better
at<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.170> moment<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:22.800> 1.2<00:02:24.810> gonna<00:02:25.810> reforge<00:02:26.560> that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
at the moment so 1.2 gonna reforge that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.810 
at the moment so 1.2 gonna reforge that
back<00:02:28.800> expertise<00:02:29.800> yeah<00:02:30.280> that's<00:02:30.580> close<00:02:30.790> enough

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
back expertise yeah that's close enough

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.260 
back expertise yeah that's close enough
I'm<00:02:31.120> expertise<00:02:31.540> cap<00:02:31.750> now<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:33.660> i<00:02:35.070> ended<00:02:36.070> up

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
I'm expertise cap now so i ended up

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.790 
I'm expertise cap now so i ended up
reforging<00:02:37.270> into<00:02:37.540> all<00:02:37.690> haste<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.110> mastery<00:02:38.170> so

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
reforging into all haste and mastery so

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.590 
reforging into all haste and mastery so
for<00:02:38.980> example<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.520> didn't<00:02:40.030> reforge<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.510> one

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
for example I didn't reforge that one

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.500 
for example I didn't reforge that one
because<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.870> need<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.080> be<00:02:41.170> expertise<00:02:41.620> capped

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
because I need to be expertise capped

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.430 
because I need to be expertise capped
that<00:02:43.510> has<00:02:43.690> hastened<00:02:43.930> mastery<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:46.030> I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
that has hastened mastery this I

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.890 
that has hastened mastery this I
reforged<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.650> oh<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.070> didn't<00:02:48.460> oh<00:02:48.550> yeah<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:48.900> kept

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
reforged the oh I didn't oh yeah I kept

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.360 
reforged the oh I didn't oh yeah I kept
it<00:02:50.020> expertise<00:02:50.560> because<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.830> needed<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.190> kept

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
it expertise because I needed to be kept

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.240 
it expertise because I needed to be kept
I<00:02:52.530> reforged<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.709> hits<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.250> haste<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.860> this

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
I reforged the hits to haste and in this

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.400 
I reforged the hits to haste and in this
one<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.489> reforged<00:02:58.150> critical<00:02:59.050> strike<00:02:59.260> to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
one I reforged critical strike to

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.199 
one I reforged critical strike to
mastery<00:02:59.800> because<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.730> don't<00:03:00.880> really<00:03:01.000> need

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
mastery because you don't really need

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.790 
mastery because you don't really need
critical<00:03:01.420> strike<00:03:01.810> as<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.959> frosty<00:03:02.380> case<00:03:02.530> since

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
critical strike as a frosty case since

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.380 
critical strike as a frosty case since
you<00:03:02.950> get<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:05.020> prox<00:03:05.650> which<00:03:06.489> do<00:03:06.730> instant

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
you get the the prox which do instant

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.500 
you get the the prox which do instant
grits<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:09.040> reforged<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.060> didn't<00:03:10.270> reforge

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
grits and I reforged I didn't reforge

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.720 
grits and I reforged I didn't reforge
that<00:03:10.660> one<00:03:10.750> because<00:03:10.840> it's<00:03:11.050> haste<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.350> mastery

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
that one because it's haste and mastery

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.050 
that one because it's haste and mastery
I<00:03:13.410> reforged<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.560> hit<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.010> one<00:03:15.670> too<00:03:15.850> haste

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
I reforged the hit on that one too haste

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.910 
I reforged the hit on that one too haste
I<00:03:16.360> reforge<00:03:17.140> hit<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.470> mastery<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.450> then<00:03:19.920> crit

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
I reforge hit to mastery and then crit

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.290 
I reforge hit to mastery and then crit
to<00:03:21.040> mastery<00:03:21.540> then<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:23.080> reforged<00:03:24.300> crit

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
to mastery then on this I reforged crit

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.380 
to mastery then on this I reforged crit
to<00:03:25.450> mastery<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.050> then<00:03:26.970> crit<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.060> mastery

again then hit taste and done my weapon

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.780 
again then hit taste and done my weapon
I<00:03:31.930> left<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.320> haste<00:03:32.560> i'm<00:03:33.130> going<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.459> try<00:03:33.580> both

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
I left it haste i'm going to try both

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.949 
I left it haste i'm going to try both
haste<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.150> mastery<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.570> see<00:03:34.690> which<00:03:34.810> one's

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
haste and mastery to see which one's

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.170 
haste and mastery to see which one's
better<00:03:35.110> but<00:03:35.800> for<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.670> moment<00:03:36.790> i<00:03:36.940> think<00:03:37.120> i'm

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
better but for the moment i think i'm

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.550 
better but for the moment i think i'm
going<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.360> go<00:03:37.450> for<00:03:37.660> haste<00:03:37.870> because<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.290> need<00:03:38.410> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
going to go for haste because I need the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.259 
going to go for haste because I need the
runic<00:03:38.920> regeneration<00:03:39.340> since<00:03:39.670> I'm<00:03:39.760> using<00:03:39.850> frost

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
runic regeneration since I'm using frost

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.199 
runic regeneration since I'm using frost
presents<00:03:40.720> yes<00:03:41.500> nowadays<00:03:42.220> frost<00:03:42.640> presence<00:03:43.090> is

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
presents yes nowadays frost presence is

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.340 
presents yes nowadays frost presence is
better<00:03:43.420> because<00:03:44.230> um<00:03:45.300> for<00:03:46.300> frost<00:03:46.510> decays<00:03:46.870> you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
better because um for frost decays you

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.430 
better because um for frost decays you
now<00:03:48.070> get<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:49.140> increased<00:03:50.140> runic<00:03:50.380> power

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
now get the increased runic power

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.280 
now get the increased runic power
generation<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.390> reduction<00:03:52.390> of<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.630> frost

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
generation and reduction of the frost

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.860 
generation and reduction of the frost
strike<00:03:53.590> by<00:03:53.890> 15<00:03:54.310> which<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.550> pretty<00:03:54.940> big<00:03:55.209> so<00:03:55.840> you

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
strike by 15 which is pretty big so you

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.000 
strike by 15 which is pretty big so you
can<00:03:56.109> frustrate<00:03:56.470> quite<00:03:56.920> often

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
can frustrate quite often

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.949 
can frustrate quite often
and<00:03:58.280> I've<00:03:58.760> also<00:03:58.939> noticed<00:03:59.209> that<00:03:59.420> obliterates

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
and I've also noticed that obliterates

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.179 
and I've also noticed that obliterates
hitting<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.290> lot<00:04:00.470> harder<00:04:00.650> than<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.920> was<00:04:01.069> before

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
hitting a lot harder than it was before

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.580 
hitting a lot harder than it was before
so<00:04:01.580> I've<00:04:01.730> started<00:04:02.450> using<00:04:02.720> obliterate<00:04:03.379> again

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
so I've started using obliterate again

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.670 
so I've started using obliterate again
and<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:05.180> way<00:04:05.329> i<00:04:05.360> use<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.110> is<00:04:06.230> i<00:04:06.439> get<00:04:06.590> my

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
and the way i use it is i get my

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.610 
and the way i use it is i get my
diseases<00:04:07.069> on<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.459> then<00:04:07.849> i<00:04:08.170> use<00:04:09.170> obliterate

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
diseases on and then i use obliterate

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.990 
diseases on and then i use obliterate
when<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.430> instant<00:04:10.760> prox<00:04:10.989> so<00:04:12.700> that's<00:04:13.700> what<00:04:13.879> I've

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
when it instant prox so that's what I've

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.689 
when it instant prox so that's what I've
been<00:04:14.090> doing<00:04:14.209> for<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.599> I<00:04:15.260> think<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.250> control

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
been doing for that I think the control

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.550 
been doing for that I think the control
and<00:04:16.880> debt<00:04:17.000> ability<00:04:17.389> is<00:04:17.449> really<00:04:17.750> cool<00:04:17.900> because

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
and debt ability is really cool because

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.580 
and debt ability is really cool because
you<00:04:18.829> can<00:04:18.859> use<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.190> on<00:04:19.310> I'm<00:04:19.430> targets<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:20.150> PvP<00:04:20.720> so

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
you can use it on I'm targets in PvP so

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.189 
you can use it on I'm targets in PvP so
I<00:04:21.650> like<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:23.440> now<00:04:24.440> talent-wise<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.810> went<00:04:26.810> into

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
I like that now talent-wise I went into

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.390 
I like that now talent-wise I went into
play<00:04:27.710> gleech<00:04:28.060> because<00:04:29.060> it's<00:04:29.210> basically<00:04:29.419> like

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
play gleech because it's basically like

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.219 
play gleech because it's basically like
it's<00:04:31.400> like<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.669> blood<00:04:31.910> tap<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.270> think<00:04:32.510> is<00:04:33.169> that

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
it's like the blood tap I think is that

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.580 
it's like the blood tap I think is that
blood<00:04:33.560> tap<00:04:34.570> room<00:04:35.570> tap<00:04:35.840> it's<00:04:36.139> like<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.410> room

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
blood tap room tap it's like the room

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.350 
blood tap room tap it's like the room
tap<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:36.919> think<00:04:37.160> whatever<00:04:37.340> whatever<00:04:37.789> one<00:04:38.150> gave

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
tap I think whatever whatever one gave

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.469 
tap I think whatever whatever one gave
you<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.949> depleted<00:04:39.949> rune<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.460> went<00:04:41.090> into<00:04:41.210> that

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
you the depleted rune I went into that

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.050 
you the depleted rune I went into that
because<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.710> was<00:04:42.919> that<00:04:43.460> was<00:04:43.520> pretty<00:04:43.580> big<00:04:43.880> for

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
because that was that was pretty big for

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.370 
because that was that was pretty big for
me<00:04:44.120> when<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.270> wanted<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:44.630> strangulate<00:04:44.960> someone

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380

so good I like I tried as fixie eight
and<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.889> stun<00:05:25.160> is<00:05:25.280> nice<00:05:25.490> but<00:05:25.880> having

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
and the stun is nice but having

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.320 
and the stun is nice but having
strangulate<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.010> being<00:05:28.639> I<00:05:28.760> mean<00:05:28.940> yes

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.670 
strangulate and being I mean yes
triangulate<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:29.900> being<00:05:30.110> able<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.380> go<00:05:30.500> into

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
triangulate and being able to go into

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.790 
triangulate and being able to go into
deaths<00:05:31.370> advanced<00:05:31.699> that's<00:05:32.360> really<00:05:32.660> cool<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.500> I

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
deaths advanced that's really cool so I

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.430 
deaths advanced that's really cool so I
ended<00:05:34.729> up<00:05:34.849> going<00:05:35.000> into<00:05:35.150> death<00:05:35.419> pact<00:05:35.690> because

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
ended up going into death pact because

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.400 
ended up going into death pact because
it<00:05:36.740> only<00:05:36.860> drains<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.729> minion<00:05:38.120> for<00:05:38.510> fifty

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
it only drains the minion for fifty

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.050 
it only drains the minion for fifty
percent<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.740> its<00:05:39.860> health<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.729> heals<00:05:40.909> you

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
percent of its health and it heals you

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.879 
percent of its health and it heals you
for<00:05:41.240> fifty<00:05:41.510> percent<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.900> your<00:05:42.110> maximum<00:05:42.680> health

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
for fifty percent of your maximum health

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.629 
for fifty percent of your maximum health
which<00:05:43.639> is<00:05:43.909> a<00:05:44.630> buff<00:05:44.900> from<00:05:45.169> what<00:05:45.349> it<00:05:45.440> was<00:05:45.470> before

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
which is a buff from what it was before

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.180 
which is a buff from what it was before
so<00:05:46.930> that's<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:48.020> lot<00:05:48.169> better<00:05:48.320> than<00:05:48.500> death<00:05:48.919> safe

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
so that's a lot better than death safe

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.100 
so that's a lot better than death safe
and<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.460> tried<00:05:49.669> that<00:05:49.699> out<00:05:49.849> it's<00:05:50.539> not<00:05:50.690> very<00:05:50.840> good

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
and I tried that out it's not very good

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.680 
and I tried that out it's not very good
in<00:05:51.320> conversion<00:05:52.010> that's<00:05:52.370> that's<00:05:53.090> like<00:05:53.270> it

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
in conversion that's that's like it

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.570 
in conversion that's that's like it
depletes<00:05:54.260> your<00:05:54.380> resources<00:05:54.889> which<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.370> don't

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
depletes your resources which I don't

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.020 
depletes your resources which I don't
see<00:05:55.760> as<00:05:55.880> being<00:05:56.030> very<00:05:56.300> very<00:05:56.659> good<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.560> um

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
see as being very very good so um

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.370 
see as being very very good so um
finally<00:05:59.030> I<00:05:59.060> went<00:05:59.180> into<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.479> runic<00:05:59.960> empowerment

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
finally I went into a runic empowerment

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.330 
finally I went into a runic empowerment
and<00:06:02.020> that<00:06:03.020> one's<00:06:03.199> pretty<00:06:03.380> good<00:06:03.590> it<00:06:03.830> activates

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
and that one's pretty good it activates

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.820 
and that one's pretty good it activates
whenever<00:06:05.240> you<00:06:05.449> land<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.720> Death<00:06:06.260> Strike<00:06:06.469> frost

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
whenever you land a Death Strike frost

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.620 
whenever you land a Death Strike frost
Drakkar<00:06:07.070> rune<00:06:07.729> strike<00:06:07.909> you<00:06:08.120> have<00:06:08.270> a<00:06:08.300> forty

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.719 
succour for at least dispatch because
there's<00:06:42.930> no<00:06:43.050> arenas<00:06:43.470> so<00:06:44.010> for<00:06:44.220> bee<00:06:44.310> gees<00:06:44.490> that's

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
there's no arenas so for bee gees that's

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.909 
there's no arenas so for bee gees that's
like<00:06:44.880> the<00:06:45.060> warrior<00:06:45.780> victory<00:06:46.110> rush<00:06:46.380> which<00:06:46.800> is

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
like the warrior victory rush which is

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.650 
like the warrior victory rush which is
pretty<00:06:47.040> cool<00:06:47.280> so<00:06:48.060> i<00:06:48.120> ended<00:06:48.300> up<00:06:48.389> going<00:06:48.510> into

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
pretty cool so i ended up going into

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.210 
pretty cool so i ended up going into
that<00:06:48.840> for<00:06:49.080> now<00:06:49.200> i'm<00:06:49.530> going<00:06:49.680> to<00:06:49.740> try<00:06:49.919> out<00:06:50.100> a<00:06:50.130> few

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
that for now i'm going to try out a few

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.000 
that for now i'm going to try out a few
different<00:06:50.430> ones<00:06:51.380> cliffs<00:06:52.380> with<00:06:52.500> strangulate

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
different ones cliffs with strangulate

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.310 
different ones cliffs with strangulate
which<00:06:53.430> most<00:06:54.180> people<00:06:54.330> know<00:06:54.600> increases<00:06:55.260> your

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
which most people know increases your

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.840 
which most people know increases your
silence<00:06:55.680> duration<00:06:55.950> by<00:06:56.070> two<00:06:56.130> seconds<00:06:56.610> when<00:06:56.729> you

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
silence duration by two seconds when you

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.790 
silence duration by two seconds when you
interrupt<00:06:57.720> something<00:07:00.229> glyph<00:07:01.229> of<00:07:01.380> anti-magic

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
interrupt something glyph of anti-magic

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.440 
interrupt something glyph of anti-magic
shell<00:07:01.979> causes<00:07:02.490> your<00:07:02.580> anti-magic<00:07:03.030> shell<00:07:03.210> to

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
shell causes your anti-magic shell to

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.840 
shell causes your anti-magic shell to
absorb<00:07:03.720> all<00:07:03.930> incoming<00:07:04.470> magical<00:07:04.919> damage<00:07:05.070> up<00:07:05.610> to

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
absorb all incoming magical damage up to

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.120 
absorb all incoming magical damage up to
the<00:07:05.940> absorption<00:07:06.300> limit<00:07:06.660> I<00:07:06.870> like<00:07:07.710> that<00:07:07.740> one<00:07:08.070> I

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
the absorption limit I like that one I

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.529 
the absorption limit I like that one I
think<00:07:09.500> it<00:07:10.500> gives<00:07:10.650> you<00:07:10.830> more<00:07:11.070> time<00:07:11.100> to<00:07:11.360> it<00:07:12.360> gives

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 
think it gives you more time to it gives

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.150 
think it gives you more time to it gives
you<00:07:12.630> more<00:07:12.810> uptime<00:07:13.169> I<00:07:13.199> think<00:07:13.560> if<00:07:13.770> you're<00:07:13.979> like

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
you more uptime I think if you're like

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.250 
you more uptime I think if you're like
low<00:07:14.340> and<00:07:14.610> you<00:07:14.699> use<00:07:14.850> anti-magic<00:07:15.330> shell<00:07:15.510> you

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260 
low and you use anti-magic shell you

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.870 
low and you use anti-magic shell you
won't<00:07:16.440> lose<00:07:16.650> any<00:07:16.710> health<00:07:17.220> against<00:07:17.729> magic

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
won't lose any health against magic

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.810 
won't lose any health against magic
damage<00:07:18.210> which<00:07:18.510> is<00:07:18.630> pretty<00:07:18.810> good<00:07:19.430> but<00:07:20.430> i<00:07:20.580> think

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
damage which is pretty good but i think

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.980 
damage which is pretty good but i think
i'm<00:07:20.940> going<00:07:21.030> to<00:07:21.120> end<00:07:21.270> up<00:07:21.330> trying<00:07:21.539> glyph<00:07:21.840> of

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
i'm going to end up trying glyph of

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.320 
i'm going to end up trying glyph of
death<00:07:22.139> and<00:07:22.289> decay<00:07:22.380> because<00:07:22.680> it<00:07:23.490> reduces<00:07:24.030> a

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
death and decay because it reduces a

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.610 
death and decay because it reduces a
movement<00:07:24.630> speed<00:07:24.810> of<00:07:24.930> enemies<00:07:25.260> within<00:07:25.440> the

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
movement speed of enemies within the

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.620 
movement speed of enemies within the
radius<00:07:25.770> by<00:07:26.100> fifty<00:07:26.520> percent<00:07:26.669> which<00:07:27.090> is<00:07:27.330> pretty

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
radius by fifty percent which is pretty

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.600 
radius by fifty percent which is pretty
good<00:07:27.840> so<00:07:28.410> i'm<00:07:28.560> going<00:07:28.680> to<00:07:28.770> give<00:07:29.039> that<00:07:29.070> one<00:07:29.340> try

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
good so i'm going to give that one try

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.210 
good so i'm going to give that one try
once<00:07:30.330> i<00:07:30.450> get<00:07:30.630> a<00:07:30.660> dust<00:07:31.050> of<00:07:31.169> disappearance<00:07:31.740> and<00:07:32.060> i

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
once i get a dust of disappearance and i

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.159 
once i get a dust of disappearance and i
might<00:07:35.220> go<00:07:35.430> with<00:07:35.639> the<00:07:36.270> icy<00:07:36.570> touch<00:07:36.750> because<00:07:37.050> it

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:37.169 
might go with the icy touch because it

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:38.779 
might go with the icy touch because it
dispels<00:07:37.470> one<00:07:37.710> magic<00:07:38.070> effect<00:07:38.340> from<00:07:38.460> the<00:07:38.520> target

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:38.789 
dispels one magic effect from the target

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:42.430 
dispels one magic effect from the target
that's<00:07:39.570> awesome<00:07:39.840> being<00:07:40.590> able<00:07:40.680> to<00:07:40.919> dispel<00:07:41.280> and

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 
that's awesome being able to dispel and

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.339 
that's awesome being able to dispel and
what's<00:07:43.440> the<00:07:43.560> other<00:07:43.590> one<00:07:43.919> unholy<00:07:44.490> command

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:45.349 
what's the other one unholy command

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:48.589 
what's the other one unholy command
dealing<00:07:46.349> a<00:07:46.410> killing<00:07:46.710> blow<00:07:46.830> that's<00:07:47.580> it<00:07:48.060> resets

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 
dealing a killing blow that's it resets

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.740 
dealing a killing blow that's it resets
the<00:07:48.720> cooldown<00:07:49.020> of<00:07:49.050> your<00:07:49.320> death<00:07:49.560> grip<00:07:50.750> finally

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.640 
it doesn't matter what you go into your
minor<00:07:53.130> glyphs<00:07:53.430> but<00:07:54.120> i<00:07:54.360> want<00:07:55.080> to<00:07:55.169> use<00:07:55.260> path<00:07:55.500> of

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650 
minor glyphs but i want to use path of

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.000 
minor glyphs but i want to use path of
frost<00:07:55.800> because<00:07:56.190> it<00:07:56.310> reduces<00:07:57.270> fall<00:07:57.900> damage<00:07:58.289> so

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.010
