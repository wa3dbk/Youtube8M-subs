high school but I like the environment

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.609 
high school but I like the environment
more<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.189> free<00:01:26.549> obviously<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
more it's very free obviously you have a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.520 
more it's very free obviously you have a
lot<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> freedom<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.960> freedom<00:01:31.350> these

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
lot of freedom but with freedom these

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.800 
lot of freedom but with freedom these
responsibilities<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> plus<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
responsibilities so it's like a plus and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.929 
responsibilities so it's like a plus and
a<00:01:33.869> minus<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.799> think<00:01:35.189> university<00:01:35.640> has<00:01:35.759> been

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
a minus but I think university has been

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.640 
a minus but I think university has been
a<00:01:35.970> bit<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> challenge<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
a bit of a challenge for me it's just I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590 
a bit of a challenge for me it's just I
don't<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> expect<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:39.150> into

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
don't know what to expect going into

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.360 
don't know what to expect going into
University<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.610> maybe<00:01:41.610> that's<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.970> challenge

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
University so maybe that's a challenge

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.880 
University so maybe that's a challenge

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
should kind of delete these social media

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.949 
should kind of delete these social media
because<00:02:11.009> social<00:02:11.819> media<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.540> we

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
don't have to but i think it's better if

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.150 
don't have to but i think it's better if
we<00:02:14.640> see<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.940> personalities<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.470> i<00:02:16.950> don't

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
we see the personalities so i don't

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.610 
we see the personalities so i don't
really<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.790> social<00:02:18.239> media<00:02:18.269> scoring<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.590> I

really like to social media scoring so I
bet<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.160> kind<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.580> rid<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.060> but<00:02:21.420> I
