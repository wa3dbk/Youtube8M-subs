00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
being shared ok now let's go to the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.340 
being shared ok now let's go to the
second<00:03:04.620> laptop<00:03:05.010> right<00:03:05.160> here<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.990> we<00:03:06.990> want<00:03:07.200> to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
there installed so now let's do the

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.820 
there installed so now let's do the
second<00:04:26.350> part<00:04:26.590> which<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.220> how<00:04:27.789> to<00:04:28.199> map<00:04:29.199> a<00:04:29.410> local

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
second part which is how to map a local

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.680 
second part which is how to map a local
network<00:04:29.949> drive<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.760> way<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:30.970> don't<00:04:31.180> have<00:04:31.389> to

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
network drive that way I don't have to

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.529 
network drive that way I don't have to
do<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:32.139> all<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.500> time<00:04:32.789> which<00:04:33.789> is<00:04:33.970> go<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.210> run

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
do that all the time which is go to run

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.689 
do that all the time which is go to run
and<00:04:34.750> type<00:04:34.810> in<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.560> name<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.039> all<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.190> stuff
