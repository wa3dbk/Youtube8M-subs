shape six makes you the would gear so

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.970 
shape six makes you the would gear so
there<00:02:32.019> will<00:02:32.170> give<00:02:32.439> it<00:02:32.650> goes<00:02:32.890> at<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.189> top<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
there will give it goes at the top the
