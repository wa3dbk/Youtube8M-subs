we're doing the amp Tweaker Tiger buzz
base<00:00:55.890> type<00:00:56.250> fuzz

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.980 

this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.720> am<00:01:16.080> tweakers<00:01:16.710> bass<00:01:17.100> type<00:01:17.520> fuzz<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
this is am tweakers bass type fuzz the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.250 
this is am tweakers bass type fuzz the
type<00:01:19.520> I'm<00:01:20.520> gathering<00:01:21.180> comes<00:01:21.720> from<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.050> fact

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
type I'm gathering comes from the fact

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.310 
type I'm gathering comes from the fact
that<00:01:22.550> this<00:01:23.550> knob<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> tight<00:01:24.630> knob<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that this knob is the tight knob and so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.500 
that this knob is the tight knob and so
what<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.800> do<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.010> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> tighten<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.820> so

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
what you can do is you can tighten up so

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.630 
what you can do is you can tighten up so
you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:28.080> control<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.770> feedback<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.370> as<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you can control that feedback so as you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
you can control that feedback so as you
heard<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.060> um<00:01:30.390> example<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.410> just<00:01:31.500> did

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
heard in this um example that I just did

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
heard in this um example that I just did
when<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:32.790> stopped<00:01:33.119> playing<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.750> dead<00:01:34.050> quiet

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
when I stopped playing it's dead quiet

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.500 
when I stopped playing it's dead quiet
and<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> loosen<00:01:36.330> that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
and that's you can you can loosen that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.660 
and that's you can you can loosen that
up<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:37.470> where<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:37.860> little<00:01:37.979> bit<00:01:38.130> noisier

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
up to where it's a little bit noisier

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
up to where it's a little bit noisier
towards<00:01:39.180> full-blown<00:01:39.720> open<00:01:40.260> so<00:01:40.410> when<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.650> stop

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
towards full-blown open so when you stop

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400 
towards full-blown open so when you stop
you<00:01:41.130> hear<00:01:41.400> noise<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> hiss<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.960> you're

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
you hear noise and hiss but if you're

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.630 
you hear noise and hiss but if you're
not<00:01:43.560> into<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.160> you're<00:01:44.250> trying<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> do

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
not into that if you're trying to do

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120 
not into that if you're trying to do
tight<00:01:44.940> cuts<00:01:45.300> this<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.440> pedal<00:01:46.680> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
tight cuts this this is the pedal this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.510 
tight cuts this this is the pedal this
is<00:01:47.310> awesome<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.450> heavy<00:01:48.840> overdrive

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
is awesome for for that heavy overdrive

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.930 
is awesome for for that heavy overdrive
basically<00:01:50.520> volume<00:01:51.000> tone<00:01:51.420> fuzz<00:01:52.250> tight<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
basically volume tone fuzz tight and

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.270 
basically volume tone fuzz tight and
this<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.540> dry<00:01:55.050> low<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.130> basically

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
this is the dry low so you can basically

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.240 
this is the dry low so you can basically
blend<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> low<00:01:57.890> frequencies<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
blend in like the low frequencies of the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330 
blend in like the low frequencies of the
the<00:02:00.119> dry<00:02:00.360> signal<00:02:00.420> take<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.800> know<00:02:01.920> when<00:02:02.100> cuz

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the dry signal take you know when cuz

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
the dry signal take you know when cuz
when<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.610> happens<00:02:02.910> when<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.149> fuzz<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.600> distort

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
when it happens when you fuzz or distort

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
when it happens when you fuzz or distort
it<00:02:04.410> compresses<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.369> signal<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> lose

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it compresses your signal and you lose

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.370 
it compresses your signal and you lose
some<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.300> your<00:02:06.390> bottom<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.960> where<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> can

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
some of your bottom and where you can

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.680 
some of your bottom and where you can
add<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.009> dry<00:02:08.399> low<00:02:08.700> with<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.270> poem

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
add some of that dry low with this poem

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.449 
add some of that dry low with this poem
I<00:02:09.840> mean<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.229> knob<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.649> sorry<00:02:10.890> going

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
I mean with this knob I'm sorry going

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.070 
I mean with this knob I'm sorry going
into<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> next<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.209> switch<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
into the next little switch is the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.990 
into the next little switch is the
transistor<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.550> switch<00:02:14.820> between

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
transistor so you can switch between

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.960 
transistor so you can switch between
germanium<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:15.870> silicon<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.739> then<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.730> final

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
germanium or silicon and then this final
