00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
check this out so the innovation zone I

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.550 
check this out so the innovation zone I
guess<00:00:05.609> Riva<00:00:06.569> lights<00:00:06.870> there<00:00:07.080> we<00:00:07.170> go<00:00:07.259> yeah<00:00:07.410> I've

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
guess Riva lights there we go yeah I've

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.280 
guess Riva lights there we go yeah I've
seen<00:00:07.799> these<00:00:08.010> online<00:00:09.000> do<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.080> know<00:00:10.139> where

seen these online do you know where
these<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.530> Kickstarter<00:00:11.130> thing<00:00:12.170> it<00:00:13.170> were<00:00:13.349> a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
these a Kickstarter thing it were a

these a Kickstarter thing it were a
Kickstarter<00:00:14.040> thing<00:00:14.190> I'm<00:00:14.400> really<00:00:14.639> interested

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
Kickstarter thing I'm really interested

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660 
Kickstarter thing I'm really interested
in<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.379> new<00:00:16.410> lighting<00:00:16.890> technology<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
in this the new lighting technology and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
in this the new lighting technology and
and<00:00:17.789> these<00:00:18.180> are<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.690> little<00:00:18.900> LEDs<00:00:19.289> that

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and these are like little LEDs that

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.779 
and these are like little LEDs that
light<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:19.920> as<00:00:20.160> your<00:00:20.369> wheel<00:00:20.550> spins<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.119> sort<00:00:21.270> of

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.960 

there's<00:00:26.789> an<00:00:26.939> accelerometer<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.970> algorithm

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
there's an accelerometer and algorithm

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.900 
there's an accelerometer and algorithm
determines<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.630> LEDs<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.230> light<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.619> all

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
determines which LEDs to light up at all

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.569 
determines which LEDs to light up at all
and<00:00:33.559> it<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.860> kind<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> lights<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.430> your

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and it actually kind of lights up your

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:52.580 
and it actually kind of lights up your
path<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:41.000> facing<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.199> keeps<00:00:52.410> your

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
path so facing and and it keeps your

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
path so facing and and it keeps your
cockpit<00:00:52.860> clean<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:53.879> need<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> worry

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
cockpit clean you don't need to worry

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
cockpit clean you don't need to worry
about<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> does<00:00:58.280> like<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> remind<00:00:59.579> here

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
yes these fields do and the other big
thing<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:14.659> involving<00:01:15.659> cyclists

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
thing about it is involving cyclists

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.830 
thing about it is involving cyclists
happen<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:17.360> black<00:01:18.360> off<00:01:18.479> site<00:01:18.630> visibility

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
happen because black off site visibility

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.240 
happen because black off site visibility
because<00:01:19.320> no<00:01:19.500> light<00:01:19.650> headlights<00:01:19.920> or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
because no light headlights or

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
because no light headlights or
taillights<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.880> trying<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> fun<00:01:22.140> right<00:01:22.560> so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
taillights just trying to fun right so

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.320 
taillights just trying to fun right so
that's<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.790> you're<00:01:23.880> saying<00:01:24.060> side

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that's what you're saying side

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
that's what you're saying side
visibility<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> reflect<00:01:25.500> off

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
visibility so they kind of reflect off

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
visibility so they kind of reflect off
of<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.310> off<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> your<00:01:26.790> rim<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:27.360> fit<00:01:27.600> you
