- we use the stem of the plant and

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.550 
- we use the stem of the plant and
determine<00:00:32.210> according<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.110> vision<00:00:33.290> we

want small big as more like this whole
piece<00:00:37.130> we<00:00:37.340> have<00:00:37.520> here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
piece we have here

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.700 
piece we have here
Phyllis<00:00:40.610> Putin's<00:00:41.120> that<00:00:41.300> we<00:00:41.450> part<00:00:41.780> knife<00:00:42.260> like

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
Phyllis Putin's that we part knife like

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:58.270 
Phyllis Putin's that we part knife like
this

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.430 

see<00:00:58.910> here<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.210> came<00:00:59.510> back<00:00:59.780> strong<00:01:00.230> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
see here is a came back strong and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.040 
see here is a came back strong and
flexible<00:01:00.830> that's<00:01:01.700> why<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:01.970> ancient<00:01:02.540> Egyptian

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
flexible that's why the ancient Egyptian

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.710 
flexible that's why the ancient Egyptian
will<00:01:03.200> be<00:01:03.350> building<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:03.950> baskets<00:01:04.550> for<00:01:04.880> sandals

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
will be building in baskets for sandals

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.230 
will be building in baskets for sandals
and<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.260> reserved<00:01:06.560> seats<00:01:06.830> then<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:07.790> have<00:01:07.970> here

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
and the reserved seats then we have here

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.970 
and the reserved seats then we have here
is<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.420> inter<00:01:08.750> path<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.800> most

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
is the inter path and this is the most

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.770 
is the inter path and this is the most
important<00:01:10.640> part<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.150> make<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.510> sheet<00:01:11.660> of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
important part to make the sheet of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:22.110 
important part to make the sheet of
papyrus<00:01:11.870> who<00:01:12.800> does<00:01:13.040> it<00:01:13.190> into<00:01:13.520> slices<00:01:13.760> slices

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.080 

so<00:01:22.600> easy<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.230> create<00:01:23.380> why<00:01:23.860> because<00:01:24.850> it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
so easy to create why because it's

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.110 
so easy to create why because it's
continent<00:01:25.780> ml<00:01:26.080> sugar<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.920> water<00:01:27.130> that's<00:01:27.940> why

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
continent ml sugar and water that's why

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.480 
continent ml sugar and water that's why
we<00:01:28.450> roll<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.720> with<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:29.260> piece<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.710> food<00:01:29.920> to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
we roll it with this piece of food to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.580 
we roll it with this piece of food to
make<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.820> more<00:01:31.060> flexible<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.960> make<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.440> water

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
make it more flexible and make the water

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.920 
make it more flexible and make the water
coming<00:01:33.130> out<00:01:33.310> from<00:01:33.670> first-class<00:01:34.120> flights

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.420 

making<00:01:41.560> profits

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.219 

you<00:01:45.610> can<00:01:45.790> see<00:01:46.000> here<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.420> without<00:01:46.689> coming<00:01:47.049> out

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
you can see here so without coming out

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.100 
you can see here so without coming out
from<00:01:47.530> supplies<00:01:47.979> this<00:01:48.549> disguise<00:01:49.060> became<00:01:49.659> more

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
from supplies this disguise became more

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.139 
from supplies this disguise became more
strong<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.770> more<00:01:50.920> flexible<00:01:51.759> you<00:01:52.119> have

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
strong and more flexible you have

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.179 
strong and more flexible you have
olivine<00:01:52.869> without<00:01:53.170> any<00:01:53.439> breaking<00:01:53.920> it's<00:01:54.100> a

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
olivine without any breaking it's a

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.210 
olivine without any breaking it's a
slice<00:01:54.490> after<00:01:55.270> this<00:01:55.689> we'll<00:01:55.869> put<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.409> butyl

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
slice after this we'll put it in a butyl

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.969 
slice after this we'll put it in a butyl
for<00:01:57.460> six<00:01:57.880> days<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.170> solid<00:01:59.350> sheet<00:01:59.770> like

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
for six days to get solid sheet like

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.999 
for six days to get solid sheet like
this<00:02:00.009> one<00:02:00.630> after<00:02:01.630> another<00:02:01.659> full<00:02:02.380> days<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.740> get

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
this one after another full days to get

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.740 
this one after another full days to get
the<00:02:03.189> dark<00:02:03.399> up<00:02:03.610> she's<00:02:03.850> like<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.329> one

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the dark up she's like this one

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.169 
the dark up she's like this one
it's<00:02:05.439> move<00:02:05.679> darker<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.340> darker<00:02:06.490> in<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.030> water

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
it's move darker and darker in the water

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.389 
it's move darker and darker in the water
because<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.869> sugar<00:02:08.080> means<00:02:08.560> in<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.920> pipe

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
because of the sugar means in the pipe

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.790 
because of the sugar means in the pipe
it's<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:09.940> leaving<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.539> novel<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.290> or<00:02:11.470> betrayal

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
it's like leaving a novel in or betrayal

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's like leaving a novel in or betrayal
after<00:02:12.190> many<00:02:12.640> days<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.060> will<00:02:13.239> start<00:02:13.510> burning

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
after many days it will start burning

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.070 
after many days it will start burning
right<00:02:13.989> in<00:02:14.769> after<00:02:15.340> six<00:02:15.760> days<00:02:15.940> I'd<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.840> go<00:02:17.019> to

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
right in after six days I'd like I go to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.280 
right in after six days I'd like I go to
you<00:02:17.290> how<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.650> slices<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:20.140> you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
you how the slices like this if you

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.870 
you how the slices like this if you
touch<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.560> you'll<00:02:20.860> fun<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.519> sticky

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
touch it you'll fun it's so sticky

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:35.080 
touch it you'll fun it's so sticky
because<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.420> crushed<00:02:22.630> sugar<00:02:22.750> needs

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.000 

we'll<00:02:35.390> put<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.930> slices<00:02:36.380> between<00:02:36.740> do

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
we'll put it the slices between do

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.550 
we'll put it the slices between do
business<00:02:37.460> limit<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.210> this<00:02:38.420> investigate<00:02:39.350> and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
business limit like this investigate and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.560 
business limit like this investigate and
within<00:02:39.980> two<00:02:40.160> months<00:02:40.340> until<00:02:40.700> we<00:02:41.210> have<00:02:41.390> the
