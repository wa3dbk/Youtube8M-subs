00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.469
 One more episode of iran ahead but here 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.170

 we are here total mike curry that we 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.919
 old boss entered the troll nor did I 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.749
 other everything both in the aspect as in the 15 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.749
 that's exactly what we're going to talk about 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.800
 attacked know that it is possible here 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.170
 job back or not I do not know if 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 I'm really high up, because I 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.630
 honestly I've never trained a 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.150
 series or the reason I never gave you and 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.920
 I never played it basically I do not know 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.260
 if things really changed all the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.030
 shadows some but anyway anything 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.810
 Do you think the comments perceive 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.090
 also ok it is basically that i 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.370
 I 'm always going to kill the enemy. 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.100
 no one arrives at an enemy unit and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.609
 will not buy 2 percent of life 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.009
 the maximum of that enemy who killed him and 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.679
 touched can be a trumpet killed or 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.020
 simply can have a mpt or 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.689
 where she can kill a boy and I 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 I got my life back 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.069
 speaking now of the first time the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.439
 throne or what is a bite that 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.719
 basically we 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.409
 the next one is taking care of the bank more 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.490
 normal and for eight second place in 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.649
 plus 40 thematic attack is 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.560
 calm according to the enemy who bit him 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.810
 will power anointed of health or be people 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.759
 who wins 40 of tactically will not 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.090
 lose 20 from attacking and lying during 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.909
 these eight shield 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.890
 to heal the accounts that the plan is the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.200
 largest file I've created, but 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.810
 come the ability that the day I 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.539
 I had but I created a zone of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.200
 dilates large areas - so when 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.409
 back within that zone she earns 30% 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.149
 in the spiritist movement 50% of the tax calls 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.730
 gains 14% of life reversal of all 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.709
 forms as well as all sources 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.830
 There are times when we are filled with life. 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.930
 or even the style or tension of the river 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.989
 or even an ally who owed them 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:28.290
 inside this area's games will give 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.519
 14% more health than normal 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.310
 adds that traffic is also well 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.670
 not like the aunt who lives here 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.000
 so I made a wall and they had small 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.220
 so that it is possible to pass or 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.890
 want to until it will turn around 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.200
 it has basically control it and 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.040
 how many are in that area 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.420
 wall that gives 35% islam to all and mix 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.060
 of course the last stage of work is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.090
 a bit complicated to explain basically 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.620
 I select the enemy and what they are going to do 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.660
 base that would suck your 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.290
 Let's just say that skills will not 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.109
 get the maximum life of this center 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.069
 enemy will be able to take 20% of 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:17.049
 her weapon and 20% of mexico are you 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.540
 can expect that the court is 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.630
 getting bigger is and I imagine there is 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.000
 love and and the supposedly more hp come and 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.120
 try to increase only it ran full hp 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.609
 for five seconds or is the bank 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.989
 world will get going gets 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.069
 strongest of 5 and xix where they pass 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.169
 for another five seconds she goes 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.940
 decrease our already the stadium are going 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:43.640
 gradually decreasing 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.740
 and this is smart staff as explained 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.440
 here 's the training thing I think the 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.840
 vitor march that you like the river and 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.460
 which was good at the end of the auction 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.840
 We always need the mall. 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.430
 because he brought Israel as well as 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.040
 My voice is a little strange because 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.080
 I may be there, I've just been swallowed. 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.150
 wake up also does not want to record the video 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.770
 the faster you whistle 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.690
 anything you have explained to the 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.970
 please leave it in the comments here 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.580
 for everyone to know and strive to correct 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.950
 also over notes and in the video with the 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.049
 correction okay you can have some 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.120
 thing and I feel that of the total 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.490
 bad bounce because the limit again 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.980
 never diminishes the champagne and sometimes I know 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.070
 there may be some mistake on my part 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.870
 but in particular creates great so I go to 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.000
 everyone who watched the video did not 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.650
 Forget to evaluate congost conflict that 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.470
 really help a lot with the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.570
 promotion here on the channel 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.040
 Another thing to thank is that it's right. 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.660
 if it were not for it, it will not be able to 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.190
 because you need two people 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.400
 to a room and everything else 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.990
 here in the pv is a saint who used to quote and 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.230
 tried to avoid creating new accounts 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.630
 so if you want to look 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.060
 search because the first few are 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.190
 days ago was affecting the creation 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.020
 new accounts so much research that it should 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.580
 to be right for a while 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.500
 fast ok 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.850
 I also wanted to thank the poles leave 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.570
 to disclose what will happen to them 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.390
 ever 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.610
 We are great friends of mine and anyway. 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:18.840
 Thank you, my God, you guys. 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:22.949
 A hug and it 's the next I went. 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.570
 you are always a gradual thing of neo 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.830
 graphic chemistry then what I go 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.380
 let it pass now 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.639
 first a tropical country honey, I'm not 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.990
 I think so but what I wanted to talk m 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.090
 cell dodo but in the original in 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.130
 principle of each other - in the other 15 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.110
 that I had old so if not 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.449
 have given the fan but couple has 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.340
 I'll leave the clips that the 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.970
 obstacles that remained in the other 15 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.330
 fall 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.330
 went
