00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 one of the most anticipated championship games 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.540
 gathered in this frosty evening almost 10 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.639
 Thousands of fans standoff Russia 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.740
 and sweden began with careful action 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.389
 both teams of the first minute start half 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.190
 national team eyeing each other 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.139
 while doing an introductory 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.310
 excursions opponent's penalty area and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.050
 so it went on the family without seen half 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 thunder of applause and stadium labor exploded on 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 22 minute meeting the first ball in this 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.859
 meeting scored Alan Dzhioev seemingly 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.929
 here it is the happiness of Russia ahead 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.000
 however almost immediately after coming forward 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.559
 native pretend rush of emotion removal up 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.030
 end of the game earns Alex 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.750
 Darovskys our team stayed 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.750
 minority 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.539
 the swedish national team is ready for 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.370
 the attack on the black gate of the novel 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.260
 resulting in defense of acting 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.329
 world champions quivered for the final 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.519
 minute of the first half goal locker room 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.370
 1 food for thought at the break 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.070
 Our prefab created Juhan Lion booth but also 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.780
 a respite did not help at 51 minutes russia 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.579
 again misses the beginning of the second 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.189
 halftime translated our franc catching up 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.110
 teams only after 75 minutes from 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.970
 start the game and protracted as well as ours 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.100
 players at the gates of sweden captain 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.479
 Russian national team Sergey Lamanov succeeded 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.479
 to return the intrigue of the meeting again 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.650
 22 and the whole stadium stopped waiting 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.540
 how will the remaining time of the meeting be she 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.490
 in the best traditions of principle meetings 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.350
 passed in a stubborn fight on equal terms 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.390
 although up from within the entire game time 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.490
 More score and failed to anybody and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.020
 here it is the rarest of events today 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.509
 post-match hockey 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.550
 penalty first to the point go the Swedes 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.650
 whistle swing and the ball is repulsed by our 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.690
 the goalkeeper continues to score our team 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.369
 after a few more head kicks and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.409
 misses the winning team to 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.119
 general jubilation becomes the national team 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.950
 Russian machine can be 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.539
 I repeat I liked it a lot 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.220
 interesting moments from both sides and 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.210
 although I had a lot of goals 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.720
 boring 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.580
 call well I think what is it mashed 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.330
 probably the result is logical although each 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.880
 the team probably had the right to say that 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.730
 Today we were worthy again, Victor 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.180
 so the cuff is naturally grievous even 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.280
 a game I think it was just 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.440
 great match we showed very 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.720
 good speed at halftime 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.850
 in the second half, the game was enough 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.250
 well we tried to prove ourselves in 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.620
 full this year our team 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.960
 so many newbies and when they play 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.340
 at home they can not get 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.020
 such game experience as in the championship 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.310
 today both teams play their 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.380
 urine for reaching the semifinals of the championship 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.390
 our squad will play with 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.550
 Canada and Sweden with the national team of Belarus
