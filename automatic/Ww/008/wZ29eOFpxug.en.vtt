but doing this is a good way to keep
your<00:01:48.120> fruit<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.900> is<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> live

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
because the high sugar content the high

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.430 
because the high sugar content the high
alcohol<00:01:54.480> content<00:01:54.840> they're<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.320> keep

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.900 
the fridge but you know traditionally
this<00:05:32.720> is<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.930> way<00:05:33.140> of<00:05:33.170> preserving<00:05:33.560> food<00:05:34.070> so<00:05:34.880> I

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
this is a way of preserving food so I

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.490 
this is a way of preserving food so I
probably<00:05:35.630> okay<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.170> put<00:05:36.410> in<00:05:36.560> your<00:05:38.350> you<00:05:39.350> know

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
probably okay to put in your you know

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.190 
probably okay to put in your you know
pantry<00:05:39.950> your<00:05:40.100> root<00:05:40.280> cellar<00:05:40.310> someplace<00:05:41.060> cool

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
pantry your root cellar someplace cool

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.980 
pantry your root cellar someplace cool
I've<00:05:43.040> keep<00:05:43.670> my<00:05:43.850> brandied<00:05:44.420> apples<00:05:44.510> in<00:05:44.900> the

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
I've keep my brandied apples in the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.720 
I've keep my brandied apples in the
fridge<00:05:45.020> just<00:05:45.500> because<00:05:45.890> I'm<00:05:46.100> paranoid<00:05:46.310> that

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
fridge just because I'm paranoid that

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.660 
fridge just because I'm paranoid that
way<00:05:46.880> but<00:05:47.540> we're<00:05:48.440> going<00:05:48.890> to<00:05:48.950> cool<00:05:49.100> down<00:05:49.280> we're

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
way but we're going to cool down we're

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.390 
way but we're going to cool down we're
gonna<00:05:49.760> stick<00:05:50.030> them<00:05:50.090> in<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.270> fridge

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
gonna stick them in the fridge

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.830 
gonna stick them in the fridge
theoretically<00:05:52.400> you<00:05:53.090> know<00:05:53.270> everything's

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
theoretically you know everything's

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.600 
theoretically you know everything's
cooked<00:05:54.050> you<00:05:54.230> could<00:05:54.410> eat<00:05:54.530> it<00:05:54.650> now<00:05:54.800> but<00:05:55.460> it's

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
cooked you could eat it now but it's

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.250 
cooked you could eat it now but it's
gonna<00:05:55.790> taste<00:05:56.090> like<00:05:56.390> alcohol

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
gonna taste like alcohol

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.520 
gonna taste like alcohol
you<00:05:57.830> know<00:05:57.950> sugary<00:05:58.340> alcohol<00:05:59.230> after<00:06:00.230> a<00:06:00.260> month

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
you know sugary alcohol after a month

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.530 
you know sugary alcohol after a month
you<00:06:00.830> know<00:06:01.310> flavors<00:06:01.820> will<00:06:01.970> start<00:06:02.210> to<00:06:02.330> develop

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
you know flavors will start to develop

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.140 
you know flavors will start to develop
that'll<00:06:02.960> probably<00:06:03.140> be<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.620> best<00:06:03.970> after<00:06:04.970> two

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
that'll probably be the best after two

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.910 
that'll probably be the best after two
months<00:06:05.540> you<00:06:05.570> know<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:05.960> longer<00:06:06.290> you<00:06:06.440> wait<00:06:06.620> the

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
months you know the longer you wait the

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.150 
months you know the longer you wait the

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
and the less just you know alcohol

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.160 
and the less just you know alcohol
tastes<00:06:13.340> that<00:06:13.490> you're<00:06:13.640> gonna<00:06:13.760> get<00:06:14.000> so<00:06:14.780> anyway
