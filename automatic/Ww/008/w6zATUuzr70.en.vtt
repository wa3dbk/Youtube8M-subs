00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
little walkthrough on the new DLC maps

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.720 
little walkthrough on the new DLC maps
that<00:00:31.230> came<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.930> Xbox<00:00:33.930> 360<00:00:34.620> elite<00:00:35.190> members

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that came up for Xbox 360 elite members

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.610 
that came up for Xbox 360 elite members
only<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:36.989> only<00:00:37.940> face<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.149> maps<00:00:39.620> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
only and these are only face off maps so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.190 
only and these are only face off maps so
that<00:00:40.649> means<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.520> only<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.120> V<00:00:42.450> 1<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.899> V<00:00:42.930> 2

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that means it's only for one V 1 to V 2

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.470 
that means it's only for one V 1 to V 2
and<00:00:43.410> 3<00:00:43.680> V<00:00:43.829> 3<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.120> map<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.360> called

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and 3 V 3 and this map is called

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
and 3 V 3 and this map is called
intersection<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.010> pretty<00:00:47.219> cool<00:00:47.309> map

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
intersection and it's a pretty cool map

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.250 
intersection and it's a pretty cool map
so<00:00:48.000> far<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.270> think<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.600> my<00:00:48.780> favorite<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so far I think it's my favorite one I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.130 
so far I think it's my favorite one I
really<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> design<00:00:51.899> of

right<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.680> corner<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
right there that corner and the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
right there that corner and the
basketball<00:00:57.090> court<00:00:57.420> already<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.680> tips<00:00:58.920> for

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
basketball court already some tips for

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.599 
basketball court already some tips for
you<00:00:59.160> guys

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
you guys

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.020 
you guys
that<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> spawn<00:01:00.660> area<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> key

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that is a spawn area and I think the key

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.630 
that is a spawn area and I think the key
of<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.359> map<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.710> floor<00:01:05.129> here

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
of this map is on this floor here

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.789 
of this map is on this floor here
because<00:01:06.299> you're<00:01:06.510> pretty<00:01:06.750> much<00:01:06.960> able<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> watch

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
because you're pretty much able to watch

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.660 
because you're pretty much able to watch
pretty<00:01:08.760> much<00:01:08.909> everywhere<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> map<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.310> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
pretty much everywhere on the map and I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.840 
pretty much everywhere on the map and I
remember<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> play<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:13.049> time

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
remember when I play the first time

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.670 
remember when I play the first time
which<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:14.880> capture<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> flag<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
which was capture the flag and this is a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
which was capture the flag and this is a
new<00:01:17.040> game<00:01:17.250> mode<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.150> put<00:01:18.450> on

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
new game mode that I think that I put on

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.560 
new game mode that I think that I put on
face<00:01:18.869> off<00:01:19.049> maps<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> was<00:01:21.299> playing

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
face off maps and when I was playing

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.340 
face off maps and when I was playing
capture<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> flag

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
capture the flag

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.670 
capture the flag
I<00:01:23.240> found<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> mistaking<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.990> didn't<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I found that mistaking I didn't go and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
I found that mistaking I didn't go and
check<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.340> Teeter<00:01:26.640> mode<00:01:26.939> back<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.930> my

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
check out on my Teeter mode back on my

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.700 
check out on my Teeter mode back on my
fault<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:29.720> believe<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:31.020> probably<00:01:31.470> like

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
fault but I believe I was probably like

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.999 
fault but I believe I was probably like
4<00:01:32.070> off<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.729> ammo<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.920> don't<00:01:34.920> know

because<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.700> map<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.180> ridiculous

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
because this map is ridiculous

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.640 
because this map is ridiculous
ridiculous<00:02:15.450> but<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.870> really<00:02:17.320> what<00:02:17.620> really

ridiculous but it's really what really
small<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:19.020> okay<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.760> when<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> first<00:02:22.240> download

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
small like okay so when I first download

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.440 
small like okay so when I first download
the<00:02:23.200> map<00:02:23.380> content<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:24.100> actually<00:02:25.060> thought<00:02:25.390> that

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
the map content I actually thought that

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.010 
the map content I actually thought that
you<00:02:25.780> know<00:02:25.930> there<00:02:26.170> was<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.650> was<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.780> face<00:02:28.780> off

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020
