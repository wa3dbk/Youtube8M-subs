the water feed to run through the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.230 
the water feed to run through the
machine<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> machine<00:01:34.680> takes<00:01:34.890> 12<00:01:35.850> liters<00:01:36.180> of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
and then back to one again we'll see it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.970 
and then back to one again we'll see it
will<00:02:31.840> come<00:02:32.020> up<00:02:32.050> any<00:02:32.290> room<00:02:32.470> now<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:32.680> we've

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
will come up any room now because we've

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.610 
will come up any room now because we've
already<00:02:33.130> pre<00:02:33.870> pre<00:02:34.870> filled<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.170> water<00:02:35.320> anyway

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
already pre pre filled the water anyway

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:53.880 
already pre pre filled the water anyway
for<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.280> demonstration

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.320 

as<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.100> can<00:02:55.190> see<00:02:55.370> now<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.580> pumpers<00:02:56.000> come<00:02:56.180> off

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
as you can see now the pumpers come off

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.360 
as you can see now the pumpers come off
the<00:02:56.959> lights<00:02:57.170> are<00:02:57.410> off<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:57.950> means<00:02:58.220> your

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the lights are off so that means your

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.100 
the lights are off so that means your
boiler<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.730> full<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.360> can<00:02:59.390> now<00:02:59.690> turn<00:02:59.750> the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
boiler is full you can now turn the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.530 
boiler is full you can now turn the
machine<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.530> number<00:03:00.740> two<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.240> will<00:03:02.330> start

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
machine to number two and it will start

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.720 
machine to number two and it will start
to<00:03:02.600> heat<00:03:02.750> for<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.709> will<00:03:03.830> heat<00:03:04.520> up<00:03:04.550> to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
to heat for you and it will heat up to

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.550 
to heat for you and it will heat up to
temperature<00:03:05.120> once<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.750> gets<00:03:05.870> up<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.050> your

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
temperature once it gets up to your

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.900 
temperature once it gets up to your
desired<00:03:06.890> temperature<00:03:07.400> here<00:03:07.640> which<00:03:07.790> is

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
desired temperature here which is

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.850 
desired temperature here which is
normally<00:03:08.240> point<00:03:08.570> nine<00:03:08.750> or<00:03:08.959> one<00:03:09.110> bar<00:03:09.320> depending

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
normally point nine or one bar depending

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.440 
normally point nine or one bar depending
when<00:03:10.160> you've<00:03:10.280> you've<00:03:10.790> had<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> machine<00:03:11.270> set

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
when you've you've had the machine set

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.030 
when you've you've had the machine set
for<00:03:11.630> you're<00:03:12.080> ready<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.380> be<00:03:12.470> under<00:03:12.650> steam<00:03:12.860> do

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
for you're ready to be under steam do

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.850 
for you're ready to be under steam do
extractions<00:03:13.750> as<00:03:14.750> as<00:03:14.900> simple<00:03:14.990> as<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.320> so

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860

mains water you have a connection kit
like<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.600> much<00:03:20.720> goes<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.110> mains<00:03:21.440> water<00:03:21.590> tap

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
like so much goes to the mains water tap

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.860 
like so much goes to the mains water tap
