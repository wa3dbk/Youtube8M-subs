00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
pressure game that they play and it's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
pressure game that they play and it's
not<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.850> cold<00:01:45.119> cannot<00:01:45.540> handle<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:45.990> cold

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
not that cold cannot handle that cold

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.050 
not that cold cannot handle that cold
can<00:01:46.680> handle<00:01:46.920> himself<00:01:47.130> very<00:01:47.549> well<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.939> his

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
can handle himself very well with his

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.960 
can handle himself very well with his
dribbling<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> his<00:01:48.960> speeds<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
dribbling and his speeds but it's it the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
dribbling and his speeds but it's it the
teammates<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> team<00:01:52.680> pressure<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
teammates like when the team pressure is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.039 
teammates like when the team pressure is
on<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.850> teammates<00:01:54.360> act<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.500> amateurs<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
on the teammates act like amateurs and

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.929 
on the teammates act like amateurs and
they<00:01:58.049> make<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.530> bad<00:01:58.799> passes<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.549> their

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
they make really bad passes and their

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.719 
they make really bad passes and their
decision-making<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.990> completely<00:02:01.710> flawed<00:02:01.979> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
decision-making is completely flawed so

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
decision-making is completely flawed so
that<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.149> my<00:02:03.299> problem<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.320> was

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that is my problem with that so this was

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.260 
that is my problem with that so this was
definitely<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.130> issue<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.790> match<00:02:06.000> but

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
definitely the issue in this match but

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.240 
definitely the issue in this match but
you're<00:02:06.390> probably<00:02:06.509> wondering<00:02:07.079> what's<00:02:07.770> with

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you're probably wondering what's with

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
you're probably wondering what's with
the<00:02:08.640> title<00:02:09.119> good<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> episode<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.259> like

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the title good of the episode is like

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040 
the title good of the episode is like
kind<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.129> bizarre<00:02:11.550> well<00:02:12.060> basically<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.840> stuff

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
kind of bizarre well basically the stuff

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.970 
kind of bizarre well basically the stuff
I<00:02:13.170> said<00:02:13.410> at<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
I said at the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.240 
I said at the
the<00:02:14.190> episode<00:02:14.550> with<00:02:15.170> me<00:02:16.170> wanting<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> switch<00:02:16.950> my

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the episode with me wanting to switch my

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.890 
the episode with me wanting to switch my
network<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.760> being<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.209> frustrated<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
network and being all frustrated and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.360 
network and being all frustrated and
it's<00:02:19.709> affecting<00:02:20.489> my<00:02:20.670> actual<00:02:21.209> schedule<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
it's affecting my actual schedule and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.440 
it's affecting my actual schedule and
you<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.640> think<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:23.970> cold<00:02:24.209> situation

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
you have to think of cold situation

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.020 
you have to think of cold situation
because<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.890> even<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.760> delay

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
because we are so even with this delay

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.570 
because we are so even with this delay
the<00:02:27.239> five-day<00:02:27.750> delay<00:02:28.049> now<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.319> want<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.519> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the five-day delay now we want to go to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.580 
the five-day delay now we want to go to
a<00:02:29.700> bigger<00:02:29.970> club<00:02:30.239> even<00:02:30.750> though<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.110> series<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
a bigger club even though the series of

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.990 
a bigger club even though the series of
might<00:02:31.739> be<00:02:31.890> ending<00:02:32.160> prematurely<00:02:32.730> which

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
might be ending prematurely which

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.550 
might be ending prematurely which
definitely<00:02:33.390> will<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:33.810> an<00:02:33.900> agreement<00:02:34.080> surely

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
definitely will be an agreement surely

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.030 
definitely will be an agreement surely
actually<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.489> we<00:02:36.330> want<00:02:36.660> cold<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.230> go<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
actually but we want cold to go to a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.830 
actually but we want cold to go to a
different<00:02:38.190> team<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.640> actually<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:39.450> Europe

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
different team to actually be in Europe

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.069 
different team to actually be in Europe
when<00:02:40.200> he<00:02:40.530> when<00:02:41.519> his<00:02:41.730> career<00:02:42.060> will<00:02:42.269> end<00:02:42.299> however

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
when he when his career will end however

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.780 
when he when his career will end however
way<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.860> maybe<00:02:44.040> look<00:02:44.370> at<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.610> mess

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
way that maybe look at that mess

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.569 
way that maybe look at that mess
amazingly<00:02:45.450> spike<00:02:45.780> holes<00:02:45.989> there<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.590> um<00:02:46.799> and

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
amazingly spike holes there but um and

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.069 
amazingly spike holes there but um and
then<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.819> think<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.120> my<00:02:48.269> situation<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.810> I

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
then you think of my situation so I

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.610 
then you think of my situation so I
think<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:49.769> kind<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:51.780> similar<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.290> can

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
think we are kind of like similar I can

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.080 
think we are kind of like similar I can
definitely<00:02:52.920> we<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.430> definitely<00:02:53.640> relate<00:02:53.940> to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
definitely we can definitely relate to

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.710 
definitely we can definitely relate to
each<00:02:54.390> other

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
each other

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.199 
each other
Colon's<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.530> course<00:02:55.769> just<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> character<00:02:57.000> and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
Colon's of course just the character and

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.509 
Colon's of course just the character and
look<00:02:57.390> at<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.599> chance<00:02:57.840> by<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.049> way<00:02:58.260> make<00:02:59.190> shot

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
look at this chance by the way make shot

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.729 
look at this chance by the way make shot
outside<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.209> crosses<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.170> cool<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.560> there
