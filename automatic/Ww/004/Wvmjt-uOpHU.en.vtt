00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.380
 little bit more complicated thank you for the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.610
 silence he recipes a little bit for a 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.070
 little more complicated therefore a pina colada 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:35.880
 for the pina colada we will have to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:38.500
 pineapple juice and coconut milk 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.940
 to do well you need a mixer 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 if you do not have a mixer it's not 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.320
 serious you will put all in the green one 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.320
 will happen but ideally a mixer 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:03:00.400
 pina colada you need 12 cents 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:05.350
 pineapple juice they are there you need 400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.580
 tigers of coconut juice 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.360
 the 4 cents must be added some 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.670
 ice cubes and of course always 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.900
 their men since this is the basis of 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.900
 care next no more 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 it's already not bad I think we're going 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 close to avoid damage 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.570
 this will be served in this type of glass 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.110
 obviously for it to be 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:55.940

00:03:48.110 --> 00:04:00.500
 deco we will take to the vallasse in 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:06.710
 which one will cut a neighborhood like 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:13.910

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:16.660
 dark edge of the glass we will pour 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.660

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:58.490

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:04.070
 in cane sugar syrup in the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:14.570

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.760
 cane sugar 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:53.760
 not too much cane sugar syrup a 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:06:02.590
 Docks and therefore lime 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:06.900
 lime to compress directly 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:10.990
 in the shaker then a lime 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:14.550
 full half a lemon points to 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:22.330
 the second piece almost of this summit 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:24.880

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.170
 have a nice shot of brilliance are the 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.570
 ice cubes 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:36.040
 it will not be necessary to let melt in the 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:39.210
 shaker say we're going to position them a 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.210

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.080
 imagine you quickly and we pour 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.880
 instantly in the rules it takes 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:55.390
 not just ice cubes and time 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:56.850
 to melt it comes inevitably and the juice 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.100
 of lemon 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:03.150
 we can embellish all and coppel with 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:07.600
 decoration, ie a small breakdown 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:10.450
