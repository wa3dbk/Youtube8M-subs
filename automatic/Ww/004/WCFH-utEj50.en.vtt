 let's cut into squares 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.860
 We are going to use 5 tablespoons of mayonnaise and 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.610
 We are going to use 2 tablespoons of mustard 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.260

 use and so let's move on to what 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.610
 follow the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.040
 put a pot with water so that this 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.750
 boil and then we will cook the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.660
 coditos so we're going to turn on the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.090
 stove and this we are going to cover it so that 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.310
 boil soon good here we have the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.120
 boiling water so let's add 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 our paste of squares 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.710
 let's leave for 10 minutes to 12 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.710
 minutes to cook 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.170
 and we are going to add a little salt 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.150
 that is to your taste not much good 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.790
 we are going to cover this so that it cooks 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.030
 faster and we're going to leave it there 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.550
 good time have passed 10 minutes and this 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.039
 it's already cooked so we're going to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.989
 remove 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.090

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.909
 drain and let's wait for it to cool 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.019
 a little bit so we can do what 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.340

 drainer to drain very well and 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.900
 we're going to leave it for about 20 minutes 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.489
 so that it gets cold and then we go 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.739
