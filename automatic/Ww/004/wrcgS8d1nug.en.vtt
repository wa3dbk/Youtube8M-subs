00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello youtube friends how are you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.230
 Once again his friend talks to him the xperia 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.389
 well then bringing this application 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.580
 pretty pretty good that good 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.769
 had brought an application that is from dj 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.020
 in this case, well, let's go 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.340
 know her 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.340
 I want to share with you all 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.010
 and proceed to install the remember 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.090
 just download and install it that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.660
 is this application like that is called 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.340
 we open it and it will not give us this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.390
 interface that the truth is is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.640
 simple but very complete yes and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.950
 well what are we going to proceed to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.989
 to do is to know a little bit of this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.660
 application the truth no I'm not very 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.210
 fanatic of this being dj but for the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.480
 that it is highly recommended works 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.750
 for tablets that for many is something like 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.220
 like a miracle or something like that 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 Well, let's go to the simplest 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.759
 the basics here is what is this the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 low volume equalizer and media 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.960
 treble ok and most importantly for a dj 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 are the effects that it has has 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 enough effects 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.890
 and the truth is very father now you 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.020
 let's put a song and another thing is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.020
 who has this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.350
 have 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.840
 you can search your files 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.450
 or all your music in the most 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
 easier than you can imagine because 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.740
 others have that but they fail a lot 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.140
 close and so on 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.810
 ok here we have the auto mix the auto mix 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.080
 it serves so that you put not be a folder 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.650
 of your favorite music and alone it goes 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.810
 mixing 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.310
 and well, here we have what is the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.900
 master volume control we can 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.880
 upload the volume more here also what 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.010
 we can go up a bit more to the volume if 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.810
 they want clear to l'aquila this one 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.430
 this is something very important since 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.650
 many are interested in recording their their 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.260
 mixtures then here we have this one of 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.500
 record has a great capacity I think 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.380
 who records this equal 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.880
 the same byte speed is recorded 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.910
 as if it were the same song 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.040
 the copy as is and you hear very very 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.400
 all right 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.050
 and good as this truth is 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 very nice 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.330
 now let's see this let's put a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.050
 song in fact I have it connected to 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.890
 me to my stereo 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:50.270
 and we're going to try and see how 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:55.280
 such is there is how they see the xperia zl 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.780
 and then let's see that this is going to 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.210
 put this song only to try 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.770
 done here have here we can do 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.650
 we lower this the speed of 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.909
 accommodate the track 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.909
 and then let's try it 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.950
 in fact there he is playing 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.200
 and also 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:37.140
 the truth works very well this 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.140
 let's put him with just making him more 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.930
 see 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.540
 we see 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.830
 are you working and now we are going to 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.670
 to try this 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.870
 the fx 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.870
 what I tell you are the 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.370
 are the effects 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.650
 what's wrong with it 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.370
 and it was if the truth is an application 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.370
