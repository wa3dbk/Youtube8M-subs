wires into your doors you use the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.180 
wires into your doors you use the
factory<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.529> don't<00:00:16.529> know<00:00:16.590> if<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.890> see<00:00:17.039> that

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
factory I don't know if you can see that

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.490 
factory I don't know if you can see that
use<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.880> factory<00:00:18.300> spot<00:00:18.930> where<00:00:19.109> they<00:00:19.199> run<00:00:19.320> all

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
use the factory spot where they run all

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500 
use the factory spot where they run all
the<00:00:19.590> wires<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.760> run<00:00:20.910> your<00:00:21.029> speaker<00:00:21.330> wires

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the wires you run your speaker wires

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.230 
the wires you run your speaker wires
through<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.920> way<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.670> looks<00:00:23.850> nice<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
through there that way it looks nice and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.179 
through there that way it looks nice and
clean<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:25.410> even<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.769> speaker

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
clean you don't even see the speaker

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.759 
clean you don't even see the speaker
wires<00:00:27.859> and<00:00:29.660> because<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.840> takes<00:00:31.050> two<00:00:31.260> hands<00:00:31.560> I'm

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
wires and because it takes two hands I'm

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.170 
wires and because it takes two hands I'm
not<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:32.070> able<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> record<00:00:32.520> doing<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.120> I'll

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
not be able to record doing it so I'll

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.690 
not be able to record doing it so I'll
just<00:00:33.329> tell<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:34.370> you're<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> use

see that the truck side the body side
take<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:27.259> fish<00:01:27.500> tube<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.360> fish<00:01:29.600> it

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
take this fish tube and you fish it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.380 
take this fish tube and you fish it
through<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:33.079> goes<00:01:33.259> through<00:01:37.390> that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
through so that it goes through that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.499 
through so that it goes through that
into<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.170> door<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.679> you<00:01:40.340> leave<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.520> hanging

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
into the door and you leave it hanging

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.820 
into the door and you leave it hanging
in<00:01:41.720> there<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.960> might<00:01:42.110> want<00:01:42.289> to<00:01:42.350> spray<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.649> with

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
in there you might want to spray it with

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.559 
in there you might want to spray it with
some<00:01:42.979> wd-40<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:43.819> it<00:01:43.880> slides<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.360> rubber

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
some wd-40 so it slides on the rubber

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.350 
some wd-40 so it slides on the rubber
easier<00:01:44.959> spray<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.009> down<00:01:46.130> with<00:01:46.190> some<00:01:46.340> wd-40<00:01:47.060> it

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
easier spray it down with some wd-40 it

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.350 
easier spray it down with some wd-40 it
works<00:01:47.569> really<00:01:47.810> well<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.819> then<00:01:49.819> you<00:01:49.909> stick<00:01:50.179> it

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
works really well and then you stick it

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.690 
works really well and then you stick it
through<00:01:52.179> there<00:01:53.950> you've<00:01:54.950> got<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.130> work<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:55.520> to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
through there you've got to work it to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.419 
through there you've got to work it to
get<00:01:55.849> through<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.869> since<00:01:57.229> it's<00:01:57.439> bent<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.369> a

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
get through that since it's bent in a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.029 
get through that since it's bent in a
couple<00:01:58.729> directions<00:01:59.149> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.709> stick<00:02:00.920> it

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
couple directions and then you stick it

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.330 
couple directions and then you stick it
through<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.479> door<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.500> you've<00:02:03.709> got<00:02:03.950> some

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
through to the door so you've got some

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.949 
through to the door so you've got some
sticking<00:02:04.670> out<00:02:04.909> on<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.270> inside<00:02:05.569> of<00:02:05.599> the<00:02:05.750> truck

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
sticking out on the inside of the truck

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.240 
sticking out on the inside of the truck
and<00:02:06.170> sticking<00:02:06.470> out<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.830> inside<00:02:07.099> of<00:02:07.189> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
and sticking out on the inside of the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.069 
and sticking out on the inside of the
door<00:02:07.450> then<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:10.759> just<00:02:10.940> run<00:02:11.120> your<00:02:11.239> speaker<00:02:11.630> wire

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.509 

right<00:02:15.079> through<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.709> while<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.130> hanging<00:02:16.310> in

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
right through it while it's hanging in

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.580 
right through it while it's hanging in
there<00:02:17.320> put<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:20.140> fish<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.290> all<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> way

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
there put it in fish it all the way

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.870 
there put it in fish it all the way
through<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.250> push<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.609> all<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.730> way<00:02:22.820> through

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
through just push it all the way through

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.130 
through just push it all the way through
it'll<00:02:23.359> slide<00:02:23.540> real<00:02:23.720> nicely

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
it'll slide real nicely
