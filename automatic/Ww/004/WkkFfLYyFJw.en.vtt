00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.930 
deep conditioned so I really believe
that<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:54.080> is<00:03:54.260> why<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.500> have<00:03:54.980> never<00:03:55.370> had<00:03:55.910> a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
that that is why I have never had a

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.780

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
was relaxed yeah part of it is because I

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.810
