00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.209 

there<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.090> two<00:00:12.330> questions<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.380> asked<00:00:14.040> all

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
there are two questions we get asked all

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.970 
there are two questions we get asked all
the<00:00:15.000> time<00:00:15.210> come<00:00:15.660> extracting<00:00:16.289> season<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the time come extracting season the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.849 
the time come extracting season the
first<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.580> how<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.449> clean<00:00:18.930> my<00:00:19.230> equipment

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
first is how do I clean my equipment

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.820 
first is how do I clean my equipment
after<00:00:20.010> harvesting<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.000> extracting<00:00:21.710> well<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
after harvesting and extracting well the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
after harvesting and extracting well the
answer<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:23.310> quite<00:00:23.699> simple<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.750> always

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
answer is really quite simple you always

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.099 
answer is really quite simple you always
want<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.830> start<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.340> cold<00:00:26.939> water<00:00:27.449> rather

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
want to start with cold water rather

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
want to start with cold water rather
than<00:00:28.260> warm<00:00:28.650> water<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.220> that's<00:00:29.400> somewhat

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
than warm water and that's somewhat

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.530 
than warm water and that's somewhat
counterintuitive<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:31.140> beeswax<00:00:32.000> get<00:00:33.000> soft

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
counterintuitive but beeswax get soft

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.220 
counterintuitive but beeswax get soft
and<00:00:33.899> sticky<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:35.420> smear<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.079> gets

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
and sticky and can smear when it gets

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.520 
and sticky and can smear when it gets
hot<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.670> cold<00:00:39.030> water<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.809> gets<00:00:40.170> brittle

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
hot but with cold water it gets brittle

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.340 
hot but with cold water it gets brittle
and<00:00:40.890> flaky<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.760> easily<00:00:42.480> flakes<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and flaky and easily flakes off of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
and flaky and easily flakes off of
equipment<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> scratch<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> little

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
equipment or you can scratch it a little

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
equipment or you can scratch it a little
bit<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> easily<00:00:46.350> comes<00:00:46.800> off<00:00:47.100> the
