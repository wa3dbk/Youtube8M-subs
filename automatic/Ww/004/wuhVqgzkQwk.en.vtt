let's<00:00:31.739> try<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> chorus<00:00:32.460> sound<00:00:32.700> first<00:00:33.000> i<00:00:33.680> have

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the level at about 50% this is an

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.950 
the level at about 50% this is an
interesting<00:00:38.550> chorus<00:00:39.030> pedal<00:00:39.330> because<00:00:39.660> unlike

a lot of other chorus pedals you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.070 
a lot of other chorus pedals you
actually<00:00:41.490> can<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> signal<00:00:42.180> boost<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.810> the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
actually can get a signal boost from the

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.840 
actually can get a signal boost from the
pedal<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:44.610> depth<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> way<00:00:46.260> up

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
pedal the depth i have all the way up

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.570 
pedal the depth i have all the way up
speed<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> rate<00:00:48.240> both<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:48.960> about<00:00:49.170> 25%<00:00:49.740> so<00:00:50.430> here

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
speed and rate both at about 25% so here

00:00:50.580 --> 00:01:38.649 
speed and rate both at about 25% so here
we<00:00:50.670> go

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:02:49.149 

now<00:01:39.659> let's<00:01:39.960> engage<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.470> vibrato<00:01:40.740> switch

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.199 

this<00:02:50.159> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.459> hear<00:02:50.640> when<00:02:50.760> he<00:02:50.819> gives<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.060> pretty

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
this you can hear when he gives a pretty
