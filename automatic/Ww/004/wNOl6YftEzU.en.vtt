00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.259
 as you know I made a video does 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599

 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.110
 easy is very simple and I want to clarify 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.960
 here I'm just going to show you how 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.210
 connect the device once you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.040
 connect you go back to the other video and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.480
 you do the configuration like you 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.550
 want to do then 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.900
 in the video one of the problems that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.989
 live that people are saying that more 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.570
 is no longer versions for 30 and 82 and my 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.399
 computer is 34 environment well that is what 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.870
 that I will explain to you here that a lot 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.420
 people have problems in that installation 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.129
 here are the load too much failures 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.800
 I'm going to leave the link below 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.590
 we are going to give him some we go now that yes 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.100
 since it is installed ok we verify that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.009
 so although we give everything yes 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.840
 ready and you should install now watch something 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:27.720
 look at this here you go out to install 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.930
 Microsoft visual set prost plus of 86 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 but where it says it but you're going to 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.920
 leave to install it but you no no no 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 he cares about that I follow that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.940
 no and you are going to give him an error 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.770
 of 9 here an example to this des 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.299
 installing it because I installed it in the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.670
 there you first uninstall 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.950
 complete but an error is raised 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.899
 basic viewer that is trying to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.190
 install for you look here the error 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.920
 is the same and vice and that we 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.119
 installed close that way but notice that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 if peru that if you settled in age 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.979
 that yes here it was because I opened it again 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.360
 I'm going to close what you give him 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.190
 if you are going to have it 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.229
 order I know it's already installed then let's go 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.770
 to come here and we will open it because and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.170
 half error 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.230
 and another mistake me what to uninstall 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.420
 It seems that it was installed badly and I'm going to 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.950
 install again because then here 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.810
 looking at the program here I'm going to 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.450
 try to install again we will see 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.430
 now do not give me any error because 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.760
 I installed it but it was not recording 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.380
 when I install it here I'm installing 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.050
 the program notice that it will be treated 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.600
 to install the visual basic but that's not 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.370
 matter is going to say separate ok or not say 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.000
 will give an error and will say that it is not 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.000
 could install 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.510
 and when I say it ok tells me that this 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.510
 version 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.019
 when you finish here it tells me that the version 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.580
 but that is the basic visual that is being 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.940
 installing this is not what we 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.970
 we want to take care to close and we're going 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.780
 now to look for the application here below 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.599
 and there it is working, there is the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.690
 application running and says look 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.209
 he says no of vice although they can see the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.239
 application here byte sine now is 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.440
 when you are going to proceed to connect what 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.340
 which is the cable of course with the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.829
 connected from mosley control 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.530
 playstation yesterday I will connect it and 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.900
 notice that this is zinc and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.670
 there I find it is seen there is the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.650
 address of the remote control that is 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.720
 here remote control is the address of the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.000
 playstation control that is here 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.310
 as I already have it connected there is less 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.400
 register and we will also connect the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.590
 iPad or the air is going to hear you have the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.849
 iphone or any device ok 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.090
 there you see that itunes is going to open 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.819
 then now is when are we going to go to the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.950
 ipad and let's connect it this is what 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.230
 only different thing we have to do 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.780
 earlier than in the previous video 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.920
 does only here we have to enter this 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.640
 code that I am going to tell you now 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.620
 then I will come here to troll that already 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.300
 we download what you did not do it 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.250
 I'm discharging because he has not seen the 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.980
 another video we are going to come to troll to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.290
 butron so we write the program here 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.730
 under control we're going to do like 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.620
 let's connect the control of 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.989
 playstation 3 and we are going to give you here 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.600
 let's select station 3 and we're going 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.490
 to give to connect then there is not going to 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.860
 find automatically as in the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.930
 imac let's copy this code from here 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.840
 and we are going to put her directly 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.590
 ok then that 's what I'm going to do 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:43.979
 now let's copy the same code 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.979
 the tips 7 May 274 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.910
 because you see that there was a mark for me 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.860
 says of day what do you mean we are already 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.440
 just updating so that it 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.150
 connect ok we will give you there where it says 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.460
 of day to you will not be in any 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.900
 number up here will not leave a 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.880
 number but it will not be the same 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.120
 I get the same because I already did 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.470
 this procedure then boil it says 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.440
 update and ready already there is going to connect and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.580
 we just have to come here 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.680
 disconnect control 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.390
 I'm going to disconnect the control and I'm going 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.190
 to notice that I am in the same 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.210
 window here then I connect 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.230
 what I'm going to do here is that I'm going to 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:26.040
 turn on the control 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.410
 and ready then super super fast and the 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.780
 control is connected and this is from here 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.700
 is where this signal does not indicate if it is 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.430
 here of the bluetooth is what indicates it and 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.200
 Now we can go to the other video and do the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.840
 configurations that we want to make and 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.070
 start playing then I'm going to 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.740
 leave this video until here this 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.990
 it was only for the windows 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.670
 if you did not understand something it is very 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.250
 It is recommended that you watch the other video for 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.010
 that understands the whole context and already here 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.450
 it's just to solve the problem 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.130
 I want to ask a question now well in 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.510
 everything that I have here behind those are 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.760
 more videos that I have to do but 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.620
 I need to know if they want me to do 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.660
 the Tuesday video that says today 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.400
 it's Tuesday and this video I do not know if it's going to 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.630
 go up on Tuesday but it's going to go up and 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.430
 I want you to tell me if you 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.100
 Do you want me to ship on Tuesdays or 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.710
 continue with the comparisons and 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.570
 omv boxing ok the video on Tuesdays I have 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.730
 a video that I want to do that is 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.470
 interesting but it 's all up to 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.360
 you so tell me here below in 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.000
 the comments the next thing that you 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.770
 they want to see in these videos this has been 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.960
 everything for today server like always 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.980
 a little hand up subscribe if you have not 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.410

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.100
 that you answer me 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.980
 if I did not tell them every time I was not 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.980
 playing they have to die 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.539
 every time they go to play they have to 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.539
 to do that 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.909
 kill him
