00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.019
 roj 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.209
 france from 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.959
 one of the greatest and most successful ajacied of all time a leader on it 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.230
 field a personality 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
 he combined strength and technique with scoring ability 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.319
 the complete soccer player 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.099
 dave twente spoke richly and spoke to him about frings the first 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.380
 years of life in a rich arsenal was the soccer player he would later become 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.770
 how do you look at Ajax 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680
 good ajax is one 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 it was 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 I say but I am from Amsterdam, which is the highest 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 but oddly enough, I am never very concerned with reporting on mumps 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 football has been crazy but it is not me 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.050
 to be found every week in a stadium it was now indeed what you just say it 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 self on is paramount at the club at that time 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.930
 days off on the street or playing rules 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.380
 but not clear 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.300
 focused 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.920
 professional football 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.560
 but make good the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.000
 you have maximum wax ajax always win 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.430
 exists in Amsterdam 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.300
 I am also completely up with the successes that I grew up a bit 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.470
 of course also the seventies with international 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.670
 successes 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.380
 in that regard, the state had such ajax still very well on my retina 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.060
 have not seen full by all match 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.799
 but i had that i also have feyenoord feyenoord this thing was that 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.840
 the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.510
 it runs at a time when you see it as 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.910
 as a child and you always stay there and then that incredible one came 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.160
 sequence of ajax in the back 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.620
 jade ajax had the horizon 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.650
 then saying it is perhaps inviolable or 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.690
 that was the summit 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.570
 the football but there days 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 I never thought about it 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.030
 unfortunately for myself 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.500
 I enjoyed good football 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.450
 the young viewers hurd at the professional football clubs 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.930
 his friend did not succeed in finally pulling the first half into his own house 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.230
 and leave fireplace 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.920
 follow the same route 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.820
 until ajax report 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.780
 what did you find there at ajax it was one 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.680
 in a completely different world than the world of dws with the reacted differently 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.869
 vice versa 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.099
 yes at the time he was, of course 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.930
 I think what hears what 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.759
 we had wanted to know them here now says that 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.459
 after every game you play in that sense camouflage the dream about goal among the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.840
 to reach among the first let it say i think we already know that not 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.209
 completely double, I think playing football was a wonderful challenge 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.249
 was proud to be at ajax 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.739
 could also play this time in the judgments now that I paid 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.279
 very special anyway 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.949
 but no I am not so concerned with the future and afterwards sometimes about it 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.289
 thought 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.559
 that generation of ajax that patients fantastic players at 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.830
 I also had a friend who is not playing a few years older than me and me 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.749
 sometimes watched him 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.189
 and then you saw all that talent 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.379
 and very few left after the first 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.499
 that is not due to the boy himself a bit light at the moment and actually when I 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:12.999
 went as a 17 year old boy then came a lot the possibility that 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.899
 the doors of the first openings also occur 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.409
 to be youth players 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.359
 it seemed as if they all came a little easier 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.629
 and I just came in at that time so you might have to finish 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.399
 laps 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:29.659
 you have the 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.329
 the door opened a bit and we gave the youth players some more chances 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.499
 for young players 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.789
 In the first to come he took advantage of you in Wim Kieft 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.809
 people just watched hello and saw 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.889
 and talented footballer but how did you see yourself 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.829
 throughout that room 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.829
 well i have to say i was late 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.739
 had to be found himself as a professional footballer so also with ajax 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.069
 that I now take myself from my early years and look at it 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.189
 also not really about van 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.659
 of the confidence that i 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.819
 that I would make it and 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.819
 correct that he did take some time to get real 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.439
 to find that ambition to go along with that 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.930
 that must go back in again 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.029
 and always 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:28.740
 just like we at ajax fan 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.159
 be sharp 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.259
 some more time 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.009
 it's what you do 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.639
 so cumbersome 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.279
 place awareness 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.669
 of it is not just play with so too 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.060
 we work but craftsmanship yes it is actually me 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.060
 What I do know is that I do 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 could get more out of it but 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.249
 that I do not always enter because many things were against me 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.580
 the mentality 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.159
 he did that 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.599
 has to and it 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:06.580
 it yourself 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.210
 we also do that over the back of the other 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.370
 many things that are not so this week 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.469
 spring 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.409
 you know I was not fully involved in what I saw around me 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.110
 and then it was the owner of the western bolides prague 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.930
 nice that we lost and it worked 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.169
 did play but it just wasn't good enough or wasn't present 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.889
 and then of course there was criticism 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.889
 that such a boy who will never have it in professional football 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.509
 this includes so yes but well there is waiting there is a core of it 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.050
 truth is that it is it is it is jar must give everything from that 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.509
 moment i am more 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.669
 take myself back and play soccer 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.889
 because i like it and includes league 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.889
 would like to try to catch up and not 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.060
 too much more influenced by the cold the team nuts that 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.080
 which I did not feel obliged to present will present itself or 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.210
 or by what the environment said or has a comment 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.210
 wim from that moment more a close 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.319
 more or less the appointment with a home-made one 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.459
 from now on, do what matches are that you do not play well on that you 

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.520
 performs less but you always look at the mass in the mirror this is one 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.719
 disaster 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:28.800
 done everything 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.129
 what was in it I tried him on 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.119
 it will be a lot easier because that will take him to the ground 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.229
 played
