00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.439
 I would like to briefly respect again 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.420
 to bring the vegan diet in general 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.969
 even if I think a lot about it 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.200
 I want to talk about Irish 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.259
 still something short to say 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.060
 And indeed , the vegan diet is very 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.450
 healthy and in all circumstances 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.190
 no matter if you are a child since he is one 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.930
 Breastfeeding mother since you have one 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.790
 pregnancy time or something else 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.710
 this is scientifically proven 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.930
 that diet in any case 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.750
 is healthy and even for prevention 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.600
 different diseases is thought 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.589
 so she can not be bad too 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.420
 no case at all 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.429
 The vegan diet is great and 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.260
 it just has to be said a thousand times 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.870
 because unfortunately you hear it too little 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.339
 it is also for athletes it is this 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.800
 nutrition very interesting though 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.129
 many people are exercising and so on 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.079
 further, it's not like that and 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.819
 would have to continue their protein shakes 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.289
 pure whistle and ok once sex well 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.300
 constantly bring only six when they 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.649
 train and amino acids and so on 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.280
 but I do not have to be from animal 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.960
 Origin can also be just like proteins 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.479
 be of plant origin 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.140
 which use the body just as effectively 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.659
 can look like proteins from the animal 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.369
 nutrition and you can still all 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.500
 others also get these eight 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.060
 Essential amino acids are themselves 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 absolutely no worries 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.149
 important is that a vegan diet 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.490
 Simply planned and thought out today 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.460
 Every diet must be thought out and 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.719
 also people are planned to eat everything 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.329
 on meat and milk on us 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.920
 Eat every diet must go insane 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.450
 be thoughtful that you just do not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.219
 lack gets the people, so to speak 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 not at all interested in it and 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.369
 Just eat what you want in yourself 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.890
 Reinstopfen what you want 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.549
 they usually have a shortage too 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.350
 Everybody has somebody somewhere or somewhere 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.960
 almost every human being somehow a preparation 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.079
 He is as a dietary supplement 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 occupies 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.369
 and since I am now even to the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.780
 Good transitions though in the vegan 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.420
 nutrition you get everything you need 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.799
 So you need all the vitamins to 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 on an exception the rather little time 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.819
 are you a trace element only 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.709
 you get all marco nutrients just like you 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.890
 they also need protein as well 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.480
 Grad also had enough iron enough 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.430
 calcium and so on so get 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.849
 really everything except vitamin b12 and 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.250
 this topic has a lot of potential 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.860
 It's not about bringing discussion either 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.410
 sufficiently documented if the person alone 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.760
 Vitamin B12 may or may not produce 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.500
 I already have some videos 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.569
 made and there are always found 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.519
 very many comments that great 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.590
 as a lively exchange always takes place 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.840
 but it is not proven that we 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.790
 absolutely need vitamin b12 pills 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.829
 but as a precaution, you should be yourself 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.220
 but really great in this 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.959
 read the topic because you just have to 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.030
 when you look at this vitamin 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.139
 I can not do without the body 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.700
 alone form, for example, at zero 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.380
 grad school in nutrition even though 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.660
 man like face you can as I said 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.700
 then it can be that one 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.100
 Vitamin B12 deficiency gets many people 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.840
 as for example to polio christina 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.519
 here on youtube the feeds on 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.970
 example vegan and for me it is to 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.030
 For example, quite a role model or 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.560
 an inspiration because it lies the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.730
 Just eat it is so great now rest 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.650
 So watch looks definitely times 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.870
 Past the plate she picks up 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.420
 in any case, no vitamin B12 principle 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.269
 the opinion if you the body vitamin 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.250
 B12 leads to artificial then the 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.599
 body someday unlearn vitamin b12 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.060
 to form what I say of this 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.990
 I do not want to say that because of this 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.820
 I always in 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.530
 videos make sure to read because this theme purely 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.330
 and ultimately decide for yourself 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.520
 he wants to take this vitamin b12 or 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.120
 I do not even like to go vegan 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.040
 nutrition 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.750
 I would like to mention that the change 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.540
 from zero to one hundred is very heavy 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.360
 So dare you can because I can 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.190
 because really interested and take 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.750
 also in buying that sometimes bad 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.640
 just while that can run 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.710
 you might also announce it again 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.970
 us on, or maybe there will be 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.800
 People are just a few 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.540
 days a week to feed vegan 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.530
 that's great that's great if you have it 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.020
 So honestly want 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.360
 you do not have to be that way either 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.070
 make the main thing he does your body 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.840
 and what's good and you become 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.540
 be aware of your decision what you are 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.730
 buy and so on as you feed 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.100
 and that's why point slow 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.200
 make steps forward and how 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.280
 just say setbacks easy 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.020
 accept 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.450
 interesting could be the vegan diet 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.670
 as I said for all people the the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.490
 Disease like this diet 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.410
 said to be called a healthy diet 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.570
 and that's why I can do that in any case 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.820
 to the people to heart 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.940
 maybe vegan in this topic 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.880
 nutritionally the vegan 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.340
 Diet is not all that healthy 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.230
 is no equations the front to the top 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.460
 in the back, but the people agree 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.130
 Exclusively of finished products 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.570
 Feeding in the vegan I believe that 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.580
 These people are very healthy then 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.070
 also the pudding vegans so where 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.070
 Constantly vegan cheese from so 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.830
 these replacement products 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.240
 they are not that great 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.980
 healthy and who cares a lot about 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.380
 currently wants to feed finished products 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.270
 a lot of money because of that my many 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.910
 people the vegan diet is so expensive 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.710
 but with me in the kitchen is actually 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.900
 nothing expensive except i'm going in now 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.140
 Organic market special only permanently shopping 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.240
 or I constantly have to buy nuts and 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.680
 these finished products and what with me 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.290
 are really there are in any case 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.580
 This must have products but the make 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.200
 we are already homesick in the meantime 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.540
 thermomix and he is natural 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.100
 must convert super on the mountain must 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.050
 and do so on and so forth so 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.430
 why should you give the challenge one 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.660
 I would also like very briefly a couple 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.950
 say words 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.950
 I try also to briefly 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.240
 hold and that is trying on 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.070
 worth every case to see if that 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.330
 new variant is if I'm like that 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.130
 want to feed or not 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.560
 and many people who say I know 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.480
 not to ever eat as you have 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.340
 simply the opportunity is 30 days too 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.660
 make great recipes are there 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.030
 pretty much taken in hand and 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.610
 so why not do it in thirty 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.200
 days of your life it is 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.270
 really a joke but tried 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.130
 Just have a look and then you can say 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.750
 hey super for me it is really hard 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.160
 I like it but 30 days 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.210
 I still saw you 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.310
 can eat delicious 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.680
 but I do not want to continue this 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.030
 I still want less meat 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.250
 eat less dairy 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.380
 but maybe many people say 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.760
 It's not so good of you 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.260
 I like it and I feel really good 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.270
 I just realize that more power 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.530
 have more energy and so on and me 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.360
 I just feel good if I do not 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.770
 animals is not any of these 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.390
 industry in our world these days 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.610
 society is full of animals 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.780
 supports no, i just leave it 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.210
 I think it's just good that we just 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.950
 Let me see that I would like that 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.240
 I do not want to or do not do it 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.800
 you can definitely lose my money 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.480
 nothing at the end you can even then 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.490
 be proud of you because that is 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.140
 really a challenge completely 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.820
 to eat differently like the bulk of ours 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.290
 Society is so easy for you 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.060
 provided at the end of a challenge 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.260
 which you have done in any case and 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.300
 You can then on the shoulder 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.310
 knock and say hey I have something good 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.180
 done not only for my sake but also 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.090
 for the sake of animals 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.750
 So my application is somehow 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.700
 longer as it had before and 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.090
 That's why I stop 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.800
 just about my diet before that 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.560
