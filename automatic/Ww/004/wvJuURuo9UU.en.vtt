00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.890
 Porta Westfalica MT 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.220
 Today Magalhães appears to be extremely worried 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.390
 Pixum ahead the food 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.550
 this had to do with what an 8-megapixel camera on the back 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.539
 Victory even more beautiful »man's phone 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:16.679
 on the 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.249
 the visibility is 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.249
 then the phone in the histamine is one you have 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.189
 a camera 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.839
 be him 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.470
 They also provide a grant for protection 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.519
 because I always have a chance and I like the art 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.240
 on the other hand 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 then very nice friend resolution display 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.150
 the touch-sensitive works 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.350
 and privately that the complete operation of the mobile phone works 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.660
 Herta Müller wanted 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.540
 she asks to afford 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.540
 and drop different applications 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 by Detlef Sundermann for example 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 my calendar 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 the terminus station 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.430
 Candy 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 the widgets also pull on him too 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.530
 have them again in Worms, for example, with a test drive 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.530
 position 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.400
 just play 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.280
 - If you do not need them anymore, just send them lots of iron again 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 open door 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.230
 however, it is the most interesting 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.230
 Camera functions that again 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.070
 this includes 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.070
 Camera function rest 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 Objectively complains shot 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.370
 It should seem to me it is photo light that is not 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.660
 feverish suddenly but a lady who was very bright 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.149
 among them died 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.489
 all recording modes for example 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.310
 Now, Urbez Armenhaus automatically follows automatically 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.789
 or different scenes as you would from a compact camera Rupprecht 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.939
 through the different currencies 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.939
 Taken in May 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 You can also grow by strong market position 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.799
 we are happy and are too 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.039
 Light art correction 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:49.019
 inside settings Philipp Neumann and self-timer the resolution can 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.279
 to adjust 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.929
 often lead 3 2 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.009
 or less value AXA 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.090
 as compensation can be adjusted 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.039
 Schiller asked 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.499
 To show chamis 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:06.059
 so happened too 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.039
 around 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:12.319
 Minute equal for example to the Sony Ericsson c905 Zaugg and 8 megapixels 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.789
 photographed 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.769
 Percent that took pictures of a picture the biogas are split off 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.799
 got to 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.510
 Percent of what can take a long time as long as you can not new 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.869
 Take money 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.869
 We just try it out of focus here 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.359
 Answer to the keyboard or like monitors 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.299
 and not now 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.299
 there they appeared 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.559
 and already focussed savings one can produce something immediately 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.039
 1 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.039
 this direction 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.489
 Big bit darker is Jung Turkish 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.539
 for the project they have there 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.539
 it rarely rings 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.579
 that's how it works 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.659
 with which she is in bed by Anton Börner 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.659
 press here and on the play button 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.219
 and dumb 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:19.219
 can give me the pictures + grain 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.069
 very nice in the medium term 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.069
 Use lists can be given and edit 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.689
 Let the animal dream 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.949
 or 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.949
 and image editing 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.439
 Naughty Dog work 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.490
 Functions for example effects 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.180
 Janz the boys 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.180
 For example, if he has Screen Mainz and Bremen 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.619
 remains so now is today became common the contours 4 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.610
 undo more 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.729
 or 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.550
 a stool 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.550
 Yield to 23 0 percent 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.069
 G 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.740
 now wake up on board 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.719
 currently comes with tempo effect 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.719
 now it looks like this 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.919
 Shot assuredly made clear again and again 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.400
 when the work goes wrong 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
 no problem 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.229
 that would have happened if we returned 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.569
 information 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.930
 June the resolution size 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.610
 Although the picture will 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.610
 when it was recorded wos saved 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.559
 Susanne provided Tyler Browser 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.090
 often no longer 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.090
 really photo out 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.189
 the animal love itself the citizen 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.259
 now afraid 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.059
 I give Sven's name 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:07.059
 I quote like scrolling 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.830
 but now so unpopular feedback 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.830
 Skippy Returns phone from Driftsethe played very nice 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.520
 to take a picture 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:24.999
 so led 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.189
 Yusuf leaf through 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.110
 hereby wants 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.110
 great interesting to the train they used to link 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:41.150
 means around 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.150
 Reasons for example a person photographed 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.919
 Points this person is on several photos 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:51.949
 by percent 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.990
 also Eric Healey face recognition 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.249
 quite clearly as she recognizes 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.849
 to postpone the same person's focus 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.249
 then, for example, you can also search for people 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:03.629
 besides telephone shows one all 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:05.369
 back to 

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:08.369
 on which this person is to be found 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:11.680
 He is looking for a cell phone 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.099
 that the 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.620
 Compact camera that you had to carry around with you 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:21.539
 the ATX where so forced a very good chance 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.960
 especially the fast autofocus 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.689
 shoot dropped within two weeks 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:29.889
 Again, these are stored very quickly this has the usual functions in the 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.199
 current quarter finds again 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.599
 and you are so used to the service, it is kind of deep 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.430
 and how she stands best possible 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.339
 see www it-academy CC 

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.519
 in the detailed test
