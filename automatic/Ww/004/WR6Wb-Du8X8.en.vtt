00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 here it is claudio ranieri then 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.190
 eehmm we don't know how to interpret the game because then 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.730
 when I saw her anyway let me do a yes you chronicler will fail to recognize there is that 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.450
 minimum of suffering than with that always an Italian market area 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.019
 something can always happen, I'm all gearing up for it 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.169
 well the web generation 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.349
 csa fi sud ranieri this suffered like all the mallor malloggi Roma fans 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.269
 we knew that 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.460
 I don't like to suffer against marik e 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.460
 here they left us the fjord team pens the inter and drew us but 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.789
 for the broken cuff 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.450
 3 coming here because he would win was not written anywhere I hope because 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.290
 someone has given a practice done but it is not so for use often and willingly yes 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.329
 from how phrases of songs to first play them as I always say 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.629
 eheh I try to inculcate in people who are not lower than the calendar here 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.660
 let's make the bridge 2 1 2 3 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.810
 now I have one of us who made gallarate 3 total score 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.299
 starting you need lease is not that 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.649
 maybe llamar look I put three day points meteo.it and we knew that 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.529
 the players vary a game system that puts you in trouble 

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:04.640
 because to those two 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.300
 - very fast outside that triples well 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.890
 where i've the two fishing tips - very well 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.240
 to try not to make them think we have pressed a lot and very high for 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.130
 which was not a game 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270
 very easy to tamper with that we are well physically 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.070
 and we have managed to press high for the whole game this is the first 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.470
 half an hour we even wanted not to say close but maybe a better one 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.210
 a little bit wider advantage is this true but it is for we will have to 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.110
 take advantage of every minimum opportunity many times in football 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.230
 because if we remember the match of the first leg we will take the first one 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.320
 occasion the pole with mirko 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.740
 then face mo3 colt 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.540
 but they made four cassione by pull did not even make one there were two 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.170
 sometimes two occasions for barreto only in front of bertagnoli 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.610
 l2 is filmed on the fly of langella 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.500
 hehe why we have to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.830
 a knowledge and to see against we go to play what she liked it today 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.110
 shark said of this great concentration on all men 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.930
 yes the spirit of sacrifice was the first time we played with 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.750
 trony totti and vucinic 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.220
 we are used to playing with other players who run across the board 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.420
 simone perrotta was missing for which 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 the big expenditure of energy back and forth if they are 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.159
 tna 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.700
 ahahah put on ebay shoulders 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.639
 and de rossi that he had to accompany 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:33.129
 and playing the pizarro was very good when it came to press and good 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.819
 then in the management of the ball so we failed in a game that 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.059
 I never love tried it the three tips we managed to tackle a team 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.459
 like the bar for which 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.720
 fat compliments to my players and many thanks ar thousands of fans 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.309
 which made us feel at home is beautiful totti as I am 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.080
 totti is fine and in short, he felt good 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.310
 as first match 70 - of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.909
 msm sparse 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.609
 lol today i run remove i knew that 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.629
 removing him eee pad is an important point of reference 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.969
 and for us and for the pitfalls of others 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.969
 however that favorite point put matteo brighi who was a player 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.170
 frescopic with 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.569
 different features but trying to develop the same type of game and if 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.000
 before the good wishes we do not have the spectator because the puma is going to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.400
 starting from the Argentine inter expects something next week 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.609
 but we must always expect something from someone and we must 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.340
 thinking of ourselves then God sees and wishes to all of you 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.080
 happy easter i give it to you i call it love happy easter mister
