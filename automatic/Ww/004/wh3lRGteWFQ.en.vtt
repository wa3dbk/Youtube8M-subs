can be difficult and it generally falls
down<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.020> raid<00:03:52.200> leader<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.620> do<00:03:52.770> so<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.280> you

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
down to the raid leader to do so if you

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.730 
down to the raid leader to do so if you
have<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.360> player<00:03:54.660> who<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.900> just<00:03:55.170> being<00:03:55.320> nasty<00:03:55.530> to

the<00:03:55.920> raid<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.760> best<00:03:57.000> way<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.420> my<00:03:57.450> opinion<00:03:58.080> is

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
the raid the best way in my opinion is

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.230 
the raid the best way in my opinion is
to<00:03:58.260> give<00:03:58.530> them<00:03:58.710> a<00:03:58.830> warning<00:03:59.190> in<00:03:59.400> whisper<00:03:59.760> if

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240

they continue give them a warning in

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.680 
they continue give them a warning in
raid<00:04:02.070> then<00:04:02.580> remove<00:04:03.060> them<00:04:03.180> from<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.420> group<00:04:03.570> if

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
raid then remove them from the group if

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.570 
raid then remove them from the group if
they<00:04:03.780> continue<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.160> particularly

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
they continue this is a particularly

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.520 
they continue this is a particularly
lenient<00:04:06.270> approach<00:04:06.630> coming<00:04:07.050> from<00:04:07.170> me<00:04:07.320> and

lenient approach coming from me and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.680 
lenient approach coming from me and
sometimes<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.490> plain<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.970> simple<00:04:09.240> group<00:04:09.480> kick

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
sometimes a plain and simple group kick

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.140 
sometimes a plain and simple group kick
can<00:04:10.050> be<00:04:10.080> better<00:04:10.470> it's<00:04:10.830> up<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.550> as<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.820> raid

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
can be better it's up to you as the raid

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.910 
can be better it's up to you as the raid
leader<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.510> judge<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.990> situation<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.710> act
