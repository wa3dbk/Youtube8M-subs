00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
Halloween or fall greeting at my door

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.689 
Halloween or fall greeting at my door
but<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.959> same<00:03:19.169> basic<00:03:19.500> element<00:03:19.919> that's

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
but it's the same basic element that's

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.400 
but it's the same basic element that's
in<00:03:20.910> my<00:03:21.060> house<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:21.569> it's<00:03:21.690> kind<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.109> an

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
in my house so it's kind of like an

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.039 
in my house so it's kind of like an
invitation<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:24.180> party<00:03:24.629> this<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
invitation is to a party this is the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.539 
invitation is to a party this is the
teaser<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.470> what's<00:03:25.799> going<00:03:25.949> to<00:03:26.040> be<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.129> my<00:03:26.310> house

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
teaser of what's going to be in my house

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.339 
teaser of what's going to be in my house
so<00:03:26.879> I<00:03:27.389> just<00:03:27.720> think<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.079> should<00:03:28.230> be

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
so I just think that it should be

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.250 
so I just think that it should be
consistent<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.069> shouldn't<00:03:29.430> be<00:03:29.549> like<00:03:30.260> while

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
consistent it shouldn't be like while

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.750 
consistent it shouldn't be like while
glitz<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.919> glamour<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.310> then<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.489> go<00:03:32.579> inside

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
glitz and glamour and then you go inside

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.839 
glitz and glamour and then you go inside
and<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.239> casual<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.250> natural<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.579> want<00:03:35.790> it

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
and it's casual and natural you want it

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.759 
and it's casual and natural you want it
to<00:03:36.000> flow<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.510> like<00:03:36.629> an<00:03:36.810> event<00:03:37.109> would<00:03:37.290> and
