00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.250
 in the air the most external among combustible and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.480
 the most combustible among external rubrics 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.920
 Galileo program which is called 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.379
 experiments 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.160
 friends which problem is the most urgent 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.720
 on the planet today is correct 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 energy by the way all 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.340
 Galileo team has long been 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 moved not only to energy saving 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.059
 light bulbs but also on energy-saving food 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.950
 what will happen next 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.540
 to continue here we are on petrol station 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.450
 we go there to invent all sorts of other 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.300
 biofuel options will soon be corn 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 shove it in the gas tank but it's not that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.739
 because soon there won't be any 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.969
 nothing friends remained only the sun and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 so that's all it would be all very hopeless 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.850
 if in the early 19th century the old man 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.550
 Robert Stirling by the way 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.750
 Scottish priest did not take yes not 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 would invent a stirling engine 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 stylish friends doesn't work on corn 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.990
 not on rapsy not on all sorts of oil 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.890
 recyclable and not gas it works 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.270
 just the temperature difference 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 temperature difference is very easy to achieve 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.909
 sat on the sun here's your side warmed a 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.060
 so I'm cold side here and you already 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.189
 stirling engine how does it work 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.829
 so the idea was simple 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.509
 there is a cylinder in it there is a piston and inside 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.060
 some working body in this case 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.130
 just in the air you heated the air 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.090
 air expanding presses on the piston 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.299
 commits work then sweat you air 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.310
 cool 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.700
 and the piston returns to place it seemed 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.079
 everything is great but it's very 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 energy intensive every time to heat and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.030
 cool the whole cylinder so stirling 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.130
 came up with a brilliant idea he shared 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.469
 the cylinder into two parts one part 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.159
 it heats and the other side remains 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.590
 cold 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.960
 so if the air is all 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.969
 move to the hot part he's there 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.940
 Heats up and if the experience is moved to 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.520
 the cold part he cool down the question how 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.660
 air move there here and here 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.120
 Stirling came up again 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.640
 it is necessary to place inside this cylinder 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.760
 large piston which will occupy 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.340
 half the cylinder volume and moving and 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.430
 so the cylinder and the piston will drive 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.820
 air from the area and hot chambers in 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.310
 camera area is cold so here is our 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.830
 office 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.500
 friend called Alexey and Alexey 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.560
 on the dispute for a pack of cigarettes 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.860
 did model stirling engines 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.960
 here it is this very piston which 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 moves air from one area to 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.440
 here's another hit big now show 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.420
 how does he move please and here is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.930
 this piston is small this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.000
 the piston which will push 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.200
 heated air how does this work 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.710
 Look at my engine here 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.250
 ordinary iron plate yes I am her 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.280
 I will heat no matter what the stove steam 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.920
 hand sunshine no matter i'm warming and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.160
 this air that is here next 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.560
 with this plate heats up too 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.170
 expands and begins to press on here 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.170
 This is the piston he presses on the piston 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.160
 look to shoot it is necessary there is a worker 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.600
 move and since we have a special way 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.310
 inside this one is roomy 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.090
 the piston is tied to the working piston 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.560
 capacious piston moves and 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.220
 accordingly moves all the air from 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.160
 areas 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.120
 hot to the cold here 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.130
 the air cools down the piston goes down and everything 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.050
 repeat again on the cycle now check 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.330
 Does the company Alexey Alexey work like that? 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.300
 as written in their ad they said 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.790
 that all you need is to heat it up 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.360
 here this side of this engine and so 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.970
 we start to heat it just hold it 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.100
 engine over water vapor 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.370
 notice I do not specifically put 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.100
 engine on the cup and keep at the bottom to 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.750
 You did not think that there are any 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.060
 secret holes through which steam 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.410
 affect these pistons david i.e. 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.110
 this is no steam engine this 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.110
 Stirling's engine 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.610
 Now listen, why do I need steam 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.389
 just above the hob 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.759
 because comfort and because it is so hot well 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.349
 not very useful 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.930
 so i'm holding over the hob 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.270
 I can't put the stirling engine 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.009
 because plexiglass will melt from 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.409
 which engine is made but already 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.840
 look look I'm trying to run 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.270
 him and he little by little 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:56.419
 slowly starts, let's come on 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:59.210
 own well on-the-go on go-go native 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.199
 1 cm and what happens is heated up alone 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.000
 side of the stirling engine 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.300
 accordingly, there is a difference 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.990
 temperatures so the engine has started 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.900
 lulu class 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.370
 and now I just put it on the table and 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.469
 he continues to make his move 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.939
 why because until here 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.939
 this plate is cool 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:23.930
 the engine will work which pluses in 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:26.180
 first exhaust 0 no excess 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.099
 pressure is not produced anywhere by the way 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.650
 the stirling engine is the engine 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:34.009
 external combustion because the fuel 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.020
 burned outside the work chamber understand a 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.849
 internal combustion engine which 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.250
 lives on gasoline on gas there is fuel 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.020
 burned inside the working chamber so here 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.129
 friends is the engine as I said 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.650
 has great efficiency 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.629
 does not have exhaust is all pluses and 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.690
 cons is that this engine is powerful 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.740
 make it hard plus everything 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.330
 working body which in this case 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.210
 is the air she too has some 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.979
 its heat capacity is cooled and heated 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.699
 this also requires some costs and 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:03.650
 some losses but this engine 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.659
 There is moreover in industrial 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.210
 scales 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:09.830
 please, we bought this engine in 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.189
 Moscow has a special megamoll 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.240
 called sterling in Moscow 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.610
 four storey huge store with 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.589
 underground parking is sitting there 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.240
 the chinese and do these stirling engines 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:23.089
 dealing incidentally quite like quality 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.279
 see the principle of operation is the same here 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.830
 This piston with us which carries 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:30.560
 working stroke and the piston that moves 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.949
 across is the piston that is here 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.220
 here is this big he drives the air out 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.780
 areas of elevated 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.340
 elevated temperature in the area 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.600
 low temperature itself so 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.870
 as I said this so let's see 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:48.660
 how does it work well come on old man come on 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:51.420
 let's go this way even chukh chukh chukh chukh 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.430
 friends stirling engine this 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.740
 engine that only works from 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.130
 temperature differences and there are even installations 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.130
 wholes who can 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.700
 which is arranged as follows with you 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.110
 huge mirror 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:09.330
 such a parabolic pair 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.600
 concentrates all the sunlight into one 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.790
 point and there it is worth this one here 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.030
 the red of the stirling engine before the sun 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.590
 heats it up and the engine is running 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.510
 beautiful option in my and most 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.190
 most importantly the most amazing engine 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.850
 stirling as it only works 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:29.790
 due to temperature difference can work 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.419
 using snow how in room 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.190
 temperature 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.810
 on one side they put snow and 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.820
 it turned out that you will have this country 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.230
 cold and the country which is in the room 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.780
 temperature will be considered hot 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:43.470
 side and the engine starts again but 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:46.290
 that the friends of the program were burning and the most 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.530
 Narga saving program on our 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.530
 television
