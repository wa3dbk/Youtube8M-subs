00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:16.109
 we see a portion of branch of about 15 20 centimeters of ignored length e 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.960
 that he did not bring flowers 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.589
 we prepare a mixture of peat garden soil and sand 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.640
 in equal parts 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.910
 to fill a 12-year-old 12 12 cm bidet vase 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.379
 we cut our love immediately 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.860
 soat a knot 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 we eliminate the apical part and we also remove the leaves one or two panels 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.910
 the mean already spring base and we were 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.870
 via could or dante's monarchy 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.870
 patent to stimulate root formation 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.020
 india let's see now our talia in the denim pot depth however too 10 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 centimeters 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830
 banniamo 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.980
 visually let us always remember to keep moderately wet the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.930
 soil from the pot 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.570
 if we prepare more than this it is good to use labels with indicated 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.170
 the name of vanity 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.170
 this to avoid confusion 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.810
 let's create a mini greenhouse 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.899
 I understand with a plastic bottle 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.620
 the fund was previously cut at par 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 the cap is removed 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.359
 first we prepare 2 with wave cells the wire 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.140
 we choose a long branch of flexible 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.330
 we ask the goddess on the ground 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 and we fix those two forks 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.389
 by a hook in contact with the ground must present 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.119
 at least one known 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.699
 me how to remove the leaves 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.699
 while leaving the terminal part 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.379
 we buy with the earth 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.879
 we cut the branch to remove it from the mother plant 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:40.299
 at the point of contact with the ground I love kenny good 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.139
 and while you nard the roots 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.139
 as we can see here it came spontaneously 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.709
 here it is possible to see clearly 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.459
 the portion of annamo in contact with the ground at the height of the knot you have put 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.880
 roots and to say your germonic bike 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.050
 from a plastic bag for potting soil 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.120
 reciprocate 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.779
 a rectangle 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.069
 we will need to comment oil pair our machine 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.550
 we wish John 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.700
 in the 12 years 80's two centimeters 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.939
 in the bark 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.100
 we practice under a gem 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.089
 incision 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.289
 do not start an inch and a half to two inches 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.439
 we put a piece of stintino under the 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.439
 bark time 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.119
 and we wrap the unknown love 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.059
 at the height of the lynxes 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:59.019
 each piece of plastic cut previously and we write 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:01.450
 leaving the part 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.450
 dark 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:09.449
 we therefore ask for the lower part with an artichokes 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.439
 we fill bigne with peat 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.439
 unit 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.409
 therefore we also see the upper part 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.690
 friends will develop in about two months
