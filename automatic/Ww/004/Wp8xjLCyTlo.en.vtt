trick<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.100> boss<00:00:53.309> fight<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.000> there's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
trick to this boss fight is that there's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.319 
trick to this boss fight is that there's
four<00:00:54.600> kings<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.920> kill

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
four kings that you have to kill

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.160 
four kings that you have to kill
obviously<00:00:57.329> by<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> name<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> video<00:00:57.989> and

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
obviously by the name of the video and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
obviously by the name of the video and
they<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.800> basically<00:01:02.129> Reece<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
they are they basically Reece like the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.730 
they are they basically Reece like the
they<00:01:03.899> spawn<00:01:04.260> after<00:01:04.589> you've<00:01:05.460> killed<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.850> or

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
they spawn after you've killed one or

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.380 
they spawn after you've killed one or
after<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> certain<00:01:07.950> amount<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> time<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
after a certain amount of time so the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
after a certain amount of time so the
idea<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.810> kill<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.560> guys<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.189> quickly

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
idea is just kill these guys as quickly

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
idea is just kill these guys as quickly
as<00:01:11.760> humanly<00:01:11.909> possible<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.780> keep<00:01:12.810> chopping

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
as humanly possible just keep chopping

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.490 
as humanly possible just keep chopping
away<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.570> use<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> green<00:01:15.960> blossom

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
away at them and use the green blossom

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.010 
away at them and use the green blossom
to<00:01:17.479> increase<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.720> stamina<00:01:19.110> recovery<00:01:19.830> rate

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
to increase your stamina recovery rate

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.230 
to increase your stamina recovery rate
and<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.320> grabbed<00:01:22.530> by<00:01:22.650> them<00:01:22.860> they're

so<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.280> keep<00:01:26.400> chopping<00:01:26.610> away<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> Kings

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so just keep chopping away the Kings

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
so just keep chopping away the Kings
they<00:01:27.930> died<00:01:28.280> after<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.960> quarter<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.229> entire

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
they died after a quarter of that entire

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.179 
they died after a quarter of that entire
health<00:01:32.340> bar<00:01:32.640> bar<00:01:33.299> disappears<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
health bar bar disappears or like you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.800 
health bar bar disappears or like you
get<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> quarter<00:01:36.119> mark<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> total

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
get to the quarter mark on that total

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270 
get to the quarter mark on that total
health<00:01:36.960> bar<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.650> strange

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
health bar but it's kind of strange

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.910 
health bar but it's kind of strange
because<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.850> keep<00:01:39.060> chopping<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.689> as

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
because you can keep chopping them as

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.050 
because you can keep chopping them as
they're<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.070> disappearing<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.790> that

they're like disappearing like that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.899 
they're like disappearing like that
which<00:01:42.750> basically<00:01:43.229> does<00:01:43.560> damage<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> next

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
which basically does damage to the next

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.389 
hard on new game+ in new game+ plus a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
new game + + + because you can't kill

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
new game + + + because you can't kill
these<00:02:05.610> guys<00:02:05.820> fast<00:02:06.329> enough<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:10.470> only<00:02:10.649> be

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
these guys fast enough to to only be

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.449 
these guys fast enough to to only be
fighting<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:12.060> at<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> time

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
fighting one of them at a time

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.849 
fighting one of them at a time
so<00:02:13.609> it's<00:02:14.030> more<00:02:14.329> of<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.480> challenge<00:02:14.689> of<00:02:15.079> just

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
so it's more of a challenge of just

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.949 
so it's more of a challenge of just
doing<00:02:15.950> enough<00:02:16.250> damage<00:02:16.280> quickly<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:17.239> getting

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
doing enough damage quickly and getting

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.440 
doing enough damage quickly and getting
through<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.430> but<00:02:19.430> as<00:02:19.579> you<00:02:19.609> can<00:02:19.790> see<00:02:19.879> on<00:02:20.209> just

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
through it but as you can see on just

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.229 
through it but as you can see on just
the<00:02:20.599> defaults<00:02:21.200> new<00:02:21.409> game<00:02:21.620> I'm<00:02:22.090> having<00:02:23.090> no

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
the defaults new game I'm having no

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.550 
the defaults new game I'm having no
problems<00:02:23.629> at<00:02:23.750> all

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.770 

also<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.620> can<00:02:27.980> block<00:02:28.790> almost<00:02:29.120> all<00:02:29.299> there<00:02:29.540> like

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
also you can block almost all there like

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.190 
also you can block almost all there like
all<00:02:29.989> their<00:02:30.590> attacks<00:02:30.950> are<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.930> straight

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
all their attacks are just straight

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.800 
all their attacks are just straight
physical<00:02:33.709> damage<00:02:34.010> there's<00:02:34.280> no<00:02:34.629> magic<00:02:35.629> damage

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
physical damage there's no magic damage

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.410 
physical damage there's no magic damage
attacks<00:02:36.260> but<00:02:36.739> they<00:02:37.099> can<00:02:37.639> grab<00:02:37.969> you<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:38.120> that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
attacks but they can grab you like that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.970 
attacks but they can grab you like that
but<00:02:38.629> they<00:02:38.840> don't<00:02:39.019> do<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> ton<00:02:39.319> of<00:02:39.560> damage<00:02:39.769> so

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
but they don't do a ton of damage so

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.039 
but they don't do a ton of damage so
it's<00:02:40.250> not<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.430> big<00:02:40.639> deal<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:41.060> feel<00:02:41.689> like<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.930> is

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
it's not a big deal I feel like this is

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.449 
it's not a big deal I feel like this is
one<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.290> those<00:02:42.379> bosses<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> could<00:02:43.340> have

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
one of those bosses that I could have

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.599 
one of those bosses that I could have
done<00:02:43.639> oh<00:02:44.000> no<00:02:44.569> because<00:02:45.379> I<00:02:45.829> was<00:02:46.340> going<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.519> say

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
done oh no because I was going to say

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:47.619 
done oh no because I was going to say
that<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.760> think<00:02:46.849> I<00:02:47.090> could<00:02:47.239> have<00:02:47.329> done<00:02:47.359> this<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
that I think I could have done this a

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.240 
that I think I could have done this a
little<00:02:47.720> bit<00:02:47.930> earlier<00:02:48.319> on<00:02:48.379> and<00:02:48.889> I<00:02:48.950> did<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.159> out

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
little bit earlier on and I did it out

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.679 
little bit earlier on and I did it out
of<00:02:49.280> order<00:02:49.459> kinda<00:02:49.909> like<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.090> pinwheel<00:02:50.329> boss

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
of order kinda like a pinwheel boss

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:51.940 
of order kinda like a pinwheel boss
fight<00:02:50.989> but<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.290> don't<00:02:51.530> think<00:02:51.739> that's

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
fight but I don't think that's

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.830 
fight but I don't think that's
necessarily<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.639> case<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.150> think<00:02:53.629> I'm<00:02:53.720> just

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
necessarily the case I think I'm just

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.629 
necessarily the case I think I'm just
guessing<00:02:54.250> incorrectly<00:02:55.250> there<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:57.579> this<00:02:58.579> is

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
guessing incorrectly there and this is

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.339 
guessing incorrectly there and this is
the<00:02:59.060> last<00:03:00.549> major<00:03:01.549> soul<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.090> think<00:03:02.569> no<00:03:03.019> I

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
the last major soul I think no I

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.330 
the last major soul I think no I
shouldn't<00:03:03.859> say<00:03:04.010> that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
shouldn't say that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.039 
shouldn't say that
see<00:03:05.000> now<00:03:05.150> I'm<00:03:05.269> just<00:03:05.389> trying<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.629> fill<00:03:05.780> time<00:03:05.900> in

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
see now I'm just trying to fill time in

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.690 
see now I'm just trying to fill time in
making<00:03:06.169> things<00:03:06.439> up<00:03:06.680> anyway<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.459> keep

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
making things up anyway so just keep

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.300 
making things up anyway so just keep
chopping<00:03:07.879> away<00:03:08.120> at<00:03:08.299> this<00:03:08.419> dude<00:03:08.689> broomy<00:03:09.310> swords

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
chopping away at this dude broomy swords

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.759 
chopping away at this dude broomy swords
