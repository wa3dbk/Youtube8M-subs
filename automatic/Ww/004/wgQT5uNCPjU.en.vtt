and<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:47.809> printed<00:00:49.129> in<00:00:50.129> five<00:00:50.550> piece<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.300> board<00:00:52.309> we

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and I printed in five piece the board we

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
and I printed in five piece the board we
will<00:00:53.550> cut<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> seal<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.199> put<00:00:55.410> inside<00:00:55.829> now<00:00:56.550> you

things we will hello to put all the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.600 
things we will hello to put all the
parts<00:01:10.680> together<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.280> keep<00:01:11.670> together<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:13.610> we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
parts together and keep together so we

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.109 
parts together and keep together so we
will<00:01:15.030> start<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> cut<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> zero<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.130> try

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
will start to cut the the zero and try

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.060 
will start to cut the the zero and try
to<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.689> together<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.979> if

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to put all together and we will see if

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.719 
to put all together and we will see if
it<00:01:20.189> works<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.170> works<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.490> find

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
wheels with the board and try the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:37.650 
wheels with the board and try the
massive

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.290

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
okay oh you can see the board is builded

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.620 
okay oh you can see the board is builded
I<00:02:41.480> put<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.990> truck<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.530> put<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> wheel<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.640> just

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
I put the truck I put the wheel so just

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.460 
falls well how you say you see in the
video<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:06.360> just<00:03:06.659> little<00:03:07.049> problem<00:03:07.349> with

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
video I have just little problem with

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.410 
video I have just little problem with
the<00:03:07.590> back<00:03:07.739> parts<00:03:08.159> but<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.430> will<00:03:08.970> change<00:03:09.239> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the back parts but I will change the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.539 
the back parts but I will change the
design<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.080> maybe<00:03:10.260> flat<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.159> steel<00:03:11.370> rod

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
design to be maybe flat so the steel rod

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.050 
design to be maybe flat so the steel rod
can<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.819> go<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> hand<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.049> board<00:03:13.260> and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
can be go to the hand of the board and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.440 
can be go to the hand of the board and
still<00:03:15.060> hard<00:03:16.160> button<00:03:17.160> already<00:03:17.700> happy<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.150> will

description of the video and it's enough
I<00:03:24.299> think<00:03:24.840> we<00:03:25.170> will<00:03:25.440> see<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.010> end<00:03:26.099> of<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
I think we will see at the end of the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.059 
I think we will see at the end of the
video<00:03:26.579> maybe<00:03:26.940> some<00:03:27.629> short<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.470> pressure
