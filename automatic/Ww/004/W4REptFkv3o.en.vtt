seconds<00:00:36.950> that's<00:00:37.950> what<00:00:38.160> I've<00:00:38.250> already<00:00:38.550> done

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
seconds that's what I've already done

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
seconds that's what I've already done
here<00:00:40.280> I've<00:00:41.280> already<00:00:41.579> cut<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.960> hole<00:00:43.230> for

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
here I've already cut out my hole for

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.869 
here I've already cut out my hole for
the<00:00:43.680> box<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:47.039> box<00:00:47.100> has<00:00:47.520> got<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:48.450> 12

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
the box and this box has got for 12

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
the box and this box has got for 12
reason<00:00:50.879> why<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.239> polyfill<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> makes<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
reason why I put polyfill it makes the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.639 
reason why I put polyfill it makes the
box<00:00:53.059> act<00:00:54.059> larger<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> speaker<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
box act larger for the speaker the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.080 
box act larger for the speaker the
speaker<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:56.100> thinks<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> bigger

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
speaker actually thinks it's in a bigger

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.920 
speaker actually thinks it's in a bigger
box<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.489> why<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.789> use<00:00:59.940> polyfill<00:01:00.600> not

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
box and that's why you use polyfill not

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.150 
box and that's why you use polyfill not
to<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.170> better<00:01:01.379> sound<00:01:01.590> anything<00:01:01.800> just

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to get better sound anything just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.670 
to get better sound anything just
because<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> small<00:01:03.989> box<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
because this is a small box and the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
because this is a small box and the
speaker's<00:01:05.070> actually<00:01:05.430> need<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.810> cubic<00:01:06.810> feet

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
speaker's actually need more cubic feet

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
speaker's actually need more cubic feet
so<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.150> spray<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> spray

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
so I'm just going to spray out a spray

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:20.539 
so I'm just going to spray out a spray
glue<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.290> spray<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.950> back<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.340> this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
glue and then spray the back of this

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
glue and then spray the back of this
here<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.540> wait

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
here and what you want to do is wait

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.069 
here and what you want to do is wait
about<00:01:34.229> 30<00:01:34.710> seconds<00:01:35.479> before<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.780> actually<00:01:36.900> put

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
about 30 seconds before you actually put

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
about 30 seconds before you actually put
it<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.350> arm<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.770> it'd<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.920> too<00:01:38.189> slippery<00:01:38.610> so

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
it on arm so it'd be too slippery so
it'll<00:01:39.090> start<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.540> tacky<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:41.040> 30

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
wire connections here so you still get

00:02:50.629 --> 00:03:04.729 
wire connections here so you still get
to<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.840> wires<00:02:51.370> don't<00:02:52.370> have<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:52.700> perfect

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
though okay so that's how you polyfill

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.060 
though okay so that's how you polyfill
your<00:04:32.110> box<00:04:32.289> you<00:04:32.410> don't<00:04:32.470> want<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.710> put<00:04:32.860> too<00:04:33.039> much

I got everything
we<00:04:36.490> got<00:04:36.639> one<00:04:36.880> layer<00:04:37.410> all<00:04:38.410> glue<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.070> sides

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
we got one layer all glue to the sides

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
we got one layer all glue to the sides
and<00:04:41.260> what<00:04:42.250> I'll<00:04:42.400> do<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:43.560> take<00:04:44.560> my<00:04:44.770> second<00:04:45.160> layer

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
and what I'll do is take my second layer

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.219 
and what I'll do is take my second layer
and<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.789> stuff<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.120> in<00:04:46.210> there<00:04:46.419> also<00:04:46.720> glue<00:04:47.110> it

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
and just stuff it in there also glue it

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.260 
and just stuff it in there also glue it
make<00:04:47.380> sure<00:04:47.560> make<00:04:48.430> sure<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.729> glue<00:04:48.910> it<00:04:48.940> cuz<00:04:49.180> if

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
make sure make sure you glue it cuz if

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.460 
make sure make sure you glue it cuz if
you<00:04:49.330> don't<00:04:49.510> glue<00:04:49.660> this<00:04:49.810> stuff<00:04:50.080> will<00:04:50.200> flop

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
you don't glue this stuff will flop

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.529 
you don't glue this stuff will flop
around<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:51.669> we'll<00:04:51.820> get<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.000> caught<00:04:52.150> into<00:04:52.330> your

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
around and we'll get it caught into your

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.409 
around and we'll get it caught into your
speaker's<00:04:53.520> eventually<00:04:54.520> burning<00:04:54.760> voice<00:04:55.060> coils

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
speaker's eventually burning voice coils

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.779 
speaker's eventually burning voice coils
out<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:56.889> want<00:04:57.039> about<00:04:57.099> two<00:04:57.400> layers<00:04:57.639> you

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
out so you want about two layers you

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:58.830 
out so you want about two layers you
don't<00:04:57.910> want<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.090> put<00:04:58.210> too<00:04:58.360> much<00:04:58.479> in<00:04:58.660> there<00:04:58.690> if

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
don't want to put too much in there if

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.040 
don't want to put too much in there if
you<00:04:58.930> over<00:04:59.110> stuff<00:04:59.349> it<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.919> defeats<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.310> purpose

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
you over stuff it it defeats the purpose

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.820 
you over stuff it it defeats the purpose
so<00:05:02.280> that's<00:05:03.280> how<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.490> put<00:05:03.760> a<00:05:03.900> polyfill<00:05:04.900> in<00:05:05.740> a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
so that's how you put a polyfill in a

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.219 
so that's how you put a polyfill in a
speaker<00:05:06.099> box<00:05:06.510> any<00:05:07.510> questions<00:05:07.870> just<00:05:07.990> leave<00:05:08.169> a

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
speaker box any questions just leave a

speaker box any questions just leave a
comment<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:08.740> I'll<00:05:08.800> get<00:05:08.919> back<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.099> you<00:05:09.340> as<00:05:09.520> soon
