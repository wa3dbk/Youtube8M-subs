00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
i will say i'll talk a little bit about

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.120 
i will say i'll talk a little bit about
you<00:00:18.449> know<00:00:18.480> weapons<00:00:18.960> here<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.619> second<00:00:19.980> but

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
you know weapons here in a second but

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.120 
you know weapons here in a second but
i've<00:00:20.760> been<00:00:20.939> using<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.240> lot<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.449> weapons<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.130> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
i've been using a lot of weapons and it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.370 
i've been using a lot of weapons and it
seems<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.400> assault<00:00:23.789> rifles<00:00:24.119> are<00:00:24.380> probably

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
seems like assault rifles are probably

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.859 
seems like assault rifles are probably
the<00:00:25.619> go-to<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.340> right<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.119> that's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the go-to as if right now but that's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.140 
the go-to as if right now but that's
that's<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.470> stopping<00:00:28.980> me<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.519> from<00:00:29.730> using

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
that's not stopping me at all from using

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.569 
that's not stopping me at all from using
a<00:00:30.269> whole<00:00:30.539> lot<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> stuff<00:00:31.399> whenever<00:00:32.399> i'm

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
a whole lot of stuff whenever i'm

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.250 
a whole lot of stuff whenever i'm
streaming<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.180> i've<00:00:33.360> been<00:00:33.390> joining<00:00:33.780> myself

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
streaming so i've been joining myself

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
streaming so i've been joining myself
and<00:00:34.469> i<00:00:34.530> hope<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.059> guys<00:00:36.210> that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and i hope that some of you guys that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.520 
and i hope that some of you guys that
have<00:00:36.540> picked<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.079> been<00:00:37.260> enjoying

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
have picked it up have been enjoying

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
have picked it up have been enjoying
yourself<00:00:37.980> too<00:00:38.010> i<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.250> there's<00:00:38.550> some<00:00:38.790> i<00:00:39.000> think

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
yourself too i know there's some i think

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
yourself too i know there's some i think
it's<00:00:39.660> mostly<00:00:39.989> positive<00:00:40.340> feedback<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.670> far

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's mostly positive feedback so far

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000 
it's mostly positive feedback so far
we'll<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.750> how<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.379> things<00:00:43.590> go<00:00:43.829> when

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
we'll see how you know things go when

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.650 
we'll see how you know things go when
people<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> grace<00:00:45.149> period<00:00:45.629> for

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
people get out of that grace period for

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720 
people get out of that grace period for
the<00:00:45.989> game<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:47.370> don't<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the game and they don't have the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.830 
the game and they don't have the
blinders<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.440> i<00:00:49.469> think<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
blinders on but you know i think that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.569 
blinders on but you know i think that
with<00:00:51.840> sledgehammers<00:00:52.250> entering<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> call<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
with sledgehammers entering the call of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
with sledgehammers entering the call of
duty<00:00:53.610> franchise<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> step<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> right

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
duty franchise is a step in the right

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
duty franchise is a step in the right
direction<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:56.250> movement<00:00:56.789> system<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.270> really

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
direction the movement system is really

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
direction the movement system is really
good<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.050> quite<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.559> good<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.859> titanfall<00:00:59.390> but

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
good not quite as good as titanfall but

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
good not quite as good as titanfall but
it's<00:01:00.539> certainly<00:01:00.780> good<00:01:01.230> there's<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> be

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it's certainly good there's going to be

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
it's certainly good there's going to be
a<00:01:02.100> lot<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> parallels<00:01:02.820> I've<00:01:03.210> already<00:01:03.390> watched

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a lot of parallels I've already watched

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.660 
a lot of parallels I've already watched
a<00:01:03.840> couple<00:01:03.960> videos<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:05.220> different

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
a couple videos now from different

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
a couple videos now from different
youtubers<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.799> one-to-one

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
youtubers that make that one-to-one

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.300 
youtubers that make that one-to-one
connection<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.990> titanfall<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
connection to titanfall with the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.920 
connection to titanfall with the
movement<00:01:11.520> system<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.270> saying<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
movement system and saying that this is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
movement system and saying that this is
not<00:01:13.110> quite<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.470> good<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.830> titanfall<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.520> quite

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
not quite as good as titanfall not quite

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.800 
not quite as good as titanfall not quite
as<00:01:14.880> smooth<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:16.549> but<00:01:17.549> i<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:18.270> say<00:01:18.390> it's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
as smooth and but i should say it's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.800 
as smooth and but i should say it's
still<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.580> no<00:01:21.299> knock<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
still good and that's that's no knock on

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.539 
still good and that's that's no knock on
a<00:01:21.840> sledgehammer<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.890> being<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.310> good<00:01:23.430> as

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
a sledgehammer for not being as good as

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.830 
a sledgehammer for not being as good as
titanfall<00:01:24.259> certainly<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.009> pretty<00:01:26.369> hard

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
titanfall certainly you know pretty hard

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.420 
titanfall certainly you know pretty hard
movement<00:01:27.840> system<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.439> replicate<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.040> terms<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
movement system to replicate in terms of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.200 
movement system to replicate in terms of
just<00:01:29.579> fluidity<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> map<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:32.729> each<00:01:32.970> map

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
just fluidity in the map so or each map

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
just fluidity in the map so or each map
I<00:01:33.420> should<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.079> mean<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:34.619> did<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> nice

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I should say so I mean they did a nice

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
I should say so I mean they did a nice
job<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> overall<00:01:35.909> design<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> maps

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
job with the overall design of the maps

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
job with the overall design of the maps
and<00:01:36.960> how<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.200> flow<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> movement

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and how they flow with the movement

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.219 
and how they flow with the movement
system<00:01:38.430> weapons<00:01:39.420> feel<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> most<00:01:40.020> part

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
system weapons feel for the most part

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.889 
system weapons feel for the most part
pretty<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.909> know<00:01:41.939> assault<00:01:42.420> rifles<00:01:42.750> are

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
pretty good you know assault rifles are

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.880 
pretty good you know assault rifles are
pretty<00:01:43.380> dominant<00:01:44.009> right<00:01:44.280> now<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:45.619> most<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
pretty dominant right now in most of the

warfare 3 and ghosts were not very good

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.990 
warfare 3 and ghosts were not very good
games<00:02:49.960> in<00:02:50.200> my<00:02:50.320> opinion<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.700> call<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.910> duty

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
games in my opinion for the call of duty

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.820 
games in my opinion for the call of duty
entry<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.660> those<00:02:52.750> are<00:02:52.900> both<00:02:52.990> by<00:02:53.230> infinity

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
entry and those are both by infinity

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.680 
entry and those are both by infinity
ward's<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:55.000> know<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.150> would<00:02:55.270> like<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.450> see

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
ward's so you know I would like to see

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.440 
ward's so you know I would like to see
them<00:02:55.870> try<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.140> step<00:02:56.800> up<00:02:57.010> on<00:02:57.190> their<00:02:57.370> next<00:02:57.730> entry

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
I think they have a little while like

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.440 
I think they have a little while like
two<00:03:00.220> years<00:03:00.250> or<00:03:00.640> something<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.360> the

and got knifed in the back and that is
what<00:03:19.810> makes<00:03:19.930> this<00:03:20.200> game<00:03:20.440> fun<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.980> me<00:03:21.100> there<00:03:21.340> is

what makes this game fun to me there is

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.180 
what makes this game fun to me there is
a<00:03:21.660> certain<00:03:22.660> level<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:23.110> skill<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.800> think<00:03:24.100> a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
a certain level of skill that I think a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.830 
a certain level of skill that I think a
lot<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.370> Call<00:03:24.640> of<00:03:24.670> Duty<00:03:25.030> players<00:03:25.300> probably

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
lot of Call of Duty players probably

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.230 
lot of Call of Duty players probably
aren't<00:03:26.380> aware<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.680> or<00:03:27.280> haven't<00:03:27.970> had<00:03:28.090> to

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.210 
aren't aware of or haven't had to
experience<00:03:28.690> because<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.410> game<00:03:29.590> has<00:03:29.620> been<00:03:29.920> so

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
experience because the game has been so

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.730 
experience because the game has been so
flat<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:31.030> they<00:03:31.690> haven't<00:03:31.900> really<00:03:32.320> had<00:03:32.500> to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
flat that they haven't really had to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.650 
flat that they haven't really had to
look<00:03:32.950> above<00:03:33.250> them<00:03:33.490> in<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.790> mahboob<00:03:34.180> them<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.600> you

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
look above them in a mahboob them so you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.380 
look above them in a mahboob them so you
see<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.900> lot<00:03:34.960> of<00:03:35.110> people<00:03:35.410> still<00:03:35.650> struggling<00:03:36.490> so

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
see a lot of people still struggling so

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.850 
see a lot of people still struggling so
far<00:03:37.630> with<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.930> movement<00:03:38.140> system<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.710> we're

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
far with the movement system and we're

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.890 
far with the movement system and we're
we're<00:03:39.250> only<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.550> week<00:03:39.760> 1<00:03:40.000> people<00:03:40.390> saw<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.810> know

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.050 
we're only in week 1 people saw you know
I<00:03:40.930> expect<00:03:41.020> players<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.710> get<00:03:42.060> drastically

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
I expect players to get drastically

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.660 
I expect players to get drastically
better<00:03:43.440> over<00:03:44.440> time<00:03:44.470> but<00:03:45.100> it's<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.460> same<00:03:45.640> thing

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
better over time but it's the same thing

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.520 
better over time but it's the same thing
I<00:03:45.940> kind<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.210> saw<00:03:46.390> in<00:03:46.540> titanfall<00:03:46.930> people

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
know having this type of movement system

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.610 
know having this type of movement system
is<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.650> time<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.040> kill<00:04:03.250> feels<00:04:03.640> extremely<00:04:04.620> fast

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
is the time to kill feels extremely fast

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.210

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
died just as fast if not faster then

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.439 
died just as fast if not faster then
when<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:33.220> know<00:04:33.250> don't<00:04:33.639> activate<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.240> so

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
when you you know don't activate it so

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.540 
when you you know don't activate it so
you<00:04:35.169> know<00:04:35.289> that<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:35.919> try<00:04:36.069> to<00:04:36.130> draw<00:04:36.340> some

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550

parallels<00:04:36.699> between<00:04:37.150> some<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.780> abilities

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
parallels between some of the abilities

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.960 
parallels between some of the abilities
in<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.410> game<00:04:38.500> but<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.069> time<00:04:39.520> they<00:04:39.669> killin

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
in the game but the time they killin

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.050 
in the game but the time they killin
call<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.210> duty<00:04:40.449> is<00:04:40.509> just<00:04:40.720> ridiculously<00:04:41.440> fast

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
call of duty is just ridiculously fast

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.240 
call of duty is just ridiculously fast
so<00:04:43.060> until<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.720> get<00:04:44.020> my<00:04:44.199> ID<00:04:44.500> say<00:04:44.710> muscle<00:04:45.099> memory

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
so until I get my ID say muscle memory

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.950 
so until I get my ID say muscle memory
mechanics<00:04:45.940> down<00:04:46.120> it's<00:04:46.330> going<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.539> be<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.660> little

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
mechanics down it's going to be a little

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.439
