about feet Stamper and feed Stamper

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.360 
about feet Stamper and feed Stamper
allows<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> really<00:00:07.379> manipulate<00:00:08.189> your

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
allows you to really manipulate your

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.850 
allows you to really manipulate your
feed<00:00:08.700> that's<00:00:08.940> being<00:00:09.210> brought<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.380> let's

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
feed that's being brought in so let's

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.209 
feed that's being brought in so let's
say<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.370> have<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> feed<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.900> any<00:00:13.110> type<00:00:13.380> but<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
say you have a feed of any type but the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.220 
say you have a feed of any type but the
data<00:00:14.370> isn't<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:15.120> quite<00:00:15.420> exactly<00:00:15.900> what<00:00:16.109> you'd

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
data isn't just quite exactly what you'd

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.490 
data isn't just quite exactly what you'd
like<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.670> manipulate<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.449> data<00:00:18.510> while

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
like you can manipulate that data while

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.140 
like you can manipulate that data while
it's<00:00:19.529> importing<00:00:20.250> instead<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.609> having<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.000> go

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
it's importing instead of having to go

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.640 
it's importing instead of having to go
back<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.600> change<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.990> or<00:00:22.140> anything<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.619> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
back and change it or anything like that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.269 
back and change it or anything like that
and<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:24.269> feed<00:00:24.570> Stamper<00:00:25.080> gives<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.130> its

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
and as feed Stamper gives in its

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.160 
and as feed Stamper gives in its
examples<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.119> replace<00:00:27.449> every<00:00:27.810> instance

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
examples you can replace every instance

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.720 
examples you can replace every instance
of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> word<00:00:28.470> dog<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.220> cat

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of the word dog with cat

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.609 
of the word dog with cat
you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.179> filter<00:00:30.420> items<00:00:30.810> based<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.170> keywords

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
you can filter items based on keywords

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
you can filter items based on keywords
and<00:00:31.800> vocabularies<00:00:32.489> make<00:00:32.669> every<00:00:32.969> letter

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and vocabularies make every letter

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 
and vocabularies make every letter
uppercase<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.840> mean<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.290> don't<00:00:34.380> know<00:00:34.530> why<00:00:34.649> I'd

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
uppercase I mean I don't know why I'd

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.569 
uppercase I mean I don't know why I'd
wanna<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.340> could<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
wanna do that because you could do that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450 
wanna do that because you could do that
with<00:00:35.700> CSS<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.770> break<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> comma<00:00:38.160> separated

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
with CSS but break a comma separated

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
with CSS but break a comma separated
into<00:00:39.030> lists<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.719> words<00:00:40.020> including<00:00:40.559> taxonomy

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
into lists into words including taxonomy

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.270 
into lists into words including taxonomy
terms<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> list<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.870> comma

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
terms so if you have a list of comma

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
terms so if you have a list of comma
separated<00:00:44.280> values<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
separated values you you know you can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.590 
separated values you you know you can
have<00:00:45.840> those<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.200> taxonomy<00:00:46.770> terms<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:48.420> can

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
have those be taxonomy terms you can

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
have those be taxonomy terms you can
combine<00:00:48.930> separate<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:49.920> name<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.280> last

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
combine separate first name and last

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
combine separate first name and last
name<00:00:50.640> fields<00:00:51.180> into<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.660> name<00:00:52.079> field<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.129> can

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
name fields into one name field you can

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
name fields into one name field you can
convert<00:00:53.610> URLs<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.390> relative<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.960> absolute

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
convert URLs from relative to absolute

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260 
convert URLs from relative to absolute
so<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.460> sorts<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> cool<00:00:56.969> stuff<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
so there's all sorts of cool stuff you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.319 
so there's all sorts of cool stuff you
can<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.160> need<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> modify

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
can do and really if you need to modify

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.479 
can do and really if you need to modify
your<00:01:00.780> feet<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.170> any<00:01:01.320> way<00:01:01.469> feed<00:01:01.859> Stamper<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
your feet in any way feed Stamper is

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.369 
your feet in any way feed Stamper is
pretty<00:01:02.820> much<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> way<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> okay

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
pretty much the way to do it okay

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.170 
pretty much the way to do it okay
so<00:01:04.860> by<00:01:05.010> now<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> should<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.909> install

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so by now you should know how to install

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
so by now you should know how to install
a<00:01:06.420> module<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.500> module<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.310> modules

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
a module I have my module in my modules

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.719 
a module I have my module in my modules
folder<00:01:11.420> I'm<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.159> feeds<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
folder I'm gonna go to feeds here and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.149 
folder I'm gonna go to feeds here and
I'm<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.479> select<00:01:15.659> feeds<00:01:16.229> tamper<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
I'm going to select feeds tamper and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.170 
I'm going to select feeds tamper and
feeds<00:01:17.670> tamper<00:01:18.210> UI<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.500> monkey<00:01:19.799> save<00:01:20.180> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
feeds tamper UI and a monkey save and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
feeds tamper UI and a monkey save and
yeah<00:01:21.780> because<00:01:21.960> without<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> UI<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> can't

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
yeah because without the UI you can't

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.289 
yeah because without the UI you can't
really<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.430> much<00:01:23.640> done<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:28.610> now<00:01:29.610> let's<00:01:30.090> check

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
really get much done so now let's check

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.429 
really get much done so now let's check
out<00:01:30.689> our<00:01:30.930> feed

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
out our feed

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.010 
out our feed
so<00:01:32.220> here's<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> RSS<00:01:33.210> feed<00:01:33.450> we're<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> be

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
so here's the RSS feed we're going to be

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.740 
so here's the RSS feed we're going to be
importing<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.850> let's<00:01:35.850> check<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.420> some<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
importing and let's check out some of

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.100 
importing and let's check out some of
this<00:01:36.840> stuff<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> let's<00:01:39.090> say<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.630> wanted<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
this stuff so let's say we wanted to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.920 
this stuff so let's say we wanted to
just<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:41.460> specific<00:01:42.090> content<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.780> want

we wanted okay so what we're going to go

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.149 
we wanted okay so what we're going to go
from<00:01:47.100> structure<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:49.110> tamper<00:01:49.890> which

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
from structure is in to tamper which

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
from structure is in to tamper which
should<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.700> under<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.149> operations<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
should now be under your operations so

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
description tag is going into the body

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.749 
description tag is going into the body
so<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.590> check<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.920> our<00:02:05.009> feed<00:02:05.250> here's<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
so if we check out our feed here's the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.570 
so if we check out our feed here's the
description<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.689> here's<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> title<00:02:08.069> really

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
description and here's the title really

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.059 
description and here's the title really
are<00:02:08.789> only<00:02:08.910> two<00:02:09.209> things<00:02:09.619> well<00:02:10.619> let's<00:02:10.800> try<00:02:11.009> to

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
are only two things well let's try to

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.460 
are only two things well let's try to
modify<00:02:11.550> these<00:02:11.610> things<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.660> let's<00:02:12.930> add<00:02:13.080> up

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
modify these things so let's add up

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.020 
modify these things so let's add up
into<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> title<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:14.400> how<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.880> modify

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
into the title to see how we can modify

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270 
into the title to see how we can modify
this<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.710> keyword

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
this so you can have it be a keyword

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.130 
this so you can have it be a keyword
filter<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.340> strip<00:02:20.730> all<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.970> HTML<00:02:21.420> make

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
filter you can strip all the HTML make

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.930 
filter you can strip all the HTML make
URLs<00:02:22.620> absolute<00:02:23.100> all<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.490> stuff<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.790> was

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
URLs absolute all this stuff I was

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.080 
URLs absolute all this stuff I was
showing<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.300> before<00:02:24.330> under<00:02:24.900> there<00:02:25.020> examples

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
showing you before under there examples

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.080 
showing you before under there examples
calculate<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.150> hash<00:02:27.420> value<00:02:28.100> rewrite<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.280> so

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
calculate a hash value rewrite it so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.760 
calculate a hash value rewrite it so
let's<00:02:30.630> actually<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:31.050> something<00:02:31.290> really

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
let's actually do something really

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.380 
let's actually do something really
obvious<00:02:31.950> we're<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.620> truncate<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.390> how

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
obvious we're going to truncate and how

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.120 
obvious we're going to truncate and how
many<00:02:36.570> numbers<00:02:37.050> do<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.290> want<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.650> text<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> be

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
many numbers do we want this text to be

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.970 
many numbers do we want this text to be
limited<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.520> we'll<00:02:38.880> say<00:02:39.290> we'll<00:02:40.290> say<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.710> five

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
limited to we'll say we'll say it's five

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.160 
limited to we'll say we'll say it's five
characters<00:02:41.610> okay<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.210> we'll<00:02:42.390> add<00:02:42.600> ellipses

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
characters okay and we'll add ellipses

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.170 
characters okay and we'll add ellipses
so<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:44.520> fun<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.880> wouldn't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
so this is just for fun I wouldn't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.150 
so this is just for fun I wouldn't
actually<00:02:45.300> want<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.690> do<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.590> let's<00:02:46.830> say

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
actually want to do this but let's say

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.530 
actually want to do this but let's say
you<00:02:47.580> didn't<00:02:47.790> want<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.970> bring<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.330> whole

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
you didn't want to bring this whole

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.390 
you didn't want to bring this whole
thing<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.590> wanted<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> truncate<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
thing and you just wanted to truncate it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.880 
thing and you just wanted to truncate it
at<00:02:50.520> ellipses<00:02:51.180> okay<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:51.990> now<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.350> value<00:02:52.830> is

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
at ellipses okay so now that value is

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
at ellipses okay so now that value is
actually<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.790> come<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.180> truncated<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
actually going to come in truncated and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.930 
actually going to come in truncated and
let's<00:02:55.590> add<00:02:55.740> something<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.550> description

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
let's add something for the description

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.910 
let's add something for the description
as<00:02:57.240> well<00:02:57.980> let's<00:02:58.980> go<00:02:59.130> to<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:01.320> tree<00:03:01.470> let's<00:03:01.709> see

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
as well let's go to the tree let's see

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.100 
as well let's go to the tree let's see
what<00:03:02.610> kind<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.880> keyword<00:03:03.360> there<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.959> this

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
what kind of keyword there is in this

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.160 
what kind of keyword there is in this
feed<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> word<00:03:06.270> album<00:03:06.540> shows<00:03:06.959> up

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
feed so the word album shows up

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.400 
feed so the word album shows up
sometimes<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.300> have<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.630> filter<00:03:10.290> on

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
sometimes so we have this filter on

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.050 
sometimes so we have this filter on
album<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.010> that's<00:03:11.130> going<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.340> look<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:11.760> any

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
album and that's going to look for any

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.290 
album and that's going to look for any
word<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.530> item<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.190> has<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.550> word<00:03:14.730> album

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
word in the item that has the word album

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.630 
word in the item that has the word album
in<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.959> description<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.770> it's<00:03:17.160> only<00:03:17.370> going

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
in the description and it's only going

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.460 
in the description and it's only going
to<00:03:17.700> tamper<00:03:18.239> those<00:03:18.420> ones<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.840> we're<00:03:19.019> saying<00:03:19.230> if

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
to tamper those ones so we're saying if

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.150 
to tamper those ones so we're saying if
it<00:03:19.800> has<00:03:19.950> an<00:03:20.070> album<00:03:20.280> we<00:03:20.730> want<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.500> change<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.680> to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
it has an album we want to change it to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.060 
it has an album we want to change it to
you<00:03:23.610> know<00:03:24.150> have<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.600> ellipses<00:03:25.019> in<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.890> real

you know have the ellipses in the real

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.070 
you know have the ellipses in the real
life<00:03:26.760> situation<00:03:27.420> maybe<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.690> could<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
life situation maybe you could have the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.259 
life situation maybe you could have the
title<00:03:28.410> change<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.010> something<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.880> album
