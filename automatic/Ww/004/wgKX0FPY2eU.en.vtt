whatever it's called or the game battles
that's<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.500> one<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.650> couldn't<00:05:44.919> remember

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
that's the one I couldn't remember

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.490 
that's the one I couldn't remember
whether<00:05:46.210> their<00:05:46.510> admins<00:05:46.960> allow<00:05:47.200> you<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.470> use

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
whether their admins allow you to use

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.620 
whether their admins allow you to use
this<00:05:47.770> device<00:05:47.950> now<00:05:48.340> of<00:05:48.430> course<00:05:48.610> they<00:05:49.300> are

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
this device now of course they are

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.409 
this device now of course they are
sticklers<00:05:50.080> for<00:05:50.520> everyone<00:05:51.520> using<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.180> same

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
sticklers for everyone using the same

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.870 
sticklers for everyone using the same
device<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.169> that's<00:05:53.320> more<00:05:54.100> than<00:05:54.160> in<00:05:54.610> their

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
device and that's more than in their

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.600 
device and that's more than in their
rights<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:56.680> you<00:05:57.070> wouldn't<00:05:57.310> be<00:05:57.400> able<00:05:57.460> to

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
rights and so you wouldn't be able to

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.400 
rights and so you wouldn't be able to
use<00:05:57.730> this<00:05:57.850> device<00:05:58.030> in<00:05:58.300> that<00:05:58.450> but<00:05:58.630> of<00:05:59.020> course<00:05:59.260> I

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
use this device in that but of course I

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.490 
use this device in that but of course I
don't<00:05:59.680> do<00:06:00.250> any<00:06:00.640> of<00:06:00.970> that<00:06:01.000> goodness<00:06:01.510> I<00:06:01.900> just
