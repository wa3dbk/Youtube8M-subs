00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 there is a very good youtube wanted 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 commenting very good I bring you a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.990
 piece of employment in league mode arrasan 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 demolished a new episode and good here 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.960
 you are watching me play with the mmc in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.509
 no episode that has been brought 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.769
 it implied that of it rocks if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 so good first job league with the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 msc and apart then you are seeing the title 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.160
 which it is a piece of starting as 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.689
 he said a 50 3 with a run of 20 ni 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 much less did I think to get that out when 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 I was playing this game because as 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.240
 you will see there is a moment in the implies if 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 the beginning you will see in terms of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.630
 ghosts to this pair of casualties I'll go for that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 he replied they kill me and we stayed 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.960
 three against four since the others the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 other enemies will be a team that is what 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.370
 good of this that good was preseason 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.800
 and that the enemy team was not too 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.469
 well even so they were not very very 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.610
 banks and play I knew not but I get 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.899
 make me a very good level match 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.370
 staff was playing with people who did not 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.870
 he knew nothing about the team that is not 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.840
 I could communicate with them I do not know how 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 play and all that and then at that moment 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.660
 as I exist that the partner is caught in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.399
 the part and we stayed three for four 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 that if I always tell you it's a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.780
 very very big disadvantage in competitive 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.399
 play three people against four then 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.830
 What I decide is to try to play a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.810
 little bit more campero is worth so to speak 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 because then because I need insurer 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.439
 to hold the points so that they come 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.759
 the companions as you see quickly 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.710
 although I was taking the points I'm going 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.939
 to respawn to force the responds 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.130
 colleagues to try that the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.450
 enemies do not kill me and get out very far 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.920
 because if we did not have to travel all 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.240
 the map and good as I'm seeing in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 it reaches the partners and it's basically 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.960
 it was mine is my goal throughout the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 starting to try that the enemies do not 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.590
 remove the rest try to hold them 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 that do not happen and that the comrades join 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 points and is that really as you know 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.869
 when competitive game normally 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.899
 I do long gun function that is 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.520
 game of air but lately with the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.929
 theme of the land is that it is with a vine 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.659
 in victory and I do not meet 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.060
 lately more at ease playing from smg 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.110
 but perhaps not of objective objectivity that would be 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.459
 go to the point that good that from time to time 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.470
 when yes you see how the point came 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.789
 but a little bit of slayer that they 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.799
 it hurts because it is the person who is dedicated to 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.709
 kill that is dedicated to move then a 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.970
 little backups that is dedicated to 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.369
 help the team do a bit of 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.750
 support make casualties not for that enemy 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.130
 can enter at the point 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.140
 problem with peers for entering 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.250
 like the point and make the game a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.810
 little bit more bearable then in this 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.700
 heading so to speak I have that job 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.739
 no slayer work that would be a little bit 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.390
 against the theme of respawn kill take out 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.530
 gusts and all that not like I've seen 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.700
 I wanted to ensure 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 helicopter because the helicopter 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.440
 I also tell you that in competitive but 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.660
 you get out if the enemy does not shoot you 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.800
 you assure almost a whole point then to 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.360
 the 60 seconds that point are going to be 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.160
 whole because for example on this map 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.680
 As you can see, that part is all discovered 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.840
 then I the only place I thought 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.920
 that they could hide was in the house and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.420
 so well here you are seeing how 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.400
 I'm also playing without a scavenger 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.600
 then I did not have thought as I say 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.310
 take out no streak or anything for the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.810
 style then I have to pick up you have 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.910
 Soil weapons that some do not 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.420
 I like that it catches me to get used to 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.280
 no and good the only place as I said 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.840
 where they could hide was the house and 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.280
 as you can see why I take off inside the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.110
 home so that I can for the helicopter 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.160
 lower as I entered in theory no 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.959
 can be hidden anywhere else 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.070
 good if the plates of the old hard 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.410
 point or the arch that is on the left 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.519
 of the map or the garage but it's that up 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.959
 here they have a very long road that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.239
 would go through the whole part of the middle 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.120
 of the map and I'm seeing the last the 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.830
 only step forgiveness of the map not because the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.569
 others the other steps that would be the subject 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.600
 of the source and such is covering the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.160
 helicopter so without more kids 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.350
 as I told you the enemy team is not 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.970
 make it a show but well this 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.550
 you have to do it or it's not easy 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.950
 make you a streak 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.270
 in league mode apart from having the liquor 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.650
 stealing low and all that as I say the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.150
 goal was not to pay to do this 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.920
 streak but try to win the game 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.540
 linking so you're not going to make a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.760
 good game but you will win not 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.530
 to practice to take aim etc. not 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.300
 to adapt a bit what would be the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.680
 competitive I always tell you all that 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.540
 you want to start competitive always 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.850
 I recommend playing league mode because it is 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.120
 perhaps the way that most resembles 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.170
 competitive already really good at 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.050
 eliminate any consequent takings 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.120
 as you know then the 40 the asm ere by 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.750
 example here the light ones are allowed 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.000
 shotguns the peephole dmm I do not know 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.440
 And besides, usually you do not get into 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.270
 play league mode with your team me so 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.220
 less if we are all the complete team 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.570
 we get to play team scripts this 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.310
 more than anything is to play if you are two 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.110
 or three alone we have others alone and that 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.850
 we want to play a little league but 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.530
 what is the problem with this we have 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.940
 play as a team in the league as it happens what 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.220
 has happened in this of jmm play that many 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.110
 Sometimes you take people and you catch the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.430
 beginning of the game and my question is 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.040
 why not because you too 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.530
 you are very tired of this happening 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.330
 kind of things then I do not know if there would be 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.860
 to put a solution or something that when 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.990
 happens that you see how the enemies are already 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.760
 I could be silly and good 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.080
 I agustí and they are letting themselves kill and good 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.850
 Well, if the fool is being 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.870
 little bit but at the beginning the example 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.100
 as I have seen they were not doing the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.110
 foolish but good have already seen that no 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.310
 they can beat them by throwing a few 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.650
 helicopters is already up to the balls 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.120
 the guys and then you can play the fool 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.830
 no more no then what am I 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.970
 saying I know that you both 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.110
 You, like me, play a lot 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.350
 noses that people leave the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.790
 games already I understand that if a 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.070
 example in this case imagine that you 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.750
 goes from the game 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.150
 we were three against a very team 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.990
 good and although they penalize you is to say 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.640
 even if you have five minutes of 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.960
 penalty you have to leave the 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.340
 departure they start charging us a lot 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.990
 because he says he knows to test me 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.880
 charging here and having them take me down 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.010
 and over I'm not going to win I'm losing 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.270
 the total time because they penalize me 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.370
 Well, something penalizes me five 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.810
 minutes and then they let me bounce 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.060
 bounced meanwhile whatever it is not 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.410
 a confirmed low or such but what I 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.060
 I do not understand is the people who go to 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.920
 principle of the games they catch and they 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.900
 throw highlights even between the game 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.030
 they take and they leave tenacity I do not understand it or 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.890
 be if you go as soon as you start the 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.720
 departure does not make sense no no you do not get 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.010
 to play league mode is already or if you do not 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.900
 like the people who had at the point of 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.550
 I find so many people do I do not 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.860
 I do it but well there are many people who 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.270
 take the open tray and exit the menu 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.130
 then it does not count defeat that takes 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.540
 lobby then good if for whatever 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.220
 against a very good team and you 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.690
 you have very bad people because you take and 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.830
 you do that but what is not normal is 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.260
 that you ask in the middle of a game 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.810
 because you are penalized you lose points and 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.130
 They annoy your other three companions 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.690
 so there's good there are people then 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.130
 also that when it is about to 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.570
 finish the game leaves because no 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.850
 they can win me that too I understand 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.110
 you will not waste your time if you have 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.670
 lost but 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.290
 You also have to think as I have 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.080
 said before the issue of penalty 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.580
 because really when you leave the 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.810
 normally league game you get 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.070
 five minutes of penalty then 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.930
 you have to see if that is profitable not the 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.130
 penalty that they put you apart then 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.590
 that's going to take away points like 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.390
 we all know then I do not know how I have 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.120
 said before if they can put some kind 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.830
 of measurement so that people do not leave 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.050
 is that I do not know how they can do it 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.580
 stop the game 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.470
 it would be unfair to those in the 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.570
 another team would not enter you can not 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.960
 do a lot with three types of people but 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.280
 good leaving that aside and I good 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.530
 I had said on twitter I'm a little 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.570
 sick of constipation, yes, I am a 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.630
 little bit weird in summer I wear 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.520
 bad I constituted such but good we 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.050
 try a little more the voice and good in 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.420
 this gameplay is playing as it is a 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.030
 bad and I do not know why but I'm playing 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.470
 even better bad than normal I do not know if 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.760
 will be the effect of medicines and 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.010
 drugs as said by twitter that the 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.060
 I'm playing drugs I do not pay here 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.410
 in league mode and good I do not know I do not know if 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.850
 I do not know why it will be but the truth is that 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.530
 is getting some very good games 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.129
 yesterday you had the nuclear is with the 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.809
 minus 16 very good with storms of assault 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.909
 and all that as you saw the escort drone 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:11.369
 and such good this is the point where 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:12.989
 they kill me miss bullets and apart when the 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:14.939
 jump to the right is limping 

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:16.979
 I hit the wall on the right and 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:18.719
 I can not turn is good if I can turn 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.429
 but I did not realize that I am against the 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:22.439
 wall and turn wrong and does not kill me not then 

00:07:20.429 --> 00:07:23.819
 well as I say no I would not have given 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.409
 time to get me the nuclear either 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.550
 although I would have killed that one because 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:27.959
 I had to have walked super ready 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.459
 looking responsive and good what I 

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.929
 I dedicate and finish the game before 

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:32.129
 spoil the most then it came to well I'm going to 

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:34.860
 take the last points and up 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:36.119
 then you are seeing as almost almost me 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.589
 alone defends a little the subject of the 

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:39.179
 garage as I'm watching tilted ahead 

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:40.529
 towards the garden because from behind 

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.689
 theory will not come until the 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:44.490
 enemies of forgiveness that the companions 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:45.990
 back do not die and as you see continued 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.729
 all the time tilting in front of the 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.249
 garden to the front yard good sorry graves 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.289
 and good to get rid of this enemy 

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:53.490
 and then with the front and it's over 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.860
 the game and good and I celebrate it a 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.149
 little if more kids and bringing more 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.499
 in piscologists like flashes we had it 

00:07:57.149 --> 00:08:00.300
 said post is one of those as flashes 

00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:02.639
 I will bring some public item as follows 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.689
 with the n with this rebellious camouflage and 

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.979
 without more kids but that liked 

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:07.229
 this episode demolished that for me has 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:09.149
 been the best and a pretty kill 

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:10.289
 important besides playing with the alarm 

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:11.610
 short that is always a little bit more 

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:13.259
 complicated 

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.210
 this example as I have always been then 

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:17.509
 let me like favorites and subscribe 

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.509
