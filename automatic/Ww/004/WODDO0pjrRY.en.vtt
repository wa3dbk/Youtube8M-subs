you have this the pedal to tight the
spring<00:00:09.269> it's<00:00:09.719> hard<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.110> get<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.410> fast<00:00:10.650> beats

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
spring it's hard to get the fast beats

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.020 
spring it's hard to get the fast beats
if<00:00:11.250> you're<00:00:11.400> getting<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.730> groups<00:00:12.000> fast<00:00:12.540> feeling

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
when you have a spring tight it doesn't

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.099 
when you have a spring tight it doesn't
work<00:00:16.710> as<00:00:16.949> well<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.359> order<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
work as well so in order to see that you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
work as well so in order to see that you
have<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> spring<00:00:19.529> slacking<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.430> do

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
have the spring slacking if you can do

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.029 
have the spring slacking if you can do
this<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> beater<00:00:22.199> ball<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.710> make<00:00:22.920> sure

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
this with the beater ball and make sure

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.689 
this with the beater ball and make sure
you<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> few<00:00:24.140> kickbacks<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
you get a few kickbacks like that if it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.070 
you get a few kickbacks like that if it
doesn't<00:00:26.880> go<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> you'll<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.510> anything<00:00:27.750> then

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
doesn't go and you'll do anything then

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320 
doesn't go and you'll do anything then
you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.380> too<00:00:28.560> tight<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.119> that's<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> very

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
you know it's too tight so that's a very

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
you know it's too tight so that's a very
important<00:00:30.779> thing<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.170> okay<00:00:32.070> that's<00:00:32.520> one

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
important thing to do okay that's one

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150 
important thing to do okay that's one
now<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.329> stem<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> bass<00:00:34.350> drum<00:00:34.380> should<00:00:34.980> be

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
now the stem on the bass drum should be

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.470 
now the stem on the bass drum should be
I've<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.610> measures<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.030> four<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
I've got it measures at four and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630 
I've got it measures at four and
three-quarter<00:00:36.960> inches<00:00:37.280> give<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.370> take<00:00:38.489> an

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
three-quarter inches give or take an

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.490 
three-quarter inches give or take an
eighth<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.850> an<00:00:38.969> inch<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> fact<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
eighth of an inch so the fact that the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.549 
eighth of an inch so the fact that the
the<00:00:41.129> beater<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.629> high<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.780> enough<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.410> bring

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the beater is high up enough to bring

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.060 
the beater is high up enough to bring
the<00:00:43.739> beater<00:00:43.920> back<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.030> beat<00:00:46.070> if

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the beater back so you get the beat if

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
the beater back so you get the beat if
it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> shorter<00:00:47.730> stem<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.480> much

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it's a shorter stem it's it's much

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's a shorter stem it's it's much
harder<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> play<00:00:51.120> like

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
harder to get you know if you play like

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.500 
harder to get you know if you play like
eight<00:00:51.570> beats<00:00:52.489> its<00:00:53.489> orderly<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
eight beats its orderly if you have a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
eight beats its orderly if you have a
short<00:00:54.870> stem<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.379> can't<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.739> nothing<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> work

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
short stem you can't is nothing to work

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.369 
short stem you can't is nothing to work
with<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:57.059> shouldn't<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
with it shouldn't be back here like that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
with it shouldn't be back here like that
because<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> takes<00:00:59.520> too<00:00:59.910> long<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
because it takes too long to get to the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.380 
because it takes too long to get to the
base<00:01:01.199> jump<00:01:01.500> from<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> technique

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
base jump from here with this technique

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.759 
base jump from here with this technique
especially<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.049> also<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
especially and also you can get it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
especially and also you can get it
caught<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.250> pants<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:06.510> which<00:01:07.200> I've

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
caught in your pants like which I've

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.550 
caught in your pants like which I've
done<00:01:07.500> before<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:08.159> amazing<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.320> needs

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
done before you're amazing so it needs

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
done before you're amazing so it needs
to<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.710> sitting<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> deal<00:01:12.240> with

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
to be sitting which you can deal with

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
to be sitting which you can deal with
with<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.890> on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> side<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> pedal<00:01:14.670> there

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
with the on the side of the pedal there

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
with the on the side of the pedal there
so<00:01:15.570> all<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.840> things<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.229> important

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so all these things are very important

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.399 
so all these things are very important
the<00:01:16.830> slack<00:01:17.130> spring<00:01:17.460> tension<00:01:18.170> make<00:01:19.170> sure<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the slack spring tension make sure you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.770 
the slack spring tension make sure you
get<00:01:19.500> enough<00:01:19.770> rock<00:01:20.009> backs<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.420> length<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
get enough rock backs and the length of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.050 
get enough rock backs and the length of
the<00:01:22.020> stem<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.619> bigger<00:01:22.799> ball<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.820> beater

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the stem of the bigger ball the beater

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.539 
the stem of the bigger ball the beater
so<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> strange<00:01:25.770> beater<00:01:26.040> ball<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.400> here

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
so I have a strange beater ball on here

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.520 
so I have a strange beater ball on here
which<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> probably<00:01:26.970> notice<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.659> saw<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
which you probably notice I saw the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
which you probably notice I saw the
front<00:01:28.860> off<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.610> necessary<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.119> an

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
front off which is not necessary just an

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
front off which is not necessary just an
idiosyncrasy<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.259> mine<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
idiosyncrasy of mine but I like to get a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
idiosyncrasy of mine but I like to get a
sharp<00:01:33.090> sound<00:01:33.479> from<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> bass<00:01:33.960> domain<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
sharp sound from the bass domain if you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.910 
sharp sound from the bass domain if you
get<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> side<00:01:36.920> it's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
get it from this from this side it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.899 
get it from this from this side it's
nice<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.210> better<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.909> it

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
nice but this is better you get it it

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.120 
nice but this is better you get it it
doesn't<00:01:41.939> matter<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:43.170> hope<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
doesn't matter I hope so

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.550 
doesn't matter I hope so
so<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> has<00:01:45.630> nothing<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so but that has nothing to do with this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
so but that has nothing to do with this
at<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> plus<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> fact<00:01:47.579> notice<00:01:48.060> I'm

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
at all and plus the fact notice I'm

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.710 
at all and plus the fact notice I'm
using<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.689> solid<00:01:49.229> foot<00:01:49.560> board<00:01:49.799> foot<00:01:50.700> pedal<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
using a solid foot board foot pedal it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
using a solid foot board foot pedal it
has<00:01:51.899> nothing<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> technique<00:01:53.130> at

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
has nothing to do with the technique at

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.170 
has nothing to do with the technique at
all<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:54.799> started<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> first<00:01:56.009> 1516<00:01:56.820> years<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
all I started the first 1516 years of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.690 
all I started the first 1516 years of
this<00:01:57.299> technique<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.530> split<00:01:59.040> hinge<00:01:59.280> foot

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this technique with a split hinge foot

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.060 
this technique with a split hinge foot
pedal<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.869> says<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> kind

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
pedal so then it says I like this kind

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.160 
pedal so then it says I like this kind
of<00:02:02.189> pedal<00:02:02.490> that's<00:02:02.790> all<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.780> has<00:02:03.869> nothing

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
of pedal that's all but it has nothing

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.740 
of pedal that's all but it has nothing
to<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> technique<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:06.600> know

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
to do with the technique so you know

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.270 
to do with the technique so you know
what<00:02:06.960> whichever<00:02:07.259> pedal<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.069> this

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
what whichever pedal you have is this

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.470 
what whichever pedal you have is this
just<00:02:08.520> fine

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
just fine

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.730 
just fine
you<00:02:11.480> better<00:02:11.750> get<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.080> know<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.440> play

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
you better get you know that the play

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.000 
you better get you know that the play
from<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> title<00:02:13.430> that's<00:02:13.520> that's<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.880> idea

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
from the title that's that's the idea

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.160 
from the title that's that's the idea
also<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.040> prefer<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> nylon<00:02:16.880> strap<00:02:17.209> for<00:02:17.780> myself

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
also I prefer a nylon strap for myself

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.949 
also I prefer a nylon strap for myself
than<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.800> chain<00:02:19.250> drive<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:20.360> because<00:02:20.720> it

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
than the chain drive just because it

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.000 
than the chain drive just because it
doesn't<00:02:21.140> make<00:02:21.290> any<00:02:21.410> difference<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
doesn't make any difference to the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.510 
doesn't make any difference to the
technique<00:02:22.370> which<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.730> prefer<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:24.430> let<00:02:25.430> me

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
technique which I prefer that and let me

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.850 
technique which I prefer that and let me
let<00:02:25.640> me<00:02:25.760> ask<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:27.320> shoe<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.680> have

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860

sneakers on yes I do

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.760

the reason I have these sneakers always

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.100 
the reason I have these sneakers always
because<00:02:31.160> I'm<00:02:32.030> comfortable<00:02:32.330> playing<00:02:32.750> and

because I'm comfortable playing and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.890 
because I'm comfortable playing and
these<00:02:33.260> are<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.970> only<00:02:35.090> thing<00:02:35.300> not<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.540> wear<00:02:35.750> is

is like sneakers with like thick lumps
on<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.170> bottom<00:02:39.560> because<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.069> technique<00:02:40.430> of

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
on the bottom because this technique of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.370 
on the bottom because this technique of
mine<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:41.000> move<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.630> foot<00:02:41.870> around<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:45.020> need<00:02:45.290> to

you<00:03:25.610> can<00:03:25.760> feel<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.090> like<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.239> tight<00:03:26.570> it

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
you can feel it's like a tight it

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.080 
you can feel it's like a tight it
doesn't<00:03:27.799> really<00:03:27.920> work<00:03:28.130> too<00:03:28.340> well<00:03:28.519> or<00:03:28.760> down

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
doesn't really work too well or down

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.270 
doesn't really work too well or down
here<00:03:29.510> there's<00:03:30.260> only<00:03:30.320> one<00:03:30.620> place<00:03:30.890> for<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.220> to

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
here there's only one place for it to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.860 
here there's only one place for it to
get<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:31.880> good<00:03:32.060> feel<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.510> that's<00:03:32.600> right

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
get a really good feel and that's right

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.170 
get a really good feel and that's right
in<00:03:33.049> there<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:34.519> see<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.820> just<00:03:34.970> moves

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
in there you can see it just moves

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.430 
in there you can see it just moves
better<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:38.269> once<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.600> know<00:03:38.840> we<00:03:39.230> have<00:03:39.320> two

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
better so once you know we have two

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.560 
better so once you know we have two
terms<00:03:39.650> with<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.670> there's<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> part<00:03:41.390> of

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
terms with that then there's the part of

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.750 
terms with that then there's the part of
the<00:03:41.690> foot<00:03:41.900> that's<00:03:42.049> very<00:03:42.320> very<00:03:42.590> important<00:03:43.130> then

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the foot that's very very important then

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.030 
the foot that's very very important then
you<00:03:43.790> have<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> camera<00:03:44.329> there<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:45.590> very<00:03:45.799> back

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
you have the camera there the very back

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.920 
you have the camera there the very back
of<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.220> toes<00:03:46.579> is<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:46.970> move<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.480> best<00:03:47.660> part

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
of the toes is the move is the best part

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.020 
of the toes is the move is the best part
I've<00:03:48.440> gone<00:03:48.829> through<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.130> scientifically<00:03:49.880> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
I've gone through this scientifically so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.780 
I've gone through this scientifically so
I<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.329> know<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.660> perfect<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.799> used<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.489> say<00:03:52.640> the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
I I know is perfect I used to say the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.199 
I I know is perfect I used to say the
ball<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.239> foot<00:03:53.420> which<00:03:53.570> is<00:03:53.600> okay<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:55.209> this

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
ball of the foot which is okay but this

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.900 
ball of the foot which is okay but this
part<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.720> foot<00:03:57.370> joined<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:58.670> part

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
part of the foot joined with this part

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:09.080 
part of the foot joined with this part
of<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.060> pen<00:03:59.269> that's<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.170> best<00:04:00.380> response

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.100 

so<00:04:10.090> always<00:04:10.300> remember<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.750> what<00:04:10.990> you're

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
so always remember that what you're

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.040 
so always remember that what you're
going<00:04:11.260> through<00:04:11.319> these<00:04:11.470> exercises<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:13.050> know

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
going through these exercises you know

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.970 
going through these exercises you know
this<00:04:14.200> part<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.530> technique<00:04:14.860> is<00:04:14.950> very

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
this part of the technique is very

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.759 
this part of the technique is very
important<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.520> remember<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.290> helps<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.620> you

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
important to remember as it helps to you

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.390 
important to remember as it helps to you
to<00:04:17.950> get<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.250> done<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:19.950> can<00:04:20.950> have<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.220> ball<00:04:21.370> I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
to get it done you can have the ball I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.580 
to get it done you can have the ball I
tried<00:04:22.150> both<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.870> used<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.080> have<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.320> say

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
tried both of it I used to have to say

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.270 
tried both of it I used to have to say
the<00:04:23.740> ball<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.070> foot<00:04:24.280> but<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.790> think<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:26.280> part

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
the ball the foot but I think the part

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.950 
the ball the foot but I think the part
of<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.400> back<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.730> toes<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.510> best<00:04:28.690> part

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
of the back of the toes is the best part

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.290 
of the back of the toes is the best part
you<00:04:29.830> know<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.400> guess<00:04:30.550> but<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:30.940> know<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.180> can

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
you know so I guess but you know you can

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.030 
you know so I guess but you know you can
try<00:04:31.540> people<00:04:31.930> can<00:04:32.020> try<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.290> wherever<00:04:32.710> they<00:04:32.890> feel

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
try people can try it wherever they feel

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.620 
try people can try it wherever they feel
most<00:04:33.280> comfortable<00:04:33.520> with<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.000> then<00:04:34.030> use<00:04:34.360> that

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
most comfortable with it then use that

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.810 
most comfortable with it then use that
but<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.710> very<00:04:35.919> end<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.280> toe<00:04:36.430> is<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.640> very

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
but the very end of the toe is the very

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.670 
but the very end of the toe is the very
end<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.210> toes<00:04:37.480> or<00:04:38.020> further<00:04:38.230> back<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.530> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
end of the toes or further back on the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.260 
end of the toes or further back on the
floor<00:04:38.860> doesn't<00:04:39.070> seem<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.400> work<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.820> mean<00:04:40.150> I<00:04:40.210> know

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
floor doesn't seem to work I mean I know

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.770 
floor doesn't seem to work I mean I know
other<00:04:40.840> guys<00:04:41.050> do<00:04:41.260> this<00:04:41.610> especially<00:04:42.610> for<00:04:42.910> we're

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
other guys do this especially for we're

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.110 
other guys do this especially for we're
playing<00:04:44.050> louder<00:04:44.320> stuff<00:04:44.770> which<00:04:44.980> is<00:04:45.130> cool<00:04:45.970> but

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
playing louder stuff which is cool but

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.090 
playing louder stuff which is cool but
for<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.450> technique<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:47.740> doesn't<00:04:48.010> really

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
for this technique it doesn't really

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.530 
for this technique it doesn't really
work<00:04:48.430> you'll<00:04:48.669> see<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.060> know<00:04:49.150> when<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.360> play

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
work you'll see you know when you play

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.909 
work you'll see you know when you play
these<00:04:49.720> exercise<00:04:50.140> get<00:04:50.350> into<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.650> technique

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
these exercise get into the technique

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.950 
these exercise get into the technique
further<00:04:51.190> you'll<00:04:51.370> see<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.720> value<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.840> these

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
further you'll see the value of these

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.080 
further you'll see the value of these
things<00:04:53.260> we've<00:04:53.650> been<00:04:53.770> going<00:04:54.040> through<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.880> is

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
things we've been going through this is

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.120 
things we've been going through this is
also<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.570> thing<00:04:55.840> we<00:04:56.169> whatever<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.860> want<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.100> to

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
also a thing we whatever you want it to

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.280 
also a thing we whatever you want it to
be<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.610> for<00:04:57.970> myself<00:04:58.450> I<00:04:58.570> like<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.870> heads<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.169> be

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
be but for myself I like the heads to be

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.890 
be but for myself I like the heads to be
pretty<00:04:59.530> tight<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.100> I<00:05:00.820> like<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.210> get<00:05:01.330> some<00:05:01.630> boom

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
pretty tight and I like to get some boom

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.590 
pretty tight and I like to get some boom
out<00:05:02.230> of<00:05:02.350> it<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:03.430> debtor<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.940> head<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.270> harder

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
out of it the debtor the head the harder

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.170 
out of it the debtor the head the harder
it<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.110> harder<00:05:05.740> work<00:05:05.950> it<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.490> do<00:05:07.030> this

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
it is the harder work it is to do this

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.099 
it is the harder work it is to do this
technique<00:05:07.419> especially<00:05:08.110> when<00:05:08.200> you<00:05:08.260> go<00:05:08.350> like

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:11.109
