00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.300 
be like one and it if you want to spawn
it<00:02:33.620> higher<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.299> on<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.959> do<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.859> really

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
it higher and so on but I do not really

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.149 
it higher and so on but I do not really
know<00:02:37.519> like<00:02:38.390> much<00:02:38.959> about<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.129> just

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
know like much about this but I just

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.460 
know like much about this but I just
know<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.549> those<00:02:40.819> are<00:02:41.060> not<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.959> coordinates

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
know that those are not the coordinates

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.800 
know that those are not the coordinates
but<00:02:42.680> how<00:02:43.250> far<00:02:43.579> away<00:02:43.849> that<00:02:44.120> they<00:02:44.510> will<00:02:44.689> be

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
but how far away that they will be

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.099 
but how far away that they will be
sportin<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.439> you<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.060> then<00:02:47.060> after<00:02:47.209> powered

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
sportin from you and then after powered

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.170 
sportin from you and then after powered
which<00:02:48.379> means<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.859> creeper<00:02:49.250> will<00:02:49.549> be<00:02:49.700> charged

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
which means the creeper will be charged

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.690 
which means the creeper will be charged
and<00:02:50.450> will<00:02:51.079> have<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.620> lightning<00:02:52.010> effect<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and will have the lightning effect and

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.099 
and will have the lightning effect and
then<00:02:53.599> this<00:02:53.959> number<00:02:54.439> after<00:02:54.650> powered<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:56.109> how

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
then this number after powered is how

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.649 
then this number after powered is how
big<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:58.040> creeper<00:02:58.430> explosion<00:02:58.939> pretty<00:02:59.150> much<00:02:59.419> is

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
big the creeper explosion pretty much is

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.399 
big the creeper explosion pretty much is
so<00:03:00.470> one<00:03:00.769> is<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.459> normal<00:03:02.049> charge<00:03:03.049> creeper

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
so one is just the normal charge creeper

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.770 
so one is just the normal charge creeper
explosion<00:03:03.799> if<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.099> was<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.400> put<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.180> 10<00:03:05.480> the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
explosion if I was to put that to 10 the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.960 
explosion if I was to put that to 10 the
creeper<00:03:06.200> explosion<00:03:06.680> bigger<00:03:07.129> so<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.459> may<00:03:07.760> show

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
creeper explosion bigger so I may show

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.899 
creeper explosion bigger so I may show
you<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.840> after<00:03:09.829> I've<00:03:10.040> shown<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.579> but

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
really know if it works it kind of blow

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.179 
really know if it works it kind of blow
up<00:03:55.280> your<00:03:55.400> own<00:03:55.459> house<00:03:55.699> but<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:57.530> guys<00:03:57.949> can

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
up your own house but you guys can

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.379 
up your own house but you guys can
probably<00:03:58.280> sort<00:03:58.699> something<00:03:58.909> out

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
probably sort something out

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.099 
probably sort something out
so<00:03:59.569> did<00:04:00.169> exactly<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.709> same<00:04:01.329> command<00:04:02.329> in<00:04:02.689> the

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
so did exactly the same command in the

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.770 
so did exactly the same command in the
command<00:04:03.139> block<00:04:03.879> is<00:04:04.879> exactly<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.510> same<00:04:05.659> as

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
command block is exactly the same as

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.449 
command block is exactly the same as
before<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.169> the<00:04:06.379> capital<00:04:07.780> C<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.099> then<00:04:10.099> the

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
before so the capital C and then the

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.749 
before so the capital C and then the
lines<00:04:12.669> powered<00:04:13.669> and<00:04:14.199> then<00:04:15.340> I'm<00:04:16.340> going<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.639> do

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
lines powered and then I'm going to do

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.960 
lines powered and then I'm going to do
10<00:04:17.180> for<00:04:17.449> a<00:04:17.479> bigger<00:04:17.690> explosion<00:04:18.669> just<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.789> show

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
10 for a bigger explosion just to show

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.180 
10 for a bigger explosion just to show
you<00:04:20.030> guys<00:04:20.150> done<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.349> then<00:04:21.709> when<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.039> get<00:04:22.130> a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
you guys done and then when you get a

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.460 
you guys done and then when you get a
register<00:04:22.820> redstone<00:04:23.510> signal

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
register redstone signal

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.400 
register redstone signal
as<00:04:26.220> we<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.670> see<00:04:26.970> here<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:30.000> spawns<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.810> charged

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
as we can see here it spawns a charged

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.540 
as we can see here it spawns a charged
creep<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.130> I'm<00:04:32.310> going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> go<00:04:32.640> into<00:04:34.550> game-mode

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
creep and I'm going to go into game-mode

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.130 
creep and I'm going to go into game-mode
0<00:04:37.490> just<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.580> show<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.000> they<00:04:39.150> do<00:04:39.570> work<00:04:39.840> and

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
0 just to show you that they do work and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.530 
0 just to show you that they do work and
this<00:04:40.980> is<00:04:41.100> going<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.310> be<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.430> really<00:04:41.940> crazy

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
this is going to be a really crazy

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.860 
this is going to be a really crazy
explosion<00:04:43.050> as<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:44.040> can<00:04:44.190> see<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.640> die<00:04:45.150> pretty

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
explosion as you can see I die pretty

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.560 
explosion as you can see I die pretty
instantly<00:04:46.680> then<00:04:47.030> so<00:04:48.030> let's<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.300> go<00:04:48.420> back

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
instantly then so let's just go back

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.150 
instantly then so let's just go back
into<00:04:48.810> game<00:04:49.200> mode<00:04:49.230> one<00:04:49.830> here<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:51.110> fly<00:04:52.110> over<00:04:52.980> to

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
into game mode one here and fly over to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.880 
into game mode one here and fly over to
where<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.690> Marie<00:04:54.690> died<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:56.640> as<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.240> can<00:04:57.360> see

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
where it Marie died so as you can see

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.130 
where it Marie died so as you can see
this<00:04:58.890> explosion<00:04:59.250> was<00:04:59.790> massive<00:05:00.420> caused<00:05:00.840> by<00:05:01.080> the
