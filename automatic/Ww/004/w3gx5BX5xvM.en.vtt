been soaking for about 15 minutes now
and<00:01:06.799> let's<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:12.510> water<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.110> pretty<00:01:13.650> cloudy

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
and let's see the water is pretty cloudy

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.109 
and let's see the water is pretty cloudy
definitely<00:01:16.470> pretty<00:01:16.770> cloudy<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.970> they

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
definitely pretty cloudy now what they

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.880 
definitely pretty cloudy now what they
said<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> there's<00:01:19.470> an<00:01:20.060> alkaline<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
said was that there's an alkaline and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.640 
said was that there's an alkaline and
alkaline<00:01:22.890> base<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.650> 100%

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
alkaline base that's put on the 100%

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.429 
alkaline base that's put on the 100%
Kanekalon<00:01:26.220> hair<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.780> fiber<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
Kanekalon hair and it's a fiber it's a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.429 
Kanekalon hair and it's a fiber it's a
synthetic<00:01:28.799> hair<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> fiber<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.600> therefore

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
synthetic hair it's a fiber so therefore

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.200 
synthetic hair it's a fiber so therefore
you<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.890> things<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.610> chemicals<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.060> going

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
you know things and chemicals are going

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.990 
you know things and chemicals are going
to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.360> put<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:35.100> preserve<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.729> hair

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to be put on there to preserve the hair

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.289 
to be put on there to preserve the hair
or<00:01:36.240> whatever<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> reason<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:38.299> that

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
or whatever the reason is that they that

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.539 
or whatever the reason is that they that
they<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.920> soak<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
they have it on there now you soak it

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.060
