00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:08.279
 hello we are already in contact 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.490
 I forgot to tell them 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.270
 first you have to preheat what 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.669
 connecting it would put closed 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.949
 put a little bit of red wait for it to 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.900
 release the little green and in that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.420
 now you can put them 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.560
 in filling the layers with the dough 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.780
 and close it and then wait 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.800
 28 minutes and we waited 8 minutes so 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.800
 let's see if they were done 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 good 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.210
 and where does it come from if we put a toothpick 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.210
 that still lacks a little 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.340
 is already and is 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.329
 and we are going to take us out 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.059
 watch out 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:09.760
 Lets put 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:13.090
 another session and we'll see each other in one of the 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.900
 first is that it is 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.370
 those are the ones that are left 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.770
 this is the other has a little more and 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.390
 so they stayed 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.840
 better then it's a little bit up 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 From the half 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.250
 so that it does not spill 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.480
 to Carlos very carefully 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.480
 these nine minutes 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.219
 it's time 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.219
 fair 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.270
 i 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.170
 let's wait for it to cool in a 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.580
 moment 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.580
 that's how they come out 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:18.530
 and now he showed them how it is that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.230
 they look good already frei and they are 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.129
 facts all boundaries 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.129
 here they are 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.040
 from the box that teaches 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.040
 I came out 30 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.900
 you have to eat all my assistant is 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.480
 gave the burgas and that I will give you the review 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:53.069
 unlike today 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.069
 of this that you have to put it in the oven 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:01.959
 well here as you can see I can put 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:05.260
 12 as vital two trays and I already have 24 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.690
 in 20 minutes in this case nothing more 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.110
 I can do 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.160
 six in six and durÃ¡n 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.860
 nine minutes to be done 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.310
 the good thing about this that I had not achieved 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.860
 with the gas oven and the other mold is 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.910
 what to know with this form of 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.910
 tenderloin 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.049
 and they leave pretty little couples then this 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.590
 I did not make it 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.330
 I could not do it, I do not know if you can 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.599
 make it in the gas oven in the oven to 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.230
 gas as they spread out and then already 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:50.379
 I was and here it is not saved like the heat 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.709
 parejito I believe and dill myth and that 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.730
 it is finished in this way 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.800
 which are very even and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.910
 they have 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.670
 well the curvita all beautiful come out very 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.930
 fluffy 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.930
 and this 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.510
 I think I also feel that more 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.260
 spongy than in the oven 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.260
 tall 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.300
 Y 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.300
 this is the will that has 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.300
 already 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.810
 well, if I like how it comes out 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.360
 and I'm satisfied with this one if you want 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.770
 encourage 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.770
 Well yes I recommend it 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.719
 I repeat the only drawback is that 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:51.319
 nothing can make us six in six 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:53.569
 but for a person a whim and 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.689
 just make a part of the flour 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.939
 it looks perfect so I hope that you 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.050
 have really liked this video see you 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:07.039
 in a next and hopefully have time 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:10.630
 tomorrow we the next days for 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:14.560
 to be able to teach them how to improve them 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.400
 and it's thanks for watching the video and we 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 we see in a next
