00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.820 
just blown out because it was just a
world<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.599> haven't<00:02:26.900> really<00:02:27.230> become

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
world that I haven't really become

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.130 
world that I haven't really become
involved<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.239> definitely<00:02:32.480> got<00:02:32.900> my

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
involved in and it definitely got my

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.589 
involved in and it definitely got my
juices<00:02:33.680> flowing<00:02:34.160> again<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.090> thinking

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
juices flowing again and and thinking

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.110 
juices flowing again and and thinking
about<00:02:35.930> life<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.459> really<00:02:37.760> was

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
about life and it really was

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.569 
about life and it really was
thought-provoking<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.530> me<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.829> do<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.220> part

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
thought-provoking for me to do this part

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.729 
thought-provoking for me to do this part
there's<00:02:41.299> very<00:02:41.540> few<00:02:41.629> things<00:02:42.079> in<00:02:42.230> life<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.440> are

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
there's very few things in life that are

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.280 
there's very few things in life that are
stronger<00:02:43.250> than<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.700> person<00:02:44.690> who<00:02:44.780> was<00:02:44.959> really

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
stronger than a person who was really

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.770 
stronger than a person who was really
seeking<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.860> leave<00:02:46.069> with<00:02:46.579> mom<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.030> not<00:02:47.450> being

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
seeking you leave with mom and not being

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.349 
seeking you leave with mom and not being
able<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.989> find<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.349> answer<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:49.090> think<00:02:50.090> Ryan

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
able to find that answer I think Ryan

00:02:50.359 --> 00:03:04.640 
able to find that answer I think Ryan
was<00:02:50.510> there<00:02:50.750> but<00:02:51.590> he<00:02:51.680> found<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.040> answer

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.700 

guitar<00:03:05.650> pick<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.519> live
