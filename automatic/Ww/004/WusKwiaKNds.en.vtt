ways in this series we take a look at

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.140 
ways in this series we take a look at
Sami<00:00:07.740> maps<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.250> we<00:00:08.309> try<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.490> see<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:08.970> can

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
Sami maps and we try to see how we can

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.030 
Sami maps and we try to see how we can
turn<00:00:09.330> them<00:00:09.480> into<00:00:09.660> something<00:00:10.170> amazing

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
turn them into something amazing

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.740 
turn them into something amazing
today<00:00:11.490> we're<00:00:11.700> gonna<00:00:11.820> figure<00:00:12.030> out<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.330> top<00:00:12.509> 5

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
today we're gonna figure out the top 5

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.259 
today we're gonna figure out the top 5
ways<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> improve<00:00:13.740> 5<00:00:14.160> without<00:00:14.580> further<00:00:14.910> ado

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
ways to improve 5 without further ado

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:25.630 
ways to improve 5 without further ado
let's<00:00:15.990> begin

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.680 

starting<00:00:26.640> off<00:00:26.760> at<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.940> number<00:00:27.150> five<00:00:27.330> spot

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
starting off at the number five spot

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.990 
starting off at the number five spot
I<00:00:27.840> wish<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.320> teleporters<00:00:28.980> weren't<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.550> random

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
I wish the teleporters weren't as random

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.850 
I wish the teleporters weren't as random
as<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.450> are<00:00:30.690> I<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.110> no<00:00:31.290> problem<00:00:31.740> with

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
as they are I have no problem with

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.160 
as they are I have no problem with
random<00:00:32.279> teleporters<00:00:32.970> but<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> start<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
random teleporters but I start to have a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
random teleporters but I start to have a
problem<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.860> these<00:00:34.950> teleporters<00:00:35.310> are<00:00:35.910> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
problem when these teleporters are so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.670 
problem when these teleporters are so
random<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> random<00:00:37.230> order<00:00:37.470> actually

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
random that the random order actually

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
random that the random order actually
changes<00:00:38.250> midway<00:00:38.580> through<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.750> random

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
changes midway through if one random

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.960 
changes midway through if one random
order<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.559> set<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.220> very<00:00:41.280> beginning

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
order was set at the very very beginning

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.790 
order was set at the very very beginning
of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.330> game<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.720> I<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.960> learn<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.410> order

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of the game and I can learn this order

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.979 
of the game and I can learn this order
as<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> game<00:00:44.309> goes<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.510> perfectly

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
as the game goes on of you perfectly

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.030 
as the game goes on of you perfectly
fine<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.890> it's

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
fine like that but because it's

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.500 
fine like that but because it's
constantly<00:00:47.550> changing<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.330> is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
constantly changing and there is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
constantly changing and there is
literally<00:00:48.900> no<00:00:49.199> predictable<00:00:49.710> order<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.280> find

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
literally no predictable order I find

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.070 
literally no predictable order I find
these<00:00:50.970> cell<00:00:51.180> borders<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.720> chaos

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
these cell borders to be chaos

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.299 
these cell borders to be chaos
especially<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> situation<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.190> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
especially in a situation like this

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.740 
especially in a situation like this
where<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.730> running<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.180> life<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.570> no

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
where I'm running for my life with no

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
where I'm running for my life with no
perks<00:00:55.080> I<00:00:55.260> could<00:00:55.409> easily<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:55.830> with<00:00:56.220> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
perks I could easily go down with a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.369 
perks I could easily go down with a
smart<00:00:56.670> player<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.480> learn<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.809> map<00:00:57.930> well<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
smart player can learn the map well I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.110 
smart player can learn the map well I
feel<00:00:58.589> he<00:00:58.739> should<00:00:58.769> be<00:00:58.949> rewarded<00:00:59.220> for<00:00:59.670> him

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
feel he should be rewarded for him

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
feel he should be rewarded for him
taking<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.449> time<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> learn<00:01:01.110> this<00:01:01.290> map<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
taking the time to learn this map and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:11.630 
taking the time to learn this map and
the<00:01:01.769> teleporters

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
certainly looks older we can see the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.580 
certainly looks older we can see the
gray<00:01:31.420> hair<00:01:31.660> in<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.870> backend<00:01:32.050> it's<00:01:32.380> almost

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
gray hair in the backend it's almost

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.230 
gray hair in the backend it's almost
like<00:01:32.770> he<00:01:32.860> has<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.010> military<00:01:33.460> uniform<00:01:33.670> as<00:01:34.000> if<00:01:34.120> he

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
like he has a military uniform as if he

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.340 
like he has a military uniform as if he
was<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.390> part<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.720> United<00:01:34.960> States<00:01:35.020> military

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
was a part of the United States military

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:46.180 
was a part of the United States military
it's<00:01:35.980> mind-boggling<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.790> me

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.950

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
slow down this guy is way too fast we've

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.600 
disguised trap I wish we had this
concept<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.780> expanded<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.530> further<00:03:33.920> we<00:03:34.400> have

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
concept and expanded it further we have

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.430 
concept and expanded it further we have
a<00:03:34.640> thunder<00:03:35.240> gun<00:03:35.420> in<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.690> map<00:03:35.840> what<00:03:36.080> if<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:36.320> were

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
a thunder gun in the map what if we were

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.230 
a thunder gun in the map what if we were
able<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.740> take<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.920> thunder<00:03:37.400> gun<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.880> collect

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
able to take a thunder gun and collect

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.850 
able to take a thunder gun and collect
parts<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.750> build<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.170> up<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:39.410> that<00:03:39.530> we<00:03:39.620> had<00:03:39.830> a

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
parts and build it up so that we had a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.190 
parts and build it up so that we had a
fully<00:03:40.340> functioning<00:03:41.000> thunder<00:03:41.330> gun<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.690> think

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
fully functioning thunder gun I think

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.620 
fully functioning thunder gun I think
that'd<00:03:42.380> be<00:03:42.410> pretty<00:03:42.590> cool<00:03:42.890> or<00:03:43.490> maybe<00:03:43.880> we<00:03:44.480> could

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
that'd be pretty cool or maybe we could

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.360 
that'd be pretty cool or maybe we could
just<00:03:44.840> do<00:03:45.050> stuff<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.470> enhance<00:03:45.950> part<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
just do stuff like enhance part of the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.740 
just do stuff like enhance part of the
features<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.970> map<00:03:47.090> maybe<00:03:47.360> make<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
features on the map maybe make the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.110 
features on the map maybe make the
teleporters<00:03:48.350> more<00:03:48.530> predictable<00:03:49.130> maybe<00:03:49.790> we

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
teleporters more predictable maybe we

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.060 
teleporters more predictable maybe we
could<00:03:50.510> have<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> system<00:03:51.350> where<00:03:51.470> we<00:03:51.530> can<00:03:51.680> upgrade

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
could have a system where we can upgrade

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.340 
could have a system where we can upgrade

time<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.770> them<00:04:30.980> I<00:04:31.160> think<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.550> is<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.730> really

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
time in them I think this is a really

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.550 
time in them I think this is a really
cool<00:04:32.150> idea<00:04:32.270> we<00:04:32.570> have<00:04:32.720> these<00:04:32.870> rooms<00:04:33.200> or<00:04:33.350> we<00:04:33.440> can

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
cool idea we have these rooms or we can

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.409 
cool idea we have these rooms or we can
teleport<00:04:33.830> too<00:04:34.070> but<00:04:34.580> I'd<00:04:34.669> like<00:04:34.850> just<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.120> couple

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
teleport too but I'd like just a couple

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.600 
teleport too but I'd like just a couple
extra<00:04:35.780> seconds<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.260> explore<00:04:36.860> look<00:04:37.220> around<00:04:37.520> I

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
extra seconds to explore look around I

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.430 
extra seconds to explore look around I
feel<00:04:37.760> players<00:04:38.060> can<00:04:38.390> miss<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.630> lot<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.050> details

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.540 
switches which releases the crawlers
this<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.080> fantastic<00:05:03.710> idea<00:05:03.830> maybe<00:05:04.190> either<00:05:04.400> a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
this is a fantastic idea maybe either a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.270 
this is a fantastic idea maybe either a
gas<00:05:04.850> mask<00:05:05.210> or<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.570> gas<00:05:05.870> Mack<00:05:06.140> perk<00:05:06.560> suddenly

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
gas mask or a gas Mack perk suddenly

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.320 
gas mask or a gas Mack perk suddenly
just<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.520> prevent<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.880> Deauville<00:05:08.150> crawler

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
just to prevent the Deauville crawler

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.480 
just to prevent the Deauville crawler
from<00:05:08.480> doing<00:05:08.690> as<00:05:08.810> much<00:05:09.110> damage<00:05:09.190> moving<00:05:10.190> on<00:05:10.340> we

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
from doing as much damage moving on we

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.860 
from doing as much damage moving on we
have<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> suggestion<00:05:10.940> from<00:05:11.150> air<00:05:11.419> quakes<00:05:11.660> who

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
have a suggestion from air quakes who

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.780 
have a suggestion from air quakes who
says<00:05:12.050> me<00:05:12.260> I<00:05:12.410> had<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.560> sniper<00:05:12.890> position<00:05:13.010> looking

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
says me I had a sniper position looking

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.450 
says me I had a sniper position looking
onto<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.180> stage<00:05:14.450> near<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.870> pm-63<00:05:15.440> wall<00:05:15.980> by<00:05:16.220> I

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
onto the stage near the pm-63 wall by I

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.370 
onto the stage near the pm-63 wall by I
think<00:05:16.730> this<00:05:17.000> is<00:05:17.120> another<00:05:17.390> excellent<00:05:17.780> idea

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
think this is another excellent idea

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.050 
think this is another excellent idea
cool<00:05:18.890> thing<00:05:19.070> could<00:05:19.220> be<00:05:19.310> maybe<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.610> mounted

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
cool thing could be maybe a mounted

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.170 
cool thing could be maybe a mounted
sniper<00:05:20.390> we've<00:05:20.630> seen<00:05:20.870> mounted<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:21.500> large

sniper we've seen mounted and large

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.720 
sniper we've seen mounted and large
before<00:05:23.050> what<00:05:23.620> if<00:05:23.710> we<00:05:23.830> had<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.040> method<00:05:24.280> sniper

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
before what if we had a method sniper

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.190 
before what if we had a method sniper
rifle<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.150> we<00:05:25.300> can<00:05:25.420> look<00:05:25.540> down<00:05:25.720> onto<00:05:25.960> the

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
rifle that we can look down onto the

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.620 
rifle that we can look down onto the
stage<00:05:26.500> with<00:05:26.860> another<00:05:27.610> idea<00:05:27.760> from<00:05:28.090> Eric<00:05:28.450> way

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
stage with another idea from Eric way

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.110 
stage with another idea from Eric way
full<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.110> great<00:05:29.260> ideas<00:05:29.290> today<00:05:29.860> said<00:05:30.220> make<00:05:30.580> the

full of great ideas today said make the

purpose to a knocking sound near the mp5

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.490 
purpose to a knocking sound near the mp5
I<00:05:33.700> think<00:05:33.970> this<00:05:34.090> is<00:05:34.270> also<00:05:34.540> another<00:05:34.870> fantastic

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
I think this is also another fantastic

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.750 
I think this is also another fantastic
idea<00:05:35.740> for<00:05:35.920> those<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.190> you<00:05:36.280> that<00:05:36.400> don't<00:05:36.550> know

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
idea for those of you that don't know

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
ledge up by the pack-a-punch room maybe

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.900 
ledge up by the pack-a-punch room maybe
if<00:05:56.140> there<00:05:56.320> is<00:05:56.440> a<00:05:56.470> zipline<00:05:56.890> to<00:05:57.070> go<00:05:57.190> down<00:05:57.400> or<00:05:57.670> an

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
if there is a zipline to go down or an

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.700 
if there is a zipline to go down or an
extra<00:05:58.240> perk<00:05:58.450> machine<00:05:58.900> that's<00:05:59.380> a<00:05:59.470> good<00:05:59.620> idea

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
extra perk machine that's a good idea

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.410 
extra perk machine that's a good idea
maybe<00:06:00.040> when<00:06:00.220> we<00:06:00.280> can<00:06:00.430> put<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:00.700> gas<00:06:00.880> Mac<00:06:01.150> perch

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
maybe when we can put the gas Mac perch

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.690 
maybe when we can put the gas Mac perch
there<00:06:01.720> we<00:06:02.260> can<00:06:02.380> also<00:06:02.500> have<00:06:02.800> our<00:06:03.070> little<00:06:03.280> sniper

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
there we can also have our little sniper

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.730 
there we can also have our little sniper
and<00:06:04.060> then<00:06:04.270> maybe<00:06:04.540> a<00:06:04.660> zipline<00:06:05.170> that<00:06:05.380> allows<00:06:05.590> you

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
and then maybe a zipline that allows you

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.110 
and then maybe a zipline that allows you
to<00:06:05.770> go<00:06:05.890> down<00:06:06.100> to<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.340> sage<00:06:06.580> although<00:06:06.850> I<00:06:06.880> feel

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
to go down to the sage although I feel

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.400 
to go down to the sage although I feel
this<00:06:07.270> zipline<00:06:07.630> shouldn't<00:06:08.050> be<00:06:08.110> able<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.350> be

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
this zipline shouldn't be able to be

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.000 
this zipline shouldn't be able to be
accessed<00:06:08.680> until<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:10.990> stage<00:06:11.230> is<00:06:11.590> opened
