00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 how safe is it to ride the subway in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.759
 connection with recent chips in Moscow 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.280
 Underground this question is relevant for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.269
 residents of many cities 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.309
 Yekaterinburg convince in our 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.679
 underground every millimeter under 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.929
 close attention of road walkers 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.000
 Maria Novikova spent the night in the tunnels 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.980
 under the city and saw how she lives 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.410
 Ekaterinburg subway after closing and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.420
 who ensures the safety of the line in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.420
 hands reporting from the ground 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.370
 it's midnight on the clock and life is in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.320
 Ekaterinburg subway is just beginning 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 when the last train leaves the depot 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.160
 paths are provided in the subway tunnel 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.160
 night watch 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.610
 the city sleeps in the metro revival as 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.280
 an anthill 12 kilometers first and bye 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.480
 single line meter by meter 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 check more than a hundred experts 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.790
 if there is damage on the rails 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.590
 the experts will surely hear it 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.930
 using ultrasound flaw detector 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.100
 looks for tiny crack size 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.990
 with a match head 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 the damaged area is immediately changed 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 little things in the subway is no good now 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.290
 all responsible for passenger safety 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.790
 seeing technique used to say workers 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.190
 it was harder the boat went off to the sound if 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.820
 deaf that is then these then went 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.820
 what else happens 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.080
 the magnet will not send but everyone checks the strip 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.910
 we have a head neck and see everything 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.650
 all that is hidden now is trying very hard 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.060
 after the tragedy in the Moscow metro 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.350
 when one of the trains went to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.720
 unfinished tunnel and crashed into 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 concrete floor all underground paths in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.940
 Russia is thoroughly checking the first 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.770
 night and no plan checked turnouts 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.260
 our translations they were with us all 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.310
 no comment no effects 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.140
 everything else we will plan those 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.600
 work these activities but we need 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.340
 understand what happened in Moscow because of what 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.530
 in Moscow killed 23 passengers and 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.510
 suffered more than a hundred until not exactly 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 installed by the main version of the accident 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.930
 happened due to a faulty arrow 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.210
 presumably a device that I 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.430
 translates it was badly fixed just 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.100
 only wrapped with wire so the composition 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.020
 and drove to a standstill like this 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.300
 an ordinary arrow as a rule 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.250
 automatically controlled from a distance 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.130
 but if you need to close it on the glock and 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.280
 delete the translation and and lock here on 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.170
 This bookmark here necessarily hangs 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.010
 Castle 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.020
 Yekaterinburg subway certainly not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.340
 as branched as Moscow but 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.350
 because you don't need an eye yes an eye 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.350
 the train can get off the rails even because 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.860
 small skew . 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.870
 Is the width of our tires like glue in 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.459
 Russia thousand end of eyes special 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.470
 level Alexey Anatolyevich every day 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.180
 measures kilometers of paths checks 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.190
 gauge and whether at the same level 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.920
 there are rails and a type of wand should 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.250
 run and not swing for how much tolerances 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.900
 order 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.520
 just start chatting just just just 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.520
 saying maybe its probably you about 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.910
 besides this is more the best kabrita because 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.540
 what we have in is very close here 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.239
 facilities 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.860
 tunnel trim if from vibration 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.959
 load rails still caved under 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.700
 they are poured on gravel this is a matter of several 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.700
 hours until the metro is closed 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.260
 during the day there are trains at night 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.330
 the crawlers they inspect the pin 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.459
 rail on which the current is looking for places 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.230
 where melted insulation with so thin 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:36.330
 work, no electronics can not cope 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.330
 have to act by touch will 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:46.290
 catching need to develop a node for a long time and 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.519
 noble all bring you fell apart 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.750
 underground workers not even rising 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.750
 to the surface can predict 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.790
 weather if rain is flowing from the ceiling 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.110
 so that the subway does not flood and does not close 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.640
 cracks sealed with a special gel 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.769
 lunch and breaks night shift no 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.810
 workers are working tirelessly because 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.120
 time and passengers are not waiting for the metro 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.099
 opened 6 already at 4 am night owls 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.239
 must get out of the tunnel after that 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.400
 electricity is supplied 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.890
