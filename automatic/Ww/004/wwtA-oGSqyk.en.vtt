00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.850
 we would carry in Spanish the same 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.860
 very simple but there are no limits 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.900

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.640

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.640
 I will not take anything to your liking 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.559
 because I'm going to let him have his daughter very 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.480
 useful is that that's love for my taste 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.290
 it has enough stack 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.290

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.070

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.630
 This cheese is fresh and I fill the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.640

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.190

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.420

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.969
 You can also cut the onion 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.969
 peppers 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.899
 because you can throw chips can throw 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.360
 cilantro can throw you can make them from 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.509

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.200
 start with a pan I also put it to 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.360
 to warm 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.300
 and here I have the tortillas they use that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.140
 are the soft tortillas ok 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.140
 so 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.940
 this is the tortilla 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.940
 ok i 'm going to start 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 I like to heat him 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.220
 have a little 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.150
 so I'm going to start throwing him express 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.150
 of butter comes out too 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.080
 so that the egg is cooked 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.050
 I will so warm the cough 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.640
 if they do not have this grill it does not matter what 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.860
 can do in the microwave or what 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.360
 can do in the pan and many 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.180
 people have asked me about this 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.010
 Toaster I bought it well old lady 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.350
 well old lady and I bought it in google wrong 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.700
 do that time ago I think they come back 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.120
 they have them 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.640
 I will 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.700
 to heat my tortilla 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.340
 a little bit because wait, let's put 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.260
 so that it becomes easy for us when 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.030
 let's go deliver the burrito 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.230
 but this same thing can be done in a 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.769
 pan like in the microwave as 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.769
 mentions 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.140
 not much a little enough like 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.840
 so that we can 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.150
 double the tortilla we go back to 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.800
 the stove we do not have this that is 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.600
 perfect only that 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.600
 really cook a little 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.540
 and how you like your egg if you 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.460
 like it softer because it does more 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.000
 soft 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.000
 she 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.810
 and you can have onion 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.569
 and he likes to touch the ball 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.459
 tool 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.459
 Now let's make it in the burrito 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.579
 although it seems that you know there is no limit 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.400
 like I said they can put what you 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.340
 want we put you we start putting 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.180
 here the little egg 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.180
 and the cheese 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.760
 a little 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.760
 and the sauce 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.249
 a little 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.019
 a little bit more 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:48.129
 a little bit by the time I finish 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:50.580
 we have the tortilla now on how it goes 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:55.259
 to wrap we grab 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.710
 towards the sides the tortilla chiquita without 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.700
 fear without fear 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.700
 we squeeze it 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.490
 and we're going to roll it up 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.320
 and we have the burrito now if 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.419
 have a pan you can put us in a 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.230
 pan but I'm going to put it a little while 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.200
 in micro 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.560
 Now what we are looking for is that 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.390
 this part 6 that yes we put it towards 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.810
 down be in a pan cited a 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.810
 grilling 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.230
 we are going to let the cheese that is 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.590
 will melt and we hope that a 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.590
 bit 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.970
 in the end I show you the result 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.840

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:55.419
 do it and the doraditos 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.419

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.899
