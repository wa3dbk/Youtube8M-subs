various RC vehicles that I want to film

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.260 
various RC vehicles that I want to film
from<00:00:46.450> for<00:00:47.450> my<00:00:47.540> quad<00:00:47.810> copters<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.500> mount<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
from for my quad copters I mount on the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.240 
from for my quad copters I mount on the
battery<00:00:50.840> cover<00:00:51.170> basically<00:00:51.740> because<00:00:52.070> that's

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
battery cover basically because that's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.280 
battery cover basically because that's
gonna<00:00:52.400> be<00:00:52.490> right<00:00:52.850> at<00:00:52.970> your<00:00:53.090> CG<00:00:53.630> your<00:00:53.900> center<00:00:54.230> of

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
gonna be right at your CG your center of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.160 
gonna be right at your CG your center of
gravity<00:00:54.739> so<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.910> camera<00:00:56.329> won't<00:00:56.600> throw<00:00:56.960> off

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
gravity so the camera won't throw off

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.930 
gravity so the camera won't throw off
the<00:00:57.590> weight<00:00:57.770> of<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.040> helicopter<00:00:58.220> if<00:00:58.820> it's

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
the weight of the helicopter if it's

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.850 
the weight of the helicopter if it's
mounted<00:00:59.420> right<00:00:59.600> below<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.230> battery<00:01:00.620> like

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
mounted right below the battery like

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.319 
mounted right below the battery like
that<00:01:01.130> and<00:01:02.560> so<00:01:03.560> then<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:04.040> just<00:01:04.299> stick<00:01:05.299> the

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
that and so then you just stick the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.920 
that and so then you just stick the
velcro<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:07.220> there<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:07.880> that<00:01:08.210> holds<00:01:08.659> really

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
velcro on there and that holds really

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.080 
velcro on there and that holds really
nice<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.439> tiring<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.920> camera<00:01:10.369> is<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:10.790> light

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
nice and tiring the camera is so light

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.779 
nice and tiring the camera is so light
it's<00:01:11.869> not<00:01:12.110> gonna<00:01:12.320> shake<00:01:12.740> itself<00:01:13.189> off<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:13.700> a

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
it's not gonna shake itself off with a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.480 
it's not gonna shake itself off with a
belt<00:01:13.999> riving<00:01:14.359> that's<00:01:14.539> a<00:01:14.689> good<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.289> good<00:01:16.159> hold

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
belt riving that's a good a good hold

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.809 
belt riving that's a good a good hold
with<00:01:16.789> just<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.210> velcro<00:01:17.420> alone<00:01:18.429> you<00:01:19.429> can<00:01:19.579> see

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
with just the velcro alone you can see

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.929 
with just the velcro alone you can see
it<00:01:19.939> sticks<00:01:20.270> pretty<00:01:20.509> well<00:01:21.429> but<00:01:22.429> yeah<00:01:22.579> you'll

it sticks pretty well but yeah you'll
notice<00:01:23.359> that<00:01:23.719> when<00:01:24.319> I<00:01:24.350> do<00:01:24.499> that<00:01:24.889> though<00:01:25.219> the

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
notice that when I do that though the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.669 
notice that when I do that though the
camera<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.479> now<00:01:26.950> upside<00:01:27.950> down<00:01:29.049> but<00:01:30.049> with<00:01:30.469> you

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
camera is now upside down but with you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.249 
camera is now upside down but with you
know<00:01:30.799> any<00:01:31.009> normal<00:01:31.549> video<00:01:32.270> editing<00:01:32.719> program<00:01:33.229> I

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
know any normal video editing program I

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.389 
know any normal video editing program I
use<00:01:33.679> iMovie

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
use iMovie

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.429 
use iMovie

you can rotate the film or the video in
the<00:01:39.439> video<00:01:40.009> editor<00:01:40.639> so<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.420> would<00:01:41.719> take<00:01:41.899> you

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
the video editor so I would take you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.050 
the video editor so I would take you
know<00:01:42.319> this<00:01:42.499> is<00:01:42.649> going<00:01:42.889> to<00:01:43.009> end<00:01:43.219> up<00:01:43.369> giving<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
know this is going to end up giving the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.019 
know this is going to end up giving the
upside<00:01:44.539> down<00:01:44.779> footage<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:46.249> I<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.609> flip<00:01:46.909> it

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:47.029 
upside down footage but I just flip it

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:50.379 
upside down footage but I just flip it
over<00:01:47.179> in<00:01:47.479> iMovie<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.289> looks<00:01:48.469> normal<00:01:49.389> one

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
over in iMovie and it looks normal one

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:51.849 
over in iMovie and it looks normal one
problem<00:01:50.749> with<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.079> though<00:01:51.349> is<00:01:51.380> if<00:01:51.709> you've

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
problem with that though is if you've

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.800 
problem with that though is if you've
got<00:01:51.889> one<00:01:52.279> of<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.459> keychain<00:01:52.700> cams<00:01:53.329> that<00:01:53.539> has

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
got one of the keychain cams that has

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.050 
got one of the keychain cams that has
the<00:01:54.079> stupid<00:01:54.560> date<00:01:54.829> stamp<00:01:55.219> down<00:01:55.520> in<00:01:55.639> the<00:01:55.729> bottom

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
the stupid date stamp down in the bottom

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.359 
the stupid date stamp down in the bottom
corner<00:01:56.170> when<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.200> rotate<00:01:57.709> it<00:01:57.889> now<00:01:58.069> it's<00:01:58.279> going

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
corner when you rotate it now it's going

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.239 
corner when you rotate it now it's going
to<00:01:58.459> be<00:01:58.579> up<00:01:58.700> here<00:01:58.939> in<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.179> top<00:01:59.859> so<00:02:00.859> that<00:02:01.069> really

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
to be up here in the top so that really

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.580 
to be up here in the top so that really
only<00:02:01.579> works<00:02:01.789> best<00:02:02.149> when<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.479> can<00:02:02.779> turn<00:02:03.319> off

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
only works best when you can turn off

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.480 
only works best when you can turn off
the<00:02:03.920> date<00:02:04.099> stamp<00:02:04.399> which<00:02:04.819> this<00:02:05.179> HD<00:02:06.130> 808<00:02:07.130> number

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
the date stamp which this HD 808 number

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.960 
the date stamp which this HD 808 number
11<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:09.229> came<00:02:09.590> with<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.130> date<00:02:10.310> stamp<00:02:10.580> turned

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
11 it came with the date stamp turned

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.750 
11 it came with the date stamp turned
off<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.930> I'm<00:02:12.080> getting<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.590> new<00:02:12.770> number<00:02:12.980> 16

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
off and I'm getting a new number 16

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.520 
off and I'm getting a new number 16
which<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.180> think<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.630> also<00:02:14.780> turn<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.380> date

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
which I think you can also turn the date

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.580 
which I think you can also turn the date
stamp<00:02:15.830> off<00:02:16.130> on<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.569> would<00:02:17.810> highly<00:02:18.079> recommend

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
stamp off on so I would highly recommend

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.130 
stamp off on so I would highly recommend
that<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.180> get<00:02:20.329> that<00:02:20.480> stupid

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
that just to get that stupid

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.490 
that just to get that stupid
sample<00:02:21.770> off<00:02:21.830> your<00:02:22.069> screen<00:02:23.020> yeah<00:02:24.020> that's<00:02:24.319> all

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
there is to that and then I figured

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.180 
there is to that and then I figured
while<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.540> was<00:02:26.750> at<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.140> would<00:02:27.200> also<00:02:27.410> show<00:02:27.830> my
