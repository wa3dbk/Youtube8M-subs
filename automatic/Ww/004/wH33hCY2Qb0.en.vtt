00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.300 
by 9to5 mac and this shows kind of what
we<00:01:53.220> saw<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.149> first<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.600> before<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
we saw in the the first one before a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
we saw in the the first one before a
four-inch<00:01:56.310> screen<00:01:56.610> as<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> bigger<00:01:57.149> screen<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
four-inch screen as a bigger screen on a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.060 
four-inch screen as a bigger screen on a
lot<00:01:58.950> less<00:01:59.340> space<00:01:59.759> at<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> bottom<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.840> top

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
lot less space at the bottom and the top

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
lot less space at the bottom and the top
the<00:02:02.070> cameras<00:02:02.520> move<00:02:02.759> slightly<00:02:03.030> over<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.649> said

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the cameras move slightly over as I said

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.410 
the cameras move slightly over as I said
before<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.759> looks<00:02:06.299> pretty<00:02:06.630> good<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.970> looks

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
before it looks pretty good and it looks

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
before it looks pretty good and it looks
like<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.510> some<00:02:12.510> sort<00:02:12.900> of

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
like it's going to have some sort of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.700 
like it's going to have some sort of
home<00:02:14.310> button<00:02:14.670> maybe<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.560> other

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
home button maybe now with the the other

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.410 
home button maybe now with the the other
two<00:02:16.860> are<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.130> sure<00:02:17.460> because<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.150> showing

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
two are not sure because it is showing

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.410 
two are not sure because it is showing
the<00:02:18.660> back<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.770> thing<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> such<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the back but thing is with the such a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.620 
the back but thing is with the such a
small<00:02:21.990> area<00:02:22.520> we're<00:02:23.520> not<00:02:23.790> sure<00:02:24.150> whether<00:02:24.330> or<00:02:24.540> not

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
small area we're not sure whether or not

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.230 
small area we're not sure whether or not
is<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.130> home<00:02:26.970> button

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
is actually going to have a home button

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.930 
is actually going to have a home button
but<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.440> most<00:02:28.830> likely<00:02:28.920> not<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.910> a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
but it's most likely not going to have a

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.700 
but it's most likely not going to have a
home<00:02:30.180> button<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.140> small<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.530> an

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
home button if it's that small of an

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.110 
home button if it's that small of an
area<00:02:31.950> unless<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.730> more<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
area unless it's going to be more of a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.900 
area unless it's going to be more of a
rectangular<00:02:33.750> shaped<00:02:34.530> home<00:02:34.830> button<00:02:35.130> once

fix<00:02:50.640> calm<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.990> think<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.300> most

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
fix calm and I think this one is most

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.720 
fix calm and I think this one is most
likely<00:02:54.570> fake<00:02:55.020> because<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.160> fact<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.490> if

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
likely fake because of the fact that if

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.510 
likely fake because of the fact that if
you<00:02:56.850> take<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> look<00:02:57.300> right<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:58.440> at<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.860> iphone

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
you take a look right here at the iphone

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.460 
you take a look right here at the iphone
that's<00:02:59.940> written<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.480> here<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> text<00:03:01.320> is

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that's written on here the text is

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.190 
that's written on here the text is
definitely<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.430> centered<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.150> aligned<00:03:03.540> with

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
definitely not centered and aligned with

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.080 
definitely not centered and aligned with
the<00:03:04.350> phone<00:03:04.620> itself<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.370> definitely<00:03:05.850> looks

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the phone itself it definitely looks

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.230 
the phone itself it definitely looks
like<00:03:06.300> it's<00:03:06.900> been<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.460> photoshopped<00:03:08.460> on<00:03:08.700> here

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
like it's been a photoshopped on here

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.300 
like it's been a photoshopped on here
and<00:03:09.390> not<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:10.170> good<00:03:10.230> job<00:03:10.590> at<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.250> if
