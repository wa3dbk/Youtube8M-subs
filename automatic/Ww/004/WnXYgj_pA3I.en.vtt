because<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:56.539> Anna<00:00:57.539> even<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.410> comes<00:00:58.739> I'm

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
because I'm Anna even if it is comes I'm

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
because I'm Anna even if it is comes I'm
not<00:00:59.430> confidant<00:01:00.059> my<00:01:00.090> hand<00:01:00.649> obviously<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
not confidant my hand obviously if the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.529 
not confidant my hand obviously if the
six<00:01:02.160> come<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:02.879> impose<00:01:03.359> too

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
six come not I'm not impose too

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.990 
six come not I'm not impose too
confident<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> hit<00:01:05.790> two

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
confident so I really have to hit two

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.910 
confident so I really have to hit two
pair<00:01:06.210> trips<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.930> feel<00:01:07.409> any<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:09.650> that's<00:01:10.650> my

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
pair trips to feel any good so that's my

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.700 
pair trips to feel any good so that's my
reasoning<00:01:13.220> um<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> we'll<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.259> how<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> pay

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
reasoning um so we'll see how the pay

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
reasoning um so we'll see how the pay
table<00:01:16.890> place<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.420> loose<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
table place if it's if it's loose that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.420 
table place if it's if it's loose that
I'm<00:01:19.200> definitely<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> sit<00:01:19.950> back<00:01:20.130> like

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I'm definitely going to sit back like

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.090 
I'm definitely going to sit back like
them<00:01:20.610> making<00:01:20.790> mistakes<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.710> if<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:23.040> turn

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
them making mistakes but if they turn

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.810 
them making mistakes but if they turn
out<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.640> nits<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:25.340> plain<00:01:26.340> cream<00:01:26.670> your

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
out to be nits and just plain cream your

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.140 
out to be nits and just plain cream your
hands<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.600> don't<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.990> expect<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
hands which I don't really expect in the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:39.380 
hands which I don't really expect in the
two<00:01:30.150> dollar<00:01:31.460> level<00:01:33.110> um<00:01:37.700> um<00:01:38.700> yeah<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> don't

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
two dollar level um um yeah I don't

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
two dollar level um um yeah I don't
really<00:01:39.689> expect<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.060> we'll<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
really expect it so we'll see how it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.490 
really expect it so we'll see how it

worth it now i mean if you go up to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.890 
worth it now i mean if you go up to
2,000<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.040> know<00:03:47.130> that's<00:03:47.790> good<00:03:48.060> that's<00:03:48.810> a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
2,000 you know that's good that's a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.380 
2,000 you know that's good that's a
decent<00:03:49.080> chip<00:03:49.860> static<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:50.400> good<00:03:50.670> but<00:03:51.330> it's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
decent chip static it's good but it's

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.550 
decent chip static it's good but it's
not<00:03:51.600> cool<00:03:51.930> as<00:03:53.690> effective<00:03:54.690> as<00:03:55.020> if<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.470> were

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
not cool as effective as if you were

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.540 
not cool as effective as if you were
down<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> thousand<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.910> know<00:03:58.550> you're

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
down to a thousand you know you're

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.910 
down to a thousand you know you're
you're<00:03:59.910> definitely<00:04:00.150> crippled<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.500> that's<00:04:01.680> the
