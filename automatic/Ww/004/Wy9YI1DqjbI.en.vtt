00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
eight you know and then you need eight

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.440 
eight you know and then you need eight
more<00:02:09.479> stitches<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:11.430> all<00:02:11.640> together<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:12.300> do

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
more stitches so all together you do

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.220 
more stitches so all together you do
this<00:02:12.629> process<00:02:13.560> at<00:02:13.860> nine<00:02:14.069> times

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
this process at nine times

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.760 
this process at nine times
and<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.710> how<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.040> looks<00:02:19.110> when<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.380> do<00:02:20.590> it

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.830 
and this is how it looks when you do it
fast<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:24.460> is<00:02:24.670> how<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.180> looks<00:02:25.450> when<00:02:25.690> you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
fast and this is how it looks when you

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.600 
fast and this is how it looks when you
do<00:02:25.960> it<00:02:26.080> superfast

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.460 

okay
