00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.620
 the German philosopher Günther different 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.390
 would you have the main subject 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.730
 antiquity of the famous man 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.480
 sentence said man can do more 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.980
 make out of that can imagine 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 this is the situation of people 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.900
 technical and was with a 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.580
 automatic old signs with our 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.070
 Understand and sometimes are the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.170
 Realities often simply overwhelmed 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.879
 for politics to prevail 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.070
 half-life two years ago 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.739
 economy not two minutes ago and us 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.710
 all the times you found this theory 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.260
 pose with strategy people 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.239
 overwhelmed it is not just political 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 ask for an exit from nuclear energy 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.660
 but always into the atomic age 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 change cultural forms with what 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.100
 a question of guilt and responsibility 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.590
 and put the human that 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.789
 develop awareness as one with 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.440
 Their dimension actually lives 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.440
 restless transported 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.630
 as the kurgemeinde 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.220
 came to me and asked me if I was 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.830
 could write something 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.180
 a work that deals with the important 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.970
 and large nuclear issue was busy 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.650
 Of course, I was pleased, too 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.270
 a bit baffled because you can do that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 You can do something musical like that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.460
 you can do it that way 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.119
 argue that it makes sense me 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.610
 I then searched for texts if I goethe 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.560
 or eichendorf names that we against 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.590
 not everything but i discovered by 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.289
 a coincidence in time in the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.899
 German newspaper the time a text 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:01.090
 from ulf stolterfoht exactly to 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.970
 Radiation is easier this topic 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.759
 as has smelled and then me up 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.300
 make my request immediately 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.310
 with the text you want 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.290
 He is the right person with you 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.010
 that honored me and I have then 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.590
 still get texts from gomringer eugen 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.739
 gomringer and günter eich and have 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.780
 resorted to old English texts 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.510
 even made something alfred 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.880
 liechtenstein the expressionist 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.519
 denser and then not ovid 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.579
 forgot and now I could work 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.680
 that fascinated me tremendously and 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.180
 I have really intense for months 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.070
 sat there and again and again 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.959
 discarded and started over again 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.480
 and it made me immensely happy and 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.299
 cost a lot of strength and great 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.829
 enrichment and that's what I am for 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.829
 still grateful 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.099
 if I 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.790
 Bello saw from Geneva to Lyon 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.670
 maybe 30 kilometers before lyon 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.680
 impressive picture it was a while 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.750
 blooming with horses peaceful apple trees 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.800
 and pretty close behind it 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.330
 the four reactors one of books 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.750
 nuclear power plant and I thought that is 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.580
 Actually, what exactly am I in the piece 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.610
 that I wrote a few years ago 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.810
 I've tried roofing somehow 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.269
 to thematize 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.110
 it is about the possibilities of the 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.810
 human activity, the viewing 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.799
 simply because I am on see on enjoy 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.209
 this nature 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:55.780
 there were people who worked for it 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.590
 that's what the apples look like 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.870
 maybe they taste very good but the 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.209
 are also similar people the these 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.450
 Reactors have been built right now 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.329
 am working and take care of everything 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.510
 as controlled as possible goes well 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.310
 actually before it starts there is one 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.180
 Fantasy of a single person 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.370
 note and the penultimate act remains 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.669
 suddenly everything quiet 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.060
 So it's like frozen under cook 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:31.900
 begins to sing the affected people 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.330
 that the words and in relation to 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.680
 your own birthday and it is 1 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.110
 arises depending on the type of 30 seconds 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.660
 an eight-tone cloud and then begins 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.860
 the piece with texts by john, so to speak 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.380
 milton from the lost paradise 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.740
 and there is already mentioned that actually 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:58.600
 man is free and he is himself 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.889
 whispered this liberty whispered 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.340
 things will not happen until much later 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:07.680
 in the piece then understand there are 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.680
 then in a tremendous 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.430
 mechanics lexicon definitions become 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:21.900
 It can take you off the chorus and at the end 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.819
 8, after a non-explosion the music 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.590
 really totally frozen and it is 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:30.780
 you only hear a few quotes 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.080
 testimonials from kazakhstan's people 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.750
 Victims were the atomic experiments of the 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.169
 Soviet Union for 50 years has made in 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.190
 a desert at the end says sounds 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:50.009
 another sentence from john milton it's about 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:52.440
 the silence of the heavenly course no 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.949
 answer no solution nor one 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.949
 silence 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.340
 the biggest difference between the 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.000
 works is that we in 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.240
 christophs who are directly involved 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.080
 be industrialized in this and 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.140
 instrumentalized world and 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.110
 society and as a singer and also in the 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.490
 Audience device directly into this tooth 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.870
 shipping companies and with a lot 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.090
 rhythmic elements with a lot 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.670
 spoken text with a lot of lexicon 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.260
 Definitions will be like part of this 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.060
 big machines with the factory 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.910
 actually very much inside 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.580
 hidden anger describes meantime 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:37.870
 in hans-martin, however, kantate radiation 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.610
 We can do it easier than light 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.460
 Do not withdraw the power from the 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.220
 picture goes out the string 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.230
 and we describe fog like 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.000
 describe the coldness of stressing the 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.620
 Danger of a cage of the one 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.850
 gets crack and so simple things 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:00.400
 like cutouts from a popular song that 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.770
 said now I'm going to drink brünnele 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.900
 but not and I go to the bunny ostrich 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.870
 but not and now I'm going 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.810
 but I do not sleep at home 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:14.470
 And that's something big in the choir 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.900
 anxiety actually triggers and for 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.390
 is important to us somehow 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.510
 to understand with what huge 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:25.620
 But we actually asked each other 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.620
 try to disassemble
