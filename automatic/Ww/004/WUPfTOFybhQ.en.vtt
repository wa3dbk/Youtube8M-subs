00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
game there would no longer serve as

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
game there would no longer serve as

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
rewards for playing the game so I've

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.420 
rewards for playing the game so I've
decided<00:01:14.729> against<00:01:15.509> having<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
decided against having them now it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.859 
decided against having them now it
should<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.640> mentioned<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.479> does<00:01:18.689> not

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
should be mentioned that this does not

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
should be mentioned that this does not
mean<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.170> Smash<00:01:19.560> Bros<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> new

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
mean that Smash Bros will not have a new

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
mean that Smash Bros will not have a new
story<00:01:21.030> mode<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.110> means<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.680> there

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
story mode all this means is that there

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.590 
story mode all this means is that there
will<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.100> less<00:01:23.310> cinematic<00:01:23.909> cutscenes<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.479> us

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
will be less cinematic cutscenes for us

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.660 
will be less cinematic cutscenes for us
to<00:01:24.750> watch<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> probably<00:01:25.979> expect<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to watch we can probably expect to see a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
to watch we can probably expect to see a
much<00:01:26.909> more<00:01:27.090> linear<00:01:27.360> story<00:01:27.840> mode<00:01:28.080> where<00:01:28.590> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
much more linear story mode where you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.319 
much more linear story mode where you
have<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> defeat<00:01:29.189> certain<00:01:29.549> characters<00:01:30.000> or

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
have to defeat certain characters or

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.530 
have to defeat certain characters or
overcome<00:01:30.930> certain<00:01:31.110> obstacles<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.890> advance

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
overcome certain obstacles to advance

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.570 
overcome certain obstacles to advance
in<00:01:33.230> one<00:01:33.500> way<00:01:33.650> this<00:01:33.950> can<00:01:34.130> be<00:01:34.220> seen<00:01:34.370> as<00:01:34.550> a

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
in one way this can be seen as a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.790 
in one way this can be seen as a
positive<00:01:34.820> thing<00:01:35.140> instead<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.200> spending<00:01:36.560> long

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
positive thing instead of spending long

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.620 
positive thing instead of spending long
hours<00:01:36.980> creating<00:01:37.580> these<00:01:37.700> cutscenes<00:01:38.120> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
hours creating these cutscenes the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.210 
hours creating these cutscenes the
developers<00:01:39.110> can<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:39.320> focus<00:01:39.770> their<00:01:39.800> attention

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
developers can now focus their attention

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.090 
developers can now focus their attention
on<00:01:40.550> developing<00:01:40.760> new<00:01:41.180> characters<00:01:41.800> stages<00:01:42.800> and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.820 
who never even played the single-player
so<00:01:47.300> it<00:01:47.510> would<00:01:47.660> be<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> lot<00:01:47.990> better<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.380> focus<00:01:48.680> on

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
so it would be a lot better to focus on

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.460 
so it would be a lot better to focus on
what<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.190> fans<00:01:49.430> would<00:01:49.670> want<00:01:49.700> most<00:01:50.260> but<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.350> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
what the fans would want most but on the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.290 
what the fans would want most but on the
other<00:01:51.620> hand<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.370> could<00:01:52.490> say<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.820> Sakurai

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
other hand you could say that Sakurai

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.090 
other hand you could say that Sakurai
is<00:01:53.450> playing<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.900> way<00:01:54.080> too<00:01:54.140> safe<00:01:54.560> with<00:01:54.800> all<00:01:54.920> this

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
is playing it way too safe with all this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.520 
is playing it way too safe with all this
if<00:01:55.760> players<00:01:56.090> really<00:01:56.510> want<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.900> avoid<00:01:57.050> spoilers

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
if players really want to avoid spoilers

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.030 
if players really want to avoid spoilers
they<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.280> every<00:01:58.730> right<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.000> do<00:01:59.300> so<00:01:59.510> also<00:02:00.350> one

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
they have every right to do so also one

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.410 
they have every right to do so also one
of<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.190> greatest<00:02:01.430> progressions<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.240> we're

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
of the greatest progressions that we're

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.240 
of the greatest progressions that we're
all<00:02:02.510> made<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:03.200> creating<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.740> story<00:02:04.040> that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
all made is creating a story that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.250 
all made is creating a story that
actually<00:02:04.430> included<00:02:05.180> all<00:02:05.300> of<00:02:05.540> these<00:02:05.720> videogame

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
actually included all of these videogame

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.810 
actually included all of these videogame
characters<00:02:06.710> interacting<00:02:07.400> with<00:02:07.550> each<00:02:07.580> other

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
characters interacting with each other

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.810 
characters interacting with each other
too<00:02:08.690> many<00:02:08.899> Subspace<00:02:09.770> Emissary<00:02:09.800> could<00:02:10.460> even<00:02:10.670> be

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
too many Subspace Emissary could even be

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.600 
too many Subspace Emissary could even be
considered<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.390> game<00:02:11.630> all<00:02:11.810> by<00:02:12.110> itself<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.740> it's

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
considered a game all by itself so it's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.920 
considered a game all by itself so it's
kind<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.880> sad<00:02:14.090> knowing<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:14.690> won't<00:02:14.780> be

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
