00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.970 
so you can see it clearly here I'm just
gonna<00:03:15.620> tie<00:03:16.340> my<00:03:16.550> hair<00:03:16.850> into<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.420> bun<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:18.410> make

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
gonna tie my hair into a bun and make

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.610 
gonna tie my hair into a bun and make
sure<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.460> a<00:03:19.670> good<00:03:20.270> medium-sized<00:03:21.110> button

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
sure it's a good medium-sized button

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.400 
sure it's a good medium-sized button
don't<00:03:21.890> make<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.370> too<00:03:22.400> small<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.840> yeah<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.350> think

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
don't make it too small so yeah I think

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.240 
don't make it too small so yeah I think
it's<00:03:27.800> like<00:03:27.890> more<00:03:28.550> or<00:03:28.730> less<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.420> size

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.790
