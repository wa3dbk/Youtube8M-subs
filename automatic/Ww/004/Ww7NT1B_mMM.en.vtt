00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
different two types so when you're on

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.539 
different two types so when you're on
the<00:03:12.930> right<00:03:13.170> tube<00:03:13.440> type<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:13.950> put<00:03:14.190> put<00:03:14.430> in

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
the right tube type that you put put in

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.699 
the right tube type that you put put in
you<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.760> press<00:03:15.060> ok<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.260> will<00:03:16.350> count<00:03:16.530> down

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
you just press ok and it will count down

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.570 
you just press ok and it will count down

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
each number got it counts down to will

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.520 
each number got it counts down to will
represent<00:03:24.239> two<00:03:24.480> different<00:03:24.510> testings<00:03:25.260> doing

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
represent two different testings doing

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.230 
represent two different testings doing
on<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> tube<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.390> it's<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.600> preamp<00:03:28.019> tube

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
on the tube and if it's a preamp tube

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.300 
on the tube and if it's a preamp tube
it's<00:03:30.240> actually<00:03:30.990> two<00:03:31.410> tubes<00:03:31.710> in<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.100> bottle

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
it's actually two tubes in one bottle

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.390 
it's actually two tubes in one bottle
because<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.240> george<00:03:33.480> i<00:03:33.750> owed<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.220> will

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
because it's george i owed so it will

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.760 
because it's george i owed so it will
count<00:03:35.640> down<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.750> will<00:03:36.870> arrive<00:03:37.230> at<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
count down and it will arrive at to

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.370 
count down and it will arrive at to
match<00:03:38.070> numbers<00:03:38.610> one<00:03:39.420> for<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.750> one<00:03:39.900> side<00:03:40.170> and

using<00:05:01.029> op<00:05:01.209> amps<00:05:01.599> instead<00:05:02.049> of<00:05:02.199> tubes<00:05:03.179> and<00:05:04.179> it's

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:04.299 
using op amps instead of tubes and it's

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:05.759 
using op amps instead of tubes and it's
actually<00:05:04.419> come<00:05:04.719> out<00:05:04.839> sounding<00:05:05.049> pretty<00:05:05.349> smart

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:05.769 
actually come out sounding pretty smart

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:08.369 
actually come out sounding pretty smart
but<00:05:06.399> the<00:05:06.579> only<00:05:06.729> it's<00:05:07.449> all<00:05:07.569> analog<00:05:08.019> the<00:05:08.199> only

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
but the only it's all analog the only

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.609 
but the only it's all analog the only
digital<00:05:08.589> thing<00:05:08.979> is<00:05:09.099> the<00:05:09.189> reverb<00:05:09.839> as<00:05:10.839> a<00:05:11.019> reverb

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:11.619 
digital thing is the reverb as a reverb

digital thing is the reverb as a reverb
module<00:05:12.360> in<00:05:13.360> there<00:05:13.629> you<00:05:13.809> know<00:05:13.839> which<00:05:14.139> has<00:05:15.209> 33

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:16.209 
module in there you know which has 33

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:19.279 
module in there you know which has 33
type<00:05:16.419> settings<00:05:16.959> play<00:05:17.229> tall<00:05:17.589> and<00:05:17.829> spring<00:05:18.159> and

obviously<00:05:20.289> the<00:05:20.439> channel<00:05:21.069> switching<00:05:21.579> the<00:05:22.299> foot

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
obviously the channel switching the foot

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.979 
obviously the channel switching the foot
switch<00:05:22.629> is<00:05:23.019> the<00:05:23.499> effects<00:05:23.889> loop<00:05:24.329> work<00:05:25.329> exactly

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:25.989 
switch is the effects loop work exactly

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:30.359 
switch is the effects loop work exactly
