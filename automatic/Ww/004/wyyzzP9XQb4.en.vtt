00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
using to make you piece I usually

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.410 
using to make you piece I usually
connect<00:03:06.549> these<00:03:07.410> from<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.620> torso<00:03:09.269> coming<00:03:10.269> down

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
connect these from the torso coming down

from torso to the hips and the legs so

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.240 
from torso to the hips and the legs so
that<00:03:13.660> way<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.170> will<00:03:14.319> stay<00:03:14.590> right<00:03:14.829> there<00:03:14.890> we'll

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
that way it will stay right there we'll

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:25.199 
that way it will stay right there we'll
move<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:24.340> that's<00:03:24.549> how<00:03:24.760> you're<00:03:24.880> going<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.090> look

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209

like<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.590> got<00:03:26.739> your<00:03:26.950> piece<00:03:27.160> right<00:03:27.459> here

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
like and you got your piece right here

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.129 
like and you got your piece right here
example<00:03:29.109> if<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.250> put<00:03:30.430> one<00:03:30.609> of<00:03:30.639> these<00:03:30.819> pieces

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
example if you put one of these pieces

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.430 
example if you put one of these pieces
see<00:03:32.139> we'll<00:03:32.380> be<00:03:32.410> just<00:03:32.799> kind<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:33.579> like<00:03:33.790> this

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
see we'll be just kind of just like this

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.449 
see we'll be just kind of just like this
that<00:03:35.440> piece<00:03:35.709> right<00:03:35.739> there<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.220> going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.400> be

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
that piece right there is going to be

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.090 
that piece right there is going to be
inside<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.840> pipe<00:03:38.109> is<00:03:38.319> going<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.590> coming<00:03:38.829> out

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
inside the pipe is going to coming out

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.400 
inside the pipe is going to coming out
of<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.310> back<00:03:39.690> okay

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.710 

the<00:03:47.410> only<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.130> only<00:03:48.430> complaint<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.180> got<00:03:49.510> about

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
the only the only complaint I got about

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.380 
the only the only complaint I got about
this<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:51.220> because<00:03:52.030> he<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.470> going<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.920> be<00:03:54.070> in

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
this it's because he is going to be in

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.920 
this it's because he is going to be in
90-degree<00:03:55.390> angle

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
90-degree angle

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.760 
90-degree angle
you<00:03:56.560> won't<00:03:56.770> be<00:03:56.920> able<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.250> move<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.910> up<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.390> down

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
you won't be able to move it up and down

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.190 
you won't be able to move it up and down
it's<00:03:59.770> going<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.190> very<00:04:00.370> steady<00:04:00.700> though<00:04:01.200> so

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
it's going to be very steady though so

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.390 
it's going to be very steady though so
you<00:04:02.260> won't<00:04:02.530> be<00:04:02.650> able<00:04:02.770> to<00:04:02.920> move<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.430> up<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.840> down

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
you won't be able to move it up and down

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.160 
you won't be able to move it up and down
so<00:04:06.400> if<00:04:06.580> you<00:04:06.730> making<00:04:07.270> a<00:04:07.360> figure<00:04:07.600> it's<00:04:07.930> going<00:04:08.110> to

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
so if you making a figure it's going to

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.090 
so if you making a figure it's going to
be<00:04:08.260> leaning<00:04:08.500> forward<00:04:09.220> or<00:04:09.460> leaning<00:04:10.150> back<00:04:11.100> you

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
be leaning forward or leaning back you

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.930 
be leaning forward or leaning back you
might<00:04:12.370> going<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.700> counter<00:04:13.150> problem<00:04:14.050> here<00:04:14.940> now

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
might going to counter problem here now
