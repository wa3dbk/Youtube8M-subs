00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
let's go for a ride oh you're doing that

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.740 
let's go for a ride oh you're doing that
thing<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.109> backwards<00:00:54.530> there<00:00:54.710> oh<00:00:55.570> okay<00:00:56.570> that's

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
thing the backwards there oh okay that's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.569 
thing the backwards there oh okay that's
what<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.109> is

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
what it is

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.150 
what it is
all<00:00:58.579> right<00:00:59.379> let's<00:01:00.379> making<00:01:00.679> sure<00:01:00.800> that<00:01:01.070> the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
all right let's making sure that the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.119 
all right let's making sure that the
system<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:01.670> off<00:01:02.410> you<00:01:03.410> can<00:01:03.559> make<00:01:03.679> it<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.920> weather

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
system is off you can make it a weather

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.980 
system is off you can make it a weather
system<00:01:04.430> but<00:01:04.730> it's<00:01:04.879> easier<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.360> do<00:01:05.480> without<00:01:05.720> the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
system but it's easier to do without the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.200 
system but it's easier to do without the
system<00:01:06.290> okay<00:01:06.680> because<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.790> system<00:01:08.090> is

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
system okay because the system is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.930 
system okay because the system is
working<00:01:08.390> either<00:01:09.350> way<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.650> go<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.220> if<00:01:10.760> we're

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
working either way you go so if we're

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.510 
working either way you go so if we're
reversing<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.750> I'm<00:01:12.230> turning<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.340> car<00:01:13.490> around

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
reversing and I'm turning the car around

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.230 
reversing and I'm turning the car around
the<00:01:13.880> system<00:01:14.119> will<00:01:14.420> try<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:16.250> help<00:01:16.670> me<00:01:17.030> get

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
the system will try to to help me get

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.999 
the system will try to to help me get
out<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.659> gate<00:01:17.869> which<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.290> want<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.619> have<00:01:18.950> a

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
out of this gate which I want to have a

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.649 
out of this gate which I want to have a
skid<00:01:19.220> do<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.759> want<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.939> car<00:01:20.119> around<00:01:20.299> after

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
skid do you want the car around after

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.370 
skid do you want the car around after
yeah<00:01:20.810> okay<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.640> you're<00:01:22.820> doing<00:01:23.380> rough

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
yeah okay but if you're doing rough

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.870 
yeah okay but if you're doing rough
enough<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.829> turn<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.189> around<00:01:25.280> with<00:01:25.729> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
enough you turn it around with the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.630 
enough you turn it around with the
system<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:26.450> um<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:27.950> disconnect<00:01:28.460> any

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
system but um just disconnect any

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.520 
system but um just disconnect any
incident<00:01:29.119> make<00:01:29.329> it<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.630> good<00:01:30.020> one

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
incident make it a good one

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:41.680 
incident make it a good one
okay<00:01:30.920> yeah<00:01:31.130> yeah

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.350 

yes<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:44.100> don't<00:01:44.310> need<00:01:44.490> more<00:01:44.640> space<00:01:44.910> than<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
yes you don't need more space than the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
yes you don't need more space than the
length<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> car

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:17.630 

yes

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.460 

hmm<00:02:18.360> yeah<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.600> could<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.170> one-lane

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
hmm yeah you could do it in a one-lane

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.370 
hmm yeah you could do it in a one-lane
road<00:02:19.680> yeah<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.730> your<00:02:20.850> skills<00:02:21.150> yeah<00:02:22.050> probably

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
road yeah with your skills yeah probably

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.000 
road yeah with your skills yeah probably
yeah<00:02:22.950> hopefully<00:02:23.870> well<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.470> thing<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.710> that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
yeah hopefully well the thing is that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.520 
yeah hopefully well the thing is that
you<00:02:26.190> you're<00:02:26.610> reversing<00:02:26.850> either<00:02:27.840> either<00:02:28.380> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
you you're reversing either either you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.040 
you you're reversing either either you
turn<00:02:28.680> around<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.430> use<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.030> mirrors<00:02:30.330> yeah

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
turn around or you use the mirrors yeah

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.600 
turn around or you use the mirrors yeah
because<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.740> have<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.130> know<00:02:32.280> where<00:02:32.490> you're

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
because you have to know where you're

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.830 
because you have to know where you're
going<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> course<00:02:33.210> mm-hmm

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
going of course mm-hmm

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.100 
going of course mm-hmm
define<00:02:34.200> keep<00:02:35.100> keep<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> lane<00:02:36.270> yeah

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
define keep keep in the lane yeah

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.900 
define keep keep in the lane yeah
it's<00:02:37.650> an<00:02:37.710> easier<00:02:37.920> turn<00:02:38.130> around<00:02:38.370> or<00:02:38.610> use<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
it's an easier turn around or use the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.020 
it's an easier turn around or use the
mirrors<00:02:39.180> that's<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.730> normally<00:02:41.730> use<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
mirrors that's it I normally use the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.670 
mirrors that's it I normally use the
mirrors<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.780> you're<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.020> Reverse<00:02:43.170> and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
mirrors and so you're in Reverse and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.110 
mirrors and so you're in Reverse and
then<00:02:43.860> you're<00:02:43.980> popping<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.459> into<00:02:44.580> drive<00:02:44.850> what

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
then you're popping it into drive what

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.360 
then you're popping it into drive what
dream<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.810> spin<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.620> kind<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.890> coming<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.250> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
dream the spin it's kind of coming to it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.960 
dream the spin it's kind of coming to it
okay

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
okay

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.090 
okay
we're<00:02:48.209> reversing<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.050> may<00:02:49.470> decide<00:02:49.800> okay

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
we're reversing and I may decide okay

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.290 
we're reversing and I may decide okay
I've<00:02:50.310> done<00:02:50.520> like<00:02:50.880> this

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
I've done like this

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.030 
I've done like this

they cover two under car in this way
yeah<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:53.880> I'll<00:02:54.030> prepare<00:02:54.240> myself<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.810> use<00:02:55.080> my

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
yeah then I'll prepare myself to use my

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.620 
yeah then I'll prepare myself to use my
left<00:02:55.440> hand<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.890> put<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> down<00:02:56.459> here<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:57.600> a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
left hand I put it down here on a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.930 
left hand I put it down here on a
steering<00:02:57.900> wheel<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.400> with<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.550> good<00:02:59.730> whip

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
steering wheel in with that good whip

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.800 
steering wheel in with that good whip
move<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.920> right<00:03:02.100> hand<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.910> gearshift

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
move the right hand on the gearshift

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.960 
move the right hand on the gearshift
yeah<00:03:04.170> even<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:04.830> manual<00:03:05.280> or<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.670> sort<00:03:05.910> of

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
yeah even if it's manual or it sort of

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.600 
yeah even if it's manual or it sort of
he<00:03:06.239> doesn't<00:03:06.480> matter<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.840> same<00:03:07.610> increase

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
he doesn't matter it's the same increase

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.240 
he doesn't matter it's the same increase
the<00:03:08.730> speed<00:03:08.880> all<00:03:09.060> right<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.390> accelerate<00:03:10.250> as

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the speed all right just accelerate as

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.370 
the speed all right just accelerate as
long<00:03:11.459> as<00:03:11.640> I'm<00:03:11.790> accelerating<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.989> car<00:03:13.170> would

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
long as I'm accelerating the car would

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.440 
long as I'm accelerating the car would
go<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> little<00:03:13.709> bit<00:03:13.920> more<00:03:14.700> weight<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.330> front

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
go a little bit more weight on the front

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.820 
go a little bit more weight on the front
of<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> course<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.260> because<00:03:16.380> that's<00:03:16.680> where

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
of the course is because that's where

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.890 
of the course is because that's where
the<00:03:16.890> powers<00:03:17.190> are<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.640> powers<00:03:18.060> yeah<00:03:18.360> we're

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the powers are the powers yeah we're

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.000 
the powers are the powers yeah we're
going<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.380> direction

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
going in this direction

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.860 
going in this direction
yeah<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.520> it's<00:03:20.610> pushing<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.150> car<00:03:21.570> then

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
yeah and it's pushing the car then

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.539 
yeah and it's pushing the car then
Nicole<00:03:22.560> raises<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.920> little<00:03:23.160> bit<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.400> this

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
Nicole raises a little bit like this

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.199 
Nicole raises a little bit like this
okay<00:03:23.970> okay<00:03:24.890> then<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.920> say<00:03:26.190> okay<00:03:26.519> time<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.940> turn

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
okay okay then I say okay time to turn

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.500 
okay okay then I say okay time to turn
mm-hmm<00:03:27.930> released<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:29.519> fog<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:30.180> at<00:03:30.269> least<00:03:30.390> it

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
mm-hmm released the fog or at least it

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.420 
mm-hmm released the fog or at least it
yes<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.290> car<00:03:31.470> goes<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.950> bit<00:03:32.190> like

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
yes and the car goes a little bit like

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.280 
yes and the car goes a little bit like
this<00:03:32.640> not<00:03:32.850> much<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.299> little<00:03:33.450> bit<00:03:33.750> which

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
this not much but a little bit which

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.130 
this not much but a little bit which
helped<00:03:34.590> me<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:35.459> lose<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.760> grip<00:03:35.910> on<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.660> front

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
helped me to lose the grip on the front

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.810 
helped me to lose the grip on the front
wheels<00:03:37.350> because<00:03:37.920> that's<00:03:38.100> what<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.370> want<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.700> do

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
wheels because that's what I want to do

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.930 
wheels because that's what I want to do
when<00:03:39.000> I'm<00:03:39.120> turning<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.540> car<00:03:39.690> yeah<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.530> I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
when I'm turning the car yeah so I

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.210 
when I'm turning the car yeah so I
accelerate<00:03:42.200> make<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> decision<00:03:43.799> time<00:03:44.040> to

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
accelerate make the decision time to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.000 
accelerate make the decision time to
turn<00:03:44.370> release<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> gas<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.799> I'm<00:03:46.799> almost

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
turn release the gas and I'm almost

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.210 
turn release the gas and I'm almost
almost<00:03:47.940> at<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.209> same<00:03:48.390> time<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:49.320> one

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
almost at the same time just one

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.949 
almost at the same time just one
hundredths<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.880> second<00:03:51.209> later<00:03:51.390> then<00:03:51.930> I

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
hundredths of a second later then I

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.920 
hundredths of a second later then I
release<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.410> guess<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:53.480> take<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> steering

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
release to guess I take the steering

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.509 
release to guess I take the steering
wheel<00:03:55.049> all<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.620> way<00:03:55.890> down<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.220> have<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.370> good

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
wheel all the way down I have a good

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.370 
wheel all the way down I have a good
grip<00:03:56.670> yeah<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.030> set<00:03:57.299> all<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.080> way<00:03:58.110> down<00:03:58.350> like

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
grip yeah I set all the way down like

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.190 
grip yeah I set all the way down like
this<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.910> now<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.120> car<00:04:00.420> will<00:04:00.630> start<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.049> turn

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
this and now the car will start to turn

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.380 
this and now the car will start to turn
like<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.620> mhm<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.519> when<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.150> were<00:04:03.209> passing

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
like this mhm and when we were passing

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.440 
like this mhm and when we were passing
90<00:04:03.930> degrees<00:04:04.530> angle<00:04:05.100> that's<00:04:05.820> when<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.090> started

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
90 degrees angle that's when I started

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.330 
90 degrees angle that's when I started
go<00:04:06.570> back<00:04:06.780> again<00:04:07.049> we're<00:04:07.260> saying<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:08.070> keep<00:04:08.190> your
