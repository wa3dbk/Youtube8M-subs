00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
background on again this is what it

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.340 
background on again this is what it
looks<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.600> takes<00:01:12.750> whatever<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.200> in

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and it makes it blurry hence the name

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.219 
and it makes it blurry hence the name
buried<00:01:17.189> NC<00:01:17.640> background<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229

after<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.880> over<00:01:36.030> some<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> blur<00:01:36.689> values

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
after we go over some of the blur values

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.810 
after we go over some of the blur values
so<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.770> turn<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> down<00:01:38.189> you'll<00:01:38.460> notice

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so when we turn it down you'll notice

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.130 
so when we turn it down you'll notice
that<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.150> easily<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that you can easily make out the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
that you can easily make out the
background<00:01:40.710> however<00:01:41.280> when<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> turn<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.790> up

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
background however when you turn it up

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
background however when you turn it up
it's<00:01:42.240> quite<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.810> opposite<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.250> it's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's quite the opposite so really it's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.920 
it's quite the opposite so really it's
up<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.180> want<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> leave<00:01:45.750> your

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
up to you where you want to leave your

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
up to you where you want to leave your
border<00:01:46.350> value<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.460> leaving<00:01:47.909> at<00:01:48.030> more

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
border value I just like leaving at more

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.359 
border value I just like leaving at more
towards<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.960> middle<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.560> more<00:01:49.920> towards<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
towards the middle or more towards the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160 
towards the middle or more towards the
lower<00:01:50.549> end<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.119> things<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.020> least

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
lower end of things so you can at least

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.780 
lower end of things so you can at least
kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> make<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.430> gives<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
kind of make it out so it gives you that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.819 
kind of make it out so it gives you that
really<00:01:54.090> nice<00:01:54.299> effect<00:01:54.810> also<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> mentioned

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
really nice effect also as I mentioned

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.950 
really nice effect also as I mentioned
there<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.430> color<00:01:56.880> tints<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:57.869> instance

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
there are color tints so for instance

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.020 
there are color tints so for instance
you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.500> anywhere<00:01:58.829> from<00:01:59.159> black<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.790> let's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you can go anywhere from black to let's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.420 
you can go anywhere from black to let's
say<00:02:00.270> yellow<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:00.869> magenta<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.310> up

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
say yellow or magenta so it's really up

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.030 
say yellow or magenta so it's really up
to<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.880> let's<00:02:03.360> go<00:02:03.540> ahead<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.439> set<00:02:04.710> the

dark gray tint

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.800 
dark gray tint
and<00:02:06.829> we<00:02:07.009> can<00:02:07.130> increase<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.610> tent<00:02:08.030> as<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.660> can

amazing<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:29.150> makes<00:02:29.540> Notification<00:02:30.230> Center

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
amazing it makes Notification Center

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.140 
amazing it makes Notification Center
much<00:02:30.650> more<00:02:30.890> elegant<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.489> my<00:02:31.610> opinion<00:02:31.910> and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
much more elegant in my opinion and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.540 
much more elegant in my opinion and
overall<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.140> better<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.560> look<00:02:33.709> at<00:02:33.920> right<00:02:34.519> now

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
overall just better to look at right now

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.800

that<00:02:34.760> we've<00:02:34.880> gone<00:02:35.030> over<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.300> first<00:02:35.510> one<00:02:35.690> I'm

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
that we've gone over the first one I'm

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
probably one of the more notable tweaks

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.250 
probably one of the more notable tweaks
in<00:02:37.519> this<00:02:37.849> video<00:02:38.150> let's<00:02:38.690> actually<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:39.080> into

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
in this video let's actually get into

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.449 
in this video let's actually get into
the<00:02:39.410> rest<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.769> these<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.069> these<00:02:40.130> are<00:02:40.310> more

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
the rest of these and these are more

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.460 
the rest of these and these are more
just<00:02:40.730> add<00:02:40.880> ons<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.660> Notification<00:02:42.440> Center

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
just add ons to Notification Center

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
however they work extremely well now the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.530 
however they work extremely well now the
first<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.650> notification<00:02:46.310> shower<00:02:47.000> you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
first one is a notification shower you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.809 
first one is a notification shower you
can<00:02:47.720> tell<00:02:47.959> right<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.590> up<00:02:48.799> at<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.250> top<00:02:49.370> down

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
can tell right here up at the top down

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.120 
can tell right here up at the top down
below<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.510> weather<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:51.080> does<00:02:51.500> have<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:52.040> a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
below the weather it does have just a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.430 
below the weather it does have just a
blank<00:02:52.459> area<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.720> actually<00:02:53.900> really

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
blank area and this is actually really

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.920 
blank area and this is actually really
great<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.130> my<00:02:55.310> opinion<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:56.030> basically<00:02:56.690> what<00:02:56.900> it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
great in my opinion so basically what it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.570 
great in my opinion so basically what it
allows<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.530> do<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.769> add<00:02:57.950> notes<00:02:58.370> to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
allows you to do is add notes to

allows you to do is add notes to
Notification<00:02:59.569> Center<00:02:59.600> and<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.260> works<00:03:00.410> really

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
Notification Center and it works really

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.430 
Notification Center and it works really
well<00:03:00.890> with<00:03:01.310> blurry<00:03:01.700> NC<00:03:02.299> background<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.290> let<00:03:03.380> me

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
well with blurry NC background so let me

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.380 
well with blurry NC background so let me
just<00:03:03.620> go<00:03:03.739> ahead<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:03.980> type<00:03:04.340> up<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.700> quick<00:03:05.030> test

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
just go ahead and type up a quick test

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
Center but it doesn't stop at that let's

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.589 
Center but it doesn't stop at that let's
actually<00:04:37.129> go<00:04:37.370> down<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:37.699> settings<00:04:38.120> for<00:04:38.210> we

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
actually go down to the settings for we

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.360 
actually go down to the settings for we
close<00:04:38.930> apps<00:04:39.259> inside<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.009> settings

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
close apps inside of the settings

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.980 
close apps inside of the settings
application<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.389> have<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.659> option<00:04:41.960> to

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
application so you have the option to

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.719 
application so you have the option to
configure<00:04:42.229> how<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.740> actually<00:04:42.889> slides<00:04:43.400> and

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
configure how it actually slides and

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.309 
configure how it actually slides and
what<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.090> does<00:04:44.240> let<00:04:44.539> me<00:04:44.569> give<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.900> quick

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
what it does let me give you a quick

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.710 
what it does let me give you a quick
example<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:46.099> that<00:04:46.129> so<00:04:46.669> depending<00:04:47.090> on<00:04:47.090> how<00:04:47.479> far

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
example of that so depending on how far

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.330 
example of that so depending on how far
you<00:04:47.930> slide<00:04:48.229> it<00:04:48.409> it<00:04:48.560> will<00:04:48.680> do<00:04:48.860> different<00:04:49.280> things

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
you slide it it will do different things

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.369 
you slide it it will do different things
so<00:04:50.090> let<00:04:50.389> me<00:04:50.449> show<00:04:50.629> you<00:04:50.659> what<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:50.930> mean<00:04:51.020> by<00:04:51.199> that

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
so let me show you what I mean by that

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.230 
so let me show you what I mean by that
inside<00:04:51.979> of<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.159> settings<00:04:52.490> portion<00:04:53.000> again

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
inside of the settings portion again

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.120 
inside of the settings portion again
here<00:04:53.509> so<00:04:53.990> when<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.259> move<00:04:54.440> it<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.830> far

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
here so when you move it to the far

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.010 
here so when you move it to the far
right<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.759> have<00:04:55.880> kill<00:04:56.210> background<00:04:56.750> when<00:04:56.930> you

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
right you have kill background when you

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.540 
right you have kill background when you
move<00:04:57.169> it<00:04:57.319> to<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.620> middle<00:04:58.009> right<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.400> have

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.020 
of the applications running in the
background<00:05:15.889> however<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.699> leaves<00:05:16.909> the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
background however it leaves the

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.149 
background however it leaves the

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.580 
application that you're in still running
and<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:20.180> very<00:05:20.509> last<00:05:20.750> option<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.289> kill

background all now this kills all of the

background all now this kills all of the
applications<00:05:23.979> including<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.069> one<00:05:25.250> you're

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
applications including the one you're

applications including the one you're
currently<00:05:25.789> in<00:05:26.030> now<00:05:26.569> this<00:05:26.750> is<00:05:26.960> also<00:05:27.289> good<00:05:27.680> for

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
currently in now this is also good for

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.800 
currently in now this is also good for
memory<00:05:28.310> management<00:05:28.759> so<00:05:29.330> I'm<00:05:29.389> going<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.659> go

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
memory management so I'm going to go

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.510 
memory management so I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.080> give<00:05:30.199> a<00:05:30.289> quick<00:05:30.560> example<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:31.340> this

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
ahead and give a quick example of this

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.490 
ahead and give a quick example of this
if<00:05:31.729> we<00:05:32.000> were<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.270> slide<00:05:32.509> it<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:33.139> to<00:05:33.349> the

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
if we were to slide it just to the

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.260 
if we were to slide it just to the
middle<00:05:33.860> right<00:05:34.039> here<00:05:34.099> it<00:05:34.370> will<00:05:34.460> close<00:05:34.789> out<00:05:35.090> of

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
middle right here it will close out of

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.969 
middle right here it will close out of
the<00:05:35.360> settings<00:05:35.719> application<00:05:36.319> however<00:05:36.560> we<00:05:36.830> can

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
the settings application however we can

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.860 
the settings application however we can
open<00:05:37.159> it<00:05:37.430> back<00:05:37.610> up<00:05:37.669> to<00:05:38.060> its<00:05:38.240> state<00:05:38.479> because<00:05:38.750> it

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
open it back up to its state because it

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.269 
open it back up to its state because it
doesn't<00:05:39.199> close<00:05:39.349> out<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.740> it<00:05:39.830> in<00:05:39.949> the

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
doesn't close out of it in the

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.399 
doesn't close out of it in the
multitasking<00:05:41.120> bar<00:05:41.330> now<00:05:41.719> if<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:41.960> were<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.199> bring

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
multitasking bar now if I were to bring

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.680 
multitasking bar now if I were to bring
it<00:05:42.590> down<00:05:42.770> again<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.279> simply<00:05:44.120> slide<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.659> the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
it down again and simply slide it to the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.600 
it down again and simply slide it to the
middle<00:05:45.050> left<00:05:45.349> it<00:05:45.590> will<00:05:45.740> completely<00:05:46.069> closed

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
middle left it will completely closed

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.059 
middle left it will completely closed
out<00:05:46.880> of<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.270> settings<00:05:47.630> application<00:05:48.409> let's<00:05:48.889> go

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
out of the settings application let's go

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.249 
out of the settings application let's go
ahead<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:49.310> do<00:05:49.699> that<00:05:49.729> right<00:05:50.120> now<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:50.569> as<00:05:51.110> you

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
ahead and do that right now and as you

ahead and do that right now and as you
can<00:05:51.380> see<00:05:51.409> if<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.770> bring<00:05:51.949> up<00:05:52.069> the<00:05:52.190> multitasking

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
can see if I bring up the multitasking

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.640 
can see if I bring up the multitasking
bar<00:05:53.029> it's<00:05:53.270> no<00:05:53.509> longer<00:05:53.539> there<00:05:54.050> so<00:05:54.349> let's<00:05:54.529> go

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
bar it's no longer there so let's go

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.689 
bar it's no longer there so let's go
ahead<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.860> open<00:05:55.039> up<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.310> settings

ahead and open up the settings
application<00:05:56.419> as<00:05:56.539> you<00:05:57.050> can<00:05:57.199> see<00:05:57.409> it<00:05:57.590> did<00:05:57.830> reset

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
application as you can see it did reset

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.249 
application as you can see it did reset

let's go ahead and just bring airplane
mode<00:06:42.560> up<00:06:42.830> towards<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.400> top<00:06:43.460> more<00:06:44.000> simply<00:06:44.840> by

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
mode up towards the top more simply by

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.290 
mode up towards the top more simply by
grabbing<00:06:45.590> it<00:06:45.860> towards<00:06:46.190> the<00:06:46.280> right<00:06:46.639> and<00:06:46.849> moving

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
grabbing it towards the right and moving

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.270 
grabbing it towards the right and moving
it<00:06:47.539> up<00:06:47.750> so<00:06:48.229> as<00:06:48.379> you<00:06:48.500> can<00:06:48.620> see<00:06:48.800> now<00:06:48.919> we<00:06:48.979> have<00:06:49.129> the

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
it up so as you can see now we have the

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.700 
it up so as you can see now we have the
ability<00:06:49.819> to<00:06:49.849> toggle<00:06:50.300> airplane<00:06:50.659> mode<00:06:51.169> towards

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
ability to toggle airplane mode towards

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.550 
ability to toggle airplane mode towards
the<00:06:51.830> far<00:06:52.069> left<00:06:52.460> and<00:06:52.699> obviously<00:06:53.539> it<00:06:54.020> does<00:06:54.259> work

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
the far left and obviously it does work

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.830 
the far left and obviously it does work
properly<00:06:55.009> because<00:06:55.280> now<00:06:55.669> we<00:06:55.729> are<00:06:56.060> in<00:06:56.300> airplane

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
properly because now we are in airplane

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.499 
properly because now we are in airplane
mode<00:06:56.870> so<00:06:57.680> like<00:06:58.159> I<00:06:58.310> said<00:06:58.370> NC<00:06:58.940> settings<00:06:59.300> works

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
mode so like I said NC settings works

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.210 
mode so like I said NC settings works
great<00:06:59.990> it<00:07:00.289> gives<00:07:00.409> you<00:07:00.650> a<00:07:00.710> ton<00:07:00.979> of<00:07:01.009> different

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
great it gives you a ton of different

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.909 
great it gives you a ton of different
toggles<00:07:01.849> and<00:07:01.940> it<00:07:02.599> just<00:07:02.990> works<00:07:03.349> and<00:07:03.650> it's<00:07:03.770> as

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
toggles and it just works and it's as

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.950
