00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
biologist would be like no the important

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.250 
biologist would be like no the important
thing<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.790> don't<00:02:32.970> alter<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.870> mantle

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and you don't raise the pH so let's just

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.750 
and you don't raise the pH so let's just
avoid<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.049> detergents<00:02:37.379> let's<00:02:38.010> add<00:02:38.250> natural

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
avoid the detergents let's add natural

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910 
avoid the detergents let's add natural
cleansing<00:02:39.090> agents<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.930> bacterials<00:02:40.620> and

antifungals to make it do the cleansing
action<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.910> really<00:02:45.269> important<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.690> a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840

are<00:03:43.590> basically<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:44.340> sales<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.730> marketing<00:03:45.120> so

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
the idea of relying on a lab in New

the idea of relying on a lab in New
Jersey<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.590> make<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.889> products<00:03:50.370> it'll<00:03:50.609> be

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
Jersey to make the products it'll be

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.509 
Jersey to make the products it'll be
nervous<00:03:51.209> like<00:03:51.540> are<00:03:51.870> they<00:03:52.019> really<00:03:52.410> adding<00:03:53.190> the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
hyaluronic acid that we bring from the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.559 
hyaluronic acid that we bring from the
Czech<00:03:55.739> Republic<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:56.430> cost<00:03:56.700> five<00:03:57.000> thousand

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
Czech Republic that cost five thousand

Czech Republic that cost five thousand
eight<00:03:57.660> hundred<00:03:57.810> euros<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.319> pound<00:03:58.769> or<00:03:59.099> are<00:03:59.220> they

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
eight hundred euros a pound or are they

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.240 
eight hundred euros a pound or are they
doing<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.940> $200<00:04:00.630> inhaler<00:04:01.049> onic<00:04:01.380> acid<00:04:01.709> but

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
doing the $200 inhaler onic acid but

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.680 
doing the $200 inhaler onic acid but
they're<00:04:02.400> charging<00:04:02.730> me<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.090> other<00:04:03.239> one<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
what an industrial engineer I've been

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.780 
what an industrial engineer I've been
trained<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.660> handle<00:04:13.200> production<00:04:14.130> facilities

is<00:04:14.940> exactly<00:04:15.450> what<00:04:15.750> industrial<00:04:16.289> engineering

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
is exactly what industrial engineering

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.110 
is exactly what industrial engineering
is<00:04:16.829> all<00:04:16.950> about<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:18.120> want<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:19.079> our<00:04:19.410> own

is all about and I want to have our own

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.060 
is all about and I want to have our own
labs<00:04:21.120> where<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:21.599> handle<00:04:22.349> everything<00:04:22.650> so<00:04:22.919> we're

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
use their own products and I really

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.080 
use their own products and I really
wanted<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.860> produce<00:04:29.190> my<00:04:29.640> own<00:04:29.760> products

wanted to produce my own products

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.090 
wanted to produce my own products
