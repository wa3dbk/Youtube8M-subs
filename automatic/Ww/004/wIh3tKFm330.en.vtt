very fascinated when I was a kid all
these<00:00:57.239> buttons<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.020> thought<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.650> was

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
these buttons and I thought it was

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
these buttons and I thought it was
something<00:00:59.220> where<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> could<00:00:59.640> express<00:01:00.540> my<00:01:00.809> my

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
something where I could express my my

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.040 
something where I could express my my
fantasy<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.980> an<00:01:02.360> imagination<00:01:03.360> so<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
fantasy and an imagination so for me it

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.850 
fantasy and an imagination so for me it
was<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.739> quite<00:01:05.840> natural<00:01:06.840> choice<00:01:07.380> simply

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
was a quite natural choice simply

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.030 
was a quite natural choice simply
because<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.370> such<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.550> big<00:01:09.860> instrument<00:01:10.860> in

all her her Bayern pieces of course but
this<00:03:11.970> new<00:03:12.750> one<00:03:13.019> with<00:03:13.349> which<00:03:13.920> was<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.129> solo

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
instrument very good and and she thought

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.650

then we we try and and and maybe fail a

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.210 
then we we try and and and maybe fail a
little<00:04:14.370> bit<00:04:14.579> also<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.150> then<00:04:15.299> she<00:04:15.870> has<00:04:16.039> she<00:04:17.039> has

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.570 

in<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.710> way<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.980> has<00:04:24.100> been<00:04:24.250> such<00:04:24.430> an

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
in that way it has been such an

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.360 
in that way it has been such an
inspiration<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.560> work<00:04:26.740> with<00:04:26.889> really

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
inspiration to to to to work with really

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.000 
inspiration to to to to work with really
a<00:04:27.460> long<00:04:27.760> lifelong<00:04:28.630> inspiration<00:04:29.440> I<00:04:29.560> think<00:04:29.800> I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
a long lifelong inspiration I think I

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.310

carries<00:06:24.460> very<00:06:24.880> very<00:06:25.240> clearly<00:06:25.570> out<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:26.229> and

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
carries very very clearly out and and

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.080 
carries very very clearly out and and
and<00:06:26.680> for<00:06:26.830> my<00:06:26.950> instrument<00:06:27.400> which<00:06:27.550> demands<00:06:28.000> a

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
and for my instrument which demands a

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.050 
and for my instrument which demands a
little<00:06:28.419> bit<00:06:28.599> of<00:06:28.780> sound<00:06:29.460> because<00:06:30.460> it's<00:06:30.729> it's<00:06:30.969> a

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
little bit of sound because it's it's a

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.080 
little bit of sound because it's it's a
kind<00:06:31.270> of<00:06:31.330> sound<00:06:31.599> less<00:06:31.780> instrument

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
kind of sound less instrument

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.790 
kind of sound less instrument
in<00:06:33.540> the<00:06:33.690> sense<00:06:33.900> that<00:06:34.050> it<00:06:34.290> doesn't<00:06:34.470> have<00:06:34.650> so

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
in the sense that it doesn't have so

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.910 
in the sense that it doesn't have so
much<00:06:34.920> resonance<00:06:35.370> on<00:06:35.670> each<00:06:35.820> read<00:06:36.380> it<00:06:37.380> really

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
much resonance on each read it really

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.070 
much resonance on each read it really
helps<00:06:38.670> a<00:06:38.760> lot<00:06:38.880> to<00:06:39.060> play<00:06:39.240> in<00:06:39.390> such<00:06:39.540> a<00:06:39.570> such<00:06:40.020> a

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
helps a lot to play in such a such a

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.360 
helps a lot to play in such a such a
hole<00:06:40.320> so<00:06:40.530> and<00:06:40.680> I<00:06:40.770> this<00:06:40.830> has<00:06:41.040> really<00:06:41.160> been<00:06:41.340> a

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
hole so and I this has really been a

00:06:41.370 --> 00:07:04.590
