the<00:00:28.150> first<00:00:28.330> date<00:00:28.480> consists<00:00:28.960> of<00:00:29.280> classroom

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
the first date consists of classroom

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.940 
the first date consists of classroom
spend<00:00:31.030> about<00:00:31.150> two<00:00:31.300> hours<00:00:31.450> in<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.720> classroom

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
spend about two hours in a classroom

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:45.250 
spend about two hours in a classroom
going<00:00:32.950> over<00:00:33.360> planet<00:00:34.360> Aleen

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.599 

after<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:46.829> which<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.430> call

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
after that they go into which we call

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.220 
after that they go into which we call
the<00:00:47.730> swimmer<00:00:48.030> which<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.449> shallow<00:00:48.870> water

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the swimmer which is shallow water

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
the swimmer which is shallow water
initial<00:00:50.190> memory<00:00:50.399> mechanical<00:00:51.300> release<00:00:51.570> device

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
initial memory mechanical release device

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
initial memory mechanical release device
which<00:00:52.199> basically<00:00:52.820> teaches<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> start

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
which basically teaches them to start

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.670 
which basically teaches them to start
thinking<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> water<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.320> using<00:00:55.589> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
thinking on the water he using the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.250 
thinking on the water he using the
reference<00:00:55.890> points<00:00:56.519> and<00:00:56.820> using<00:00:57.539> handles<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
reference points and using handles and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.280 
reference points and using handles and
leathers<00:00:58.589> to<00:00:58.940> eventually<00:00:59.940> help<00:01:00.300> them<00:01:00.449> expand

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
leathers to eventually help them expand

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:16.469 
leathers to eventually help them expand
over<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.949> investment

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.370 

after<00:01:17.479> that<00:01:17.630> they<00:01:17.749> go<00:01:17.869> into<00:01:18.020> what's<00:01:18.289> called

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
after that they go into what's called

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.399 
after that they go into what's called
the<00:01:18.530> em<00:01:18.649> sweat<00:01:18.890> modulars<00:01:20.140> shallow<00:01:21.140> water

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
the bat put them in the RBS we start the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.490 
the bat put them in the RBS we start the
rides<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.690> have<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:58.049> person<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
rides as a we have one person in the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.320 
rides as a we have one person in the
front<00:01:58.619> seat<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> person<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> back

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
front seat we have a person in the back

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.830 
front seat we have a person in the back
seat<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.159> we<00:02:02.159> rerun<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.759> through<00:02:02.940> for<00:02:03.570> rides

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
seat and we rerun them through for rides

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.410 
seat and we rerun them through for rides
throughout<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> course<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.860> day<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.420> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
throughout the course of the day and so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.949 
throughout the course of the day and so
it'll<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.690> one<00:02:07.200> ride<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> front<00:02:08.640> in

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
it'll be one ride out the front in

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.800 
it'll be one ride out the front in
during<00:02:09.959> daytime<00:02:10.140> conditions<00:02:11.209> one<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:12.660> ride

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
during daytime conditions one one ride

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.760 
during daytime conditions one one ride
in<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> back<00:02:13.140> seat<00:02:13.170> during<00:02:13.560> daytime

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
in the back seat during daytime

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:46.259 
in the back seat during daytime
conditions<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.670> each<00:02:14.700> student

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.610 

going<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.389> the<00:02:47.510> Duncan<00:02:47.780> up<00:02:47.959> experience<00:02:48.439> was

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
going to the Duncan up experience was

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.229 
going to the Duncan up experience was
actually<00:02:48.769> kind<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.159> nerve-wracking<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.939> little

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
actually kind of nerve-wracking a little

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.759 
actually kind of nerve-wracking a little
bit<00:02:50.359> because<00:02:50.599> it's<00:02:50.870> not<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.049> natural<00:02:51.260> movement

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
bit because it's not a natural movement

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.729 
bit because it's not a natural movement
because<00:02:52.700> your<00:02:52.939> buoyancy<00:02:53.209> goes<00:02:53.569> up<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.680> you

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
because your buoyancy goes up so you

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.300 
because your buoyancy goes up so you
want<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.189> swim<00:02:55.639> down<00:02:55.939> to<00:02:56.239> get<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.629> which<00:02:57.109> is

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
want to swim down to get out which is

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:30.280 
want to swim down to get out which is
completely<00:02:58.310> unnatural<00:02:58.639> thinking

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.690 

then<00:03:30.890> we<00:03:30.980> switched<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.310> night<00:03:31.520> night

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
then we switched to night night

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.490 
then we switched to night night
conditions<00:03:32.330> where<00:03:32.480> we'll<00:03:32.630> do<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:33.020> night<00:03:33.260> ride

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
conditions where we'll do a night ride

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.290 
conditions where we'll do a night ride
with<00:03:33.710> a<00:03:33.740> student<00:03:34.130> in<00:03:34.190> front<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.640> night<00:03:35.150> ride

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
with a student in front and night ride

00:03:35.300 --> 00:04:22.320 
with a student in front and night ride
with<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.480> student<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.960> backseat

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.510 

definitely<00:04:23.330> makes<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:23.600> have<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.930> much<00:04:24.200> more

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
definitely makes you have a much more

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.710 
definitely makes you have a much more
