00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.530 
incredible i think i still stay true to
my<00:01:22.470> review<00:01:22.619> video<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.520> someone<00:01:23.939> did<00:01:24.119> say<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
my review video and someone did say that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.149 
my review video and someone did say that
they<00:01:24.630> didn't<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.950> didn't

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
they didn't like it because it didn't

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.700 
they didn't like it because it didn't
sit<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.430> their<00:01:26.580> skin<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.290> had<00:01:28.439> dry

sit on their skin right and they had dry

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
sit on their skin right and they had dry
skin<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.310> recommend<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> check<00:01:30.329> out
