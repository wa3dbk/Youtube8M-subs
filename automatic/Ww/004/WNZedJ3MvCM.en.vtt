00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.740
 Come on, let's meet for a video 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.330
 makeup today that was me 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.400
 inspired by the insee ta g pics so 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.780
 you simply on their ray stuff 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.790
 of technique it is the one posted a photo 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.889
 a bronze and navy blue makeup and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.880
 I thought it was too good and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 I did not have many ideas for this 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.910
 video that I thought I was going 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.350
 do that before I forget I show you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.000
 quickly done there it's not very very 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.800
 successful 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.890
 the hairstyle of which I was filming the tutorial 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.050
 just after this one basically it's the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.510
 bun with a big trace all around I 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 I'll try to pass the video 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.969
 next we go for the make up 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.370
 I started at the base paid by the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.500
 pen pote pardon soft offer from mac 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 which serves me just to neutralize all 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.040
 small veins of colors etc and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 I 'll put some then I take the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.079
 'base castle golden brooch the technique 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 with the flat middle one that has a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.899
 little khaki of this trio cabaret de chaire 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 when they call themselves adorned with peridot 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.530
 and so I take the middle one that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.059
 looks pretty much like a leap I got 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.219
 said that it will change a little bit of themselves 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.019
 political or mesfar make-up says that at 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.360
 a thread for once and I'm going to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.500
 cover the entire eyelid 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.380
 what I like in this far knows it is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 soft enough it is not super bright 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
 it is not hyper background is hyper 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.900
 seeing and for once it changes a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.530
 little bit I find good it is when 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.530
 even visible either but I like 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.260
 then with the 239 mac I took this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 navy blue from the tram pallet to 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.979
 should from slick make up that who is 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.210
 a navy blue I love however 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.070
 I have the impression I do not know if 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 it is because he has dried or if he has 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.930
 always been like that but I find it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.090
 much less pigmented than 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.910
 I would not like and especially in relation to the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.380
 black where we barely take and that's it 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.540
 made to work there must resume 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.710
 many times so maybe he 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.330
 I just need to put a base 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 navy blue underneath for them to go 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.720
 better but here I find a little disappointing 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.670
 I rub in it is all for 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
 see if it's just because she was 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 dry and I do not feel more than that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.580
 then yes I have not made the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840
 technique like on the other side the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.020
 technique that I was doing on the other side 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.310
 it was play by two actually it's in 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.519
 100 years is not looking at 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.800
 I mean I'm leaving the hollow of the ear 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.430
 you are here and then I come back in 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.530
 making a straight line up and 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.320
 I form almost a quarter and yes I do 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.230
 that from the top down and in fact it's in 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.739
 fading away I take away everything and had 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.500
 gun round 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.480
 then I take the road at HighCo 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.519
 at laura mercier and it's blurring 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.230
 to do all the work for the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.910
 place where it is needed because basically in 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.950
 blending is the shape of your eye 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.600
 who will define where there will be the most 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.640
 of two headlights or not and suddenly 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.970
 necessarily it will be the right form for 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.310
 you see what I mean so we 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.329
 put some color we fade we add 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.829
 color so it's more 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.829
 dark in prints and so on and so on 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.800
 then when you have pretty much they 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.690
 do what you want I took the 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.460
 black pencil at first voltage 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.130
 jacob's wines products of all my life 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.690
 country at first it's called black quest 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.540
 and it's an eye liner hijh and not 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.950
 at the ena so they call it eyeliner 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.510
 and it's a gel texture that's the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.250
 first time I have its links and 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.690
 I do not hide that I put a lot 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.860
 a lot of hope for that 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.030
 become my favorite role they 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.140
 hold all day and that's the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.840
 first time I use so I do not 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.160
 do not know at all frozen I had it 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.440
 either at home mom buying it so 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.570
 I know it's very black that's for sure 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.610
 it is quite creamy and while on the other hand 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:38.390
 question held it's going to be the test of 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:40.520
 day and it will be part of course from May 2 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.540
 next test to find the collar 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.210
 perfect because the next review 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.400
 so I put inside but that rba 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.440
 is just on the last shot of the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.510
 Online game need it along the eyelid 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.790
 eyelashes also to make a small base 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.670
 for the north that I will come to pose in 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.340
 powder you take the black always from the 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:08.720
 ultra matt pallet of slick and I have a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:10.070
 meal is the high line and then I 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.480
 take back a cradle of the same shape the 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.489
 Saint Louis with navy blue 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.960
 this time and I come people to do the 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.960
 junction between black and navy blue 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.070
 dark red a little blue corner I 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.000
 accompanied to black after that 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.740
 was a long time that I had not done 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.540
 little touch of blush in the hollow of 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:47.960
 the eyelid attention is not great 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.960
 thing but it changes everything sent down 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.550
 and finally I put mascara I take the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.750
 olala volume of chercq years ago it then 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.160
 oddly I did not find on their 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.840
 website I was looking for the price all 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.830
 on time and it seems to me that it's up to 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.310
 around 12 euros 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.130
 but I did not find on the site of 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:10.890
 the mark therefore that is of infinity the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:13.080
 bottom more I have not here I took a 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.070
 not too much I feel I have not so 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.900
 you see but it's a little bit of 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.910
 media package and suddenly I take a 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.180
 brush like that where there is no 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.150
 mascara at all i do bottle brush i 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.110
 believe and I'm going a past for it's 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.110
 same here from each other 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.099
 for the bottom eyelashes I took a 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.979
 mascara with much less volume 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.449
 this is the one million ha home chair 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.680
 L'orÃ©al 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.569
 in any case the brush is much more 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.740
 small I also believe that you are less of 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.840
 volume but it's mostly because it 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.449
 brushed the smallest but the mascaras 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.990
 on the nose it's nice as blush on 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.250
 price or price lost slick pomegranate 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.009
 I will not finish reading anymore you 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.020

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.199

 it's quite discreet but I like it a lot 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.689
 and mac glosses are the only ones 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.159
