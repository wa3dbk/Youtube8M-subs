The Search Engine Google is showing this animated
Doodle on May 13th, 2015, for celebrating

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.179
127th Birthday of Inge Lehmann

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.679
Inge Lehmann was a Danish seismologist who
discovered the Earth's inner core. In 1936

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.310
she postulated from existing seismic data
that the Earth's core is not a single molten

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.530
sphere, but that an inner core exists, which
has physical properties that are different

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.440
from those in the outer core.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.440
This conclusion was quickly accepted by seismologists,
who up to this time had not been able to propose

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.609
a workable hypothesis for the observation
that the P-wave created by earthquakes slowed

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.039
down when it reached certain areas of the
inner Earth.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:01.039
Inge Lehmann was born on May 13 th 1888 in
Denmark and died in 1993.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:09.129
At the age of 105, Inge Lehmann looked back
on a long, productive life with satisfaction.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.440
During her career in seismology, she had made
two major discoveries and made other significant

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.049
contributions.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.470
Lehmann is first and foremost known as the
discoverer of Earth’s inner core in 1936,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.950
but she is also highly regarded for her studies
of Earth’s mantle, carried out during many

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.290
visits to the United States in the 1950s and
the 1960s. In these studies she identified

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:47.330
a low velocity layer between 130 and 220 kilometers
below Earth’s surface. The bottom of this

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.600
layer, at which the velocity of seismic waves
rises abruptly, is now called the Lehmann

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.829
discontinuity.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:04.389
During her career, Inge Lehmann received great
international recognition. The asteroid 5632

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.770
was named Ingelehmann in her honor.
