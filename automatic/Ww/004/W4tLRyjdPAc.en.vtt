00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
defense has been a bit lackluster and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.080 
here is why as you can see they
basically<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.710> round<00:02:26.100> my<00:02:26.370> defenses

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
basically just go round my defenses

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
I've done is obviously I've got the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.340 
I've done is obviously I've got the
flames<00:02:55.590> right<00:02:55.890> here<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:57.720> was<00:02:57.900> already<00:02:58.200> there

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
flames right here that was already there

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.170 
flames right here that was already there
but<00:02:58.560> they<00:02:58.740> blew<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.130> up<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.940> need<00:03:00.090> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
but they blew that up so I need to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.430 
but they blew that up so I need to
upgrade<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:00.690> some<00:03:00.810> point<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.170> what<00:03:01.320> I've

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
upgrade that at some point but what I've

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.470 
upgrade that at some point but what I've
done<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.730> might<00:03:02.910> not<00:03:03.030> notice<00:03:03.210> it<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
done is you might not notice it the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.450 
done is you might not notice it the
first<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:04.140> I've<00:03:04.800> move<00:03:05.070> these<00:03:05.400> back<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:08.250> what

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
first but I've move these back and what

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.160 
first but I've move these back and what
that<00:03:08.490> means<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.180> they're<00:03:09.420> still<00:03:09.660> not<00:03:09.780> touching

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
that means is they're still not touching

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.340 
that means is they're still not touching
any<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.410> my<00:03:10.560> other<00:03:10.730> buildings<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.000> they<00:03:12.030> won't

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
any of my other buildings so they won't

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.510 
any of my other buildings so they won't
sort<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:13.500> affected<00:03:13.860> by<00:03:13.920> splash<00:03:14.160> damage<00:03:14.340> or

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
sort of be affected by splash damage or

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.760 
sort of be affected by splash damage or
anything<00:03:14.670> like<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.880> but<00:03:15.750> they<00:03:16.380> will<00:03:16.500> be<00:03:16.650> able

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
anything like that but they will be able

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.770 
anything like that but they will be able
to<00:03:16.920> take<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:17.400> anything<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.300> kind<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.510> comes

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
to take on anything that kind of comes

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.290 
to take on anything that kind of comes
up<00:03:18.990> here<00:03:19.560> past<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.130> radar<00:03:20.580> just<00:03:20.820> between<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
up here past this radar just between the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.340 
up here past this radar just between the
radar<00:03:21.630> my<00:03:22.140> my<00:03:23.130> wood<00:03:23.340> storage<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:24.570> since<00:03:25.080> these

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
radar my my wood storage and since these

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.230 
radar my my wood storage and since these
are<00:03:25.410> level<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> slab<00:03:26.310> tiles<00:03:26.490> are<00:03:26.670> pretty

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
are level a slab tiles are pretty

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.150 
are level a slab tiles are pretty
powerful<00:03:27.540> at<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.870> point<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.680> think<00:03:29.010> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
powerful at this point and I think that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.860 
powerful at this point and I think that
that's<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.490> really<00:03:30.060> significantly<00:03:30.690> help

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
that's going really significantly help

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.230 
that's going really significantly help
out<00:03:31.050> i<00:03:31.170> also<00:03:31.380> want<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.740> upgrade<00:03:32.490> this<00:03:32.820> cannon

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
out i also want to upgrade this cannon

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.750 
out i also want to upgrade this cannon
here<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.170> hopefully<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.620> will<00:03:34.740> help<00:03:34.890> too<00:03:35.310> but

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
here so hopefully that will help too but

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.940 
here so hopefully that will help too but
yeah<00:03:35.910> my<00:03:36.060> strategy<00:03:36.510> has<00:03:36.720> been<00:03:36.750> improving<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.890> do

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
yeah my strategy has been improving I do

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.850 
yeah my strategy has been improving I do
feel<00:03:38.400> my<00:03:39.390> defense<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.870> think<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.200> more<00:03:40.500> solid

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
feel my defense I think is more solid

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.920 
feel my defense I think is more solid
once<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:41.670> hit<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.030> next<00:03:42.450> level<00:03:42.690> with<00:03:42.810> my

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
once I hit the next level with my

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.230 
once I hit the next level with my
headquarters<00:03:43.320> which<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.850> know<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.120> is

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
possible for me to do it at the moment

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.480 
possible for me to do it at the moment
