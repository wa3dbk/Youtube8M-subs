00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.330
 fifa 15 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.570
 2015 which of the two has the best 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.610
 gameplay we have carefully analyzed the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.820
 two games and here you have our 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.820
 verdict 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.010
 we have entered the next yen era to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.230
 these two soccer simulators the 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.529
 animations have grown in variety and 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.380
 realism in fifa 15 we have seen scenes 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.660
 more fluid and natural but is that 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.050
 there are also many more animations of 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.540
 50 have been added only for the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.390
 goalkeepers 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.040
 in 2015 the players are more 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.530
 recognizable than ever by the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.840
 faithful reproduction of your style there 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.630
 new movements like this precious 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.390
 hamsik pass and touches much more 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.160
 subtle and precise to the ball like this 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.160
 goal of the higuain pipe 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.160
 the physics in fifa each year they make us 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.739
 to surprise the trajectories of shots and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.870
 assists are very natural and we have 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.970
 proven that the clashes continue 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.690
 improving year after year 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.970
 in 2015 the improvement is remarkable in all 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 physics especially in the fight 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 melee and it was time yet 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.140
 We believe that there is room for improvement 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.380
 everything in aspects such as the physics of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.380
 ball 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.840
 but 2015 has done a great job in the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.280
 recreation of the game styles of 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.649
 each team 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.409
 You'll see Barcelona playing at Tiqui-Taca 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.440
 while you will appreciate the forcefulness of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.050
 bayern in action 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.440
 or how Real Madrid is unstoppable in the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.440
 counterattack 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 We were also pleased to see that the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.570
 reactions of the players to the new 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.909
 situations are much faster in 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.220
 fifa highlights the way in which 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.409
 opposing players read the changes of the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.200
 match and change the strategies in 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.750
 answer in addition the behavior of 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.700
 each player is very emotional can 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.149
 react differently if they commit 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.770
 many mistakes if they score an epic goal or 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.540
 if they receive a bad entry from a 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.299
 defender 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.060
 the instructions can be customized 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.099
 for each player and there are more strategies 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.079
 for the whole team 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.569
 catenaccio more closed what we know 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.640
 how to park the bus or attack 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.840
 total for when you're losing and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 few minutes left 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.230

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.740

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.490
