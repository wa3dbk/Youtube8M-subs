00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.330
 emis killa is from another planet 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.590
 shall come on October 22 mercury 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.540
 rapper's second studio album 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.190
 Milanese that after almost two years between 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.740
 collaborations with hip hop pillars 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.720
 club dogo and together with the cache and a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.160
 platinum for bad grass there 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.840
 show your assessment again 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 with a more mature record product 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.320
 compared to the present 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.849
 let's say my intent anyway 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.820
 however the artist is to grow 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
 and consequently to make it grow too 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.260
 the perception that people only but not 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 I know with what excuse you can defend the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 people believe prayers but maybe you don't love 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 read sentence when it comes to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 please the young in verona plus his 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.030
 in short, very young boys 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.750
 one step at a time I'd like to 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 get to really have an audience 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 various so maybe to take more 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 generations to the fans who will buy one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 copy of mercury will be given 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.680
 chance to meet emis killa 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.719
 directly in the registration room e 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
 Arabic but one thing for a few 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.010
 in short, in my opinion it still pushes a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.539
 boy to follow you and also because then 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.830
 those who win remember it 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.060
 I mean no, it's something that anyway 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.890
 binds them even more ata 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.900
 emis killa has recently held high 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 the Italian flag avoids the prestigious ones 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.890
 American hip hop awards site in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.330
 cypher skill category had the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.189
 possibility to compete with monsters 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.009
 sacred of the caliber of home profit icann 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.220
 declaim to interact here in person with 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.439
 a historical dg as premier was 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.439
 a unique experience then I caught myself 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.790
 from brave in there while on my way out 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.470
 in short, they crossed if in things 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.240
 which for me is a bit like what comes 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.280
 from campania revenge in si piglia 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.770
 well it says no and so it was a little 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.390
 same thing here is beautiful they run between 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.390
 all traces of the album stands out without 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.430
 doubt mb 45 song tribute the attacker 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.409
 of the Milan mario balotelli with whom 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.140
 the vice rapper to identify himself in many 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.149
 wait but the song md 45 was 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.360
 made when in shortly after mario 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.870
 arrival at Milan but was not made for 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.060
 which I am Milanist but 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.100
 the song was made to him as 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.690
 in short, a kind of tribe if we say a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.940
 mario balotelli as more as a soccer player 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.580
 and as a person I saw in him a little 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.990
 the slightest alter ego in football rather 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.240
 that I and a comma 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.410
 obviously without presumption and thrown away 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.410
 very crazy about irony
