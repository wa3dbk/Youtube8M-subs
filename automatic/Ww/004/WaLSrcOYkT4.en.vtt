reaction vial into the center of the
comparator<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:42.370> now<00:02:42.520> set<00:02:42.790> our<00:02:42.910> stopwatch

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
comparator and we now set our stopwatch

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.360 
comparator and we now set our stopwatch
for<00:02:43.720> six<00:02:43.990> minutes<00:02:44.410> which<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.950> time<00:02:45.190> it's

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
for six minutes which is the time it's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.580 
for six minutes which is the time it's
going<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.580> take<00:02:45.850> for<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> reaction<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.440> be

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
going to take for the reaction to be

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.170 
going to take for the reaction to be
ready

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.110 

okay<00:02:53.180> now

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
okay now

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.949 
okay now
above<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:55.530> rotate<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.519> disc<00:02:56.760> until<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.750> get<00:02:57.900> a

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
above we rotate the disc until we get a

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.490 
above we rotate the disc until we get a
color<00:02:58.319> match<00:02:58.620> between<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.459> two<00:02:59.670> vials

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
color match between the two vials

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.949 
color match between the two vials
starting<00:03:01.500> from<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.830> zero<00:03:02.239> we<00:03:03.239> move<00:03:03.540> around

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
starting from the zero we move around

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.610 
starting from the zero we move around
and<00:03:04.409> we<00:03:04.769> see<00:03:05.159> that<00:03:05.909> when<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.239> reach<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:08.360> 0.8<00:03:09.620> we

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and we see that when we reach the 0.8 we

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.430 
and we see that when we reach the 0.8 we
have<00:03:10.769> got<00:03:11.010> almost<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.610> match<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:14.810> 0.16<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:16.049> also

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
have got almost a match and 0.16 is also

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.220 
have got almost a match and 0.16 is also
almost<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.980> match<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.599> therefore<00:03:18.599> our<00:03:18.750> actual

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
almost a match and therefore our actual

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.979 
almost a match and therefore our actual
reading<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.860> probably<00:03:20.700> somewhere<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.480> between

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
reading is probably somewhere in between

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.629 
reading is probably somewhere in between
point<00:03:22.620> zero<00:03:23.040> eight<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.700> point<00:03:24.000> one<00:03:24.269> six
