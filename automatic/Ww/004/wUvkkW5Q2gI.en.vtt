level<00:02:03.439> up<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.159> yeah<00:02:04.520> it's<00:02:04.759> it's

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
level up with that so yeah it's it's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.300 
level up with that so yeah it's it's
been<00:02:05.390> some<00:02:05.630> changes<00:02:05.869> but<00:02:06.140> it's<00:02:06.619> good<00:02:06.829> changes

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
been some changes but it's good changes

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.729 
been some changes but it's good changes
and<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.759> course<00:02:08.299> it<00:02:08.450> improves<00:02:08.929> my<00:02:09.259> my

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
and of course it improves my my

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.429 
and of course it improves my my
all-around<00:02:09.979> game<00:02:10.749> standard<00:02:11.749> of<00:02:11.840> strikers<00:02:12.290> I

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
all-around game standard of strikers I

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.059 
all-around game standard of strikers I
mean<00:02:12.590> how<00:02:12.769> much<00:02:13.249> more<00:02:13.309> testing<00:02:13.999> is<00:02:14.180> it

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
mean how much more testing is it

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.039 
mean how much more testing is it
of<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> amount<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.510> action<00:02:16.930> you're

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
of just the amount of action you're

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.020 
of just the amount of action you're
called<00:02:17.260> into<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:18.189> typical<00:02:18.579> league<00:02:18.760> camp

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
called into in a typical league camp

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.970 
called into in a typical league camp
compared<00:02:19.749> to<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.989> PSL<00:02:20.409> where<00:02:20.709> we<00:02:20.859> know

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
compared to the PSL where we know

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.679 
compared to the PSL where we know
there's<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.969> always<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.299> most<00:02:22.329> accurate

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
there's not always the most accurate

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.289 
there's not always the most accurate
shooting<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:23.650> often<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.400> game<00:02:24.579> is<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.999> to<00:02:25.150> end

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
shooting but often the game is in to end

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.509 
shooting but often the game is in to end
and<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.540> PSL<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.230> how<00:02:26.650> much<00:02:26.769> busier<00:02:27.159> are<00:02:27.370> you

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
and the PSL so how much busier are you

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.410 
and the PSL so how much busier are you
how<00:02:27.939> different<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.739> well<00:02:29.739> um<00:02:30.459> there's<00:02:31.329> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
how different is it well um there's a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.119 
how different is it well um there's a
lot<00:02:31.599> more<00:02:31.629> more<00:02:32.139> action<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.739> mud<00:02:32.920> filled

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
lot more more action in the mud filled

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.759 
lot more more action in the mud filled
in<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.639> belgian<00:02:34.030> league<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.569> not<00:02:34.780> as<00:02:34.989> into<00:02:35.590> n

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
in the belgian league it's not as into n

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.429 
in the belgian league it's not as into n
as<00:02:36.129> in<00:02:36.340> South<00:02:36.519> Africa<00:02:36.579> but<00:02:37.510> when<00:02:37.870> they<00:02:38.019> do<00:02:38.079> get

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
as in South Africa but when they do get

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.280 
as in South Africa but when they do get
more<00:02:39.430> than<00:02:39.639> more<00:02:39.939> than<00:02:39.969> eight<00:02:40.719> times<00:02:41.019> out<00:02:41.230> of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
more than more than eight times out of

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.470 
more than more than eight times out of
10<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:42.010> know<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.549> shots<00:02:42.790> always<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.269> target

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
10 you know the shots always on target

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.759 
10 you know the shots always on target
so<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.129> end<00:02:45.219> you<00:02:45.430> are<00:02:45.749> normally<00:02:46.749> Bezier<00:02:47.200> in

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
so in the end you are normally Bezier in

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.679 
so in the end you are normally Bezier in
in<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.129> game<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.519> then<00:02:48.700> i<00:02:49.030> would<00:02:49.209> say<00:02:49.389> in<00:02:49.510> South

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689
