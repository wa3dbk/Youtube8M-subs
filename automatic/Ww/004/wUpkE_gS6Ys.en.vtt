difference<00:04:57.320> on<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.650> game<00:04:57.830> but<00:04:58.340> as<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.490> mention

yells on the pitch even if he did or if

yells on the pitch even if he did or if
he<00:05:30.650> didn't<00:05:30.980> it's<00:05:31.100> completely<00:05:31.460> irrelevant

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
he didn't it's completely irrelevant

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.280 
he didn't it's completely irrelevant
he's<00:05:32.030> only<00:05:32.210> player<00:05:32.510> that<00:05:32.540> actually<00:05:33.020> makes<00:05:33.200> an

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
he's only player that actually makes an

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.080 
he's only player that actually makes an
impact<00:05:33.410> on<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.920> side<00:05:34.160> so<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.640> don't<00:05:34.760> see<00:05:34.910> why

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
impact on the side so I don't see why

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.910 
impact on the side so I don't see why
you<00:05:35.150> would<00:05:35.420> have<00:05:35.540> the<00:05:35.660> captaincy<00:05:35.990> but<00:05:36.290> besides

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
you would have the captaincy but besides

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.890 
you would have the captaincy but besides
that<00:05:37.070> point<00:05:37.580> he's<00:05:38.000> obviously<00:05:38.210> a<00:05:38.330> goalkeeper

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
that point he's obviously a goalkeeper

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.810 
that point he's obviously a goalkeeper
that<00:05:39.050> we<00:05:39.140> can<00:05:39.290> have<00:05:39.470> for<00:05:39.740> three<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:40.580> four<00:05:40.760> years

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
that we can have for three to four years

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.760 
that we can have for three to four years
because<00:05:41.360> he's<00:05:41.480> not<00:05:41.660> even<00:05:41.900> like<00:05:42.230> he<00:05:42.470> is<00:05:42.620> in<00:05:42.740> his

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
because he's not even like he is in his

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.340 
because he's not even like he is in his
30s<00:05:43.310> but<00:05:43.490> he's<00:05:43.670> not<00:05:43.820> too<00:05:44.090> too<00:05:44.300> old<00:05:44.540> I<00:05:44.780> mean<00:05:45.260> by

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.140 
30s but he's not too too old I mean by
the<00:05:45.410> time<00:05:45.650> I<00:05:45.680> guess<00:05:45.920> I<00:05:46.070> age<00:05:46.280> Gabrielle<00:05:46.940> house
