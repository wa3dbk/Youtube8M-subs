times<00:00:24.930> speed<00:00:25.289> again<00:00:25.560> basically<00:00:26.039> because

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
times speed again basically because

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.849 
times speed again basically because
Windows<00:00:28.320> Movie<00:00:28.470> Maker<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.920> lagging<00:00:29.519> because

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
this is in the sort of better quality I

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.850 
this is in the sort of better quality I
accidentally<00:00:34.079> change<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> quality<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.710> my

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
accidentally change the quality on my

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
for this slag so it's going to be at two

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.150 
for this slag so it's going to be at two
parts<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.620> got<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> check<00:00:41.040> out

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840 
know lumps is a beast and he doesn't
really<00:01:09.750> mind<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.320> sleep<00:01:10.650> cuz<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.640> he's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.100 
really mind good sleep cuz you know he's
asleep<00:01:12.180> half<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> time<00:01:12.750> anyway<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:15.110> santhome

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
asleep half the time anyway so santhome

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
asleep half the time anyway so santhome
goes<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> he<00:01:17.070> carries<00:01:17.400> left<00:01:17.670> over

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
goes and I see the he carries left over

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.429 
goes and I see the he carries left over
so<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.270> good<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> means<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.170> he's<00:01:19.290> not

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so that's good it means that he's not

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.100 
so that's good it means that he's not
carrying<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.890> sash<00:01:20.720> even<00:01:21.720> though<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.930> know

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
carrying a sash even though you know

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
carrying a sash even though you know
sash<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.830> pretty<00:01:23.159> useless<00:01:23.520> thanks<00:01:24.119> on

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sash would be pretty useless thanks on

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.210 
sash would be pretty useless thanks on
sandstorm<00:01:24.750> anyway<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.070> nice

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
sandstorm anyway but you know it's nice

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
sandstorm anyway but you know it's nice
that<00:01:26.280> he<00:01:26.549> doesn't<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.119> uh<00:01:28.049> he<00:01:28.619> could<00:01:28.740> set

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that he doesn't have it uh he could set

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.760 
that he doesn't have it uh he could set
goes<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.579> toxic<00:01:30.150> spikes<00:01:30.420> setup<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
goes for this toxic spikes setup and I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
goes for this toxic spikes setup and I
predict<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> dugtrio<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.659> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
predict that so I go to dugtrio just so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
predict that so I go to dugtrio just so
I<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.860> rid<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.159> him<00:01:35.400> before<00:01:35.579> he<00:01:35.820> gets<00:01:35.939> up

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
I can get rid of him before he gets up

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
I can get rid of him before he gets up
to<00:01:36.450> set<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.780> two<00:01:37.049> layers<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.920> he<00:01:38.009> sets

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to set up two layers because if he sets

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.280 
to set up two layers because if he sets
up<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.549> layers<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.000> would<00:01:39.119> pretty<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.750> ruined

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
up two layers I would pretty much ruined

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.580 
up two layers I would pretty much ruined
me<00:01:40.439> would<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.890> quite<00:01:41.220> annoying<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.899> now<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> trio

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
me would be quite annoying so now I trio

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.639 
me would be quite annoying so now I trio
can<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> EQ<00:01:44.840> Trish<00:01:45.840> bad<00:01:46.020> dugtrio<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
can go for the EQ Trish bad dugtrio you
