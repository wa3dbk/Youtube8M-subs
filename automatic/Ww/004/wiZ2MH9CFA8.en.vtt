00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.340 
publicly during games twice playoffs
last<00:01:01.379> year<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> saw<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.329> when<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
last year right I saw it and when the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
last year right I saw it and when the
decision<00:01:04.949> maker<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> shoot<00:01:06.240> first<00:01:06.479> point

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
decision maker is a shoot first point

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710 
decision maker is a shoot first point
guard<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.920> harder<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.610> harder<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.180> Durant

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
guard it's harder and harder on Durant

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
guard it's harder and harder on Durant
whose<00:01:10.170> shots<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.770> fallen<00:01:11.070> slowly<00:01:11.610> but

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
whose shots have fallen slowly but

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120 
whose shots have fallen slowly but
surely<00:01:11.909> over<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.600> last<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.200> years<00:01:13.229> because

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
surely over the last two years because

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
surely over the last two years because
even<00:01:14.729> when<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.060> does<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> ball<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
even when he does get the ball now I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770 
even when he does get the ball now I
think<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.009> some<00:01:17.340> urgency<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.360> Durant

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
think there's some urgency and Durant

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
think there's some urgency and Durant
that<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.020> got<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> shoot<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> shoot<00:01:20.159> sooner<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that I got to shoot it shoot sooner in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.609 
that I got to shoot it shoot sooner in

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the time clock that he shot what happen

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
if four shots that he wouldn't normally

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
if four shots that he wouldn't normally
force<00:01:24.930> because<00:01:25.259> he's<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.619> sure<00:01:25.680> he'll<00:01:26.250> ever
