00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.990
 there he must all I am very happy 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.730
 to find you on the demo of the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.589
 road to the booth revolution he has pretty much 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.050
 it is almost 10 in the mat vain to get up 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.540
 and I simply propose everything 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 first match online here since everything 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.000
 at the time I in the menus in the process of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.400
 search I think I found how 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 we do to play online and I come 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.880
 just right there to finish off 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.410
 download the demo I did a single 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.970
 match against the pc to see a little 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.920
 little how was it going I was 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.000
 really west because the game really 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.060
 really really really a lot 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.410
 changed and so much better we are at 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 I finally found how we can 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.590
 to go on that then I have to 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.420
 remember which path I have which way 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.440
 I traveled to find 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.360
 people online because since everything at 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.559
 the time I was struggling to find so as 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.520
 I told you the game really 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.469
 changed and so much the better 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.930
 that's changing a bit it's 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 novelty I'm not at all good to taste 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.140
 well this is the very first time I 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.260
 play instant revolution I did not even have 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.059
 I did not even have the opportunity to 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.890
 to play neither a demo nor anything 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.649
 so this is the very first time 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.909
 and this will be my very first match in 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.829
 line here so I saw that he had some 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.600
 novelties I did not understand everything at all 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.250
 but I think that with time I go 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.320
 I'm not in any hurry I'm at the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.479
 hen I was waiting for the real game that comes out 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.500
 in September to start playing well 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.479
 to learn how to play 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.479
 there is no problem I'm not 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.950
 all in a hurry so I take that what is 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.110
 with hitachi here are three 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.180
 possibilities so red as usual the 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.289
 green the problem is that I do not have too much 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.729
 included to keep because everything to 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.710
 the time I had taken to and had had 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.060
 support 1 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.380
 I had against the pc so I 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.979
 learned to and had support 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.510
 defensive 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.369
 so I do not know what it's all about 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.810
 so that finally why this point it serves 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.310
 if you have the answers to the questions 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.040
 do not hesitate to put them in 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.040
 comments and another opponent 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.259
 of the day took kakashi with gaye 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.300
 so listen we'll see what's up 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.100
 give me I took that what is against 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.810
 the pc I used so that kakashi 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.210
 I saw that they were really nice 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.130
 like perso and here I take this 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.540
 what are you going 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.530
 I start with a combo so I know 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.180
 not even what looks like and we are 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.910
 in full we go we go elsewhere 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.190
 do we will try to know a little 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.619
 then there is this little novelty too 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.280
 so let's wait without a problem 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.950
 hop there was going to be a combo 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.620
 duo down he is nice but really not 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.880
 bad of the destra written that I forget 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.130
 not do there is the duo item like you 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.450
 can see that it missed a species 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.430
 of extra it's like exactly this 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.569
 that they die and there is the species of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.100
 movement that I did a little 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.410
 feeling about the way the look and hop 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 here he is then the feeling he serves all 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.239
 just if he came to touch me at this 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.799
 that's when it breaks Lagarde while in game 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.620
 right so I'll try to get you in 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.670
 to do one but that's enough 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.650
 the worry that against all brief parchment 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.730
 hop you take a little bit of play think 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.599
 really not that wright heal too 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.330
 far east this party combos as in 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.549
 I'd like to blow up two lots 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.819
 come here rather rattle to Europe in 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.969
 the air 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.459
 completely nice that's it I'm 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:02.090
 take back the laughing rail because after the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.159
 seizures to help me so look at this it's 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.719
 the highest flying themes the sooner but 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.489
 not taken to gorgeous kakashi body 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.959
 very very very very very very good and 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.480
 some new characters then that makes 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.510
 fun like what cyberconnect2 has us 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.590
 listened with with the changes of 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.900
 characters because they made a whole 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.150
 new mess and it's really slow 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.930
 better associate serious who saw them 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.609
 its combo part by the congo the congo does 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.980
 delay still relieved what they 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:36.439
 then want neutral combo and in europe 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.639
 and the three abbaoui also the 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.699
 possibility of a kiss in below 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:44.060
 air with saskia dropped from you ask 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:46.540
 also before the end of the match livetv time 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.049
 and to see that his father was well there 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.049

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.510

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.790
 it was the sub jude in the air he was 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.440
 a bit close to the shot we do not have 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.430
 well seen but it was the sound game the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.319

 difficult do not hesitate to create a
