24 hours and all of these areas are

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.110 
24 hours and all of these areas are
basically<00:03:23.500> where<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.250> high<00:03:24.550> readings<00:03:24.970> were

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
basically where the high readings were

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.380 
basically where the high readings were
coming<00:03:25.450> in<00:03:25.600> with<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.260> exception<00:03:26.890> of

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
let me go back to the last three days of

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:58.750 
let me go back to the last three days of
jet<00:03:46.570> stream<00:03:46.930> movement

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.100 

now<00:03:59.360> both<00:03:59.689> of<00:03:59.959> these<00:04:00.170> bands<00:04:00.860> here<00:04:01.569> or<00:04:02.569> what

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
now both of these bands here or what

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.670 
now both of these bands here or what
seemed<00:04:03.409> to<00:04:03.500> be<00:04:03.620> reading<00:04:04.069> high<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.470> tail

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
seemed to be reading high and the tail

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:17.879 
seemed to be reading high and the tail
end<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.189> one<00:04:14.409> and<00:04:15.409> this<00:04:15.739> is<00:04:15.950> what<00:04:16.130> we<00:04:16.160> have

end of this one and this is what we have

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.680 
end of this one and this is what we have
going<00:04:18.889> on<00:04:19.100> for<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.519> next<00:04:19.699> couple<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.180> days<00:04:20.389> let

now Thursday Friday Saturday again let's
go<00:04:40.190> back<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.400> water<00:04:40.850> vapor<00:04:41.240> analysis<00:04:41.810> now<00:04:42.050> in

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
go back to water vapor analysis now in

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.290 
go back to water vapor analysis now in
addition<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.580> areas<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:43.910> are<00:04:44.120> covered

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
addition to the areas that are covered

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.140 
addition to the areas that are covered
by<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:44.600> jet<00:04:44.900> stream<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.970> area<00:04:46.970> where

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
by the jet stream and area where

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.340 
by the jet stream and area where
precipitation<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:48.500> predicted<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:50.199> really<00:04:51.199> want

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
precipitation is predicted I really want

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.020 
precipitation is predicted I really want
to<00:04:51.410> keep<00:04:51.560> an<00:04:51.650> eye<00:04:51.800> on<00:04:51.830> these<00:04:52.100> bands<00:04:52.639> because

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
to keep an eye on these bands because

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.060 
to keep an eye on these bands because
we've<00:04:53.419> been<00:04:53.449> finding<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.380> some<00:04:54.860> of<00:04:54.949> the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
we've been finding is that some of the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.150 
we've been finding is that some of the
highest<00:04:55.340> fallout<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.330> occurring<00:04:57.229> along<00:04:57.500> these

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
highest fallout is occurring along these

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.790 
highest fallout is occurring along these
areas<00:04:58.639> of<00:04:58.669> demarcation<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.960> you<00:05:00.470> can<00:05:00.620> see

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
areas of demarcation and you can see

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.159 
areas of demarcation and you can see
we've<00:05:00.979> got<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.190> few<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:01.550> them<00:05:01.669> now<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.240> band<00:05:02.810> is

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
we've got a few of them now this band is

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.290 
we've got a few of them now this band is
what<00:05:03.470> moved<00:05:03.800> through<00:05:04.190> North<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.180> South

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
what moved through North and South

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.740 
what moved through North and South
Dakota<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.280> that's<00:05:07.280> now<00:05:07.490> moving<00:05:07.789> through

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
Dakota and that's now moving through

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.409 
Dakota and that's now moving through
Wisconsin<00:05:09.580> Michigan<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:12.380> then<00:05:12.500> on<00:05:12.620> into

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
Wisconsin Michigan and then on into

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:20.409 
Wisconsin Michigan and then on into
Ontario<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:16.699> New<00:05:16.760> England<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:20.060> part<00:05:20.270> of<00:05:20.360> the

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
Ontario and New England the part of the

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.689 
Ontario and New England the part of the
country<00:05:20.599> that<00:05:20.870> I<00:05:20.960> probably<00:05:21.229> least<00:05:21.770> concerned

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
country that I probably least concerned

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.010 
country that I probably least concerned
with<00:05:22.940> right<00:05:22.970> now<00:05:23.270> is<00:05:23.750> here<00:05:25.599> but<00:05:26.599> because<00:05:26.720> we

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
with right now is here but because we

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.890 
with right now is here but because we
have<00:05:27.169> so<00:05:27.560> much<00:05:27.680> going<00:05:27.919> on<00:05:28.190> pretty<00:05:29.150> much<00:05:29.419> the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
have so much going on pretty much the

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.430 
have so much going on pretty much the
rest<00:05:30.139> of<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.500> country<00:05:30.860> right<00:05:30.889> now<00:05:32.289> should<00:05:33.289> be

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
rest of the country right now should be

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.370 
rest of the country right now should be
taking<00:05:33.770> extreme<00:05:34.190> precautions<00:05:35.110> when<00:05:36.110> going

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
taking extreme precautions when going

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.089 
taking extreme precautions when going
outside<00:05:37.449> because<00:05:38.449> of<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.660> jet<00:05:38.840> stream

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
outside because of the jet stream

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.560 
outside because of the jet stream
because<00:05:40.099> of<00:05:40.250> precipitation<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:41.210> because<00:05:41.449> the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
because of precipitation and because the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.360 
because of precipitation and because the
water<00:05:41.810> vapor<00:05:42.159> also<00:05:43.159> there<00:05:44.000> has<00:05:44.150> been<00:05:45.370> possibly

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
water vapor also there has been possibly

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.460 
water vapor also there has been possibly
some<00:05:46.580> releases<00:05:47.000> that<00:05:47.210> have<00:05:47.479> gone<00:05:47.690> on<00:05:47.990> since

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
some releases that have gone on since

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.149 
some releases that have gone on since
the<00:05:48.760> December<00:05:49.760> 7th<00:05:50.620> emergency<00:05:51.620> nighttime

that part of the south wall of reactor 4
is<00:05:59.060> now<00:05:59.270> missing<00:05:59.770> there<00:06:00.770> has<00:06:01.010> been<00:06:01.310> some<00:06:01.639> crane

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
is now missing there has been some crane

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.080 
is now missing there has been some crane
activity<00:06:03.229> in<00:06:03.320> that<00:06:03.349> area<00:06:03.530> so<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.460> may<00:06:04.880> be<00:06:04.909> that

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
for emergency workers for you to look

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.740 
for emergency workers for you to look
over<00:06:30.350> and<00:06:30.710> links<00:06:31.669> to<00:06:31.820> all<00:06:31.970> of<00:06:32.000> these<00:06:32.210> graphs

over and links to all of these graphs

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.629 
over and links to all of these graphs
but<00:06:33.080> right<00:06:33.590> now<00:06:34.060> we<00:06:35.060> really<00:06:35.090> need<00:06:35.780> every<00:06:36.770> local

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
but right now we really need every local

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.610 
but right now we really need every local
weather<00:06:38.360> station<00:06:38.870> in<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.050> country<00:06:39.199> to<00:06:39.500> be

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
weather station in the country to be

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.469 
weather station in the country to be
doing<00:06:39.949> these<00:06:40.070> reports<00:06:40.669> because<00:06:41.030> it's<00:06:41.210> it's

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
doing these reports because it's it's

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.200 
doing these reports because it's it's
really<00:06:41.780> difficult<00:06:42.370> to<00:06:43.370> do<00:06:43.520> them<00:06:43.699> from<00:06:43.940> coast

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
really difficult to do them from coast

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.939 
really difficult to do them from coast
to<00:06:44.360> coast<00:06:44.389> and<00:06:44.990> get<00:06:45.350> any<00:06:45.560> kind<00:06:45.830> of<00:06:45.949> accuracy<00:06:46.580> or

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
to coast and get any kind of accuracy or

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.680 
to coast and get any kind of accuracy or
pinpoint<00:06:48.949> the<00:06:49.400> highest<00:06:49.729> areas<00:06:50.120> if<00:06:50.389> it<00:06:50.570> was

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
pinpoint the highest areas if it was

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.170 
pinpoint the highest areas if it was
done<00:06:50.900> on<00:06:50.930> a<00:06:51.080> smaller<00:06:51.440> scale<00:06:51.889> it<00:06:52.220> would<00:06:52.850> be<00:06:53.000> much

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
done on a smaller scale it would be much

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.010 
done on a smaller scale it would be much
more<00:06:53.210> reliable<00:06:54.040> so<00:06:55.040> if<00:06:55.490> your<00:06:56.090> city<00:06:56.479> was<00:06:56.690> named

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
more reliable so if your city was named

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.620 
more reliable so if your city was named
