something<00:02:00.430> against<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.830> then<00:02:03.370> frog

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
something against it and then frog

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:13.290 
something against it and then frog
engine<00:02:04.120> which<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.950> triple<00:02:05.950> swap<00:02:08.250> Triple<00:02:09.250> D<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
engine which was triple swap Triple D to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.750 
engine which was triple swap Triple D to
poison<00:02:13.780> draw<00:02:13.990> frog<00:02:14.820> opened<00:02:15.820> my<00:02:15.940> too<00:02:16.120> much
