and<00:02:45.799> then<00:02:46.579> find<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.569> way<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.750> scale<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:48.950> a

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
and then find a way to scale up it's a

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.000 
and then find a way to scale up it's a
challenge<00:02:49.489> it's<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:50.630> time

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.280 

there's<00:02:56.730> nothing<00:02:57.060> quite<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.300> being<00:02:57.720> here

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
there's nothing quite like being here

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.979 
there's nothing quite like being here
and<00:02:58.500> seeing<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.280> reality<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.849> ground

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
and seeing the reality on the ground

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.820 
and seeing the reality on the ground
we're<00:03:00.989> hoping<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.290> provide<00:03:01.409> a<00:03:01.650> better

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
we're hoping to provide a better

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:25.339 
we're hoping to provide a better
solution<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.720> traditionally

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
solution this is the traditionally

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.770 
solution this is the traditionally
structured<00:03:26.129> house<00:03:26.400> where<00:03:26.909> they<00:03:27.239> build<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
structured house where they build the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.199 
structured house where they build the
structure<00:03:28.440> out<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.620> wood<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:29.970> they'll

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
structure out of wood and then they'll

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.300 
structure out of wood and then they'll
apply<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.599> kind<00:03:31.079> of<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.230> mud<00:03:31.410> like<00:03:31.620> plaster<00:03:32.160> that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
apply a kind of a mud like plaster that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.170 
apply a kind of a mud like plaster that
they<00:03:32.430> call<00:03:32.640> teeth

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
they call teeth

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.289 
they call teeth
so<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.810> tweet<00:03:34.620> basic<00:03:35.459> materials<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.150> do

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
so it's tweet basic materials to do

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.009 
so it's tweet basic materials to do
construction<00:03:36.540> right<00:03:36.959> here<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.769> 12<00:03:38.640> table

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
construction right here this 12 table

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.260 
construction right here this 12 table
cement<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.260> iron

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.110 

so<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.020> is<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.260> school<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.740> Shasha<00:03:46.120> primary

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
so this is the school of Shasha primary

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.440 
so this is the school of Shasha primary
school<00:03:48.100> this<00:03:49.100> is<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.280> project<00:03:49.550> of<00:03:49.880> symbolic

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
school this is a project of symbolic

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.870 
school this is a project of symbolic
fires<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:51.040> partnership<00:03:52.040> with<00:03:52.220> Immaculate

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
Conception in the Boston area so they

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.200 
Conception in the Boston area so they
defunded<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.930> schooling<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.410> somebody<00:03:57.890> has

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
defunded of schooling and somebody has

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.480 
defunded of schooling and somebody has
managed<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.200> education<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.310> was

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
managed to the education so I was

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.380 
managed to the education so I was
responsible<00:04:01.850> for<00:04:02.800> for<00:04:03.800> everything<00:04:04.390> from

scratch to ruining the schools their

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.720 
scratch to ruining the schools their
videos<00:04:08.750> they've<00:04:09.740> done<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> really<00:04:10.070> good<00:04:10.430> job

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
videos they've done a really good job

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.300 
videos they've done a really good job
connecting<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.990> roof<00:04:12.230> trusses<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.100> block

for the poorest st. Boniface in Rattrap

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.880 
for the poorest st. Boniface in Rattrap
provide<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.790> transport<00:04:29.720> by<00:04:29.960> motor<00:04:30.380> boat<00:04:30.590> so

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
provide a transport by motor boat so

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.070 
provide a transport by motor boat so
that<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.280> fishermen<00:04:31.700> can<00:04:31.910> go<00:04:32.060> farther<00:04:32.720> out

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
that the fishermen can go farther out

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.770 
that the fishermen can go farther out
into<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.560> ocean<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.070> make<00:04:34.280> catches<00:04:35.000> we're<00:04:35.360> in

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
into the ocean and make catches we're in

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.600 
into the ocean and make catches we're in
deeper<00:04:36.200> water<00:04:36.410> where<00:04:36.530> there's<00:04:36.800> bigger<00:04:37.010> fish

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
deeper water where there's bigger fish

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.270 
deeper water where there's bigger fish
they<00:04:37.910> provide<00:04:38.500> solar-powered<00:04:39.500> refrigerators

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
they provide solar-powered refrigerators

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.100 
they provide solar-powered refrigerators
so<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.700> they<00:04:40.850> can<00:04:41.000> store<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.480> fish<00:04:41.660> longer

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
so that they can store the fish longer

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
so that they can store the fish longer
so<00:04:42.380> they're<00:04:42.650> more<00:04:43.310> viable<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.120> take<00:04:44.630> them

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
so they're more viable and to take them

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.760 
so they're more viable and to take them
to<00:04:44.960> market<00:04:46.870> one<00:04:47.870> of<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.080> interesting<00:04:48.500> things

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
to market one of the interesting things

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.740 
to market one of the interesting things
that<00:04:48.980> most<00:04:49.190> design<00:04:49.580> has<00:04:49.820> done<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.210> to<00:04:50.390> set<00:04:50.630> up

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
that most design has done is to set up

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.870 
that most design has done is to set up
this<00:04:50.960> compressed<00:04:51.620> earth<00:04:51.770> block<00:04:52.010> fabrication

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
this compressed earth block fabrication

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.230 
this compressed earth block fabrication
plan<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.660> we<00:04:54.110> see<00:04:54.320> that<00:04:54.500> as<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:55.130> possible<00:04:55.730> model

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
plan and we see that as a possible model

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.970 
plan and we see that as a possible model
that<00:04:56.420> could<00:04:56.570> be<00:04:56.630> replicated<00:04:56.780> or<00:04:57.680> in<00:04:57.860> the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
that could be replicated or in the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.640 
that could be replicated or in the
country<00:04:58.430> in<00:04:58.730> many<00:04:59.000> communities<00:04:59.690> because<00:05:00.500> it's
