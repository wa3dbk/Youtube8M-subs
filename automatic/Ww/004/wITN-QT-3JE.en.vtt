00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
like but it's kind of cool you can see

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.440 
like but it's kind of cool you can see
the<00:02:23.170> transition<00:02:23.590> there<00:02:23.950> from<00:02:24.220> from<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.060> suede

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
the transition there from from a suede

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.940 
the transition there from from a suede
to<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> smooth<00:02:26.680> leather<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:28.180> nice<00:02:28.390> touch

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
to a smooth leather really nice touch

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.120 
to a smooth leather really nice touch
and<00:02:29.950> then<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.400> insole<00:02:30.850> says<00:02:31.830> right<00:02:32.830> there<00:02:32.860> you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
and then the insole says right there you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.740 
and then the insole says right there you
can<00:02:33.310> read<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.730> won't<00:02:34.000> read<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.540> but

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
can read that I won't read it to you but

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.580 
can read that I won't read it to you but
I<00:02:36.270> don't<00:02:37.270> think<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.600> other<00:02:37.810> insole<00:02:38.290> says

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
I don't think the other insole says

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.930 
I don't think the other insole says
anything<00:02:38.800> different<00:02:39.250> no<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.490> doesn't<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:39.910> it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
anything different no it doesn't so it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.590 
anything different no it doesn't so it
says<00:02:40.180> exactly<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.720> same<00:02:40.780> thing<00:02:40.990> so<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:42.850> don't

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
says exactly the same thing so I don't

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.330 
says exactly the same thing so I don't
know<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.140> going<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.470> pick<00:02:44.650> up<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.980> I

know if this is going to pick up and I

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.320 
know if this is going to pick up and I
hope<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.640> does<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:49.950> yeah<00:02:50.950> damn<00:02:51.460> it<00:02:51.580> it's<00:02:52.150> not

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
everywhere but this colorway has been so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.210 
everywhere but this colorway has been so
hard<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.210> find<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.630> sells<00:03:43.960> out<00:03:44.170> instantly<00:03:44.860> and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
hard to find it sells out instantly and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.350 
hard to find it sells out instantly and
apparently<00:03:45.700> they're<00:03:45.820> going<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.090> coming

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
apparently they're going to be coming

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.630 
apparently they're going to be coming
out<00:03:46.480> with<00:03:46.510> more<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.200> Z<00:03:47.410> no<00:03:47.560> line<00:03:47.830> which<00:03:48.490> I'm

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
out with more of the Z no line which I'm

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.150 
out with more of the Z no line which I'm
guessing<00:03:48.850> just<00:03:49.210> just<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:49.960> this<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.590> use<00:03:51.130> of

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
guessing just just is this this use of

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.010 
guessing just just is this this use of
