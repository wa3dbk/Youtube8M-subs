00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi to all for a new video 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.390
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.940
 start a front with a stack of 9 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.830
 volts and iron straw 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.389
 you can take any 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 stacks mark the important thing is that she 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.449
 9 volts to create 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.460
 Sparks 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.650
 it is necessary that the positive band and the terminal 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.110
 negative his contact with the straw of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.340
 iron 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.619
 I'm just going to light a cotton ball 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 and not start a real fire since 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.369
 I am inside but obviously if 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.689
 I can turn on the cotton there is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 great chance that I can start at 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.160
 fire so take some iron straw 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.410
 and a cotton ball or to others 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.640
 tinder and makes contact with 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.640
 two terminals and the iron straw 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.079
 you will see that when contact between the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.820
 stack and iron straw 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.350
 there will be small sparks that do not 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.870
 may not be enough enough 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.269
 to light the queen touched several 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.500
 times the pile and the iron straw for 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.500
 increase the number of salt states 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.440
 I do not know if you see of course the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 video acosta brightness but the ball 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.830
 of cotton and well burning 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.300
 you can start several lights with 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.229
 this technique but after a while 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.700
 the rap stack or the judge I can all 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.560
 likewise not consider this technique 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.659
 like a real survival technique 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.700
 since the chances of ending up in 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.910
 iron straw and a 9-volt battery 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 in the forest are extremely weak 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.610
 however this team can prove 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.380
 useful if you are in an urban setting 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.130
 and that you need to start at 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.570
 Fire maybe some of you 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 wonder if we can start a 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
 little with any cola battery 9 volts 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.450
 the answer is yes with two stacks of 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.610
 ballots tied together 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.930
 like this but it will be much more 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.920
 hard because there will be less voltage 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.920
 that in the 9-volt ad 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.030
 you will also have to use more 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.100
 iron straw so that they touch the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.980
 positive and negative sales that are 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.360
 this time located at the ends 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.350
 thank you for watching the video and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.370
 Do not hesitate to comment 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.370
 if you have questions
