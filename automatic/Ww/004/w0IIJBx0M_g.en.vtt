00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
white background and then the eye so I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.530 
white background and then the eye so I
tried<00:01:17.130> making<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.820> usually<00:01:18.270> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
tried making it with is usually it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.280
