00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.740
 greetings nerd and rossoni at rotations 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.439
 nerds bringing you another video 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.900
 plus the origins here for the channel and 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.180
 instead of a character of that short list right 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.869
 that list of the few known or 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.660
 so little explored by the various 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.629
 media there and that ends up making a success 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.580
 only in their own comics and as 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.199
 They are not all that not in comics 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.879
 still quite obscure character 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.220
 for the majority of people who only 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.629
 watched the animations for example because 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.269
 after all its character 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.890
 appears in well-known animations avc 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.199
 such as the Justice League without 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.720
 where is the limit where is the episode 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.080
 very handy to fall on your arm as if 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 ends when that was intense without stopping 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.269
 Let's go to what interests the direct 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.190
 point as always posting by dci 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.589
 comics the captain there as he is one more 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.170
 those who have it right versions 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.939
 received a reformulation over time. 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.480
 had his debut in space adventures 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.400
 number 33 in March 1960 in a 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.610
 character reformulation was made 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.640
 more than 20 years later in March 1987 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 where he debuted his own solo hq 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.050
 captain atom number one in that other goal 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.530
 it was not the old one that was 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.780
 now closed he's christoph open 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
 material that was wrong and this is the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.140
 captain of atom that currently 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.970
 participated in the animation of the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.080
 justice and did yesterday some other 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.540
 information 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.520
 but I'll talk only later, well 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.900
 nathaniel christopher Adam he was a 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.510
 states air force officer 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.400
 united at the time of the war in Vietnam have 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.710
 been unjustly guilty of crimes 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.620
 that he had not committed by Colonel 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.470
 aid in addition to that sentenced the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.860
 death penalty in execution and this raid 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.420
 besides the note about it is that it is the same and 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.700
 of someone who appears in a 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.610
 flash you guys it shows it is not 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.729
 Just a jerk there the show is a brand 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.590
 since he accused her of a 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.769
 these crimes and also sentenced him to 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.140
 execution only for him he is called to 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.940
 an experience will make a harness 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.790
 alien 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.370
 found to do a test with her 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.350
 he would test the pilot on that. 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.000
 the adu acquiesced to avoid 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.250
 and agreed to participate in this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.260
 test where it would be within the color 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.630
 cln jenna and would be subject to a 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.710
 nuclear explosion is to test the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.780
 resistance of the breastplate but something gave 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.510
 wrong in the middle of it all now it's over 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.000
 not being as easy as it seemed 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.550
 How much did you think ended up being broken? 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.150
 by the explosion so that even the 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.820
 together with one all that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.590
 that alien material that 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.690
 ended up sticking to the student's body 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.900
 turning him into the captain stated 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.120
 giving that metallic appearance 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.120
 that metallic skin that is actually 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.850
 one more suit in a suit of containment of the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.760
 that a skin even because if it stays 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.600
 with a silver heart there good 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.030
 Can you move and look there, okay, good life. 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.930
 but if that heart is broken it's a 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.900
 explosion is not a 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.760
 party is a destructive explosion that 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.430
 I do not even know what kind of energy it gives 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.200
 to define what was a mix of 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.340
 so much that gave rise to the captain 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.250
 which I think is not just a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.530
 nuclear explosion just like that 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.350
 and then his life started to give shit 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.320
 nelly to submit to it. 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.970
 The test ended up having this explosion and 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.620
 after all this 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.690
 transformation of your body and has been 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.750
 transported was 18 years in the future 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.239
 through this explosion and they had 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.160
 promised by him a thing in case he is not 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.900
 if they had participated they had not said 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.390
 to you will only participate if you 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.150
 survive rock they did not promise to 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.160
 he the presidential pardon that would erase 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.130
 it is not any crime there that they had 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.890
 accused it will all be erased however 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.350
 It is when he was asked to forgive the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.019
 current government is those 18 years in the future 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.000
 he was eventually turned down 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.980
 they used this history of forgiveness 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.450
 president to blackmail the captain 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.150
 act to make a superhero 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.970
 controlled by the government and as if no longer 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.520
 edl is enough and I want now general 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.560
 but colonel had married 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.750
 the wife donated and to make matters worse 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.760
 still in those 18 years in the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.780
 future she was dead she already had 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.080
 deceased 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.210
 or the side he lost all the origin 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.580
 It's very tragic because it's life. 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.520
 it was simply destroyed, right? 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.470
 then became a fully 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.840
 unstable is because if that that skin 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.700
 which it brings of contention breaks 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.870
 he runs the risk of killing millions of 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.960
 innocent 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.680
 He's not a party whore. 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.050
 of a walking bomb and destroyer 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.540
 then it really was destroyed by the 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.370
 explosion and have lost everything and have 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.410
 must be constantly observed in 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.090
 himself participate in any fight 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.080
 against the super being for example the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.380
 Super man 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.720
 if he gave a damn goodbye it was already explode 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.210
 he and with that you can see that he 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.570
 it is not so he does not obey the government 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.750
 simply there I'll just call the 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.050
 justice is legal or not. 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.610
 being blackmailed by that then it is not 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.500
 asshole as many say think of 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.810
 battle fighting superman because 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.970
 he offers government is the boot is not 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.090
 being blackmailed to this the government 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.220
 destroyed his life but finally let's go 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.090
 list of powers is to leave this request 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.160
 Barbie 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.310
 after all the very sad origin is 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.169
 him because the captain is good support and 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.360
 that his arsenal , which is one of the most 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.000
 powerful characters from the same 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.850
 is also one of the most unstable are 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.010
 the neo standard the common equipment of 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.620
 all superheroes at the top level 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.570
 and that they are the force velocity and 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.380
 resistance on accompanied humans 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:10.180
 of a light dose of flight capacity and 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.430
 Quoted-to-Quoted Vulnerability 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.200
 for the simple reason that that suit 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.650
 it can be broken 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.770
 too much so he is not so vulnerable 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.419
 so he is tough but he is fighting 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.360
 against the eyebrow not pay attention 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:28.030
 it is capable that it breaks apart and beyond 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.520
 of this normal equipment it has errors 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.770
 of the most characteristic powers of a 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.470
 manipulation of the quantum energy field 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.449
 bursts of quantum energy transmutation 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.759
 for the absorption of energy 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:43.360
 and the ability to travel in time 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:45.159
 which is something that certain beings in the adc 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.159
 are able to do as flash for 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:50.439
 example, but now we have the media in the 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:53.169
 time appeared among media in the 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:56.339
 capitalism appeared I already mentioned the 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:07:00.370
 justice without limits and also has the 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:03.479
 animations from box bridge to box account 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.400
 ignition and also in batman superman 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:09.580
 enemies to serve escaped from the market 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.849
 public and this is a 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.979
 as long as it is not so apparent it is 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:19.210
 more with natal extras just to do 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:22.479
 average to be part of giving numbers 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.939
 nor to enemies of the enemy superman 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:28.620
 Because you will watch, you will know all 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:28.620
