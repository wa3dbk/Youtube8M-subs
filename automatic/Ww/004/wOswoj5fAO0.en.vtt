00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello hello here again michael of 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.640
 the organic chef we make braised today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:20.039
 Potatoes we make in the Roman times 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:21.480
 head what do we need for potatoes 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.480
 for four persons 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.099
 I have quite small particles that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 just smaller, bigger ones all over 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 would need a backfilled onion garlic 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.460
 pepper my beautiful herbal salt and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.110
 olive oil 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.450
 important at the Roman pot always neat 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.969
 better ten to 15 minutes will be 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.850
 recommended and who sticks to it then 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 has also exceeded the joy for a long time 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 Of course that also works in others 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.690
 Devices comparable device none 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.690
 sponsor onions simply cut 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.000
 the advantage of these devices is 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.049
 Of course, this in your own juice 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 as far as possible in your own juice 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:19.189
 just very nice and gives a great 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.189
 Result 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:37.810
 Potatoes already on it exact recipe 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.490
 in the infobox then the link is too 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.880
 my homepage the bio cook and there 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.560
 is then again this recipe and a 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.899
 few small things was no comments 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.899
 also go garlic where I completely 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.640
 Let's take something stronger meter 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:11.340
 there is always a lot under the shell 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:11.340
 Do not taste too much just a little bit 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.209
 herbal salt was already abundant now 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.950
 purely otherwise just takes a normal 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.360
 salt and is made with herbs of provence 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.910
 for example or a fresh thyme 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.940
 branch or fresh rosemary branch that 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:36.069
 fits both very well now could 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 Nordic struck olive oil about as well 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.930
 much as in olive oil little bit 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:03:04.569
 three times all through life of great comes 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.160
 the lid on it and then off you go 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.829
 very important because the vulva pot in the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.750
 cold oven at 180 degrees so the 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.329
 Potatoes was now an hour in the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.919
 oven with closed pot and one 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.180
 quarter of an hour again the club and 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:24.579
 then the whole thing looks so completely 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.810
 All herbs in a village of herbal salt 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.620
 they have a little friend in it that is 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.620
 yes also totally delicious 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.750
 that just a bit parsley 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.450
 You just have to go with the hero 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:44.310
 group again such a Mediterranean cuisine 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.310
 but it is possible super 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.940
 which fits all of course 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.770
 mediterranean dishes fish poultry 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.330
 vegetarian dishes and of course 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.260
 salad and back she runs out of this 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.300
 not playlist 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.980
 Click through once and look 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.760
 There are really quite a few here 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.760
 things to fit
