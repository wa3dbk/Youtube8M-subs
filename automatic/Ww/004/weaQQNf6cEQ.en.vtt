00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
you crying and he says because it's just

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
a movie and so his his position there

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.750 
a movie and so his his position there
was<00:03:46.370> it's<00:03:46.700> fiction<00:03:47.389> I<00:03:47.950> why<00:03:48.950> would<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.160> cry<00:03:49.489> and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
was it's fiction I why would I cry and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.740 
was it's fiction I why would I cry and
yet<00:03:49.940> with<00:03:50.120> Dickens<00:03:50.799> he<00:03:51.799> would<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.400> this

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
yet with Dickens he would so this

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.210 
yet with Dickens he would so this
contradiction<00:03:53.750> was<00:03:54.139> incredibly<00:03:54.799> important

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
contradiction was incredibly important

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.949 
contradiction was incredibly important
to<00:03:55.280> me<00:03:55.430> because<00:03:55.609> I<00:03:55.790> figured<00:03:55.850> out<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.389> it

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
to me because I figured out that it

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.720 
to me because I figured out that it
occurred<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.560> me<00:03:57.859> that<00:03:57.889> there<00:03:58.340> was<00:03:58.400> some<00:03:58.700> in

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
occurred to me that there was some in

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.910 
occurred to me that there was some in
his<00:03:59.090> mind<00:03:59.359> that<00:03:59.630> the<00:04:00.230> book<00:04:00.440> was<00:04:00.590> doing

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
his mind that the book was doing

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.920 
his mind that the book was doing
something<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.340> movie<00:04:01.549> couldn't<00:04:01.880> do<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.239> he

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
something the movie couldn't do and he

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.210 
something the movie couldn't do and he
couldn't<00:04:03.230> articulate<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.859> but<00:04:03.889> there<00:04:04.130> was

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
couldn't articulate it but there was

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.710 
couldn't articulate it but there was
something<00:04:04.400> special<00:04:04.790> about<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.389> way<00:04:05.540> that

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
something special about the way that

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.960 
something special about the way that
Dickens<00:04:06.079> told<00:04:06.889> that<00:04:07.010> story<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.489> afforded

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
Dickens told that story that afforded

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.559 
Dickens told that story that afforded
him<00:04:08.290> an<00:04:09.290> emotional<00:04:09.709> experience<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:10.220> he<00:04:10.340> was

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
him an emotional experience that he was

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.020 
him an emotional experience that he was
determined<00:04:11.569> not<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.930> have<00:04:12.700> when<00:04:13.700> he<00:04:13.730> went<00:04:13.970> to
