avoidance right now that's legal should
it<00:00:08.820> be<00:00:10.969> well<00:00:11.969> probably<00:00:12.599> not<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:14.670> fact<00:00:14.910> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
it be well probably not but the fact of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
it be well probably not but the fact of
the<00:00:15.089> matter<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.599> Congress<00:00:16.230> has<00:00:16.410> created

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the matter is that Congress has created

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.849 
the matter is that Congress has created
a<00:00:17.010> very<00:00:17.250> intricate<00:00:17.609> system<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.859> companies

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
a very intricate system and companies

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.840 
a very intricate system and companies
can<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.400> expected<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.060> take<00:00:21.210> advantage<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.869> it

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
can be expected to take advantage of it

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
can be expected to take advantage of it
so<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.119> question<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.689> Congress<00:00:25.170> not<00:00:25.289> for

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
so it's a question for Congress not for

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
much more worse than what any of the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.569 
much more worse than what any of the
other<00:00:40.739> tech<00:00:40.980> companies<00:00:41.010> are<00:00:41.430> doing<00:00:43.399> well<00:00:44.399> it's

other tech companies are doing well it's

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.010 
other tech companies are doing well it's
pretty<00:00:44.730> similar<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.629> they're<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:45.989> doing

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
pretty similar to what they're all doing

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.170 
pretty similar to what they're all doing
I<00:00:46.500> mean<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:46.980> broadly<00:00:47.550> speaking<00:00:47.579> what

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
I mean you know broadly speaking what

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.729 
I mean you know broadly speaking what
all<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:48.600> companies<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.320> figure

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
all these companies do is they figure

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.939 
all these companies do is they figure
out<00:00:49.770> ways<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> get<00:00:50.399> profits<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.420> US

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
out ways to get profits out of the US

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.350 
out ways to get profits out of the US
classify<00:00:52.949> them<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.309> foreign<00:00:53.760> profits<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
classify them as foreign profits and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
classify them as foreign profits and
then<00:00:54.480> once<00:00:54.660> they're<00:00:54.840> foreign<00:00:55.199> profits<00:00:55.440> get

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
then once they're foreign profits get

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.950 
then once they're foreign profits get
them<00:00:56.010> into<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> tax<00:00:56.550> haven<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:57.270> Bermuda<00:00:57.660> where

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
them into a tax haven like Bermuda where

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
them into a tax haven like Bermuda where
the<00:00:58.079> Cayman<00:00:58.410> Islands<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.039> mean<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> sheer

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the Cayman Islands I mean the sheer

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.060 
the Cayman Islands I mean the sheer
amounts<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.719> money<00:01:01.020> at<00:01:01.379> stake<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.680> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
amounts of money at stake here with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.700 
amounts of money at stake here with
Apple<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.789> huge<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.140> Apple<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.559> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Apple are huge just because Apple is so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.640 
Apple are huge just because Apple is so
much<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.400> such<00:01:05.610> an<00:01:05.760> enormous<00:01:06.090> company<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
much is such an enormous company but you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
much is such an enormous company but you
know<00:01:07.740> substantively<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.490> very<00:01:08.670> similar<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
know substantively it's very similar to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
know substantively it's very similar to
what<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.479> companies<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
what these other companies do that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.730 
what these other companies do that
doesn't<00:01:10.979> make<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.220> right<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.960> also<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.650> know

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
doesn't make it right and also you know

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.080 
doesn't make it right and also you know
I<00:01:13.770> think<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.250> careful<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I think it's so careful you know kind of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510 
I think it's so careful you know kind of
in<00:01:15.180> terms<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.450> saying<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.900> legal<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.830> broad

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
in terms of saying it's legal the broad

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.969 
in terms of saying it's legal the broad
framework<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.630> companies<00:01:19.320> shifting<00:01:19.740> profits

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
framework of companies shifting profits

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.020 
framework of companies shifting profits
overseas<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:21.680> is<00:01:22.680> legal<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.369> permitted<00:01:23.909> to

tax authorities across the world so it's
not<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.979> shouldn't<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.340> assume<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
not we shouldn't just assume that the

not we shouldn't just assume that the
results<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.930> okay<00:01:37.259> Jesse<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.400> to

results are okay Jesse are we going to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.219 
results are okay Jesse are we going to
see<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:38.729> sort<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> coordinated<00:01:39.780> action

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
see some sort of coordinated action

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
see some sort of coordinated action
among<00:01:40.710> countries<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.520> sounds<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> US

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
among countries it sounds like the US

among countries it sounds like the US
can't<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.409> alone<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.130> we're

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
can't really go at this alone if we're

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
can't really go at this alone if we're
talking<00:01:44.790> about<00:01:45.149> foreign<00:01:45.720> governments<00:01:46.320> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
don't know I don't buy the idea that

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.629 
don't know I don't buy the idea that
he's<00:03:30.720> necessarily<00:03:31.010> complaining<00:03:32.010> about<00:03:32.340> it

he's necessarily complaining about it

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.819 
he's necessarily complaining about it
perhaps<00:03:32.849> he's<00:03:33.299> trying<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:33.900> proactive<00:03:34.139> here

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
perhaps he's trying to be proactive here

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.710 
perhaps he's trying to be proactive here
in<00:03:35.010> stimulating<00:03:35.549> some<00:03:35.910> sort<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.239> legitimate

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
in stimulating some sort of legitimate

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.050 
in stimulating some sort of legitimate
conversation<00:03:37.290> about<00:03:38.010> how<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.220> change<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.639> US

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060

corporate<00:03:39.510> tax<00:03:39.810> code<00:03:40.139> what<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.560> think

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
corporate tax code what do you think

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.970 
corporate tax code what do you think
well<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.720> companies<00:03:43.199> have<00:03:43.379> been<00:03:43.530> pushing<00:03:43.949> for

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
well the companies have been pushing for

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.369 
well the companies have been pushing for
some<00:03:44.370> time<00:03:44.669> for<00:03:45.209> what<00:03:45.419> they<00:03:45.569> call<00:03:45.840> reform

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
some time for what they call reform

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.629 
some time for what they call reform
which<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.889> really<00:03:47.129> reduction<00:03:48.120> in<00:03:48.269> taxes<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.639> I

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
which is really reduction in taxes and I

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.000 
which is really reduction in taxes and I
think<00:03:51.180> apple<00:03:51.599> will<00:03:51.629> use<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.230> occasion<00:03:52.620> to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
think apple will use this occasion to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.339 
think apple will use this occasion to
push<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.609> territorial<00:03:54.510> system<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
push for a territorial system and

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.640 
push for a territorial system and
perhaps<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.919> lower<00:03:56.129> corporate<00:03:56.609> tax<00:03:57.650> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
perhaps a lower corporate tax the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.430 
perhaps a lower corporate tax the
problem<00:03:59.280> really<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.720> Congress<00:04:01.019> has

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
problem really is that Congress has

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.979 
problem really is that Congress has
created<00:04:01.709> such<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.220> monstrosity<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.510> terms<00:04:03.810> of

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
created such a monstrosity in terms of

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.309 
created such a monstrosity in terms of
our<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.440> our<00:04:04.919> overall<00:04:05.099> laws<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.870> there<00:04:07.139> are

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
our of our overall laws that there are

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.680 
our of our overall laws that there are
relatively<00:04:07.799> few<00:04:07.980> people<00:04:08.760> who<00:04:09.030> truly

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
relatively few people who truly

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.640 
relatively few people who truly
understand<00:04:10.379> what's<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.709> on<00:04:11.040> here<00:04:11.609> and<00:04:11.879> I

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
understand what's going on here and I

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.860 
understand what's going on here and I
think<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.769> would<00:04:13.919> be<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.549> pretty<00:04:15.180> big<00:04:15.419> mistake

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
think it would be a pretty big mistake

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.920 
think it would be a pretty big mistake
for<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> United<00:04:16.620> States<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.820> go<00:04:18.000> totally

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
for the United States to to go totally

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.930 
for the United States to to go totally
territorial<00:04:19.739> because<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.370> think<00:04:20.639> we<00:04:20.789> don't

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
territorial because I think we don't

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.810 
territorial because I think we don't
have<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.740> anti-abuse<00:04:22.740> mechanisms<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.789> place

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
have the anti-abuse mechanisms in place

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.690 
have the anti-abuse mechanisms in place
to<00:04:24.120> protect<00:04:24.570> against<00:04:25.260> what<00:04:25.950> would<00:04:26.130> what<00:04:26.400> would

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
to protect against what would what would

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.360 
to protect against what would what would
sooo<00:04:27.020> also<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.230> big<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.680> big<00:04:28.710> missing

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
sooo also the big the big missing

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.150 
sooo also the big the big missing
picture<00:04:29.640> here<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.320> revenue<00:04:31.650> service

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
picture here is that the revenue service

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.100 
picture here is that the revenue service
has<00:04:32.370> been<00:04:32.400> systematically<00:04:33.330> starved<00:04:33.960> by

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
has been systematically starved by

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.590 
has been systematically starved by
Congress<00:04:34.650> for<00:04:34.800> decades<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.640> they<00:04:36.360> just

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
Congress for decades and they just

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.930 
Congress for decades and they just
cannot<00:04:37.110> stand<00:04:37.710> toe-to-toe<00:04:38.100> with<00:04:38.460> the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
cannot stand toe-to-toe with the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.820 
cannot stand toe-to-toe with the
multinationals<00:04:39.900> on<00:04:40.050> these<00:04:40.230> kinds<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.620> issues

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
multinationals on these kinds of issues

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.780 
multinationals on these kinds of issues
David<00:04:41.580> there's<00:04:41.760> been<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:41.910> lot<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.410> urging<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:43.740> a

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
David there's been a lot of urging for a

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.340 
David there's been a lot of urging for a
tax<00:04:44.790> holiday<00:04:45.000> for<00:04:45.360> repatriated<00:04:45.990> earnings

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
tax holiday for repatriated earnings

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.350 
tax holiday for repatriated earnings
there<00:04:46.500> was<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.800> course<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.190> given<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.550> 2004

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
there was of course one given in 2004

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.030 
there was of course one given in 2004
that<00:04:48.900> didn't<00:04:49.110> work<00:04:49.200> out<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.410> well<00:04:49.590> what<00:04:49.950> are

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
that didn't work out so well what are

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.290 
that didn't work out so well what are
the<00:04:50.130> lessons<00:04:50.310> learned<00:04:50.670> from<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:50.880> for<00:04:51.210> this

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
the lessons learned from that for this

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.830 
the lessons learned from that for this
time<00:04:51.510> around<00:04:52.640> what<00:04:53.640> my<00:04:53.790> sense<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.420> that<00:04:54.480> the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
time around what my sense is that the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.020 
time around what my sense is that the
lesson<00:04:55.290> has<00:04:55.620> been<00:04:55.650> learned<00:04:55.890> that<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.670> money

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
lesson has been learned that the money

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.480 
lesson has been learned that the money
brought<00:04:57.420> back<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.410> United<00:04:58.560> States<00:04:59.190> on

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
brought back to the United States on

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.080 
brought back to the United States on
those<00:04:59.700> that<00:05:00.060> amnesty<00:05:01.280> doesn't<00:05:02.280> really<00:05:02.640> serve

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
those that amnesty doesn't really serve

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.360 
those that amnesty doesn't really serve
the<00:05:03.360> nation<00:05:03.510> very<00:05:03.990> well<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:04.590> don't<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.950> have<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
the nation very well I don't I have the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.120 
the nation very well I don't I have the
impression<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:06.030> liquidity<00:05:06.660> of

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
impression that liquidity of

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.010 
impression that liquidity of
multinationals<00:05:08.130> is<00:05:08.370> not<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.820> big<00:05:09.030> problem<00:05:09.900> in

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
multinationals is not the big problem in

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.780 
multinationals is not the big problem in
the<00:05:10.140> United<00:05:10.350> States<00:05:10.560> that's<00:05:11.040> not<00:05:11.280> that's<00:05:11.580> not

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
the United States that's not that's not

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.680 
the United States that's not that's not
what's<00:05:12.210> keeping<00:05:12.810> us<00:05:12.930> from<00:05:13.220> increasing<00:05:14.220> jobs

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
what's keeping us from increasing jobs

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.920 
what's keeping us from increasing jobs
so<00:05:15.690> it's<00:05:16.050> it's<00:05:16.320> a<00:05:16.440> little<00:05:16.710> unclear<00:05:17.210> why<00:05:18.210> we

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
so it's it's a little unclear why we

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.740 
so it's it's a little unclear why we
should<00:05:19.170> go<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.440> an<00:05:19.770> amnesty<00:05:20.130> except<00:05:21.060> as<00:05:21.390> part

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
should go to an amnesty except as part

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.530 
should go to an amnesty except as part
of<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.170> broad<00:05:22.500> reform<00:05:23.280> movement<00:05:23.880> now<00:05:24.120> I

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
of a broad reform movement now I

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.930 
of a broad reform movement now I
personally<00:05:25.530> would<00:05:25.740> favor<00:05:26.040> some<00:05:26.430> kind<00:05:26.700> of<00:05:26.790> an

lower tax rate on them if that were a

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
transition to a new system but the

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.970 
transition to a new system but the
2004-2005<00:05:38.880> law<00:05:39.480> was<00:05:40.320> effectively<00:05:40.860> a

2004-2005 law was effectively a

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.890 
2004-2005 law was effectively a
transition<00:05:41.730> to<00:05:41.880> know<00:05:42.030> where<00:05:42.300> we<00:05:42.690> just

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
transition to know where we just

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.480 
transition to know where we just
remained<00:05:43.260> in<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.530> same<00:05:43.770> system<00:05:44.280> that's

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
remained in the same system that's

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.120 
remained in the same system that's
that's<00:05:44.760> hypocritical<00:05:45.440> kind<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.560> interest<00:05:47.010> in

that's hypocritical kind of interest in

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
to echo one David what David said I mean

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.360

actually you know there's a nekkid
there's<00:05:56.610> an<00:05:56.760> academic<00:05:57.150> research<00:05:57.450> that

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
there's an academic research that

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.090 
there's an academic research that
suggests<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:58.140> was<00:05:58.290> not<00:05:58.410> just<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.740> road<00:05:58.920> to

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
suggests it was not just a road to

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.350 
suggests it was not just a road to
nowhere<00:05:59.130> but<00:05:59.580> actually<00:05:59.910> encouraged

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
nowhere but actually encouraged

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
profits offshore because of the

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.720 
profits offshore because of the
expectation<00:06:04.770> that<00:06:04.830> they<00:06:04.950> would<00:06:05.100> get<00:06:05.190> a<00:06:05.220> second

very aggressively moving profits in some

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.540 
very aggressively moving profits in some
cases<00:06:19.020> which<00:06:19.290> probably<00:06:19.530> should<00:06:19.830> be<00:06:19.980> in<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.220> US
