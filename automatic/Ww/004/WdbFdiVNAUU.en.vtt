of<00:04:37.080> in<00:04:37.229> this

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
of in this

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.620 
of in this
process<00:04:37.830> only<00:04:38.010> takes<00:04:38.130> about<00:04:38.490> three<00:04:39.450> or<00:04:39.480> four

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
process only takes about three or four

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.660 
process only takes about three or four
days<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.230> actually<00:04:40.350> complete<00:04:40.860> if<00:04:41.160> you're

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
days to actually complete if you're

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.250 
days to actually complete if you're
actually<00:04:41.820> doing<00:04:42.150> your<00:04:42.390> drama<00:04:42.600> not<00:04:42.810> fucking

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
actually doing your drama not fucking

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.980

around and sitting there doing nothing
