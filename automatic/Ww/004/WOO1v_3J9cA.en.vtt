00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:08.210
 my people are a hug to everyone there 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.950
 I was here on a big field. 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.200
 rio de janeiro 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.999
 I installed the valve to adapt more 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.480
 we knew that our very expensive work has 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:20.390
 seven years and lately he has 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.760
 temperature drop 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.380
 when on the road then go the thermostat 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.770
 it stays locked open 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.910
 I'm not here for hours 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.910
 raining wind beating in front 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.550
 Beauty, now I'm going to pick up Brazil. 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.930
 I'm going to give about 140 or so just to 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.260
 see us feel how it goes 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.260
 stay 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.140
 the behavior in relation to temperature 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.229
 because in the case of the thermostatic valve it is 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.140
 It's complicated, she's locked open due to 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.000
 the engine temperature drop is 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.689
 harmful also when both the engine 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.929
 increase in fuel consumption 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:07.990
 I came back to king scott hd valve 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:13.119
 finally something general output 82 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:16.990
 here I used to send it if you believe if I do not 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.759
 I am mistaken for a very cheap 2190 brand that 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.679
 will also provide good 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.610
 durability let's get brazil that gives 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.649
 A little chocolate to see how it goes 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:34.049
 at the moment the temperature behaving 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.049
 well, it's a very acceptable temperature 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.750
 and this installation movement that I 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.140
 I used nothing is apparent does not stay 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.009
 that appearance of adaptation of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.439
 Gambiarra does not deserve our 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.840
 companion that thanks to the tip that he 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.300
 gave it to the people that I could 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.900
 I thought a little more 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.700
 and run away that way it's better 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.770
 study and be embedded right 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.200
 The ditch has shown that it's about to appear. 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.120
 clamp taking nothing away from the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.640
 originality of the car so at the level of 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.380
 appearance of the original hose hose 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.580
 It's raining a lot here on the river 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:22.990
 it's terrible 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:30.470
 Come on, let's play here for 120 to 112 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:32.660
 08 call there I'll see fortunately not 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.360
 can walk on the road but for 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.530
 while the temperature is adjusted again 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.530
 of 2190 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.050
 and then you like it so lets play here 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.320
 Let's see if we can 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:58.160
 driving the driver out of the bay. 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.489
 had no wallet bought wallet 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.489
 so let's see how it was going out 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 and there they tell me it's worth 2190 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.629
 just not forgetting uncle radiator 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.799
 which is fundamental is very important 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:29.930
 the radiator additive in case I only use 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.930
 now it 's changed the name is over to the street is 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.470
 now the name now stick 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.019
 I think you do not fool me. 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.659
 I bought it to see that the concentrate 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.819
 also distilled water which is essential 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.120
 I've had this car for seven years now. 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.159
 which was approved and goes to the stadium 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.609
 never type of cooling water pump 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:54.269
 original is a car that I so love 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:57.329
 ter 12 has another also 1.6 retouching 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.319
 now I'm going to make a comeback and I'll get the 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.400
 Come back west to see if I can. 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.349
 I can stretch a little higher 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.220
 for us to take a closer look at 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.949
 accurate 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.379
 it really worked for now okay 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:15.419
 beauty is not heating up and neither is it 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.250
 it's cooling it's keeping the track on 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.250
 middle range that is 90 degrees 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.810
 It's good to catch the westbound return here. 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.039
 if the crowd stops giving a stretch 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.900
 a little more to see if people 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:41.880
 can really get a doubt. 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.680
 car you could never just add them 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.630
 with additive also from time to time 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.289
 and this is what is going to be enem 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.289
 Now let's see if we can 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.050
 fully stabilized temperature in the 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.050
 time 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.139
 it will be difficult because you have to 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.710
 patrol on the vectra front to embark 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.980
 or the temperature there up here in 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.410
 raining road was to pass without this 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.710
 valve would be below that 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.990
 with the valve you can see that 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.280
 the temperature is totally 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.280
 stabilized looks only 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.470
 the advantage of this in relation to the other 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.230
 method used by our partner 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.460
 is that nothing is apparent or post the 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.010
 video for you 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.690
 and how was the morning there? 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.710
 draw your conclusions 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:50.350
 a hug to all cbm staff and the 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.610
 embrace and that you can take 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.610
 I really enjoy this video
