00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.359 

I<00:01:20.049> was<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.229> bit<00:01:21.439> concerned<00:01:21.649> that<00:01:22.039> these<00:01:22.189> are

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
I was a bit concerned that these are

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.039 
I was a bit concerned that these are
topple<00:01:22.759> over<00:01:23.000> once<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.359> added<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.750> weight<00:01:23.899> of

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
topple over once I added the weight of

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.109 
topple over once I added the weight of
my<00:01:24.079> clothes<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:24.890> as<00:01:25.219> you<00:01:25.399> can<00:01:25.520> see<00:01:25.579> they<00:01:26.090> are

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
my clothes but as you can see they are

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.969 
my clothes but as you can see they are
attached<00:01:26.600> together<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.619> weight<00:01:27.770> does

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
attached together and the weight does

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.980 
attached together and the weight does
distribute<00:01:28.549> amongst<00:01:28.819> them<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:31.719> there's<00:01:32.719> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
distribute amongst them so there's the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.429 
distribute amongst them so there's the
screws<00:01:33.319> that<00:01:33.500> keep<00:01:33.679> them<00:01:33.859> together<00:01:34.069> here<00:01:35.439> if

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
screws that keep them together here if

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.350 
screws that keep them together here if
you<00:01:36.679> are<00:01:36.829> still<00:01:37.130> worried<00:01:37.459> too<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.939> can<00:01:38.149> also
