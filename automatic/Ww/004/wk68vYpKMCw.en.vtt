00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
figure out way to and then we got the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:46.390 
figure out way to and then we got the
course<00:03:38.760> me<00:03:39.030> which<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:40.140> did

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.280 

all<00:03:47.400> right<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:47.909> after<00:03:48.659> that<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> whole<00:03:49.049> song

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
all right so after that the whole song

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.020 
all right so after that the whole song
repeats<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.159> same<00:03:50.370> thing<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.849> bridge

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
repeats and is the same thing the bridge

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.640 
repeats and is the same thing the bridge
is<00:03:51.209> very<00:03:51.269> easy<00:03:51.689> you'll<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.170> able<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.379> get<00:03:52.470> back

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
is very easy you'll be able to get back

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.759 
is very easy you'll be able to get back
but<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.310> second<00:03:53.700> chorus<00:03:53.970> he<00:03:54.750> tags<00:03:55.079> on<00:03:55.319> e-flat

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
but the second chorus he tags on e-flat

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.190 
but the second chorus he tags on e-flat
so<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.909> second<00:03:57.269> chorus<00:03:57.450> should<00:03:57.720> do<00:03:57.840> all<00:03:58.079> the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
so the second chorus should do all the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.050 
so the second chorus should do all the
way<00:03:58.319> up<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.739> here<00:03:59.189> and<00:03:59.340> then<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.790> have<00:03:59.970> an

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
way up to here and then you have an

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.880 
way up to here and then you have an
extra<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.480> flat<00:04:00.780> that's<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.349> only<00:04:01.530> other<00:04:01.680> weed

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
extra a flat that's the only other weed

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.429 
extra a flat that's the only other weed
part<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:03.239> very<00:04:03.659> end<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.959> didn't<00:04:04.170> figure<00:04:04.319> out

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
part the very end I didn't figure out
