part one in the right hand is pretty

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.060 
part one in the right hand is pretty
easy<00:00:48.640> too<00:00:49.120> this<00:00:49.329> is<00:00:49.480> how<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.720> sounds<00:00:49.870> by<00:00:50.769> itself

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
easy too this is how it sounds by itself

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.219 
easy too this is how it sounds by itself
okay

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.950 

so<00:00:56.379> all<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.620> do<00:00:56.769> is<00:00:56.800> you<00:00:57.010> play<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.729> a<00:00:58.920> twice

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so all you do is you play the a twice

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.100 
so all you do is you play the a twice
then<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.080> move<00:01:02.260> up<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.680> e<00:01:02.979> G<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:04.210> B<00:01:04.269> when<00:01:04.989> you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
then you move up to e G and B when you

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.490 
then you move up to e G and B when you
play<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:05.379> like<00:01:05.500> this<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.659> ease<00:01:07.900> play<00:01:08.140> by<00:01:08.290> itself

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
play it like this so ease play by itself

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.140 
play it like this so ease play by itself
then<00:01:08.740> G<00:01:08.860> B<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:12.159> you<00:01:12.340> move<00:01:12.490> up<00:01:12.610> again<00:01:12.909> to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
then G B so when you move up again to

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.050 
then G B so when you move up again to
fanc<00:01:14.880> hit<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.030> twice<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.610> then<00:01:18.850> back<00:01:19.030> down

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
fanc hit that twice and then back down

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:28.380 
fanc hit that twice and then back down
to<00:01:19.420> e<00:01:19.450> gb<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:25.890> okay<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.159> with<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.759> left<00:01:27.970> hand<00:01:28.180> it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
to e gb so okay so with the left hand it

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:37.840 
to e gb so okay so with the left hand it
should<00:01:28.570> sound<00:01:28.810> like<00:01:28.960> this<00:01:29.259> really<00:01:29.979> slow

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.200 

okay<00:01:38.880> part<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> left<00:01:40.710> hand<00:01:40.980> is<00:01:41.370> like

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
okay part two and the left hand is like

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:53.440 
okay part two and the left hand is like
this<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:43.020> together

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.160 

so<00:01:54.450> break<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.810> down<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.590> D<00:01:56.390> F<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.900> click

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
so break it down it's D F in a click

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
so break it down it's D F in a click
together<00:01:58.580> one<00:01:59.580> two<00:02:00.090> three<00:02:00.570> d<00:02:01.530> e<00:02:01.560> f<00:02:01.680> na<00:02:01.980> then<00:02:02.730> eg

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
together one two three d e f na then eg

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:18.800 
together one two three d e f na then eg
and<00:02:03.720> B<00:02:12.380> then<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.470> goes<00:02:13.590> up<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.770> F<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.250> C<00:02:17.810> then

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and B then it goes up to F a and C then

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.640 
and B then it goes up to F a and C then
back<00:02:19.050> down<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.320> e<00:02:19.470> G<00:02:19.590> B<00:02:26.930> then<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.020> moves<00:02:28.200> down<00:02:28.470> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
back down to e G B then it moves down to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:38.360 
back down to e G B then it moves down to
B<00:02:28.890> flat<00:02:32.060> same<00:02:33.060> pattern<00:02:34.790> then<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.820> move<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.800> F<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
B flat same pattern then you move to F a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.559 
B flat same pattern then you move to F a
and<00:02:38.610> C

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:55.399 

then<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.689> move<00:02:46.840> back<00:02:46.870> up<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.319> b-flat<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:54.150> d-flat

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
then you move back up to b-flat a d-flat

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:25.009 
then you move back up to b-flat a d-flat
any<00:02:58.079> so<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:05.500> yeah<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:05.829> saw<00:03:06.129> that<00:03:06.310> would<00:03:06.430> be

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.809 

right<00:03:26.019> hand<00:03:26.290> for<00:03:26.560> part<00:03:26.769> two<00:03:26.950> showed<00:03:27.459> some<00:03:27.670> like

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
right hand for part two showed some like

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:46.970 
right hand for part two showed some like
this<00:03:38.489> so<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:39.819> break<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.269> down<00:03:40.480> d<00:03:41.349> ft<00:03:44.069> f<00:03:45.069> d<00:03:45.909> e

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this so that is break it down d ft f d e

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:59.890 
this so that is break it down d ft f d e
f<00:03:47.980> e<00:03:48.879> f<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.629> see

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:18.380 

then<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.020> goes<00:04:01.880> ad<00:04:02.880> F<00:04:03.450> G<00:04:03.960> a<00:04:06.020> F<00:04:07.020> G<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:17.209> I'm<00:04:18.209> going

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
then it goes ad F G a F G so I'm going

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.490 
then it goes ad F G a F G so I'm going
to<00:04:18.450> play<00:04:18.570> through<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.780> really<00:04:19.080> really<00:04:19.290> slow

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
to play through that really really slow

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:41.780 
to play through that really really slow
so<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.709> can<00:04:19.799> get<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.190> timing<00:04:20.430> right

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.760 

part<00:04:42.790> three<00:04:43.240> is<00:04:43.270> really<00:04:43.960> really<00:04:44.290> similar<00:04:44.620> to

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
part three is really really similar to

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.740 
part three is really really similar to
part<00:04:45.070> two<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:45.520> practically<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.330> same<00:04:46.510> thing

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
part two it's practically the same thing

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.020 
part two it's practically the same thing
just<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.200> ending<00:04:47.530> is<00:04:47.650> different<00:04:47.980> so<00:04:48.220> starts

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
just the ending is different so starts

00:04:49.030 --> 00:05:00.030 
just the ending is different so starts
out<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.240> same<00:04:49.270> its<00:04:50.020> DNA<00:04:53.070> eg<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.160> B<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:56.310> fancy<00:04:59.040> eg

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
out the same its DNA eg and B I fancy eg

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.060 
out the same its DNA eg and B I fancy eg
and<00:05:00.190> be<00:05:01.440> just<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.560> same<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:02.770> what<00:05:02.980> you<00:05:03.040> just

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
and be just the same as what you just

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.120 
and be just the same as what you just
did<00:05:03.400> say<00:05:04.090> me<00:05:04.270> go<00:05:04.389> down<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.600> B<00:05:05.020> flat<00:05:05.530> D<00:05:05.980> F<00:05:08.130> but

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
did say me go down to B flat D F but

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.890 
did say me go down to B flat D F but
this<00:05:09.370> time<00:05:09.669> instead<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.240> going<00:05:10.419> down<00:05:10.690> there

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
this time instead of going down there

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.959 
this time instead of going down there
you<00:05:11.530> go<00:05:11.970> here<00:05:13.350> straight<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.530> this<00:05:14.650> one

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:24.219 

some<00:05:17.289> BDNF<00:05:18.289> a<00:05:19.249> d<00:05:20.059> flat<00:05:20.809> e<00:05:22.329> and<00:05:23.329> then<00:05:23.479> you<00:05:23.629> end<00:05:23.899> on

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
some BDNF a d flat e and then you end on

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:41.529 
some BDNF a d flat e and then you end on
a<00:05:37.839> KN<00:05:38.839> is<00:05:38.989> just<00:05:39.439> the<00:05:39.559> same<00:05:39.739> asked<00:05:40.129> exactly<00:05:40.549> it's

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
a KN is just the same asked exactly it's

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:49.059 
a KN is just the same asked exactly it's
d<00:05:42.409> UF<00:05:42.709> c<00:05:42.979> d<00:05:43.939> MF<00:05:44.239> d<00:05:44.449> e<00:05:44.949> f<00:05:45.949> BF<00:05:46.819> e<00:05:47.119> C<00:05:47.419> a<00:05:47.949> then<00:05:48.949> it

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
d UF c d MF d e f BF e C a then it

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:55.820 
d UF c d MF d e f BF e C a then it
changes<00:05:49.429> a<00:05:49.489> little<00:05:49.639> bit<00:05:49.909> it<00:05:50.059> goes

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:08.140 

so<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.520> ending<00:05:56.729> part<00:05:56.940> is<00:05:57.150> ad<00:05:58.340> FDA<00:05:59.659> ad

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.000 

with<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.330> left<00:06:09.510> hand<00:06:09.600> really<00:06:10.050> slow<00:06:10.350> it<00:06:10.710> shirts

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
with the left hand really slow it shirts

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:29.330 
with the left hand really slow it shirts
like<00:06:11.250> this<00:06:27.170> you<00:06:28.170> can<00:06:28.320> either<00:06:28.440> end<00:06:28.770> it<00:06:28.890> with<00:06:29.010> a<00:06:29.040> D

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
like this you can either end it with a D

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.300 
like this you can either end it with a D
minor<00:06:29.790> chord<00:06:29.940> which<00:06:30.360> is<00:06:30.420> this<00:06:30.770> or<00:06:31.770> you<00:06:31.980> can<00:06:32.160> end

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
minor chord which is this or you can end

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.980 
minor chord which is this or you can end
on<00:06:32.460> an<00:06:32.640> E<00:06:32.760> major<00:06:33.030> chord<00:06:33.240> which<00:06:33.600> kind<00:06:33.840> of<00:06:33.870> gives

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
on an E major chord which kind of gives

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:43.910 
on an E major chord which kind of gives
it<00:06:34.170> a<00:06:34.230> cool<00:06:34.410> ending<00:06:35.270> so<00:06:36.270> it's<00:06:36.420> like<00:06:42.740> it<00:06:43.740> just

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
it a cool ending so it's like it just

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.420 
it a cool ending so it's like it just
depends<00:06:44.220> on<00:06:44.280> what<00:06:44.430> you<00:06:44.520> like<00:06:44.700> I<00:06:46.220> like<00:06:47.220> both
