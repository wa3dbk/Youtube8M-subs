after being Foster's only practice we
have<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> crack<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.980> engine<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.730> in

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
have a crack in the engine you know in

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.990 
have a crack in the engine you know in
the<00:00:50.969> block<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> oil<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.530> leaking<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:53.010> so

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the block so the oil was leaking out so

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.459 
the block so the oil was leaking out so
before<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> first<00:00:54.690> heat<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.870> guys<00:00:55.140> took<00:00:55.289> out

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
before the first heat the guys took out

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.630 
before the first heat the guys took out
and<00:00:55.739> gearbox<00:00:56.399> flywheel<00:00:57.239> everything<00:00:57.780> tried<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
and gearbox flywheel everything tried to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.510 
and gearbox flywheel everything tried to
seal<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> he<00:01:00.500> came<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> track<00:01:02.129> start

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
seal it he came out to the track start

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.460 
seal it he came out to the track start
to<00:01:02.609> leak<00:01:02.789> again<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> oil<00:01:04.049> came<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to leak again so the oil came on the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
to leak again so the oil came on the
coach<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:07.640> was<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.420> difficult

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
coach and I was just very very difficult

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.550 
coach and I was just very very difficult

and also their fight with Jack there you
know<00:01:13.680> yeah<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> clerks<00:01:14.460> were<00:01:14.580> sleeping

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
know yeah but the clerks were sleeping

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
know yeah but the clerks were sleeping
so<00:01:14.970> bad<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> start<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> had<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.200> chance

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
so bad from the start so I had no chance

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.830 
so bad from the start so I had no chance
ok<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> first<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.360> red<00:01:18.570> flag

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
ok so the first thing was red flag

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
ok so the first thing was red flag
because<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> car<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.770> turning<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.490> driving

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
because the car was turning and driving

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
because the car was turning and driving
the<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:20.939> way<00:01:21.180> yeah<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.439> leaving

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the other way yeah so I was leaving

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
the other way yeah so I was leaving
there<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.520> good<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
there and I look very good but when I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.570 
there and I look very good but when I
came<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> again<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> oil

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
came in again there you know the oil

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.880 
came in again there you know the oil
pressure<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:27.000> very<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.570> low<00:01:27.840> okay<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
pressure was very very low okay but the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010 
pressure was very very low okay but the
car<00:01:29.040> engine<00:01:29.759> still<00:01:29.970> works<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.509> use<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
car engine still works we use it in the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
car engine still works we use it in the
second<00:01:31.380> year<00:01:31.700> they'll<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.030> give<00:01:33.150> up

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
second year they'll have to give up

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.859 
second year they'll have to give up
again<00:01:33.630> still<00:01:34.500> slipping<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> Gertz<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> was

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
again still slipping the Gertz so I was

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.410 
again still slipping the Gertz so I was
quite<00:01:37.049> false<00:01:37.470> yeah<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> second

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
quite false yeah and then on the second

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
quite false yeah and then on the second
lap<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:40.619> race<00:01:40.799> suspension<00:01:40.950> broke<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
lap the race suspension broke on the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
lap the race suspension broke on the
left<00:01:42.090> rear<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.740> then<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> had<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> puncture<00:01:44.369> on

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
left rear and then I had a puncture on

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.649 
left rear and then I had a puncture on
the<00:01:44.579> last<00:01:44.790> lap

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
the last lap

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.620 
the last lap
and<00:01:46.990> still<00:01:47.259> nine<00:01:47.829> so<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.789> obviously<00:01:49.119> get<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.420> be

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
and still nine so I obviously get to be

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.420 
and still nine so I obviously get to be
seventh<00:01:50.140> overall<00:01:50.409> after<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:50.950> first<00:01:51.130> day<00:01:51.310> I'm

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
seventh overall after the first day I'm

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.639 
seventh overall after the first day I'm
actually<00:01:51.640> very<00:01:52.000> very<00:01:52.360> pleased<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.049> they're

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
actually very very pleased and they're

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.529 
actually very very pleased and they're
actually<00:01:53.950> changing<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.430> engine<00:01:54.729> now<00:01:55.000> but

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
actually changing the engine now but

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.389 
actually changing the engine now but
it's<00:01:55.659> not<00:01:55.810> for<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:55.990> new<00:01:56.259> engine<00:01:56.439> because<00:01:57.220> what

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
it's not for a new engine because what

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.889 
it's not for a new engine because what
would<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.640> mean<00:01:57.789> if<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.119> took<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.360> new<00:01:58.570> engine

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
would it mean if you took a new engine

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.380 
would it mean if you took a new engine
now<00:01:59.079> no<00:01:59.649> if<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.100> put<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.429> a<00:02:00.520> brand<00:02:00.729> new<00:02:00.850> engine<00:02:01.030> it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
now no if I put in a brand new engine it

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.120 
now no if I put in a brand new engine it
will<00:02:01.509> be<00:02:01.600> minus<00:02:01.929> fifteen<00:02:02.259> points<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:02.860> we<00:02:02.950> put

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
will be minus fifteen points so we put

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.109 
will be minus fifteen points so we put
in<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.549> Jimmy<00:02:03.670> had<00:02:03.880> Inc<00:02:04.000> on<00:02:04.149> another<00:02:04.299> who's
