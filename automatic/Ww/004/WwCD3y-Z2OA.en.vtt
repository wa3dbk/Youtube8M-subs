00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello everyone and welcome back to this one 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.600
 new computer museum episode 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.450
 today I am here to explain how 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.420
 format this pc like all the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 others with windows 98 operating system 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 95 and earlier then the thing is a lot 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.240
 simple you will wonder why 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.869
 I want to format this computer with 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.910
 windows 98 then also first of all 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.230
 if reason is very simple even a little 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.260
 stupid 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.579
 I wanted to connect this computer to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.340
 Internet 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.100
 but unfortunately this network card 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.829
 had to go with windows 98 but it doesn't go 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.879
 on other computers it works but on this 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.570
 no 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.670
 then this card should already be running 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.050
 as induced, however, it does not turn 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 so now let's go format 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.410
 so to go and put go in 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.250
 own commands then making start 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.949
 close session restart in ms mode 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 dos you see here and do 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.220
 ok at this point will open this 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.750
 window and you what you will do 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:21.619
 then it is very simple enough 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:26.850
 write format like this 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.220
 sorry space c 2 points and hit enter 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.200
 here will tell you all the details on the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.829
 hard drive will be lost to us 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.280
 continue with formatting s 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.790
 dash no then is sixth percy n for 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.619
 no so we create and press enter a 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.259
 this point he will begin the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.250
 formatting of the hard drive that it is of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.850
 about one gigabyte at the end of the procedure 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.399
 you will have this hard disk and or formatted 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.930
 completely and without a system 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.790
 operating 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.140
 here you must not be afraid because it is 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.979
 making the recovery attempt 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.760
 unit that will issue numbers here 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.220
 on the 2000s 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.530
 I remember now and after that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.380
 will continue with formatting the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.120
 formatting will last about and so will I 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.280
 I tell you with my computer then I don't know for 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:24.850
 others will last about twenty minutes 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.320
 half an hour so I'm not here to continue 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.110
 to make the video but I'm in between 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.430
 very little after that I was telling myself 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:40.070
 once it is finished it will come out 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.600
 will come out practically as you can say 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.520
 still your own commands every time 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.500
 that you will restart the computer will not be there 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.110
 plus no operating system but only the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.300
 just the commands in that case you will have to 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.570
 insert a floppy disk with the with 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.900
 restore above where you can install 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.700
 anything ok thank you all for 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.560
 have seen this video 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.750

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.910
