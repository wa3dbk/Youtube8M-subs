00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
big a problem so I have to really be

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.830 
big a problem so I have to really be
careful<00:05:51.770> with<00:05:52.010> this<00:05:52.250> guitar<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.970> take<00:05:53.600> it<00:05:53.750> on

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:55.999 
always been a collaborator in my writing
that<00:06:52.769> I'll<00:06:53.099> start<00:06:53.549> off<00:06:53.729> with<00:06:53.939> an<00:06:54.059> idea<00:06:54.209> and<00:06:55.009> my

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
that I'll start off with an idea and my

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.379 
that I'll start off with an idea and my
fingers<00:06:56.399> will<00:06:56.579> play<00:06:56.759> something<00:06:57.059> that<00:06:57.239> I

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
fingers will play something that I

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.689 
fingers will play something that I
hadn't<00:06:57.749> expected<00:06:58.079> and<00:06:58.499> the<00:06:59.189> next<00:06:59.429> thing<00:06:59.579> I

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
hadn't expected and the next thing I

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.189 
hadn't expected and the next thing I
know<00:06:59.759> I'm<00:07:00.209> headed<00:07:00.569> off<00:07:00.659> in<00:07:00.839> another<00:07:01.049> direction

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
know I'm headed off in another direction

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.179 
know I'm headed off in another direction
and<00:07:02.179> and<00:07:03.349> so<00:07:04.349> I<00:07:04.379> like<00:07:04.649> to<00:07:04.679> think<00:07:04.979> that<00:07:05.009> the

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:05.189 
and and so I like to think that the

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:07.159 
and and so I like to think that the
guitar<00:07:05.519> has<00:07:05.789> some<00:07:06.089> say<00:07:06.329> in<00:07:06.509> where<00:07:06.689> it<00:07:06.839> where<00:07:07.019> it

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
guitar has some say in where it where it

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:09.679 
guitar has some say in where it where it
wants<00:07:07.529> the<00:07:07.559> song<00:07:07.859> to<00:07:08.069> go<00:07:08.219> and<00:07:08.519> on<00:07:09.359> a<00:07:09.389> good<00:07:09.629> day

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:09.689 
wants the song to go and on a good day

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:13.369 
wants the song to go and on a good day
that<00:07:10.199> it'll<00:07:10.589> be<00:07:10.709> 5050
