this Neve concealer has a lovely light
consistency<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.579> does<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> slight

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.819 
consistency and it does have a slight
peach<00:01:36.450> tone<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.049> great<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.259> under<00:01:37.710> eyes

peach tone so it's great for under eyes
but<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.579> tough<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.060> hold<00:01:39.270> of
