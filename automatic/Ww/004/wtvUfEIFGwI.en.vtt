00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.860
 It was the first team that many people 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.280
 knows but not many people from puerto rico 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.390
 he knows but I was here like a month 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.160
 practicing with the team 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 I do not remember was the coach too 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.550
 so part of my first 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.530
 Experience in Spain was good because 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.910
 I could only see the names of the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.290
 team I think it has a very good 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.230
 template 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.690
 the results are not there but very 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.980
 good very good players to see if it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.750
 can go around 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.880
 Well, I remember because I think that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.730
 we won both and more I do not remember but 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.090
 tremendous support very well supports the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090
 team and 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.810
 we'll see what instructions the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.270
 coach but always my game is a 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.430
 assistance direction during making a 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.650
 the others not without good and that all the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.960
 world play happy to see if that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.400
 way you can take victory and we'll see 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 Let's see but we'll see what the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.270
 coach and deal with the deadly idea 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.310
 well open to see what it is that 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.580
 need already I will see the other parties to 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.570
 see how the team's dynamics are going and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.250
 I will try to add and not subtract from 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.040
 adapt to the team through you see that 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.330
 you can help and again the important thing 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.000
 here is to see how we can make victories 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.119
 which is what is needed so if 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.940
 game add to those but not a rival 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.740
 complicated from the beginning but not 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.810
 walk at its best so we'll see 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.759
 to see here at home I know that a 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.740
 complicated equipment at home so 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.530
 We will see to see if with the help of the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.310
 hobby and have the equipment well well 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.310
 centered is if we can 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.600
 and
