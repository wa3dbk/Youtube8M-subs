00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
voltage is for the pack so we're gonna

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.830 
voltage is for the pack so we're gonna
go<00:00:56.470> over<00:00:56.680> here<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:56.920> channel<00:00:57.460> one<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.510> I've<00:00:58.630> got

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
go over here to channel one and I've got

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.330 
go over here to channel one and I've got
a<00:00:58.870> program<00:00:59.380> set<00:00:59.710> up<00:00:59.739> already<00:01:00.280> for<00:01:00.370> this<00:01:00.700> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
a program set up already for this and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.700 
a program set up already for this and
pick<00:01:03.340> that<00:01:03.580> program<00:01:04.150> you<00:01:04.780> see<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.019> 40<00:01:05.500> amp

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
pick that program you see a 40 amp

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.000 
pick that program you see a 40 amp
setting<00:01:06.190> for<00:01:06.400> charging

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.310 

there<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:12.120> channel<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.050> taking<00:01:13.560> off

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
there we go channel one is taking off

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.490 
there we go channel one is taking off
channel<00:01:16.320> 2<00:01:17.360> now<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.990> thing<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.230> like<00:01:19.470> about

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
channel 2 now one thing I like about

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.500 
channel 2 now one thing I like about
dischargers<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.730> to<00:01:20.880> use<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> same

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
dischargers I get to use the same

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.830 
dischargers I get to use the same
program<00:01:21.870> profile<00:01:22.910> for<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.030> second<00:01:24.450> channel

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
program profile for the second channel

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
program profile for the second channel
at<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> same<00:01:25.140> time<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.160> have<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
at the same time I don't have to have a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.900 
at the same time I don't have to have a
separate<00:01:27.240> series<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.410> programs<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.520> channel

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
separate series of programs for channel

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.270 
separate series of programs for channel
one<00:01:30.120> and<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.900> back<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.410> reprogram<00:01:32.040> all

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
one and go back in and reprogram all

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
one and go back in and reprogram all
those<00:01:32.460> same<00:01:32.730> things<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.180> channel<00:01:33.510> 2<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.320> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
those same things with channel 2 so I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.900 
those same things with channel 2 so I
have<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.800> is<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.160> to<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
have to do is I have to put in the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.450 
have to do is I have to put in the
programming<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.840> once<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.410> then<00:01:38.160> I<00:01:38.280> can

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
programming at once and then I can

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.040 
programming at once and then I can
select<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.530> preset<00:01:40.910> program<00:01:41.910> profile<00:01:42.540> for

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
select that preset program profile for

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.920 
select that preset program profile for
either<00:01:43.170> channel<00:01:43.680> 1<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.220> channel<00:01:44.700> 2<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.750> can

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
either channel 1 or channel 2 and I can

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.900 
either channel 1 or channel 2 and I can
do<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> simultaneously<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:47.190> I'm<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.730> get

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
do it simultaneously so I'm going to get

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.420 
do it simultaneously so I'm going to get
ready<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.180> start<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.380> channel<00:01:49.650> 2<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:50.160> so<00:01:50.190> we

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
ready to start the channel 2 here so we

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.480 
ready to start the channel 2 here so we
have<00:01:50.550> about<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.820> 45<00:01:51.390> second<00:01:51.900> stagger<00:01:52.490> between

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
have about a 45 second stagger between

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.510 
have about a 45 second stagger between
these<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:53.910> charge<00:01:54.240> cycles<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.400> we're<00:01:56.400> gonna

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
these two charge cycles and we're gonna

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.150 
these two charge cycles and we're gonna
wait<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.820> channel<00:01:57.810> 2<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.020> ramp<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.500> channel<00:01:59.010> 1

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
wait for channel 2 to ramp up channel 1

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.070 
wait for channel 2 to ramp up channel 1
is<00:01:59.310> already<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.820> 40<00:02:00.180> amps<00:02:00.570> roughly<00:02:02.870> there<00:02:03.870> goes

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
is already at 40 amps roughly there goes

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.910 
is already at 40 amps roughly there goes
channel<00:02:04.440> 2

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.590 

now<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.610> other<00:02:09.760> thing<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.030> like<00:02:10.180> about<00:02:10.210> this

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
now the other thing I like about this

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.110 
now the other thing I like about this
Chargers<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.290> fact<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.130> go<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.700> look

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
Chargers in fact that I can go to look

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.820 
Chargers in fact that I can go to look
at<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.270> internal<00:02:13.690> resistance<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
at the internal resistance and the

this little green squiggly turn on that

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.310 
this little green squiggly turn on that
means<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.460> that<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.480> lowest<00:02:44.050> setting

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
means that that is the lowest setting

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.910 
means that that is the lowest setting

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.100 
for the faint the Chargers reached by
106<00:02:48.640> degrees<00:02:48.790> internally<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> fan<00:02:50.080> is

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
106 degrees internally so a fan is
