target this next level is more difficult

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
target this next level is more difficult
we<00:00:58.350> can't<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.710> bounce<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.070> laser<00:00:59.250> beam<00:00:59.520> around

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
we can't just bounce a laser beam around

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
we can't just bounce a laser beam around
through<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> targets<00:01:00.539> there's<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.109> bomb<00:01:01.289> in

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
through the targets there's a bomb in

through the targets there's a bomb in

the way and the walls and gaps don't

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
the way and the walls and gaps don't
make<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.090> any<00:01:03.239> easier<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.260> let's<00:01:04.470> blow<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
make it any easier so let's blow up the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
make it any easier so let's blow up the
bomb<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:08.490> won't<00:01:08.729> work<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.450> blew<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.780> the

bomb that won't work it blew up the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
bomb that won't work it blew up the
laser<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.890> can't<00:01:11.070> take<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.280> second<00:01:11.670> shot

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
laser too so we can't take a second shot

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240 
laser too so we can't take a second shot
hit<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> targets<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> level

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250

automatically restarts if you blow up
your<00:01:16.200> laser<00:01:16.380> we'll<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> blow<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
your laser we'll have to blow up the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
your laser we'll have to blow up the
bomb<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> hit<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> targets<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.619> shot

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
bomb and hit the targets with one shot

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.100 
bomb and hit the targets with one shot
we<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.090> using<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.630> splitter<00:01:24.110> use

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
we can do that using this splitter use

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
we can do that using this splitter use
one<00:01:25.409> beam<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.860> blow<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> bomb<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
one beam to blow up the bomb and the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
one beam to blow up the bomb and the
other<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.869> hit<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.200> leftmost<00:01:28.619> target

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
other one to hit that leftmost target

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
other one to hit that leftmost target
and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.460> bounce<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.909> back<00:01:30.030> through<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> path

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and then bounce it back through the path

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:38.179 
and then bounce it back through the path
we've<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.049> cleared<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:37.409> last<00:01:37.740> level<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
we've just cleared this last level is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
we've just cleared this last level is
pretty<00:01:38.400> tough<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> blow<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pretty tough here we have to blow up the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
pretty tough here we have to blow up the
bombs<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.650> reach<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.009> last<00:01:41.189> target<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.150> we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bombs to reach the last target but if we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.999 
bombs to reach the last target but if we
detonate<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.869> before<00:01:43.290> activating<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
detonate them before activating the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
detonate them before activating the
target<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.490> next<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> them<00:01:45.119> it'll<00:01:45.659> blow<00:01:45.810> up

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
target that's next to them it'll blow up

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.670 
target that's next to them it'll blow up
to<00:01:46.170> here's<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.070> solution

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.530 

you

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.370 

Oh

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.719 

thanks<00:02:08.380> for<00:02:08.530> watching<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.100> have<00:02:09.160> fun<00:02:09.460> playing
