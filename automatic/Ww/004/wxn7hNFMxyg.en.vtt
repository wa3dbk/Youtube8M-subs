00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
that might not be a good idea and then

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.480 
that might not be a good idea and then
you<00:01:27.410> can<00:01:27.560> just<00:01:27.649> instantly<00:01:27.920> wave<00:01:28.160> your<00:01:28.310> hands

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
you can just instantly wave your hands

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.490 
you can just instantly wave your hands
and<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.880> make<00:01:29.060> all<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.509> ink<00:01:29.690> disappear<00:01:30.110> so

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
and you make all the ink disappear so

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.219 
and you make all the ink disappear so
it's<00:01:30.619> kind<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> like<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:30.950> vanishing<00:01:31.369> ink<00:01:31.579> trick

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
it's kind of like a vanishing ink trick

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.010 
it's kind of like a vanishing ink trick
so<00:01:33.229> there<00:01:33.619> is<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:34.009> secret<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.869> is

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
so there is a secret to this it is it is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.200 
so there is a secret to this it is it is
a<00:01:36.049> gimmick<00:01:36.259> pen<00:01:36.710> but<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.549> is<00:01:37.670> highly<00:01:37.909> visual

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
a gimmick pen but it is highly visual

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.109 
a gimmick pen but it is highly visual
and<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.930> think<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:39.320> makes<00:01:39.829> for<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.130> really<00:01:40.400> fun

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
and I think it makes for a really fun

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.319 
and I think it makes for a really fun
magic<00:01:42.049> gag<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.710> wouldn't<00:01:43.310> use<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.490> as<00:01:43.729> an<00:01:43.939> effect

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
magic gag I wouldn't use it as an effect

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.690 
magic gag I wouldn't use it as an effect
per<00:01:44.600> se<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:44.899> maybe<00:01:45.259> an<00:01:45.619> effect<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.490> way<00:01:46.640> to

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
per se but maybe an effect on the way to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.999 
per se but maybe an effect on the way to
an<00:01:47.000> effect<00:01:47.329> I<00:01:47.509> mean<00:01:47.659> certainly<00:01:48.020> magicians<00:01:48.860> we

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
an effect I mean certainly magicians we

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.130 
an effect I mean certainly magicians we
use<00:01:49.159> sharpies<00:01:49.579> black<00:01:50.390> circles<00:01:50.720> all<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.930> time

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
use sharpies black circles all the time

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.429 
use sharpies black circles all the time
so<00:01:51.909> this<00:01:52.909> could<00:01:53.149> be<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:54.049> kind<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.259> like<00:01:54.409> a

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
so this could be just kind of like a

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.139 
so this could be just kind of like a
bridge<00:01:54.710> between<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:55.310> trick<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:55.729> another<00:01:55.939> or

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
bridge between one trick and another or

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.940 
bridge between one trick and another or
be<00:01:56.420> fun<00:01:56.600> at<00:01:56.719> the<00:01:56.810> kiss<00:01:56.990> party<00:01:57.290> or<00:01:57.680> something

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
be fun at the kiss party or something

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.100 
be fun at the kiss party or something
like<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.909> hey<00:01:59.450> just<00:01:59.719> a<00:01:59.780> couple<00:01:59.990> of

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
like that and so hey just a couple of

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.990 
like that and so hey just a couple of
questions<00:02:00.290> we<00:02:00.530> always<00:02:00.860> ask<00:02:01.280> about<00:02:01.610> our<00:02:01.670> magic

questions we always ask about our magic
products<00:02:02.329> first<00:02:03.170> off<00:02:03.320> can<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:03.590> do<00:02:03.710> it

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
products first off can you do it

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.160 
products first off can you do it
surrounded<00:02:04.299> pretty<00:02:05.299> much<00:02:05.479> yeah<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:05.990> don't

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
surrounded pretty much yeah I don't

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.330 
surrounded pretty much yeah I don't
think<00:02:06.200> there's<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.530> whole<00:02:06.829> lot<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.979> angle

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
think there's a whole lot of angle

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
think there's a whole lot of angle
issues<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.790> think<00:02:08.030> if<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.209> know<00:02:08.390> how<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.630> use

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
issues I think if you know how to use

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.500 
issues I think if you know how to use
the<00:02:09.380> gimmick<00:02:09.709> well<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.459> you've<00:02:11.269> had<00:02:11.450> some

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
the gimmick well and you've had some

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.390 
the gimmick well and you've had some
practice<00:02:12.019> with<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.410> in<00:02:12.680> some<00:02:12.890> settings<00:02:13.280> I

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
practice with it and in some settings I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.449 
practice with it and in some settings I
don't<00:02:13.579> think<00:02:13.790> you'd<00:02:14.690> find<00:02:15.019> too<00:02:15.769> many<00:02:15.980> angle

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
don't think you'd find too many angle

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.210 
don't think you'd find too many angle
issues<00:02:16.940> with<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.299> can<00:02:18.079> it<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.260> inspected<00:02:18.829> no<00:02:19.190> I

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
issues with it can it be inspected no I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.500 
issues with it can it be inspected no I
don't<00:02:19.519> think<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.760> inspect<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.329> think

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
don't think you can inspect it I think

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.599 
don't think you can inspect it I think
you're<00:02:20.600> in<00:02:20.690> your<00:02:20.989> spectator<00:02:21.590> would<00:02:22.190> find<00:02:22.489> the

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
you're in your spectator would find the

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.580 
you're in your spectator would find the
secret<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.150> pretty<00:02:23.570> quickly<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.380> it's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
secret to it pretty quickly and it's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.650 
secret to it pretty quickly and it's
just<00:02:24.799> easily<00:02:25.220> fixed<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.150> know<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.299> put<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.600> in

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
just easily fixed you know you put it in

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.729 
just easily fixed you know you put it in
your<00:02:26.690> pocket<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.230> bring<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.470> different

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
your pocket and you bring a different

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.199 
your pocket and you bring a different
one<00:02:27.829> out<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.100> do<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> switch<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.790> mean<00:02:28.940> that

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
one out you do a switch I mean that

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.050 
one out you do a switch I mean that
would<00:02:29.359> be<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.570> best<00:02:29.780> way<00:02:30.530> around<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.820> it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
would be the best way around this is it

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.600 
would be the best way around this is it
well<00:02:32.180> made<00:02:32.420> absolutely<00:02:33.320> I've<00:02:33.650> used<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.250> over

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
well made absolutely I've used this over

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.009 
well made absolutely I've used this over
and<00:02:34.730> over<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.030> over<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.360> over<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.690> over<00:02:35.810> and

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
and over and over and over and over and

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:36.700 
and over and over and over and over and
over<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.349> over

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
over and over

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.580 
over and over
over<00:02:36.950> over<00:02:37.160> again<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.970> never<00:02:38.450> had<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.140> single

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
over over again and never had a single

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.190 
over over again and never had a single
issue<00:02:39.860> with<00:02:40.700> its<00:02:40.910> performance<00:02:41.540> or<00:02:41.720> its<00:02:41.840> reset

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
issue with its performance or its reset

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.610 
issue with its performance or its reset
ever<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.520> don't<00:02:44.000> know<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:45.440> magic

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
ever so I don't know what you do magic

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.770 
ever so I don't know what you do magic
is<00:02:45.980> inside<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.120> yes<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.690> is

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
is inside of this but yes it is

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.840 
is inside of this but yes it is
extremely<00:02:48.410> well<00:02:48.530> made<00:02:48.740> how<00:02:49.490> much<00:02:49.640> practice

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
extremely well made how much practice

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.990 
extremely well made how much practice
does<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.300> require<00:02:50.510> none<00:02:51.340> in<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.550> box<00:02:52.760> you're

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
does it require none in the box you're

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.090 
does it require none in the box you're
gonna<00:02:53.060> get<00:02:53.360> your<00:02:53.540> instructions<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.200> your

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
gonna get your instructions and your

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.700 
gonna get your instructions and your
gimmick<00:02:55.340> pen<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:56.080> pretty<00:02:57.080> much<00:02:57.230> once<00:02:57.500> you

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
gimmick pen and pretty much once you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.070 
gimmick pen and pretty much once you
figure<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.220> out<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:59.270> straight<00:02:59.600> shot<00:02:59.630> I

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
figure it out it's a straight shot I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.750 
figure it out it's a straight shot I
mean<00:03:00.260> you're<00:03:00.530> you're<00:03:01.040> doing<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.430> right<00:03:01.550> away

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
mean you're you're doing it right away

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.130 
mean you're you're doing it right away
so<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.330> don't<00:03:02.480> think<00:03:02.540> there's<00:03:02.750> really<00:03:02.840> any

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
so I don't think there's really any

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.640 
so I don't think there's really any
practice<00:03:03.710> like<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.370> said<00:03:04.580> there<00:03:05.030> might<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.180> one

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
practice like I said there might be one

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.200 
practice like I said there might be one
one<00:03:06.650> angle<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.490> you<00:03:07.640> might<00:03:07.790> need<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.030> watch

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
one angle that you might need to watch

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.330 
one angle that you might need to watch
but<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.020> think<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.440> will<00:03:09.740> come<00:03:09.920> out<00:03:10.070> as<00:03:10.310> you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
but I think that will come out as you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.950 
but I think that will come out as you
just<00:03:10.640> play<00:03:10.880> with<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.150> you'll<00:03:11.420> you'll<00:03:11.630> notice

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
just play with it you'll you'll notice

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.020 
just play with it you'll you'll notice
and<00:03:12.140> you'll<00:03:12.260> say<00:03:12.350> oh<00:03:12.560> yeah<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.340> should<00:03:13.670> do<00:03:13.940> it

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
and you'll say oh yeah I should do it

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.390 
and you'll say oh yeah I should do it
like<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.360> um<00:03:14.600> how<00:03:15.140> much<00:03:15.290> set<00:03:15.590> up<00:03:15.620> or<00:03:15.860> reset<00:03:16.220> is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
like this um how much set up or reset is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.430 
like this um how much set up or reset is
there<00:03:16.640> zero<00:03:17.240> there's<00:03:17.810> none

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
there zero there's none

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.640 
there zero there's none
there's<00:03:18.770> nothing<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.470> go<00:03:21.470> back

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
there's nothing that you have to go back

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.910 
there's nothing that you have to go back
and<00:03:21.890> push<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.280> click<00:03:22.790> or<00:03:23.030> pull<00:03:23.630> or<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.080> reset<00:03:24.650> or

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
and push a click or pull or a reset or

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.220 
and push a click or pull or a reset or
hook<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.610> there's<00:03:26.270> nothing<00:03:26.570> like<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.930> it's

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
hook on there's nothing like that it's

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.740 
hook on there's nothing like that it's
set<00:03:27.770> up<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.070> reset<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.520> instantaneous<00:03:29.420> um

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
set up and reset is instantaneous um

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.320 
set up and reset is instantaneous um
positives<00:03:30.560> positives<00:03:31.370> because<00:03:31.730> because<00:03:32.300> of

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
positives positives because because of

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.260 
positives positives because because of
David<00:03:32.810> Barnett<00:03:33.020> Feeney's<00:03:33.640> style<00:03:34.640> being

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
David Barnett Feeney's style being

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.760 
David Barnett Feeney's style being
highly<00:03:35.630> visual<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.320> highly<00:03:36.620> visual

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
highly visual this is the highly visual

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.590 
highly visual this is the highly visual
effect<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.760> think<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.210> gives<00:03:38.300> a<00:03:38.420> big

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
effect so I think it gives a big

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.960 
effect so I think it gives a big
reaction<00:03:39.080> that<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.340> effect<00:03:40.610> happens
