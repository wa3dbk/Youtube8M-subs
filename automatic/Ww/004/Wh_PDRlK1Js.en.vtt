makes<00:00:20.619> no<00:00:21.400> mixer<00:00:21.960> involved<00:00:22.960> just<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:24.490> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
makes no mixer involved just for the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.759 
makes no mixer involved just for the
liquid<00:00:25.930> ingredients<00:00:26.170> into<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:26.680> dry

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
liquid ingredients into the dry

liquid ingredients into the dry
ingredients<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:36.010> just<00:00:36.280> stir<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.299> around

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.430 

now<00:00:47.260> this<00:00:47.379> is<00:00:47.440> ninety-five<00:00:48.070> percent

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
now this is ninety-five percent

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.560 
now this is ninety-five percent
hydration<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:51.489> sounds<00:00:51.729> a<00:00:51.909> little<00:00:52.119> high<00:00:52.269> but

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
hydration which sounds a little high but

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.560 
hydration which sounds a little high but
the<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.799> whole<00:00:53.949> grains<00:00:54.250> tend<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.360> absorb

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
the the whole grains tend to absorb

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.359 
the the whole grains tend to absorb
pretty<00:00:56.019> good<00:00:56.229> it's<00:00:56.769> always<00:00:56.890> good<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.159> use<00:00:57.339> a

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:57.369 
pretty good it's always good to use a

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.390 
pretty good it's always good to use a
nice<00:00:57.610> big<00:00:57.879> bowl<00:00:58.089> too<00:00:58.390> like<00:00:58.900> this<00:00:59.159> just<00:01:00.159> work<00:01:00.369> it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
nice big bowl too like this just work it

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.869 
nice big bowl too like this just work it
around<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.790> little<00:01:00.820> bit<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:03.309> would<00:01:03.430> be<00:01:03.549> kind<00:01:03.790> of

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
around a little bit it would be kind of

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.760 
around a little bit it would be kind of
wet<00:01:04.269> it<00:01:04.420> first<00:01:04.659> come<00:01:04.989> back<00:01:05.110> in<00:01:05.229> about<00:01:05.379> an<00:01:05.530> hour

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
wet it first come back in about an hour

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.270 
wet it first come back in about an hour
and<00:01:06.900> it'll<00:01:07.900> start<00:01:08.170> combining<00:01:08.590> really<00:01:09.130> well

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
and it'll start combining really well

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.740 
and it'll start combining really well
and<00:01:09.460> we've<00:01:09.610> done<00:01:09.970> luton<00:01:10.360> will<00:01:10.450> start<00:01:10.660> to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
and we've done luton will start to

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.480 
and we've done luton will start to
develop<00:01:11.620> overnight<00:01:14.040> make<00:01:15.040> sure<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.250> stir

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
develop overnight make sure you stir

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.710 
develop overnight make sure you stir
really<00:01:15.880> good<00:01:16.060> at<00:01:16.120> this<00:01:16.180> point<00:01:16.450> there's<00:01:16.570> lots

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
really good at this point there's lots

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.020 
really good at this point there's lots
of<00:01:16.780> gluten<00:01:17.110> starts<00:01:18.870> all<00:01:19.870> right<00:01:19.960> I'm<00:01:20.910> moving<00:01:21.910> it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
of gluten starts all right I'm moving it

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.790 
of gluten starts all right I'm moving it
around<00:01:22.120> and<00:01:22.510> see<00:01:22.660> it's<00:01:22.780> starting<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.620> thicken

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
around and see it's starting to thicken

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.340 
around and see it's starting to thicken
up<00:01:23.950> right<00:01:24.160> now<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.840> little<00:01:26.020> bit<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.170> few

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
up right now it's a little bit a few

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:38.180 
up right now it's a little bit a few
minutes

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190

little<00:02:15.130> bit<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.400> then<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.640> will<00:02:15.790> sit

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
little bit and then this will sit

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.990 
little bit and then this will sit
overnight<00:02:16.650> preferably<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.920> somewhat<00:02:18.730> cool

no<00:02:22.150> problem<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:22.630> summer<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.620> might<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:29.220> okay

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
no problem in summer it might be okay

those been resting all night in a cool
place<00:03:00.750> right<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.930> dough<00:03:02.140> temperatures

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
place right now the dough temperatures

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.360 
place right now the dough temperatures
around<00:03:03.060> low<00:03:04.060> 60s<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:05.409> it's<00:03:05.590> time<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.799> give<00:03:06.280> it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
around low 60s so it's time to give it

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.009 
around low 60s so it's time to give it
another<00:03:06.549> spin<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.230> can<00:03:08.349> see<00:03:08.560> how<00:03:08.769> it's

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
another spin so you can see how it's

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.360 
another spin so you can see how it's
starting<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.319> come<00:03:11.440> together<00:03:11.590> just<00:03:11.950> being
