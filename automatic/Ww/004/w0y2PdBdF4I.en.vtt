knights<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.460> USB<00:01:52.790> mode<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.450> something<00:01:54.080> will

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
knights on USB mode and something will

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:08.270 
knights on USB mode and something will
pop<00:01:54.259> up<00:01:54.649> there<00:01:57.820> I'll<00:01:58.820> open<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.390> this<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.490> now

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.730 

so<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.630> root<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.710> your<00:02:10.830> PhD<00:02:11.280> because

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
so this is the root of your PhD because

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.890 
so this is the root of your PhD because
as<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.100> it's<00:02:14.760> written<00:02:15.060> F<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.660> top

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
as you can see it's written F on top

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.870 
as you can see it's written F on top
that<00:02:16.140> means<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.800> root<00:02:17.070> where<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.550> passed

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
that means it's the root where I passed

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.020 
that means it's the root where I passed
in<00:02:18.030> our<00:02:18.150> mine<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:18.600> F<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.160> really<00:02:20.400> depends

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
in our mine it's F but it really depends

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.990 
in our mine it's F but it really depends
by<00:02:21.660> computer<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.580> you're<00:02:23.670> gonna<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:23.910> to
