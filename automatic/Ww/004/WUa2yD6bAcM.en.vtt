get<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> point<00:02:14.489> where<00:02:14.700> there's<00:02:14.970> three

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
get to the point where there's three

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.580 
get to the point where there's three
different<00:02:15.420> things<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.989> side<00:02:16.139> and<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.440> has

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
different things on the side and it has

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
different things on the side and it has
to<00:02:16.769> match<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.160> all<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.459> those<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:17.819> those<00:02:18.389> are

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to match with all of those and those are

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.900 
to match with all of those and those are
going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.780> much<00:02:19.440> more<00:02:19.470> difficult<00:02:19.859> to<00:02:20.519> do<00:02:20.670> if

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
going to be much more difficult to do if

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.090 
going to be much more difficult to do if
you<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:22.079> any<00:02:22.319> matches<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.769> your<00:02:22.799> hand

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you don't have any matches in your hand

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.640 
you don't have any matches in your hand
well<00:02:23.310> will<00:02:23.579> be<00:02:23.609> tied<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.389> you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.109> discard<00:02:25.470> up

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
well will be tied you you can discard up

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.199 
well will be tied you you can discard up
the<00:02:25.739> three<00:02:25.950> cards<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.459> draw<00:02:26.639> but<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.030> don't

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the three cards and draw but you don't

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.270 
the three cards and draw but you don't
get<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.329> take<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> turn<00:02:27.950> otherwise<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.190> get

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
get to take a turn otherwise you get

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.979 
get to take a turn otherwise you get
points<00:02:29.579> for<00:02:29.880> every<00:02:30.090> combination<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.840> put

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
points for every combination you put

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.660 
points for every combination you put
down<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.410> let's<00:02:31.709> say<00:02:31.829> this<00:02:31.950> was<00:02:32.100> my<00:02:32.220> first<00:02:32.400> turn

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
down so let's say this was my first turn

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.910 
down so let's say this was my first turn
I<00:02:32.880> get<00:02:33.329> five<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.840> five<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.290> would<00:02:34.470> get<00:02:34.620> ten

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
I get five and five I would get ten

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.759 
I get five and five I would get ten
points<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:36.120> keep<00:02:36.359> going<00:02:36.750> until<00:02:36.900> nobody<00:02:37.380> can

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
points we keep going until nobody can

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.420 
points we keep going until nobody can
play<00:02:38.010> or<00:02:38.280> until<00:02:39.209> well<00:02:40.160> nobody<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.250> play

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
play or until well nobody can play

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.039 
play or until well nobody can play
basically<00:02:41.670> all<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> cars<00:02:42.359> have<00:02:42.510> run<00:02:42.660> out<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
basically all the cars have run out and

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.930 
basically all the cars have run out and
then<00:02:43.829> whoever<00:02:44.069> has<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> highest<00:02:44.340> score<00:02:44.880> at

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
then whoever has the highest score at

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.710 
then whoever has the highest score at
that<00:02:45.090> point<00:02:45.389> in<00:02:45.480> time<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.889> winner<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:48.569> can

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
that point in time is the winner you can

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.910 
that point in time is the winner you can
see<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.989> artwork<00:02:49.200> on<00:02:49.410> here<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.709> very

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
see the artwork on here is very

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.690 
see the artwork on here is very
minimalistic<00:02:50.400> it's<00:02:51.359> not<00:02:51.720> bad<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.799> cars<00:02:53.579> are

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
minimalistic it's not bad the cars are

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.190 
minimalistic it's not bad the cars are
colored<00:02:54.000> differently<00:02:54.150> depending<00:02:54.750> how<00:02:55.079> many

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
colored differently depending how many

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.539 
colored differently depending how many
points<00:02:55.410> they're<00:02:55.680> worth<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.099> do<00:02:56.160> like<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
points they're worth and I do like the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.400 
points they're worth and I do like the
fact<00:02:56.579> that<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.090> word<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.450> written<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.900> all

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
fact that the word is written on all

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.710 
fact that the word is written on all
four<00:02:58.650> sides<00:02:58.680> although<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.480> think

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
four sides although you know you think

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.900 
four sides although you know you think
they<00:03:00.930> would<00:03:01.109> have<00:03:01.139> written<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.700> four

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
they would have written it in the four

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.339 
they would have written it in the four
different<00:03:03.239> directions<00:03:03.329> so<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.230> people

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
different directions so that the people

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.379 
different directions so that the people
sitting<00:03:04.709> around<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.220> table<00:03:05.250> would<00:03:06.030> be<00:03:06.090> able

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
sitting around the table would be able

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.509 
sitting around the table would be able
to<00:03:06.450> read<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.750> what's<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.019> point<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.919> that's

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
to read it what's the point but that's

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.409 
to read it what's the point but that's
okay<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> minor<00:03:09.150> flaw<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:10.290> does<00:03:10.530> seem<00:03:10.919> well

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
the game just annoyed me was that you

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.150 
the game just annoyed me was that you
could<00:03:30.110> play<00:03:30.260> as<00:03:30.349> many<00:03:30.440> cards<00:03:30.800> as<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.010> want

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
could play as many cards as you want

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.770 
could play as many cards as you want
your<00:03:31.280> turn<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:31.730> some<00:03:31.910> would<00:03:32.090> sit<00:03:32.300> there<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.510> it

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
your turn so some would sit there and it

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.440 
your turn so some would sit there and it
was<00:03:32.930> agony<00:03:33.830> as<00:03:34.459> they<00:03:34.670> sit<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.030> say<00:03:35.120> does<00:03:35.269> it<00:03:35.390> go

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
was agony as they sit and say does it go

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.729 
was agony as they sit and say does it go
here<00:03:35.599> to<00:03:35.629> go<00:03:35.870> here<00:03:36.019> does<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.230> go<00:03:36.290> here<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.530> go

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
here to go here does it go here to go

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.410 
here to go here does it go here to go
here<00:03:36.980> then<00:03:37.370> they<00:03:37.459> put<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> card<00:03:37.970> down<00:03:38.180> then<00:03:38.390> a

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
here then they put a card down then a

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.540 
here then they put a card down then a
great<00:03:38.660> debate<00:03:38.870> breaks<00:03:39.500> out<00:03:39.739> over<00:03:40.340> whether

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
great debate breaks out over whether

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.370 
great debate breaks out over whether
that's<00:03:40.849> actually<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.420> word<00:03:41.750> or<00:03:41.930> not<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.319> then

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
that's actually a word or not and then

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.660 
that's actually a word or not and then
people<00:03:42.440> are<00:03:42.769> looking<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.250> up<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.519> their

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
people are looking it up on their

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.880 
people are looking it up on their
iPhones<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.450> what<00:03:44.569> have<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.780> now<00:03:45.470> don't<00:03:45.769> get

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
iPhones and what have you now don't get

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.559 
iPhones and what have you now don't get
me<00:03:46.010> wrong<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.400> love<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:46.640> good<00:03:46.849> debate<00:03:47.000> as<00:03:47.269> much<00:03:47.420> as

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
me wrong I love a good debate as much as

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.420 
me wrong I love a good debate as much as
the<00:03:47.630> next<00:03:47.660> person<00:03:47.930> but<00:03:48.260> man<00:03:48.800> people's<00:03:49.190> terms

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
the next person but man people's terms

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.210 
the next person but man people's terms
seemed<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.790> stretch<00:03:50.030> out<00:03:50.269> forever<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.220> you

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
seemed to stretch out forever and you

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.650 
seemed to stretch out forever and you
could<00:03:52.370> say<00:03:52.519> well<00:03:52.730> think<00:03:53.030> about<00:03:53.120> your<00:03:53.330> cards<00:03:53.569> in

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
could say well think about your cards in

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.240 
could say well think about your cards in
your<00:03:53.750> turn<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.200> board<00:03:54.440> would<00:03:54.650> change<00:03:55.010> so

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
your turn but the board would change so

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.180 
your turn but the board would change so
much<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:56.290> wasn't<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.319> big<00:03:57.440> fan<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.739> this<00:03:57.980> game

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
much I wasn't a big fan of this game

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.479 
much I wasn't a big fan of this game
it's<00:03:58.580> okay<00:03:59.090> I<00:03:59.360> didn't<00:04:00.260> dislike<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.010> activity

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
it's okay I didn't dislike the activity

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.789 
it's okay I didn't dislike the activity
but<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:01.730> just<00:04:01.849> didn't<00:04:02.150> feel<00:04:02.329> that<00:04:02.989> interesting

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
but it just didn't feel that interesting

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.150 
but it just didn't feel that interesting
to<00:04:03.920> me<00:04:04.599> however<00:04:05.599> a<00:04:05.959> few<00:04:06.410> other<00:04:06.530> people<00:04:06.860> liked

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
to me however a few other people liked

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.710 
to me however a few other people liked
it<00:04:07.340> more<00:04:07.489> than<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:07.760> did<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.150> some<00:04:08.420> people

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
it more than I did and some people

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.970 
it more than I did and some people
thought<00:04:08.900> got<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.290> kick<00:04:09.560> out<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:09.829> know

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
thought got a kick out of you know

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.319 
thought got a kick out of you know
putting<00:04:10.190> two<00:04:10.370> different<00:04:10.640> words<00:04:10.760> together<00:04:10.940> I

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
putting two different words together I

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.930 
putting two different words together I
don't<00:04:11.840> think<00:04:11.930> that's<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.349> bad<00:04:12.590> idea<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:13.430> just

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
don't think that's a bad idea I just

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.789 
don't think that's a bad idea I just
felt<00:04:14.150> like<00:04:14.180> there<00:04:14.390> wasn't<00:04:14.599> enough<00:04:15.019> variety<00:04:15.200> I

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
felt like there wasn't enough variety I

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.460 
felt like there wasn't enough variety I
had<00:04:16.310> those<00:04:16.489> cards<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.150> did<00:04:17.540> what<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.720> could<00:04:18.019> tried

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
had those cards I did what I could tried

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.069 
had those cards I did what I could tried
to<00:04:18.590> find<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.799> best<00:04:18.979> place<00:04:19.280> for<00:04:19.519> scoring<00:04:20.079> it

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
to find the best place for scoring it

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.040 
to find the best place for scoring it
just<00:04:21.470> doesn't<00:04:22.460> mesh<00:04:22.940> together<00:04:23.240> as<00:04:23.630> well<00:04:23.870> as<00:04:23.990> I

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
just doesn't mesh together as well as I

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.070 
just doesn't mesh together as well as I
wanted<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.440> do<00:04:24.560> but<00:04:25.460> hey<00:04:25.780> now<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:26.810> I've
