00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.690
 promised now to complete the video in two 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.900
 month after taking over halogen sat 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.509
 by the way now the date is August 5th because 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 you tighten a bit with the video let's 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 first tell you about my feelings 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.220
 what i noticed i liked what not 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.260
 I liked it and then I will show you clearly 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 Well, firstly, as I have here in the past 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.810
 month I had my hair just started 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.489
 on the cheeks to speak that is, well, we started 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.620
 takes the whole area they were a little 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.649
 too big but they began to gain their 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.840
 the square is now a void beginning 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.829
 appear so normal and density 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.559
 that is, well, there are gaps there 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.660
 less seriously a sword when she is already but 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.120
 if straight and peering but so 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.309
 pretty great beard all great 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 one moment I noticed 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.430
 accounting forgotten there is busy very much 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.020
 It was two days I did not use Naxan and 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 the beard began to peel again then 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.360
 two days later, let's get used again 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.590
 I will show you clearly how to look 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.520
 what is my beard 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.680
 Well, if so look at the hair of blood 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.540
 Pushkin well, and if so then how would you believe in 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.330
 in general, here they are my cheeks 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.509
 the goal was to grow your hair 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.130
 already become thickish so serious i 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.720
 I think now they are a little bit under 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.030
 cut here too here under overgrown 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.070
 okay by the way and a start 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.320
 grow up but this is nonsense for some reason I do not 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.820
 not much like but something very 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.479
 speed quickly began to gain here 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 it is here that this place is possible later 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.640
 so I will do here so I will, but how 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.790

 stretch this movie to 5 10 minutes 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.110
