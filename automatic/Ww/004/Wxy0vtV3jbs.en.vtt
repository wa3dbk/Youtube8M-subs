actually more important than shooting

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.950 
actually more important than shooting
because<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> likelihood<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.930> successful

away but it's three cons that devote the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.530 
away but it's three cons that devote the
entire<00:01:32.220> game<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.759> sniping<00:01:33.270> from<00:01:33.299> the

chapped my ass I mean even at 200 meters
you're<00:01:39.689> still<00:01:39.869> far<00:01:40.110> enough<00:01:40.259> away<00:01:40.409> from<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you're still far enough away from the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.170 
you're still far enough away from the
enemy<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> advantage<00:01:41.670> over<00:01:41.970> them

enemy to have the advantage over them
but<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> closer<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.439> accurate

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
but the closer you get the more accurate

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.590 
but the closer you get the more accurate
you<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> easier<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> help<00:01:45.479> the

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
that many points for one kill really

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.839 
that many points for one kill really

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.070 
yeah didn't think so and just let me say
this<00:05:20.219> I'm<00:05:20.520> not<00:05:20.879> saying<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.449> getting<00:05:21.719> such

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
this I'm not saying that getting such

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.499 
this I'm not saying that getting such
long<00:05:22.349> range<00:05:22.620> kills<00:05:22.860> does<00:05:23.250> not<00:05:23.400> take<00:05:23.610> skill<00:05:23.969> far

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
long range kills does not take skill far

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.300 
long range kills does not take skill far
from<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.139> takes<00:05:25.349> a<00:05:25.469> really<00:05:25.680> steady<00:05:26.009> hand

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
from it it takes a really steady hand

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.580 
from it it takes a really steady hand
and<00:05:26.580> or<00:05:26.759> analog<00:05:27.210> stick<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:27.930> is<00:05:28.080> definitely<00:05:28.440> a

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
and or analog stick it is definitely a

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.680 
and or analog stick it is definitely a
difficult<00:05:28.949> skill<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.460> achieve<00:05:29.880> but<00:05:30.449> in<00:05:30.569> the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
difficult skill to achieve but in the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.659 
difficult skill to achieve but in the
confines<00:05:31.199> of<00:05:31.259> an<00:05:31.560> objective<00:05:32.039> based<00:05:32.250> shooter

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
confines of an objective based shooter

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.059 
confines of an objective based shooter
compared<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.599> skills<00:05:33.900> of<00:05:34.110> say<00:05:34.319> capturing

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
compared to the skills of say capturing

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:36.469 
compared to the skills of say capturing
objectives<00:05:35.520> working<00:05:36.029> together<00:05:36.120> and

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
objectives working together and

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.700 
objectives working together and
supporting<00:05:36.870> your<00:05:36.960> teammates<00:05:37.349> so<00:05:37.440> they<00:05:37.560> can

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
supporting your teammates so they can

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.230 
supporting your teammates so they can
better<00:05:37.889> defend<00:05:38.279> or<00:05:38.400> attack<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.699> objectives

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
better defend or attack the objectives

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.149 
better defend or attack the objectives
800-meter<00:05:40.139> headshots<00:05:40.680> is<00:05:40.830> a<00:05:40.860> pretty

800-meter headshots is a pretty

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.830 
800-meter headshots is a pretty
superfluous<00:05:41.789> skill<00:05:42.090> it's<00:05:42.449> like<00:05:42.599> if<00:05:42.719> your

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
superfluous skill it's like if your

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.480
