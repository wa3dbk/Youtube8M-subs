hello<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.470> this<00:00:10.650> video<00:00:10.860> we'll<00:00:11.280> demonstrate

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
hello in this video we'll demonstrate

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.270 
hello in this video we'll demonstrate
how<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.150> use<00:00:12.300> VSS<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.320> make<00:00:13.500> an<00:00:13.650> error<00:00:13.860> vector

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
how to use VSS to make an error vector

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.490 
how to use VSS to make an error vector
magnitude<00:00:14.420> measurement<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:16.139> we'll<00:00:16.290> also

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
magnitude measurement and we'll also

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.110 
magnitude measurement and we'll also
discuss<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.190> key<00:00:17.370> components<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.970> are

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.120 
discuss the key components that are

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.990 
discuss the key components that are
needed<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.600> make<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.260> measurement<00:00:19.850> if<00:00:20.850> we

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
needed to make the measurement if we

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.570 
needed to make the measurement if we
take<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> look<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:21.780> system<00:00:22.140> diagram<00:00:22.590> we'll

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
take a look at the system diagram we'll

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.760 
take a look at the system diagram we'll
see<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.030> a<00:00:24.060> 16<00:00:24.870> gram<00:00:25.140> source<00:00:25.530> being

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
see we have a 16 gram source being

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.320 
see we have a 16 gram source being
generated<00:00:26.280> here<00:00:27.080> we<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.230> an<00:00:28.350> amplifier<00:00:28.680> a

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
this case the VSS simulation is running

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.869 
this case the VSS simulation is running
continuously<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.950> first<00:02:20.190> column<00:02:20.459> here

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
continuously and the first column here

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.360 
continuously and the first column here
happens<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.269> be<00:02:21.360> time<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.590> second<00:02:22.980> column

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
happens to be time and the second column

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.990 
happens to be time and the second column
is<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.360> EVM<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.379> terms<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.800> percentage<00:02:26.400> so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
is the EVM in terms of percentage so
