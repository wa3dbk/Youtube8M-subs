the Bluetooth onboard at the basis of

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
charging point this looks very quirky as

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.249 
charging point this looks very quirky as
does<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.490> charging<00:01:54.939> disk<00:01:55.179> if<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.780> plunk<00:01:56.079> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
does the charging disk if we plunk the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.499 
does the charging disk if we plunk the
charging<00:01:56.649> disk<00:01:56.889> down<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.609> background<00:01:58.030> we

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
charging disk down in the background we

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.499 
charging disk down in the background we
can<00:01:58.719> very<00:01:58.959> very<00:01:59.020> easily<00:01:59.229> place<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.340> space<00:02:00.819> 360

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
can very very easily place the space 360

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.169 
can very very easily place the space 360
on<00:02:01.630> top<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.020> lo<00:02:02.469> and<00:02:02.619> behold<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:03.189> is<00:02:03.249> charging

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
on top and lo and behold it is charging

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.040 
on top and lo and behold it is charging
charges<00:02:05.020> from<00:02:05.319> 0<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.920> full<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.579> 2<00:02:07.179> hours

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.109 
charges from 0 to full in 2 hours
we<00:02:08.679> like<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.069> option<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.520> charges<00:02:09.819> quicker

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
we like the option it charges quicker

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.270 
we like the option it charges quicker
than<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.390> micro<00:02:10.720> USB<00:02:11.230> port<00:02:11.260> would<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:11.890> yeah

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
than a micro USB port would so yeah

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.910 
than a micro USB port would so yeah
thumbs<00:02:12.700> up<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.390> solution<00:02:13.870> you've<00:02:14.500> also

can get other Bluetooth speakers that
have<00:03:02.290> more<00:03:02.890> bass<00:03:03.370> but<00:03:03.940> this<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.300> probably<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
have more bass but this is probably the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.570 
have more bass but this is probably the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
we've tested to date it's like we said

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.310 
we've tested to date it's like we said
there<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:09.850> brilliant<00:03:10.450> sound<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.960> brilliant

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
there for brilliant sound a brilliant

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.960 
there for brilliant sound a brilliant
look<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.650> feel<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.280> battery<00:03:12.640> life<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.880> gonna

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
look and feel the battery life is gonna

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.030 
look and feel the battery life is gonna
last<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.300> by<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.540> way<00:03:13.690> around<00:03:13.900> 6<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.350> 10<00:03:14.590> hours

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
last you by the way around 6 to 10 hours

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.410 
last you by the way around 6 to 10 hours
depending<00:03:15.490> on<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.610> volume<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.060> have<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.300> it's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
depending on the volume you have it it's

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300 
depending on the volume you have it it's
quoted<00:03:16.630> at<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.020> to<00:03:17.050> 14<00:03:17.740> hours<00:03:18.070> but<00:03:18.250> that's

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
quoted at up to 14 hours but that's

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.460 
quoted at up to 14 hours but that's
probably<00:03:18.550> if<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.300> use<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.630> on<00:03:19.750> lower<00:03:20.080> volume

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
probably if you use it on lower volume

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.990 
probably if you use it on lower volume
then<00:03:20.650> we<00:03:20.800> like<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.160> use<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.520> like<00:03:21.640> we<00:03:21.820> said

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
then we like to use it and like we said

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.150 
then we like to use it and like we said
max<00:03:22.510> volume<00:03:22.720> has<00:03:22.990> very<00:03:23.200> little<00:03:23.470> distortion<00:03:23.770> so
