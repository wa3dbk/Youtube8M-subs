forty<00:00:13.920> thousand<00:00:14.490> two<00:00:14.790> hundred<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.509> thirty

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
forty thousand two hundred and thirty

forty thousand two hundred and thirty
three<00:00:16.560> miles<00:00:17.660> which<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:19.550> past<00:00:20.550> forty<00:00:20.910> thousand

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
three miles which is past forty thousand

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.840 
three miles which is past forty thousand
I<00:00:21.570> didn't<00:00:22.109> even<00:00:22.230> get<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> turn<00:00:23.550> over

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
I didn't even get to see it turn over

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
I didn't even get to see it turn over
forty<00:00:24.180> thousand<00:00:24.630> sadly<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.400> don't<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.519> why<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
forty thousand sadly I don't know why I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.810 
forty thousand sadly I don't know why I
didn't<00:00:27.029> get<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> just<00:00:27.630> didn't<00:00:30.260> hmm<00:00:31.820> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
didn't get to but I just didn't hmm it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.440 
didn't get to but I just didn't hmm it
still<00:00:33.120> runs<00:00:33.450> good<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.790> still<00:00:35.790> got<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.120> same

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
still runs good it's still got that same

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450 
still runs good it's still got that same
belt<00:00:36.780> squeak<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.410> figured<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
belt squeak we figured out that it is a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.910 
belt squeak we figured out that it is a
tension<00:00:39.090> pulley<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.870> keeps<00:00:40.140> tension<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
tension pulley that keeps tension on the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.840 
tension pulley that keeps tension on the
belts<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.780> they<00:00:42.780> turn<00:00:43.110> through<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:43.890> through

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
belts as they turn through there through

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
belts as they turn through there through
the<00:00:44.969> entire<00:00:45.270> pulley<00:00:45.539> system<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.320> that's<00:00:46.829> all

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the entire pulley system it's that's all

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
the entire pulley system it's that's all
it<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.520> shouldn't<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.539> big<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it is which shouldn't be that big of a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
it is which shouldn't be that big of a
deal<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> replace<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.129> we've<00:00:50.520> also<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
deal to replace and we've also got to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.439 
deal to replace and we've also got to
get<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.800> windshield<00:00:52.800> washer<00:00:53.190> fluid<00:00:53.449> replace

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
get the windshield washer fluid replace

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.799 
get the windshield washer fluid replace
because<00:00:55.309> as<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.390> no<00:00:57.570> fluid

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
because as you can see there is no fluid

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
because as you can see there is no fluid
in<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:59.960> but<00:01:00.960> yeah<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.460> guess<00:01:02.460> I'll<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
in there but yeah I guess I'll kind of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.420 
in there but yeah I guess I'll kind of
do<00:01:03.239> sort<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.780> interior<00:01:04.199> critique<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.220> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
do sort of an interior critique on it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.010 
do sort of an interior critique on it
I've<00:01:05.880> never<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.450> done<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.820> always

except for over here but that's to fit

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.680 
except for over here but that's to fit
up<00:06:58.710> with<00:06:58.979> the<00:06:59.190> ceiling<00:06:59.610> so<00:06:59.910> I<00:06:59.970> can<00:07:00.150> flex<00:07:00.419> there

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
up with the ceiling so I can flex there

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.730 
up with the ceiling so I can flex there
and<00:07:01.320> it<00:07:01.380> does<00:07:01.530> have<00:07:01.710> these<00:07:01.830> little<00:07:03.740> slide-out

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740

extensions and it also swings around and

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.040 
extensions and it also swings around and
rotates<00:07:09.510> just<00:07:10.340> deal<00:07:11.340> like<00:07:11.460> that<00:07:11.490> I<00:07:11.970> guess

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
rotates just deal like that I guess

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.409 
rotates just deal like that I guess
and<00:07:13.590> here's<00:07:14.400> another<00:07:14.610> thing<00:07:14.970> that's<00:07:15.120> cheap

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
and here's another thing that's cheap
