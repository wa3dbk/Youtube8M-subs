00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 all fresh hunter irrigator my dear 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 I will say anchors and world fear and frustrated 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.130
 Kraft show how they kravets and work and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.590
 so anchors are necessary in order to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.690
 load chunks and when a player from these 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.450
 tanks leave then all the mechanisms in them 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 will work and so to make 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.289
 world anchor need obsidian 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 gold bar 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.949
 diamond and pearl ender further you 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.019
 you need to install it and for your 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.439
 works he needs pearl ender 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.620
 put the court pearl and 1 is enough for 12 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.210
 hours and it is real time 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.040
 maximum you can put 16 than 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 strangers 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 to see the area in which you downloaded 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 given anchor you need to use 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.860
 crawler points expose aura and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.270
 anchor and dress 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 You see here are such purple sparks 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.739
 this is just the area that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 loaded and all the mechanisms in this 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.739
 areas will work when you leave 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.489
 somewhere so press f9 to be 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.010
 more clearly and we rise up here we 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.770
 we see an area of 3 by 3 that is, here 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.610
 me chang where is the anchor and mending 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.610
 will tell sides 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 further where there is no purple from the city 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.650
 filling already downloaded and will not be so 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.119
 to remove these red lines here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 you need to press f9 and again so 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.200
 we go down next 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.050
 as personal or personal to 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.500
 it must be made obsidian gold 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.890
 ingot 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.630
 Emerald and ender pearls are his main 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.270
 difference from the world only that 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.580
 This anchor only works when 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.440
 you are on the server as soon as you are with 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.670
 this server came out then given ikar 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.610
 stops working it also works on 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.320
 Ender clicks can also be placed 16 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.020
 pearls max possible 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.660
 and also he works with one pearl 12 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.270
 real time clock in general everything 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.830
 the same except one thing that it works 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.130
 only when you are on 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.110
 server and there is another anchor this anchor 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.620
 admin 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.810
 This eco works constantly and for 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.209
 his work he does not require ender pearls 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.459
 that is, just install it and everything and he 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.280
 will load chunks and area 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:35.530
 loadable chunks will be the same 9 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.880
 chunks so give to my take away and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.920
 the following I haven't told you yet 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.920
 this world guardian to do it 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.160
 must obsidian gold bar 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.430
 and ender pearls this guardian allows 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.739
 you expand the work area and the world 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.560
 games or personal i'm korea or anchored 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.390
 admin in general any anchor when 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.390
 you need to install it on 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.260
 line with anchor if set 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.290
 Greta 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.780
 Not on one line, then work well, like this 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.209
 here I set the world anchor further 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.890
 I take the mount press the right button 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.890
 mouse and run to the anchor 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:21.500
 how I press everything I connected them if we 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.030
 let's go up so let's turn on f9 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.770
 then you will see the following that the work area 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.740
 which anchor she loads in the first place 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.900
 narrowed down we see these chunks are no longer 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.170
 are loading but such here appeared 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.240
 the line that is here in this line is all chunks 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.920
 loaded but on the sides there is nothing 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.480
 loaded 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.310
 at the same time you can connect one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.740
 anchor with only one world fear 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.020
 if you put the second world fear 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.090
 where is the thread here and try them 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.550
 connect they will connect but so 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:01.470
 to the guardians the connection will be broken let's it 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:05.760
 Now let's see 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.340
 one line to take mount and 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.470
 connect by the way who does not know she 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:17.820
 theft with the following iron 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:24.300
 ingots and red dye come back 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.730
 and connect both here and now we will see 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.080
 what purple sparks appeared 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:34.740
 and here they are gone here a little bit left 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.580
 all this zone is no longer working 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.120
 these are the zones 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.070
 they work well, that 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.410
