so<00:00:42.739> when<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.980> sugar<00:00:44.219> gliders<00:00:44.670> you're

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
so when you have sugar gliders you're

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.869 
so when you have sugar gliders you're
always<00:00:45.750> covered<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.350> scratches<00:00:46.649> unless<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
always covered in scratches unless you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.560 
always covered in scratches unless you
trim<00:00:48.780> their<00:00:48.960> nails<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> people<00:00:51.270> put

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
trim their nails a lot of people put

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.639 
trim their nails a lot of people put
like<00:00:51.930> sandpaper<00:00:52.550> inside<00:00:53.550> their<00:00:53.879> wheels<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
like sandpaper inside their wheels so it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.590 
like sandpaper inside their wheels so it
can<00:00:55.680> keep<00:00:56.250> their<00:00:56.430> nails<00:00:56.610> trimmed<00:00:56.730> down<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
can keep their nails trimmed down I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.360 
can keep their nails trimmed down I
don't<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.340> of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
don't have one I think it's kind of

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.639 
don't have one I think it's kind of
gross<00:00:59.780> because<00:01:00.780> their<00:01:00.899> poop<00:01:01.109> will<00:01:01.410> stay

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
gross because their poop will stay

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.100 
gross because their poop will stay
inside<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.579> wheel<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:03.960> just

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
inside the wheel with them and it's just

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.859 
inside the wheel with them and it's just
kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> gross<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.710> me<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.820> trimmed<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.720> on

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
kind of gross to me so I trimmed them on

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.780 
kind of gross to me so I trimmed them on
my<00:01:07.020> own<00:01:07.170> even<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> sandpaper

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
my own even if you do have a sandpaper

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.050 
my own even if you do have a sandpaper
insert<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.689> your<00:01:09.869> wheel<00:01:10.549> it<00:01:11.549> doesn't<00:01:11.939> replace

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
insert in your wheel it doesn't replace

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.469 
insert in your wheel it doesn't replace
having<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.960> trim<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:13.740> gliders<00:01:14.100> nails<00:01:14.479> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
having to trim your gliders nails it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.050 
having to trim your gliders nails it
just<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> keeps<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.710> sanded<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.159> till

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
just kind of keeps them sanded down till

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.690 
just kind of keeps them sanded down till
you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:18.930> done<00:01:19.170> maybe<00:01:19.740> prevents<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can get them done maybe prevents it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.370 
you can get them done maybe prevents it
from<00:01:20.790> having<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.479> done<00:01:21.979> more<00:01:22.979> often<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
from having to be done more often so the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100 
from having to be done more often so the
reason<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> chose<00:01:25.950> Coco<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.759> because<00:01:27.240> she<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
reason I chose Coco is because she is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.130 
reason I chose Coco is because she is
the<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.880> gets<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> most<00:01:30.360> stressed<00:01:30.930> out

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the one that gets the most stressed out

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.179 
the one that gets the most stressed out
whenever<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.680> trim<00:01:32.159> their<00:01:32.310> nails<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.810> use

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.200 
can be because she hates going in the
pouch<00:02:36.980> because<00:02:37.980> she<00:02:38.160> knows<00:02:38.340> what's<00:02:38.580> coming<00:02:38.670> so
