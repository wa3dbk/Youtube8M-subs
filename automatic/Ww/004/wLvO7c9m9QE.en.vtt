interesting

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.160 

usually<00:00:55.030> there<00:00:55.210> are<00:00:55.240> school<00:00:55.540> he's<00:00:55.720> more<00:00:55.960> easy

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
usually there are school he's more easy

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.750 
usually there are school he's more easy
but<00:00:56.410> opening<00:00:56.860> this<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.370> go

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
but opening this there we go

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.450 
but opening this there we go
it<00:01:04.600> looks<00:01:04.780> like<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.560> magnet<00:01:06.010> part<00:01:06.280> on

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
it looks like this is the magnet part on

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.710 
it looks like this is the magnet part on
this<00:01:06.610> thing<00:01:06.940> I<00:01:07.410> meet<00:01:08.410> my<00:01:08.590> best<00:01:08.860> play<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.600> you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720

this thing I meet my best play but you
try<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.050> out<00:01:16.500> yeah<00:01:17.500> that's<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.920> magnet<00:01:18.280> port

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.880 

and<00:01:25.500> light<00:01:25.710> off<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.310> dear<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:28.530> how<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and light off of it dear this how it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.640 
and light off of it dear this how it
works

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.240 

so<00:01:32.220> none<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> us<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.510> magnets<00:01:34.040> will<00:01:35.040> see

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so none of us like the magnets will see

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
so none of us like the magnets will see
which<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.670> take<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.330> take<00:01:36.479> off<00:01:36.690> the

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.550 
can take the cake in the backpack off
but<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.139> they've<00:02:50.129> screwed<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.849> on<00:02:51.000> there

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
but they they've screwed it on there

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.140 
but they they've screwed it on there
that's<00:02:52.560> highly<00:02:52.920> disappointing<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:53.879> these<00:02:53.969> are

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that's highly disappointing so these are

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.050 
that's highly disappointing so these are
the<00:02:54.239> useful<00:02:54.629> parts<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.139> can<00:02:55.230> get<00:02:55.349> out<00:02:55.439> of<00:02:55.590> it

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
the useful parts you can get out of it

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.709 
the useful parts you can get out of it
the<00:02:57.060> closest<00:02:58.129> Boba<00:02:59.129> Fett<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> think<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.480> is

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
the closest Boba Fett I think this is

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.170 
the closest Boba Fett I think this is
two<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.439> one<00:03:01.769> from<00:03:01.919> the<00:03:02.010> slave<00:03:02.579> one<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
two is the one from the slave one the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.319 
two is the one from the slave one the
third<00:03:03.389> slave<00:03:03.840> once<00:03:04.139> it<00:03:04.730> 1897<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.909> think<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.209> is

mirror image on most lines on this one

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.750 
mirror image on most lines on this one
this<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.819> from<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:24.409> desert<00:03:25.409> skiff<00:03:25.799> set<00:03:26.159> so

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
this is from the desert skiff set so

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.000 
this is from the desert skiff set so
totally<00:03:27.540> different<00:03:27.750> than<00:03:28.169> this<00:03:28.319> one<00:03:28.379> even<00:03:28.769> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
totally different than this one even the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.459 
totally different than this one even the
Cape<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> different<00:03:29.909> color<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:31.019> there's<00:03:31.349> no

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:31.469 
Cape is a different color so there's no

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.009 
Cape is a different color so there's no
match<00:03:31.680> there<00:03:32.040> but<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.669> one<00:03:32.969> appears<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.900> be

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
match there but this one appears to be

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.969 
match there but this one appears to be
from<00:03:34.409> or<00:03:35.310> has<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.000> same<00:03:36.239> pattern<00:03:36.750> same<00:03:37.680> leg

eight ninety eight zero nine seven so if

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.110 
eight ninety eight zero nine seven so if
you're<00:03:47.040> going<00:03:47.189> to<00:03:47.250> part<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.549> out<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:47.970> probably

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
you're going to part it out it probably

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.689 
you're going to part it out it probably
Star<00:03:48.900> Wars<00:03:49.169> or<00:03:49.650> sw2<00:03:50.639> 79<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:51.780> closest

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
Star Wars or sw2 79 is the closest

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.030 
Star Wars or sw2 79 is the closest
minifigure<00:03:53.699> you<00:03:54.109> break<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.259> down<00:03:55.409> to<00:03:55.620> parts

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
minifigure you break it down to parts

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.589 
minifigure you break it down to parts
like<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> legs<00:03:56.639> again<00:03:59.299> again<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.329> again

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
like the legs again again and again

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.429 
like the legs again again and again
obviously<00:04:01.590> different<00:04:02.040> than<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.519> hands<00:04:02.879> I

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
obviously different than the hands I

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.180 
obviously different than the hands I
couldn't<00:04:04.439> take<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.709> arms<00:04:05.069> off<00:04:05.250> too

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
couldn't take the arms off too

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.010 
couldn't take the arms off too
the<00:04:07.340> alarms<00:04:07.880> come<00:04:08.090> off<00:04:08.240> too<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.780> can<00:04:08.870> take

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
the alarms come off too so you can take

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.520 
the alarms come off too so you can take
the<00:04:09.140> arms<00:04:09.230> off<00:04:13.270> so<00:04:14.270> might<00:04:14.930> make<00:04:15.140> some<00:04:15.380> of<00:04:15.470> your

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the arms off so might make some of your

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.270 
the arms off so might make some of your
money<00:04:15.710> back

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
money back

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.780 
money back
but<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:16.940> really<00:04:17.480> don't<00:04:18.110> like<00:04:18.350> these<00:04:19.310> types<00:04:19.580> of

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
but I really don't like these types of

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.660 
but I really don't like these types of
me<00:04:20.030> figure<00:04:20.269> magnets<00:04:21.170> because<00:04:21.470> they<00:04:21.709> just<00:04:22.610> a

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
me figure magnets because they just a

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.370 
me figure magnets because they just a
waste<00:04:22.880> of<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.120> minifigure<00:04:23.660> did<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.050> ask<00:04:24.140> me

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
waste of the minifigure did you ask me

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.230 
waste of the minifigure did you ask me
all<00:04:24.790> right<00:04:25.790> here<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.240> is<00:04:26.590> compared<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:28.240> one

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
all right here it is compared to the one

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.210 
all right here it is compared to the one
that<00:04:29.360> comes<00:04:29.570> with<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.780> watch<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.590> watch<00:04:30.620> is

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
that comes with the watch the watch is

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.430 
that comes with the watch the watch is
set<00:04:31.580> eight<00:04:32.000> times<00:04:32.510> even<00:04:32.900> nine<00:04:33.080> zero<00:04:33.350> zero

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
set eight times even nine zero zero

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.080 
set eight times even nine zero zero

three three seven zero

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.900 
three three seven zero
it<00:04:35.390> looks<00:04:35.570> like<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:36.050> Star<00:04:36.530> Wars<00:04:36.560> or<00:04:37.280> SK<00:04:37.730> do

what

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.939 

so<00:05:07.560> there<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.830> go<00:05:08.009> so<00:05:09.050> there<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.229> have<00:05:10.259> it

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
so there you go so there you have it

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.779

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
look at the Star Wars magnet again I'm

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.670 
look at the Star Wars magnet again I'm
not<00:05:14.969> a<00:05:15.029> big<00:05:15.240> fan<00:05:15.479> of<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:15.719> magnets<00:05:16.139> in<00:05:16.289> fact<00:05:16.499> I

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
not a big fan of the magnets in fact I

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.200 
not a big fan of the magnets in fact I
don't<00:05:16.740> like<00:05:17.039> them<00:05:17.249> I<00:05:17.310> think<00:05:17.370> it's<00:05:17.669> a<00:05:17.759> waste<00:05:17.969> of

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
don't like them I think it's a waste of

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.360 
don't like them I think it's a waste of
a<00:05:18.330> perfectly<00:05:18.360> good<00:05:18.960> minifigure<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:19.979> thought

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
a perfectly good minifigure I thought

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.249 
a perfectly good minifigure I thought
I'd<00:05:20.490> show<00:05:20.669> it<00:05:20.699> to<00:05:20.879> you<00:05:21.029> so<00:05:21.449> you<00:05:21.479> can<00:05:21.719> see<00:05:21.930> how<00:05:22.080> it

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
I'd show it to you so you can see how it

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.890 
I'd show it to you so you can see how it
is<00:05:22.379> connected<00:05:23.039> to<00:05:23.069> the<00:05:23.520> actual<00:05:23.879> magnet<00:05:24.360> this

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
is connected to the actual magnet this

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.249 
is connected to the actual magnet this
one's<00:05:25.139> more<00:05:25.349> screwed<00:05:25.889> with<00:05:26.460> some<00:05:26.729> glue<00:05:27.259> so

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
one's more screwed with some glue so

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.439 
one's more screwed with some glue so
anyway<00:05:28.650> there<00:05:28.979> you<00:05:29.009> have<00:05:29.279> it<00:05:29.430> Boba<00:05:29.759> Fett<00:05:29.969> again

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
anyway there you have it Boba Fett again

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.140 
anyway there you have it Boba Fett again
that<00:05:30.749> is<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:31.319> eight<00:05:31.770> five<00:05:32.069> zero<00:05:32.430> six<00:05:32.729> four

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
that is it eight five zero six four

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.019 
that is it eight five zero six four
