waterfall<00:01:51.689> right<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.950> I'm<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.130> make

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
waterfall right here so I'm gonna make

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
waterfall right here so I'm gonna make
it<00:01:53.490> where<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.000> lights<00:01:54.210> coming<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it where the lights coming up to the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.100 
it where the lights coming up to the
waterfall<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.390> there's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
waterfall and then there's the there's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.920 
waterfall and then there's the there's
more<00:01:58.500> less<00:01:59.250> light<00:01:59.520> around<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.390> other<00:02:00.659> places

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
more less light around the other places

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020 
more less light around the other places
like<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.290> lake<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> mountainsides<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
like the lake and the mountainsides and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209 
like the lake and the mountainsides and
everything<00:02:03.420> else<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> once<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
everything else so once you do that and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.130 
everything else so once you do that and
you<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.030> how<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.509> want<00:02:06.780> you're<00:02:07.020> just

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you have it how you want you're just

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.559 
you have it how you want you're just
gonna<00:02:07.229> push<00:02:07.439> okay<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.060> then<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.330> give<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
gonna push okay and then just give it a

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.850 
gonna push okay and then just give it a
few<00:02:09.720> seconds<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> should<00:02:10.229> start<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
few seconds and it should start it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.110 
few seconds and it should start it
should<00:02:11.459> look<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.610> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
should look like this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.040 
should look like this
so<00:02:12.420> most<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.140> light<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.530> up

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
so most of the light is up

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.100 
so most of the light is up
by<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.800> waterfall<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.730> then<00:02:16.150> less<00:02:16.360> around

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
by the waterfall and then less around

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.650 
by the waterfall and then less around
the<00:02:17.200> sides<00:02:17.440> okay<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:19.030> we're<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.390> going<00:02:19.600> to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
the sides okay so we're just going to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.320 
the sides okay so we're just going to
quickly<00:02:19.840> go<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.560> gradient<00:02:20.860> map<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.490> then

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
quickly go to a gradient map and then

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.400 
quickly go to a gradient map and then
make<00:02:22.900> sure<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.590> darker<00:02:24.040> side<00:02:24.310> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
make sure that it's the darker side to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.520 
make sure that it's the darker side to
the<00:02:26.410> left<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.960> then<00:02:28.960> what<00:02:29.110> I'm<00:02:29.200> gonna<00:02:29.320> do<00:02:29.440> is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
the left and then what I'm gonna do is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.040 
the left and then what I'm gonna do is
actually<00:02:29.620> go<00:02:29.890> all<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.250> way<00:02:30.280> black<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.050> then

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
actually go all the way black and then

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.650 
actually go all the way black and then
make<00:02:32.200> sure<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.380> this<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.740> all<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.070> way<00:02:33.160> white

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
make sure that this is all the way white

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.020 
make sure that this is all the way white
yep<00:02:35.100> all<00:02:36.100> right<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.790> gonna<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:37.000> that

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
yep all right so I'm just gonna do that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.330 
yep all right so I'm just gonna do that
this<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.270> very<00:02:37.540> simple<00:02:37.900> see<00:02:38.830> see<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.010> makes

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
this is very simple see see that makes

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.580 
this is very simple see see that makes
it<00:02:39.490> look<00:02:39.640> very<00:02:39.850> nice<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.360> then<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.380> go<00:02:41.560> to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
it look very nice and then you go to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.530 
it look very nice and then you go to
overlay<00:02:42.340> now<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.060> all<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> matter<00:02:43.360> of

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
overlay now this is all a matter of

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.860 
overlay now this is all a matter of
opinion<00:02:44.550> okay<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:45.610> I'm<00:02:46.180> probably<00:02:46.540> gonna<00:02:46.720> do

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
opinion okay so I'm probably gonna do

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.320 
opinion okay so I'm probably gonna do
soft<00:02:47.140> light<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.500> then<00:02:48.130> I'm<00:02:48.730> gonna<00:02:48.940> bring<00:02:49.270> down

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
soft light and then I'm gonna bring down

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:57.090 
soft light and then I'm gonna bring down
the<00:02:49.930> opacity<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.550> tiny<00:02:51.790> bit<00:02:52.470> okay<00:02:56.100> all

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
the opacity just a tiny bit okay all

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.460 
the opacity just a tiny bit okay all
right<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:58.270> I'm<00:02:58.450> probably<00:02:58.570> bringing<00:02:58.900> down<00:02:59.260> to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
right so I'm probably bringing down to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.640 
right so I'm probably bringing down to
75<00:03:00.120> okay<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.840> now<00:03:01.960> it's<00:03:02.080> looking<00:03:02.320> really<00:03:02.470> nice

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
just find it real quick or and go to

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.910 
just find it real quick or and go to
distort<00:03:24.490> and<00:03:24.790> they're<00:03:25.540> gonna<00:03:25.660> go<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.920> diffuse

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
distort and they're gonna go to diffuse

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.330 
distort and they're gonna go to diffuse
glow<00:03:27.750> okay<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:29.830> another<00:03:30.010> quick<00:03:30.280> thing

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
alright so as you can see it doesn't

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.699 
alright so as you can see it doesn't
look<00:03:38.830> too<00:03:39.310> great<00:03:39.550> but<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.780> have<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.050> fit

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
look too great but you have to fit

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:42.900 
look too great but you have to fit
around<00:03:41.800> with<00:03:42.100> these<00:03:42.190> settings<00:03:42.250> right<00:03:42.850> here

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
around with these settings right here

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.390 
around with these settings right here
now<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.810> graininess<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.740> situation<00:03:45.310> I

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
now the graininess in this situation I

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.570 
now the graininess in this situation I
would<00:03:45.430> not<00:03:45.760> touch<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:48.280> really<00:03:48.459> just

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
would not touch it just it's really just

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.260 
would not touch it just it's really just
useless<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.390> this<00:03:50.050> sort<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.440> manipulation<00:03:51.270> so

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
useless and this sort of manipulation so

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.140 
useless and this sort of manipulation so
glow<00:03:52.780> amount<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.440> am<00:03:54.010> probably<00:03:54.550> gonna<00:03:54.790> put<00:03:55.030> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
glow amount I am probably gonna put the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.060 
glow amount I am probably gonna put the
20<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.170> then<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.070> clear<00:03:57.430> amount<00:03:58.890> I'm<00:03:59.890> gonna

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
20 and then the clear amount I'm gonna

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.980 
20 and then the clear amount I'm gonna
put<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.340> up<00:04:00.490> a<00:04:00.580> bit<00:04:00.959> too<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.780> lower

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
put it up a bit too so if you the lower

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.020 
put it up a bit too so if you the lower
the<00:04:05.200> clear<00:04:05.440> amount<00:04:05.650> pretty<00:04:06.010> much<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.790> wider

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the clear amount pretty much the wider

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.430 
the clear amount pretty much the wider
it<00:04:07.360> is<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:08.170> more<00:04:08.200> glow<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.100> so<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:11.200> can

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
it is and the more glow it is so you can

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.410 
it is and the more glow it is so you can
fiddle<00:04:11.650> around<00:04:11.800> with<00:04:12.070> it<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.610> your<00:04:12.760> liking<00:04:12.970> I'm

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
fiddle around with it to your liking I'm

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.170 
fiddle around with it to your liking I'm
probably<00:04:13.900> gonna<00:04:14.350> put<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.800> too

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
probably gonna put it too

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.719 
probably gonna put it too
probably<00:04:17.989> put<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.229> very<00:04:18.380> low<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.400> doesn't

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
probably put it very low so it doesn't

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.230 
probably put it very low so it doesn't
look<00:04:20.570> too<00:04:20.889> because<00:04:21.889> manipulation<00:04:22.759> needs<00:04:23.030> to

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
look too because manipulation needs to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.850 
look too because manipulation needs to
look<00:04:23.330> realistic<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.020> I'm<00:04:24.110> gonna<00:04:24.229> put<00:04:24.740> it

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
look realistic so I'm gonna put it

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.370 
look realistic so I'm gonna put it
pretty<00:04:25.039> high<00:04:25.280> so<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.240> doesn't<00:04:26.539> look<00:04:26.750> too<00:04:26.810> like

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
pretty high so it doesn't look too like

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.300 
pretty high so it doesn't look too like
non<00:04:27.590> realistic<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.889> can<00:04:30.979> fiddle<00:04:31.160> around

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
non realistic so you can fiddle around

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.700 
non realistic so you can fiddle around
with<00:04:31.460> this<00:04:31.669> just<00:04:32.150> your<00:04:32.300> liking<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:33.650> I'll

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
with this just your liking so I'll

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.370 
with this just your liking so I'll
probably<00:04:33.830> put<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.190> around<00:04:35.080> probably<00:04:36.080> around

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
probably put it around probably around

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.129 
probably put it around probably around
12<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.190> then<00:04:37.910> just<00:04:38.030> push<00:04:38.180> okay<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.960> then<00:04:39.080> I

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
12 and then just push okay and then I

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.810 
12 and then just push okay and then I
start<00:04:39.380> should<00:04:39.650> start<00:04:39.830> looking<00:04:39.889> like<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.220> now

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
start should start looking like that now

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.850 
start should start looking like that now

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.870 
ctrl Z and then just go back in and just
fiddle<00:04:45.680> around<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.130> settings<00:04:46.669> even

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880
