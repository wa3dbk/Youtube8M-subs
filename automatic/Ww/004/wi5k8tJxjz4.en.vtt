00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everyone, I'll try today 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.189
 change the left front window vents 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.309
 doors sealer why I will change it 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.000
 because my speaker goes numb 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.359
 water is due to the fact that here here 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 in this place here in this place 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:25.369
 seal that should not miss 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.300
 the water has now seen formed such 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 the gap for that I am on the market of course with 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.540
 difficulty but he found seals himself 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:43.399
 correctly called seal 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.520
 pivoting glass window left vaz door 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 2101 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 Well, I was told that it fits they 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.440
 happen right and left today today 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.300
 I will try 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 change what comes of it let's 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 look further so to change 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.960
 I had to remove the door window 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 remove the door glass itself 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.060
 and only after that remove itself 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.720
 I have already posted this video window 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.150
 can see the links to them will be in 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.369
 video description 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.720
 and the ventilator is removed here so it goes 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.110
 there is when the bottom of the glass 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.780
 Here is the window 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.780
 the outer part is the outer part 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.360
 I will now change the seal 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 window design 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.759
 done in such a way that in order to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 change this sealing gum 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:58.409
 and insert it in the middle instead of the one that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.090
 now you need to pull out 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.869
 the glass panes itself because here 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.830
 four it is mounted on one side and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:15.750
 here in this place here in this place 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:22.740
 that is, if it opens like this but 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:32.010
 I never opened it here 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:33.330
 it was riveted I scratched the rivet with emery 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.990
 pulled her 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.020
 and now I will endure myself 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:45.930
 sealing gum she is already very 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.330
 It feels like getting stuck there 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.950
 now consider the sealing itself 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:59.520
 gum here this part here this part 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:07.980
 will be inserted we are not here should 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:14.610
 ok log in and and here it is here 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.200
 And so I do not know well, in short, you can 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:24.709
 it was just to look normal 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:28.650
 pane and play on nothing 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:32.820
 we will finish by the way 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.300
 when it's here already 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.870
 button and in order here 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:45.260
 it turned out well you need to unscrew this one 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.260
 this is a screw 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.730
 that's already shot 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.650
 I think it seems that dress and 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.650
 I will be very long and painful 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.180
 Well, that's all sealing gum 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:35.470
 already changed mean about the rivet 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:39.200
 found a bolt seem to be 5 to 5 and 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.680
 I had to in the glass 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.500
 glass holder and drill a hole on 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:51.050
 5 because there is such an interesting bolt 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:55.900
 that here the window frame seems to be 6 a 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:06:01.250
 here for five days and then took a spun 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:04.690
 once riveted so that it was impossible to hide 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:08.300
 and a nut on this side on this side 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.140
 here was a cruciform figure 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.500
 took a screwdriver with sandpaper to 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.440
 it was impossible to hold a screwdriver for 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.050
 to twist 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.560
 that's all sealing rubber 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.050
 varied and now we collect everything in 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.640
 reverse order since and 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.590
 disassembled put the window and and 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.110
 change me there is a new velvet ribbon 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:42.230
 install glass here 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:46.340
 fasten me standing drive on 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:52.280
 I call it the central castle 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:56.810
