of course okay there we go so it's a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.429 
of course okay there we go so it's a
nine<00:01:21.119> by<00:01:21.240> nine<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> has<00:01:21.630> very<00:01:21.869> few<00:01:22.110> mines<00:01:22.290> and

nine by nine it has very few mines and
you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.740> only<00:01:22.890> got<00:01:23.009> ten<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.500> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
easiest way to go about this is to start

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
easiest way to go about this is to start
any<00:01:27.659> game<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.170> minesweeper<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> corners

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
any game of minesweeper in the corners

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
any game of minesweeper in the corners
and<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.150> typically<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and you can see that typically the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170 
and you can see that typically the
corners<00:01:31.500> don't<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.220> anything<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.880> them<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
corners don't have anything in them and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.090 
corners don't have anything in them and
of<00:01:33.270> course<00:01:33.509> there's<00:01:34.290> exceptions<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.920> this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
of course there's exceptions to this

an<00:01:41.100> older<00:01:41.400> version<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.909> game<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.500> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
an older version of this game and you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
an older version of this game and you
know<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.740> find<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> mines<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
know you can find the mines that way and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
know you can find the mines that way and
when<00:01:46.320> you've<00:01:46.439> accounted<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.100> seven<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
when you've accounted for all seven you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.010 
when you've accounted for all seven you
can<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.180> click<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.390> everything<00:01:48.689> that's<00:01:48.869> left

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
can just click on everything that's left

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.840 
can just click on everything that's left
over<00:01:49.229> obviously<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> you'll<00:01:50.460> win<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> game

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
over obviously and you'll win the game

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
over obviously and you'll win the game
so<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.790> that's<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> easiest<00:01:54.420> way<00:01:54.890> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so that's the that's the easiest way to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.510 
so that's the that's the easiest way to
get<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.610> good<00:01:56.850> start<00:01:57.060> achievement<00:01:58.490> savior<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
get the good start achievement savior of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.100 
get the good start achievement savior of
the<00:01:59.640> world<00:01:59.700> is<00:02:00.210> won<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> game<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.630> each<00:02:00.869> board

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the world is won a game on each board

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
the world is won a game on each board
size<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> would<00:02:02.310> need<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> complete<00:02:02.729> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
size so you would need to complete that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
size so you would need to complete that
same<00:02:03.180> process<00:02:03.630> through<00:02:04.170> easy<00:02:04.409> medium<00:02:04.979> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
same process through easy medium and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.980 
same process through easy medium and
expert

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.810 

so<00:02:09.080> for<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:09.950> achievement<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.580> need<00:02:10.760> to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
so for this achievement you need to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.280 
so for this achievement you need to
complete<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.120> minefield<00:02:11.510> for<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.960> first<00:02:12.140> time

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
complete a minefield for the first time

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.500 
complete a minefield for the first time
without<00:02:12.410> using<00:02:12.770> any<00:02:13.130> flags<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.270> obviously

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
without using any flags and so obviously

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.240 
without using any flags and so obviously
you<00:02:14.900> need<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.170> do<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.320> just<00:02:15.680> by<00:02:15.740> memory<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
you need to do that just by memory and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.710 
you need to do that just by memory and
perception<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:16.970> course<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.300> easiest<00:02:17.420> way

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
perception and of course the easiest way

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.900 
perception and of course the easiest way
to<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.960> that<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> go<00:02:19.220> back<00:02:19.370> into<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.670> easy

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
to do that is to go back into the easy

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.820 
to do that is to go back into the easy
mode<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:22.900> guess<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.050> should<00:02:24.260> have<00:02:24.350> started<00:02:24.590> a

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
mode and I guess I should have started a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.860 
mode and I guess I should have started a
new<00:02:24.980> game<00:02:26.170> let's<00:02:27.170> click<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.500> mine<00:02:27.740> oh<00:02:28.870> look

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
new game let's click on a mine oh look

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.810 
new game let's click on a mine oh look
and<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.050> got<00:02:30.200> an<00:02:30.350> in-game<00:02:30.740> metal<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.310> could<00:02:31.670> get

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
and I got an in-game metal you could get

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.330 
and I got an in-game metal you could get
a<00:02:31.850> lot<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:33.020> lot<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.650> metals<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.070> they<00:02:34.190> don't

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
a lot of a lot of metals but they don't

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.910 
a lot of a lot of metals but they don't
count<00:02:34.520> for<00:02:34.640> achievements<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:35.210> that's<00:02:35.450> just

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
count for achievements so that's just

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.320 
count for achievements so that's just
whether<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.160> want<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.460> do<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:37.850> not<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.270> you

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
whether you want to do it or not so you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.760 
whether you want to do it or not so you
can<00:02:38.540> either<00:02:38.630> hit<00:02:38.810> play<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.140> same<00:02:39.320> board<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
can either hit play the same board and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.070 
can either hit play the same board and
try<00:02:39.950> again<00:02:40.100> or<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:40.970> can<00:02:41.060> hit<00:02:41.210> new<00:02:41.420> games<00:02:41.690> so

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
try again or you can hit new games so

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.570 
try again or you can hit new games so
for<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.440> sake<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.620> argument<00:02:42.920> will<00:02:43.220> play<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
for the sake of argument will play the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.030 
for the sake of argument will play the
same<00:02:43.760> board<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:46.430> will<00:02:46.580> go<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:48.010> hopefully<00:02:49.010> I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
same board and we will go so hopefully I

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.560 
same board and we will go so hopefully I
can<00:02:49.250> get<00:02:49.430> through<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.760> without<00:02:50.060> triggering

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
can get through this without triggering

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.300 
can get through this without triggering
a<00:02:50.810> mine<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.350> guys<00:02:51.440> can<00:02:51.740> see<00:02:52.040> what<00:02:52.190> that

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
a mine and you guys can see what that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.540 
a mine and you guys can see what that
looks<00:02:52.370> like<00:02:53.890> because<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.400> other

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
looks like because in all of the other

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.770 
looks like because in all of the other
videos<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:55.970> I've<00:02:56.240> done<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:57.050> guys<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:58.120> i<00:02:59.120> had

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
just earned the achievements that i'd

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.470 
just earned the achievements that i'd
already<00:03:01.040> earned<00:03:01.340> previously<00:03:01.910> mostly<00:03:02.330> through

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
already earned previously mostly through

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.100 
already earned previously mostly through
the<00:03:02.570> beta<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:02.930> windows<00:03:03.320> 8<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.870> will<00:03:06.020> be

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
the beta of windows 8 so this will be

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.930 
the beta of windows 8 so this will be
the<00:03:06.230> first<00:03:06.440> time<00:03:06.770> if<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.070> can<00:03:07.220> pull<00:03:07.490> this<00:03:07.700> off

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
the first time if I can pull this off

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.850 
the first time if I can pull this off
that<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.840> guys<00:03:08.990> would<00:03:09.140> actually<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.590> able<00:03:09.650> to

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
that you guys would actually be able to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:18.100 
that you guys would actually be able to
see

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.770 

tada<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.280> there's<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.670> event<00:03:20.210> there's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
tada and there's the event there's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.410 
tada and there's the event there's
memory<00:03:21.020> 25<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.760> know<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.000> said<00:03:23.270> that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
memory 25 and you know like I said that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.710 
memory 25 and you know like I said that
it's<00:03:23.660> not<00:03:23.780> just<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.350> windows<00:03:25.070> 8<00:03:25.310> staying<00:03:25.760> in

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
it's not just a windows 8 staying in

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.380 
it's not just a windows 8 staying in
your<00:03:27.110> xbox<00:03:27.410> live<00:03:27.680> gamertag<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:28.490> so<00:03:29.090> if<00:03:29.240> you're

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
your xbox live gamertag and so if you're

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.760 
your xbox live gamertag and so if you're
on<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.570> Xbox<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.230> can<00:03:30.350> go<00:03:30.470> through<00:03:30.680> your

on the Xbox you can go through your
gamer<00:03:30.980> profile<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.880> you'll<00:03:32.030> see<00:03:32.300> that<00:03:32.330> those

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660

they'll<00:03:33.800> be<00:03:33.920> added<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.340> your<00:03:34.370> total<00:03:34.610> just<00:03:34.880> like

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
they'll be added to your total just like

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.250 
they'll be added to your total just like
everything<00:03:35.210> else<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:40.630> then<00:03:41.630> as<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.870> said<00:03:42.110> you

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
everything else and then as I said you

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.600 
everything else and then as I said you
know<00:03:42.380> savor<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.830> world<00:03:43.010> as<00:03:43.100> win<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> game<00:03:43.430> on

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
know savor the world as win a game on

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.660 
know savor the world as win a game on
each<00:03:43.730> board<00:03:43.970> size<00:03:44.240> so<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:45.830> know<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.370> lot<00:03:46.610> of

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
each board size so I know a lot of

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.180 
each board size so I know a lot of
people<00:03:47.380> whenever<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.530> first<00:03:48.740> started<00:03:49.040> out<00:03:49.160> I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
people whenever I first started out I

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.410 
people whenever I first started out I
basically<00:03:49.550> taught<00:03:49.910> myself<00:03:50.060> how<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.330> play

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
basically taught myself how to play

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.060 
basically taught myself how to play
minesweeper<00:03:50.690> by<00:03:51.110> myself<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.620> am<00:03:51.740> in<00:03:51.830> no<00:03:52.040> way

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
minesweeper by myself and I am in no way

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.390 
minesweeper by myself and I am in no way
an<00:03:52.550> expert<00:03:52.940> at<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.240> but<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.350> know<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:55.130> lot<00:03:55.340> of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
an expert at it but I know a lot of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.580 
an expert at it but I know a lot of
people<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:56.750> know<00:03:56.840> have<00:03:56.989> difficulty<00:03:57.470> even

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
people you know have difficulty even

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.320 
people you know have difficulty even
knowing<00:03:58.040> where<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.220> begin<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.910> as<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.270> said

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
knowing where to begin so as I said

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.290 
knowing where to begin so as I said
before<00:03:59.510> your<00:04:00.080> first<00:04:00.350> bet<00:04:00.680> your<00:04:01.670> best<00:04:01.970> bet

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
before your first bet your best bet

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.760 
before your first bet your best bet
rather<00:04:02.630> is<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.110> start<00:04:03.350> clicking<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.739> the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
rather is to start clicking in the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.990 
rather is to start clicking in the
corners<00:04:04.130> until<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.520> get<00:04:04.670> something<00:04:04.880> like

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
corners until you get something like

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.830 
corners until you get something like
this<00:04:05.920> even<00:04:06.920> this<00:04:07.070> down<00:04:07.250> here<00:04:07.489> would<00:04:07.610> work

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
this even this down here would work

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.210 
this even this down here would work
because<00:04:08.840> obviously<00:04:09.410> what<00:04:09.770> you're<00:04:09.890> looking

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
because obviously what you're looking

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.470 
because obviously what you're looking
for<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:12.800> squares<00:04:13.070> around<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.880> number

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
for is the the squares around a number

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.569 
for is the the squares around a number
so<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.260> this<00:04:15.380> case<00:04:15.560> this<00:04:15.830> one<00:04:16.070> is<00:04:16.100> an<00:04:16.310> example

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
so in this case this one is an example

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.930 
so in this case this one is an example
there<00:04:17.359> would<00:04:17.450> be<00:04:17.510> one<00:04:17.989> mine<00:04:18.260> in<00:04:18.709> these<00:04:19.370> squares

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
there would be one mine in these squares

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.510 
there would be one mine in these squares
sitting<00:04:20.660> around<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.079> since<00:04:21.859> there's<00:04:22.040> only<00:04:22.130> one

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
sitting around it since there's only one

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.550 
sitting around it since there's only one
square<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.090> even<00:04:23.360> touches<00:04:23.750> this<00:04:23.900> one<00:04:24.140> that

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
square that even touches this one that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.030 
square that even touches this one that
has<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.310> be<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.460> mine<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:25.970> as<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.240> result<00:04:26.479> if<00:04:27.110> this

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
has to be a mine and as a result if this

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.340 
has to be a mine and as a result if this
is<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.640> one<00:04:28.820> mind<00:04:29.090> surrounding<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.960> one

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
is the one mind surrounding this one

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.390 
is the one mind surrounding this one
this<00:04:31.190> cannot<00:04:32.350> physically<00:04:33.350> impossible<00:04:33.890> in

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
this cannot physically impossible in

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.700 
this cannot physically impossible in
possible<00:04:34.880> for<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.450> be<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.540> mine<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.590> can

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
possible for to be a mine so you can

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.320 
possible for to be a mine so you can
click<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:36.979> get<00:04:37.100> rid<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.520> from<00:04:38.120> there

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
click and get rid of it and from there

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.719 
click and get rid of it and from there
it<00:04:38.510> just<00:04:38.570> goes<00:04:38.930> on<00:04:39.140> this<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.890> mine<00:04:40.280> next<00:04:40.520> to

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
it just goes on this is the mine next to

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.240 
it just goes on this is the mine next to
this<00:04:40.850> one<00:04:41.120> these<00:04:41.570> two<00:04:41.900> cannot<00:04:42.200> be<00:04:42.260> but<00:04:43.130> now

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
this one these two cannot be but now

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.170 
this one these two cannot be but now
since<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.790> has<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:45.590> has<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:46.820> be<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:46.970> mine

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
since this has to it has to be a mine

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.890 
since this has to it has to be a mine
and<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.800> I'm<00:04:49.790> playing<00:04:50.060> this<00:04:50.180> on<00:04:50.300> expert<00:04:50.720> of

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
and and I'm playing this on expert of

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.940 
and and I'm playing this on expert of
course<00:04:51.080> because<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:51.410> can<00:04:51.530> get<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.650> lot<00:04:51.890> of

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
course because you can get a lot of

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.550 
course because you can get a lot of
bigger<00:04:52.220> numbers<00:04:52.580> like<00:04:52.880> these<00:04:53.090> fours<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.870> so

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
bigger numbers like these fours and so

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.190 
bigger numbers like these fours and so
this<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.860> one<00:04:55.070> particular<00:04:55.669> thing<00:04:55.700> where<00:04:56.240> if

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
this is one particular thing where if

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.560 
this is one particular thing where if
you<00:04:57.410> have<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.620> for<00:04:58.040> next<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.669> one<00:04:58.940> as<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.419> do

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
you have a for next to a one as you do

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.330 
you have a for next to a one as you do
here<00:04:59.960> but<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:00.290> have<00:05:00.440> all<00:05:00.680> three<00:05:00.979> of<00:05:01.100> these

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
here but you have all three of these

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.300 
here but you have all three of these
blocked<00:05:01.850> this<00:05:02.840> month<00:05:03.380> this<00:05:03.680> square<00:05:03.979> right

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
blocked this month this square right

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.330 
blocked this month this square right
here<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.940> absolutely<00:05:05.560> guaranteed<00:05:06.560> a<00:05:06.800> mine<00:05:07.070> and

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
here is absolutely guaranteed a mine and

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.120 
here is absolutely guaranteed a mine and
why<00:05:08.060> because<00:05:09.020> there's<00:05:09.260> no<00:05:09.470> way<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:09.890> these

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
why because there's no way that these

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.030 
why because there's no way that these
two<00:05:10.460> can<00:05:10.700> both<00:05:10.970> be<00:05:11.240> mines<00:05:11.510> or<00:05:11.870> this<00:05:12.140> one<00:05:12.500> would

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
two can both be mines or this one would

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.940 
two can both be mines or this one would
be<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.220> two<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:14.300> this<00:05:14.540> has<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.260> be<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.410> mine<00:05:15.680> and

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
be a two so this has to be the mine and

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.830 
be a two so this has to be the mine and
then<00:05:16.580> what<00:05:16.729> you're<00:05:16.850> left<00:05:17.030> with<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.270> trying<00:05:17.720> to

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
then what you're left with is trying to

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.380 
then what you're left with is trying to
determine<00:05:18.169> whether<00:05:19.070> or<00:05:19.160> not<00:05:19.340> you<00:05:20.060> know<00:05:20.180> which

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
determine whether or not you know which

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.180 
determine whether or not you know which
one<00:05:20.540> of<00:05:20.570> these<00:05:20.720> is<00:05:20.780> actually<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.380> mine<00:05:21.560> and

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
one of these is actually the mine and

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.340 
one of these is actually the mine and
we'll<00:05:23.060> play<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.300> little<00:05:23.479> bit<00:05:23.660> more<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.900> see<00:05:24.169> if

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
we'll play a little bit more to see if

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.600 
we'll play a little bit more to see if
there<00:05:24.710> see<00:05:25.100> if<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:25.280> can<00:05:25.400> unlock<00:05:27.220> or<00:05:28.220> I<00:05:28.280> guess<00:05:28.430> not

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
there see if I can unlock or I guess not

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.590 
there see if I can unlock or I guess not
on<00:05:28.760> log<00:05:28.970> that<00:05:29.180> discover<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:30.020> sec

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
on log that discover a sec

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.620 
on log that discover a sec
and<00:05:30.770> that<00:05:31.770> has<00:05:31.920> another<00:05:32.190> tip<00:05:32.580> in<00:05:32.760> it<00:05:32.850> that's

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
and that has another tip in it that's

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:46.880 
and that has another tip in it that's
really<00:05:33.990> easy<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:45.260> you<00:05:46.260> know<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:46.410> apologize

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
really easy and you know I apologize

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.000 
really easy and you know I apologize
that<00:05:46.920> this<00:05:47.040> is<00:05:47.250> boring<00:05:47.640> i'm<00:05:48.110> not<00:05:49.110> finding<00:05:49.560> one

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
that this is boring i'm not finding one

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:59.780 
that this is boring i'm not finding one
that<00:05:50.040> I<00:05:50.580> thought<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.060> would<00:05:51.180> find<00:05:56.930> and<00:05:58.460> now<00:05:59.460> I

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
that I thought I would find and now I

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.890 
that I thought I would find and now I
almost<00:06:00.090> might<00:06:00.360> be<00:06:00.480> stuck<00:06:00.840> oh<00:06:01.110> crap<00:06:02.810> like<00:06:03.810> I

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
almost might be stuck oh crap like I

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.720 
almost might be stuck oh crap like I
said<00:06:03.960> I<00:06:04.140> mean<00:06:04.320> if<00:06:04.710> you<00:06:04.950> guys<00:06:05.070> are<00:06:05.250> experts<00:06:05.490> at

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
said I mean if you guys are experts at

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.280 
said I mean if you guys are experts at
this<00:06:05.850> you<00:06:06.000> probably<00:06:06.120> know<00:06:06.510> exactly<00:06:07.020> what<00:06:07.170> to

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
this you probably know exactly what to

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.660 
this you probably know exactly what to
do<00:06:07.410> but

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.960 

you<00:06:11.670> know<00:06:11.760> I'm<00:06:11.970> not<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.780> I<00:06:13.080> can<00:06:13.400> slowly<00:06:14.400> like

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
you know I'm not so I can slowly like

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.880 
you know I'm not so I can slowly like
make<00:06:15.510> my<00:06:15.660> way<00:06:15.750> through<00:06:15.780> deductions<00:06:16.410> ah<00:06:18.560> but<00:06:19.560> i

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
make my way through deductions ah but i

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.980 
make my way through deductions ah but i
will<00:06:20.520> try<00:06:20.760> this<00:06:20.820> again<00:06:21.090> because<00:06:21.330> there<00:06:21.570> is<00:06:21.690> one

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
will try this again because there is one

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.260 
will try this again because there is one
that's<00:06:22.200> really<00:06:22.470> good<00:06:22.860> that's<00:06:23.040> a<00:06:23.220> sort<00:06:24.120> of<00:06:24.150> a

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
that's really good that's a sort of a

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.140 
that's really good that's a sort of a
foolproof<00:06:24.630> way<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.620> clear<00:06:26.370> out<00:06:26.490> squares<00:06:26.820> when

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
foolproof way to clear out squares when

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.790 
foolproof way to clear out squares when
you<00:06:27.240> find<00:06:27.450> them<00:06:27.570> in<00:06:27.720> bulk<00:06:27.960> I<00:06:30.440> just<00:06:31.440> need<00:06:31.650> to

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
you find them in bulk I just need to

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.670 
you find them in bulk I just need to
find<00:06:32.010> the<00:06:32.190> setup<00:06:32.460> ah<00:06:32.640> here<00:06:33.030> we<00:06:33.060> go<00:06:33.240> right<00:06:33.450> here

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
find the setup ah here we go right here

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.070 
find the setup ah here we go right here
when<00:06:34.680> you<00:06:34.740> have<00:06:34.860> a<00:06:34.890> 12<00:06:35.670> and<00:06:36.000> a<00:06:36.060> one<00:06:36.300> on<00:06:36.660> top<00:06:36.960> of

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
when you have a 12 and a one on top of

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.960 
when you have a 12 and a one on top of
each<00:06:37.170> other<00:06:37.290> and<00:06:37.560> this<00:06:37.680> is<00:06:37.800> another<00:06:38.040> sort<00:06:38.910> of

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
each other and this is another sort of

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.390 
each other and this is another sort of
situation<00:06:39.540> where<00:06:39.720> it's<00:06:40.220> inevitable<00:06:41.220> like

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
situation where it's inevitable like

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.340 
situation where it's inevitable like
it's<00:06:42.060> impossible<00:06:42.720> for<00:06:42.750> the<00:06:42.960> mines<00:06:43.110> to<00:06:43.320> be

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
it's impossible for the mines to be

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.730 
it's impossible for the mines to be
anywhere<00:06:43.710> else<00:06:44.480> unless<00:06:45.480> you've<00:06:46.230> created<00:06:46.470> I

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
anywhere else unless you've created I

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.320 
anywhere else unless you've created I
guess<00:06:46.920> your<00:06:47.100> own<00:06:47.220> custom<00:06:47.730> board<00:06:47.940> but<00:06:48.120> even

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
guess your own custom board but even

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.640 
guess your own custom board but even
then<00:06:48.480> the<00:06:48.630> numbers<00:06:48.900> like<00:06:49.200> they<00:06:49.350> would<00:06:49.440> have<00:06:49.560> to

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
then the numbers like they would have to

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.700 
then the numbers like they would have to
be<00:06:49.740> lying<00:06:50.060> so<00:06:51.060> if<00:06:51.210> you<00:06:51.300> see<00:06:51.420> a<00:06:51.450> 12<00:06:51.990> and<00:06:52.110> a<00:06:52.170> one<00:06:52.380> or

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
be lying so if you see a 12 and a one or

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.760 
be lying so if you see a 12 and a one or
even<00:06:52.950> let's<00:06:53.460> say<00:06:53.610> a<00:06:54.060> 12<00:06:55.050> and<00:06:55.170> a<00:06:55.230> one<00:06:55.380> right<00:06:55.530> here

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
even let's say a 12 and a one right here

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.250 
even let's say a 12 and a one right here
let's<00:06:55.920> say<00:06:56.130> this<00:06:56.280> one<00:06:56.520> was<00:06:56.790> there<00:06:56.970> it<00:06:57.260> works

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
let's say this one was there it works

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.600 
let's say this one was there it works
either<00:06:58.500> way<00:06:58.680> the<00:06:59.550> middle<00:07:01.010> the<00:07:02.010> middle<00:07:02.040> square

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
either way the middle the middle square

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.540 
either way the middle the middle square
here<00:07:03.000> will<00:07:03.180> always<00:07:03.419> be<00:07:03.540> blank<00:07:03.750> and<00:07:04.250> the<00:07:05.250> reason

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
here will always be blank and the reason

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.460 
here will always be blank and the reason
for<00:07:05.580> that<00:07:05.760> is<00:07:06.120> because<00:07:06.720> when<00:07:07.110> you<00:07:07.169> have<00:07:07.320> this

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
for that is because when you have this

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.000 
for that is because when you have this
one<00:07:08.300> it<00:07:09.300> can<00:07:09.540> only<00:07:09.600> have<00:07:09.900> one<00:07:09.930> mind<00:07:10.620> and<00:07:10.830> its

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
one it can only have one mind and its

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.820 
one it can only have one mind and its
entire<00:07:11.370> you<00:07:12.300> know<00:07:12.419> circle<00:07:13.110> around<00:07:13.320> it<00:07:13.530> so<00:07:13.800> it

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
entire you know circle around it so it

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.370 
entire you know circle around it so it
has<00:07:14.160> to<00:07:14.190> be<00:07:14.610> this<00:07:14.880> one<00:07:15.150> because<00:07:15.960> if<00:07:16.200> it<00:07:16.290> were

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
has to be this one because if it were

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.880 
has to be this one because if it were
this<00:07:17.480> then<00:07:18.480> there<00:07:18.630> would<00:07:18.750> be<00:07:18.780> no<00:07:18.960> way<00:07:19.470> for<00:07:19.500> this

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:19.890 
this then there would be no way for this

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.540 
this then there would be no way for this
to<00:07:20.600> to<00:07:21.600> have<00:07:21.750> two<00:07:22.050> around<00:07:22.380> it<00:07:22.590> without<00:07:23.190> one<00:07:23.520> of

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
to to have two around it without one of

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.870 
to to have two around it without one of
these<00:07:23.910> ones<00:07:24.480> also<00:07:24.810> having<00:07:25.710> to<00:07:25.830> a<00:07:25.860> rabbit<00:07:26.250> so

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 
these ones also having to a rabbit so

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.960 
these ones also having to a rabbit so
anytime<00:07:27.300> you<00:07:27.419> see<00:07:27.600> a<00:07:27.780> 12<00:07:28.560> and<00:07:28.830> a<00:07:28.890> one<00:07:29.130> in<00:07:29.430> a<00:07:29.729> row

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970 
anytime you see a 12 and a one in a row

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.460 
anytime you see a 12 and a one in a row
with<00:07:30.180> nothing<00:07:30.660> in<00:07:30.780> between<00:07:30.810> it<00:07:31.200> you<00:07:31.350> can

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
with nothing in between it you can

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.590 
with nothing in between it you can
always<00:07:31.650> know<00:07:32.010> that<00:07:32.040> this<00:07:32.280> middle<00:07:32.700> square<00:07:32.880> will

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:33.600 
always know that this middle square will

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.420 
always know that this middle square will
be<00:07:33.630> that<00:07:33.930> will<00:07:34.260> be<00:07:34.380> the<00:07:34.560> free<00:07:34.770> space<00:07:34.979> and<00:07:35.220> that

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
be that will be the free space and that

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.090 
be that will be the free space and that
these<00:07:35.640> to<00:07:35.970> our<00:07:36.000> minds<00:07:36.590> so<00:07:37.590> I<00:07:37.620> hope<00:07:37.740> that<00:07:37.830> makes

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.100 
these to our minds so I hope that makes

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.860 
these to our minds so I hope that makes
sense<00:07:38.190> and<00:07:38.580> I<00:07:38.640> hope<00:07:38.790> that<00:07:38.820> helps<00:07:39.000> you<00:07:39.300> guys<00:07:39.479> if

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
sense and I hope that helps you guys if

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.450
