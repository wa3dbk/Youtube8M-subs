00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 is 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.179
 It is an area with nutrition at Koshien 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.339
 During the frying 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.339
 Did you know that a lot of oil is made up? 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.269
 It depends on things 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.299
 25% oil is drawn from China 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.610
 In such a blue increase 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.740
 You can reduce the refreshing taste and calories 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.930
 But such bea can not speak easily 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.860
 there 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.020
 This waterproof m is the first developed in the industry 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 I want to make love cut long 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
 It's just fried 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.470
 I will do my best for this 38206 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.010
 This is an opportunity 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060
 Start 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.800
 Oh Maho Hirai has entered 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.630
 I say that I want to do my best this way by the end of the year 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.110
 1 at the end of 7-7 extension 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.110
 I do not cry 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.050
 I got it 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.050
 Everyone was able to defend in such a short time 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.030
 Mr. Kono is 115 grams 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.240
 As we entered 126 grams in front of the wheel, we cut 11 grams 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.400
 At 11 o'clock, oil is a plastic bottle cap 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.620
 I will come into 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.579
 From this shrimp fry 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.709
 I got domestic oil 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.269
 You will have eaten this together until now 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.539
 Then let's see the difference put on the fried paper 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.009
 It is one who is not made in this side Koshien 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.249
 I am pregnant like this 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.139
 Here we won to Koshien 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.719
 The new look has gone bad 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.089
 Let's take a look at 17 games 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.089
 The same cm is not processed 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.579
 This is 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.579
 It is one that we arranged in Koshien 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.479
 It's about getting on with it 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.029
 It was originally at our company 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.469
 It is the result of the questionnaire in the supermarket 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.090
 85% like refreshing and delicious 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.289
 It is said that I can not make it in time 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.779
 9% 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.060
 But it is not enough 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.060
 Well reduced by% 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.749
 This type will be like today 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:43.799
 It is very compact but it handles a lot of food such as the head 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.849
 By the way 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.049
 About 70% can be hosted by one in a month 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.449
 There are few other companies 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.449
 You can use work efficiently 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:02.159
 Since this machine is waiting, it has to be quick and individual 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.809
 It costs about 500 yen in a year 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:11.059
 Even if I have Totsuka 100 times a day to drive 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.039
 A role in one year 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.049
 20,000 units for 50 years 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.049
 It has become an energy saving design 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.729
 At Koshien, it is produced with hands on 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
 Durable and easy to clean 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.479
 I was at home 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.490
 I would like to receive this 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 People just want to build 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.550
 From the latter 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.849
 The idea of ​​reducing oil is considered unique to our company 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.840
 The future building is 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.410
 Believed to spread the belief that a healthy, fresh-tasting university 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.249
 Let me do it 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:58.180
 I think this is the first time to see such an opportunity 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.379
 This time 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.419
 Sorry for the brief explanation 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.370
 Please take a look at it once 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.370
 I would like you to realize this difference 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.340
 This time it is different every time you see the guidance of cm 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.340
 I was smart 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.889
 End 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.879
 on the other hand
