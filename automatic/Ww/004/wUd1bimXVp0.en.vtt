 No, I did not say I did not tell her, but I 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.190
 amazon that also has digital books 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.910
 but it avoids our goal here a little 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:20.150
 while amazon does not use the format and 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.280
 paba who then we will produce a 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.490
 format is pablo but this format is 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.740
 different from the format that is amazon 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.470
 uses a closed system where you do not 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.160
 you can have is you can not use this 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.169
 format and drool is not whether you download 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.699
 It gives a book but you will get in 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.770
 no other place while these other 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.610
 stores always use the same format 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:46.580
 which is the format and potato and what we are going 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:48.940
 learn to produce in our mini 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.940
