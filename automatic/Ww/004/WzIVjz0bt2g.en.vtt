00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Where does your journey end? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 You are looking for what could give you the right to wield. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 An expedition to regain the homeland and kill the dragon. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 BEYOND DARK 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Do not think I will not kill you, Dwarf! 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 When we allowed evil to become stronger than us? 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 This is not our fight. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 This is our fight! 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 What if it's a trap? 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It is without a doubt a trap. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 OUT OF THE SHADY 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 That is the nature of evil. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 After some time, all the nasty creatures will come out of their hiding places. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 THERE IS THE LARGEST THREATEN OF ALL THREATS 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 If you wake up this beast, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 you will destroy us all. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Was it an earthquake? 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 That, my boy, 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 there was a dragon. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 HOBBIT THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
