00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
we have it a domed cupcake in two

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.160 
we have it a domed cupcake in two
seconds<00:01:57.880> super<00:01:58.390> easy

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
seconds super easy

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.039 
seconds super easy
are<00:01:59.740> the<00:02:00.070> completed<00:02:00.490> cupcakes<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.360> much<00:02:01.600> prefer

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
them domed than flat top I think this
