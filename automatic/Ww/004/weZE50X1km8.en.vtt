let's<00:02:19.550> compare<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.670> previous<00:02:23.000> model

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
let's compare this to the previous model

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.850 
let's compare this to the previous model
so<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.330> previous<00:02:26.810> bonus<00:02:27.170> was<00:02:28.600> way<00:02:29.600> bigger

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
so the previous bonus was way bigger

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.980 
so the previous bonus was way bigger
right<00:02:30.860> what<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.760> loved<00:02:32.090> about<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.480> previous

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
right what I loved about the previous

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.470 
right what I loved about the previous
one<00:02:33.230> was<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.590> could<00:02:33.860> use<00:02:34.100> ordinary<00:02:34.850> batteries

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
one was I could use ordinary batteries

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.810 
one was I could use ordinary batteries
while<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.530> one<00:02:36.800> has<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> rechargeable

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
while this one has a rechargeable

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.260 
while this one has a rechargeable
battery<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.660> proprietary<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.000> but

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
battery a proprietary one so but but

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.910 
battery a proprietary one so but but
therefore<00:02:41.690> it's<00:02:41.840> way<00:02:41.990> smaller<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.680> feels

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
therefore it's way smaller it feels

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.360 
therefore it's way smaller it feels
better

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
better

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.080 
better
the<00:02:43.550> look<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:43.910> better<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.420> my<00:02:45.320> opinion<00:02:46.090> anyways

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the look is better in my opinion anyways

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.410 
the look is better in my opinion anyways
I<00:02:47.420> still<00:02:47.720> love<00:02:47.870> my<00:02:47.900> old<00:02:48.140> one<00:02:48.380> but<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:48.920> definitely
