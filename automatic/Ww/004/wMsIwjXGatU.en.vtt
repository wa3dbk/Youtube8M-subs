 hello and welcome to 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.700
 www.servigardes.fr in this video we 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.510
 let's introduce you to the new fire 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.750
 penetration t6 it's a fire with 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.000
 a finished shell it is there so 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.380
 two lights go up and synchronized with 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 this finishing shell that you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.329
 will allow a break on grille or 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.079
 bodywork by screw or not happened to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.520
 the back a silicone plate 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.700
 thus allowing to marry perfectly 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.350
 the curve of your bodywork 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.570
 these lights are mounted waterproof ip68 on 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.050
 uses the lenses and hulls of 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.960
 finish of our ramp impacts so 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.180
 very strong and resistant to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
 the rain to the humidity to the projections of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.000
 gravel is a model that you 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.960
 can use in 12 or 24 volts on 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.260
 cars trucks boats motorcycles also 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 so you can use this cable from 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.350
 synchronization for a connection of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.659
 several lights also possible left 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 right can be synchronized the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.070
 bundles of cables and therefore provides with 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.860
 five colors the blacks the reds and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
 the yellows to connect together the red 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.439
 and black being used for feeding the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.970
 yellow to control the modes 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.460
 you can thanks to the gray cable and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.460
 synchronized white left and right 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.500
 for this demonstration we put 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.330
 coast rapid round that you can

 its fires in the same category as 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.440
 ramps impact this is the same 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.720
 lenses a projection a power 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.640
 so maximum fires with 3 using 3 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:25.280
 watts is 18 watts sure it's this assembly 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.810
 a very strong shell 28 mm thick 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.500
 with a bundle of cables provided 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.390
 complete the connection you will be able to

 to do definitively or with fish 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.630
 lighter 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.630
 so it is not supplied with the kit 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.480
 the beam issiar tuned for

 the use of a single fire is simple 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:54.360
 the red and the black that correspond to the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.630
 positive 12 or 24 volts the mass on the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.480
 black and yellow allowing via the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.040
 positive to pass the different 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.040
 flashing modes 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.690
 you will be able to find its fires in 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.520
 blue in red in white and orange 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.050
 it is also possible to associate 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.980
 two colors in one and the same 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.959
 case you can see the power of 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.850
 these lights it's the same lenses 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.470
 that we have been using for a very long time 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.520
 on the ramps impact you 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.930
 certainly know our profile 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.780
 cigar lighter is provided with a pusher 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.400
 allowing the change of mode 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.250
 there are stroboscopic effects of 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.750
 fast flicker effects less 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:46.300
 quick flashes and you will be able 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.300
 use this on 12 Nov 24 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.370
 you will be able to realize 12 mode 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.520
 flash and so these sequences are 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.900
 controllable with the yellow cable so 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.910
 for final editing with a 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.270
 switch to feed via 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.100
 a positive red protection 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.650
 you can also pass a 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.609
 positive to feed the yellow cable 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.570
 via a push to change the modes 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.570
 also available in orange 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.880
 what we will appear to be 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.190
 color associations are in 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.180
 does my strobe effects that do not 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.570
 are not noticeable with 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.490
 registering this device and you 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.370

 red white 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.900
 you will see a little further 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.970
