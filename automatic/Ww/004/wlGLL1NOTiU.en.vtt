little higher up the foot pegs going to

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.419 
little higher up the foot pegs going to

be a little lower down and further

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.370 
be a little lower down and further

is a bit more forgiving now on something

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:02.940 
is a bit more forgiving now on something
like<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.720> dual<00:02:01.960> purpose<00:02:02.259> like<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.770> BMW

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
like a dual purpose like the BMW

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.249

upright you're going to be writing much

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.860 
upright you're going to be writing much
more<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.209> sit<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.660> day<00:02:13.690> in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
more like this you can sit all day in

more like this you can sit all day in
those<00:02:14.140> things<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.680> chew<00:02:14.950> up<00:02:15.069> miles

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
those things and just chew up miles

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.400 
those things and just chew up miles
they're<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.180> designs<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.840> chew<00:02:17.019> up<00:02:17.049> miles

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
they're really designs to chew up miles

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.809 
they're really designs to chew up miles
now<00:02:18.010> obviously<00:02:18.250> they're<00:02:18.549> not<00:02:18.580> really

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
now obviously they're not really

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.729 
now obviously they're not really
designed<00:02:19.269> for<00:02:19.600> carving<00:02:20.140> through<00:02:20.319> canyon

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.890 
designed for carving through canyon
roads<00:02:20.920> or<00:02:21.100> taking<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.489> track<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:22.030> people

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
roads or taking to the track but people

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.920 
roads or taking to the track but people
do<00:02:23.049> do<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.410> now<00:02:23.760> i<00:02:24.760> find<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> TL<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.780> be

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
do do it now i find the TL to be

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.560 
do do it now i find the TL to be
actually<00:02:26.320> quite<00:02:26.500> well<00:02:26.650> balanced<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.269> nice<00:02:28.269> wide

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
actually quite well balanced a nice wide

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.830 
actually quite well balanced a nice wide
saddle<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.140> offer<00:02:29.290> plenty<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.799> support<00:02:30.130> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
saddle to offer plenty of support and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.270 
saddle to offer plenty of support and
the<00:02:31.840> weight<00:02:32.260> distribution<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.860> pretty<00:02:33.040> good

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the weight distribution is pretty good

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.370 
the weight distribution is pretty good
so<00:02:33.459> they<00:02:33.549> even<00:02:33.760> at<00:02:33.850> low<00:02:33.970> speeds<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.989> not<00:02:35.230> too

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
so they even at low speeds it's not too

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.930 
so they even at low speeds it's not too
difficult<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.859> maneuver<00:02:36.280> through<00:02:36.430> city

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
difficult to maneuver through city

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.910 
difficult to maneuver through city
traffic<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.959> little<00:02:38.140> heavy<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.709> a

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
traffic it is a little heavy and a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.220 
traffic it is a little heavy and a
little<00:02:39.160> bulky<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.970> certain<00:02:40.660> situations

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
little bulky like certain situations

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.750 
little bulky like certain situations
like<00:02:41.410> kind<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.769> maneuvering<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.400> through<00:02:42.700> a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
like kind of maneuvering it through a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.110 
like kind of maneuvering it through a
parking<00:02:43.329> lot<00:02:44.040> trying<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.160> park<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.549> on<00:02:45.609> a<00:02:45.880> hill

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
parking lot trying to park it on a hill

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840 
parking lot trying to park it on a hill
so<00:02:46.420> things<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.489> overall<00:02:48.489> it's<00:02:48.820> pretty

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so things like that overall it's pretty

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.789 
so things like that overall it's pretty
well<00:02:49.150> balanced<00:02:49.450> bike<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:50.049> as<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.350> said<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:50.739> is

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
well balanced bike now as I said this is

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.160 
well balanced bike now as I said this is
a<00:02:50.920> sport<00:02:51.250> bike<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.880> riding<00:02:52.540> position<00:02:52.660> is

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
a sport bike so the riding position is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.560 
a sport bike so the riding position is
on<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> extreme<00:02:54.160> side<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.730> handlebars<00:02:55.239> are

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
on the extreme side the handlebars are

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.590 
on the extreme side the handlebars are
low<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.170> my<00:02:56.560> wrists<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.579> take<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.850> lot<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
low so my wrists do take a lot of the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.140 
low so my wrists do take a lot of the
weight<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.739> also<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.519> foot<00:03:00.700> pegs<00:03:00.880> are<00:03:01.000> quite

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
weight and also the foot pegs are quite

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.130 
weight and also the foot pegs are quite
high<00:03:01.359> so<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.959> means<00:03:02.310> calling<00:03:03.310> my<00:03:03.489> legs<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
high so it means calling my legs up and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.330 
high so it means calling my legs up and
for<00:03:05.140> someone<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.530> said<00:03:05.739> who<00:03:05.829> is<00:03:05.890> over<00:03:06.040> 40

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
for someone like I said who is over 40

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.470 
for someone like I said who is over 40
that<00:03:06.519> does<00:03:06.700> get<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.030> be<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.180> little

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
that does get to be a little

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.740 
that does get to be a little
uncomfortable<00:03:07.750> now<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.160> sport<00:03:09.760> tourer<00:03:10.060> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
uncomfortable now on a sport tourer the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.140 
uncomfortable now on a sport tourer the
foot<00:03:10.989> pegs<00:03:11.230> here<00:03:11.560> are<00:03:11.920> going<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.280> be<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.670> little

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
foot pegs here are going to be a little

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.060 
foot pegs here are going to be a little
further<00:03:13.540> forward<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.260> probably<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.739> little

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
further forward and probably a little

further forward and probably a little
lower<00:03:15.340> down<00:03:15.430> now<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.420> see<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.930> ground

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
lower down now as you can see the ground

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.620 
lower down now as you can see the ground

you do that then

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.350
