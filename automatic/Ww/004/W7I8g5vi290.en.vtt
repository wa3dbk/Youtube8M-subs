00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.199 
some of that knowledge on to some of
these<00:02:02.810> people<00:02:03.080> is<00:02:04.720> it's<00:02:05.720> perfect

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.660 

how<00:02:10.959> do<00:02:11.019> I've<00:02:11.260> been<00:02:11.439> doing<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.739> for<00:02:12.459> six

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
how do I've been doing this for six

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.220 
how do I've been doing this for six
seasons<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.629> I<00:02:13.659> think<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.079> only

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
seasons and I and I think that only

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
seasons and I and I think that only
gives<00:02:14.500> us<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.829> slight<00:02:15.159> advantage<00:02:15.370> meaning

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
gives us a slight advantage meaning

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.179 
gives us a slight advantage meaning
we've<00:02:16.659> learned<00:02:16.959> from<00:02:17.230> some<00:02:17.650> mistakes<00:02:18.010> that

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
we've learned from some mistakes that

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.339 
we've learned from some mistakes that
we've<00:02:18.340> made<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> past<00:02:18.840> that's<00:02:19.840> where<00:02:20.200> we

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
we've made in the past that's where we

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.080 
we've made in the past that's where we
might<00:02:20.590> have<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.280> little<00:02:21.519> bit<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.819> an<00:02:21.909> edge

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
might have just a little bit of an edge

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.210 
might have just a little bit of an edge
on<00:02:22.650> Gwen<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.890> Pharrell<00:02:24.459> but<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.799> also<00:02:26.799> thought

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
on Gwen and Pharrell but I also thought

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.429 
on Gwen and Pharrell but I also thought
we<00:02:27.400> would<00:02:27.579> have<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.909> an<00:02:28.480> advantage<00:02:28.989> over<00:02:29.170> them

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
we would have it an advantage over them

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.309 
we would have it an advantage over them
in<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.590> blinds<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.129> we<00:02:30.250> certainly<00:02:30.489> didn't<00:02:31.000> so

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
in the blinds and we certainly didn't so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.839 
in the blinds and we certainly didn't so
who<00:02:32.319> knows<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.799> may<00:02:32.980> come<00:02:33.189> into<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.549> thing

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
who knows they may come into this thing

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.059 
who knows they may come into this thing
ready<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.019> plan<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.890> going<00:02:35.950> to

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
ready and with a plan and it's going to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.789 
ready and with a plan and it's going to
work<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.540> after<00:02:37.870> six<00:02:38.319> seasons<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:40.379> do<00:02:41.379> think

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
work but after six seasons I do think

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.789 
work but after six seasons I do think
that<00:02:41.940> Adam<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.260> we've<00:02:44.260> proven<00:02:44.650> ourselves

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
that Adam and I we've proven ourselves

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.410 
that Adam and I we've proven ourselves
and<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.019> we've<00:02:47.019> both<00:02:47.230> won<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> show<00:02:47.889> and<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
and and we've both won the show and it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.119 
and and we've both won the show and it's
not<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.599> fluke<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.079> you<00:02:50.170> win<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.440> show<00:02:50.620> multiple

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
not a fluke if you win the show multiple

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.379 
not a fluke if you win the show multiple
times<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.549> know<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> got<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.269> right

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
times you know you got to have the right

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.910 
times you know you got to have the right
artist<00:02:52.720> but<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.930> also<00:02:53.109> got<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:53.440> make<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> lot<00:02:53.889> of

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
artist but you also got to make a lot of

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.050 
artist but you also got to make a lot of
a<00:02:54.159> lot<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.459> right<00:02:54.700> decisions<00:02:55.180> along<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.510> way

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.970 

I<00:03:00.090> feel<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.840> we<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> target<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.680> our<00:03:01.740> back

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
more so with me than even Adam because

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.040 
more so with me than even Adam because
