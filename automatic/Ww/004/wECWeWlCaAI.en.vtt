00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.000
 we start today with ours 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.230
 everyday tests this is about the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 family friendliness the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.950
 fitness for use of a vehicle 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 test the first vehicle that we 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.610
 want to look exactly is a mondeo 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.460
 tournament in this case, a two-liter 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.920
 diesel with 163 hp the loud manufacturer 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 despite the large volume only 4.9 liters 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.539
 Consume diesel at 100 kilometers 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.539
 should 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.300
 despite its size, the mondeo is very 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.000
 clear and easy 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.159
 He also has maneuvering 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.079
 Parking assistance and rear view camera on board 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.680
 become even the closest partners to 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.680
 child's play 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.360
 but not only a family suit 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.460
 be practical 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.770
 He should not have the budget 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.810
 too much strain without doing so 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.290
 the daily driving fun on the track 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.540
 remains 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.510
 At these scales Ford has 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.330
 apparently oriented in our rides 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.580
 we came to an average of just under 65 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.790
 liter for a two-liter with more than 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.920
 160 ps a decent value for 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.670
 driving enjoyment ensured among other things also the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.230
 company typical punishment suspension design 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.180
 Thanks to your feedback, you stayed for yourself 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.680
 at rapid travel speeds up 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.420
 the highway or fleets 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.280
 Stretching sections on the highway 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.740
 always lord of the action and before 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.150
 Surprises for sure 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 a combo is expected in front of everyone 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.930
 One thing ample trunk space 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.390
 this is what the ford mondeo tournament offers 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.340
 already in the standard one puts however the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.890
 Rear bench to reach a loading volume 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.890
 of up to 1740 liters 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 O 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.750
 Compared to the predecessor is at 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.680
 Mondeo tournament happens a lot and you 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.820
 gets a lot of car for the money 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.290
 his interior is neat 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.100
 processed and makes a solid 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.610
 impression 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.390
 even if details like fittings 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.860
 multifunction steering wheel or the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.930
 touchscreen certainly serves your purpose 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.709
 Nevertheless , we would have fulfilled something 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.030
 more pep and charm desired 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.140
 our test car was powered by 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.380
 a four cylinder 2 liter tdci with 163 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.820
 ps thanks to the 70 liter tank can be 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.130
 long-distance without annoying 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.050
 Stopovers plan the tour from 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.590
 hamburg to nuremberg for example and 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.209
 back is there without a tank stay in it 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.010
 we have the ford mondeo tournament as 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.450
 experienced real family vehicle 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.340
 He offers everything you need in everyday life 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.380
 needs a generous trunk space 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.580
 a lot of space for the passengers and the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.470
 driver and the passenger 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.840
 he is thrifty and affordable though 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.650
 you get the already under 25,000 euros 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.650
 as an entry-level model 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 OK
