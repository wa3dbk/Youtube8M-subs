00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
weighted stretching I was reading an

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.270 
weighted stretching I was reading an
article<00:00:49.940> earlier<00:00:50.780> this<00:00:51.050> week<00:00:51.350> on<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.800> topic

again that is link below and here's the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.709 
again that is link below and here's the
gist<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:57.079> story<00:00:57.730> there<00:00:58.730> was<00:00:59.030> some

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
gist of the story there was some

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.010 
gist of the story there was some
research<00:01:00.050> done<00:01:00.350> on<00:01:00.980> birds<00:01:01.879> where<00:01:02.809> they

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
research done on birds where they

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.079 
research done on birds where they
weighted<00:01:03.590> them<00:01:03.800> in<00:01:04.069> a<00:01:04.219> stretched<00:01:04.699> position

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
weighted them in a stretched position

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.209 
weighted them in a stretched position
and<00:01:05.780> this<00:01:06.619> resulted<00:01:07.369> in<00:01:07.609> a<00:01:07.869> 300%<00:01:08.869> increase<00:01:09.219> in

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
and this resulted in a 300% increase in

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.620 
and this resulted in a 300% increase in
muscle<00:01:11.209> size<00:01:11.719> now<00:01:12.679> because<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.670> this<00:01:14.209> study

many<00:02:22.010> possible<00:02:22.850> examples<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.720> obviously

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
many possible examples and obviously

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.710 
many possible examples and obviously
you'd<00:02:25.250> have<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.610> get<00:02:25.700> pretty<00:02:25.970> creative<00:02:26.210> in<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
you'd have to get pretty creative in the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.050 
you'd have to get pretty creative in the
weight<00:02:26.930> room<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.350> find<00:02:27.650> good<00:02:28.220> examples<00:02:28.910> or

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
weight room to find good examples or

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.630 
weight room to find good examples or
good<00:02:29.560> applications<00:02:30.560> yourself<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.460> that's

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
good applications yourself but that's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.540 
good applications yourself but that's
just<00:02:31.820> take<00:02:32.090> dumbbell<00:02:32.600> flyes<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.260> example<00:02:33.830> one

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
just take dumbbell flyes for example one

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.240 
just take dumbbell flyes for example one
possible<00:02:35.240> application<00:02:36.200> for<00:02:36.470> dumbbell<00:02:36.950> flyes

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
possible application for dumbbell flyes

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.600 
possible application for dumbbell flyes
or<00:02:37.520> for<00:02:38.210> an<00:02:38.330> extreme<00:02:38.780> weighted<00:02:39.770> chest<00:02:40.190> stretch

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
or for an extreme weighted chest stretch

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.410 
or for an extreme weighted chest stretch
would<00:02:41.300> be<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.960> to<00:02:42.740> do<00:02:42.980> your<00:02:43.520> dumbbell<00:02:44.030> flyes

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
would be to to do your dumbbell flyes

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.380 
would be to to do your dumbbell flyes
and<00:02:44.810> then<00:02:45.290> when<00:02:45.500> you're<00:02:45.680> done<00:02:45.950> with<00:02:46.820> your<00:02:46.850> set

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
the internet on this topic advocated

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.590 
the internet on this topic advocated
that<00:03:11.660> if<00:03:12.020> you're<00:03:12.200> going<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.710> try<00:03:13.040> this

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
that if you're going to try this

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.840 
that if you're going to try this
weighted<00:03:14.600> stretching<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.770> you<00:03:15.980> do<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.550> with

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
weighted stretching that you do so with

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.500 
weighted stretching that you do so with
a<00:03:17.060> weight<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.780> about<00:03:18.430> 10<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.610> 12<00:03:19.880> reps

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
a weight that is about 10 to 12 reps

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.150 
a weight that is about 10 to 12 reps
there's<00:03:21.110> something<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.500> can<00:03:21.650> perform<00:03:21.980> about

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
there's something you can perform about

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.930 
there's something you can perform about
10<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.760> 12<00:03:23.060> reps<00:03:23.300> whip<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.740> chest<00:03:25.070> example

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
10 to 12 reps whip so the chest example

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.040 
10 to 12 reps whip so the chest example
is<00:03:26.120> just<00:03:26.570> simply<00:03:27.410> one<00:03:27.740> example<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:29.720> do<00:03:29.900> it

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
is just simply one example you can do it

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.190 
is just simply one example you can do it
also<00:03:30.320> with<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:31.190> lat<00:03:31.550> exercise<00:03:32.360> when<00:03:33.020> you're

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
also with a lat exercise when you're

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.500 
also with a lat exercise when you're
stretching<00:03:33.590> your<00:03:33.800> lats<00:03:34.250> or<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.150> can<00:03:35.300> do<00:03:35.420> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
stretching your lats or you can do it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.480 
stretching your lats or you can do it
with<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.660> roll<00:03:35.990> or<00:03:36.230> machine<00:03:36.650> row<00:03:36.890> exercise

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
with a roll or machine row exercise

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.520 
with a roll or machine row exercise
where<00:03:37.760> you're<00:03:37.880> stretching<00:03:38.209> your<00:03:38.390> lats<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.410> you

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
where you're stretching your lats so you

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.320 
where you're stretching your lats so you
just<00:03:39.860> have<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.190> really<00:03:40.520> think<00:03:40.850> through<00:03:41.090> this

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
just have to really think through this

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.810 
just have to really think through this
and<00:03:41.600> think<00:03:42.230> how<00:03:42.470> could<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.770> possibly<00:03:43.010> apply

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
and think how could I possibly apply

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.320 
and think how could I possibly apply
this<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.570> gym<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:46.580> question<00:03:47.060> becomes

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
this in the gym so the question becomes

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.970 
this in the gym so the question becomes
there's<00:03:47.600> many<00:03:47.780> questions<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.350> come<00:03:48.709> out<00:03:48.950> of

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
there's many questions that come out of

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.850 
there's many questions that come out of
this<00:03:49.220> topic<00:03:49.760> do<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.420> do<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.870> on<00:03:51.050> every<00:03:51.290> set<00:03:51.680> is

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
this topic do I do this on every set is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.770 
this topic do I do this on every set is
it<00:03:52.010> worthwhile<00:03:52.220> trying<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:53.000> on<00:03:53.180> every<00:03:53.510> set

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
it worthwhile trying this on every set

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.650 
it worthwhile trying this on every set
how<00:03:54.230> effective<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.580> really<00:03:56.000> big<00:03:56.240> hairy<00:03:56.480> I'm

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
how effective is it really big hairy I'm

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.150 
how effective is it really big hairy I'm
going<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:56.959> when<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.260> comes<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.709> muscle

can do the same thing on row say you're

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.080 
can do the same thing on row say you're
doing<00:05:11.140> seated<00:05:11.560> cable<00:05:11.740> rows<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.640> could<00:05:12.790> let<00:05:13.000> it

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
doing seated cable rows you could let it

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.880 
doing seated cable rows you could let it
come<00:05:13.270> out<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.690> just<00:05:14.170> reach<00:05:14.380> that<00:05:14.650> good

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
your last set is done so that's how I

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.300 
your last set is done so that's how I
probably<00:05:22.630> try<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.080> implement<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.920> if<00:05:24.100> you're

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
probably try to implement it if you're

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.060 
probably try to implement it if you're
curious<00:05:24.550> about<00:05:25.420> extreme<00:05:25.930> stretching<00:05:26.470> now<00:05:27.010> the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
curious about extreme stretching now the

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.880 
curious about extreme stretching now the
question<00:05:27.550> becomes<00:05:27.850> is<00:05:28.230> this<00:05:29.230> going<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.680> make<00:05:29.830> a

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
question becomes is this going to make a

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.730 
question becomes is this going to make a
huge<00:05:30.250> amount<00:05:30.790> of<00:05:30.910> difference<00:05:31.330> in<00:05:31.480> my<00:05:32.080> opinion

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
huge amount of difference in my opinion

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.580 
huge amount of difference in my opinion
this<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:33.310> one<00:05:33.760> of<00:05:33.790> these<00:05:34.000> tools<00:05:34.480> that<00:05:34.900> might

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
this is one of these tools that might

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.770 
this is one of these tools that might
add<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.370> 1/2<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.870> 1%<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:39.460> your<00:05:40.000> muscle<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.660> the

add the 1/2 to 1% to your muscle to the

add the 1/2 to 1% to your muscle to the
muscle<00:05:41.170> building<00:05:41.470> process<00:05:41.740> I<00:05:42.340> don't<00:05:42.910> believe

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
muscle building process I don't believe

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.730

it's<00:05:43.540> a<00:05:43.780> game-changer<00:05:44.230> I<00:05:44.980> don't<00:05:45.610> believe<00:05:45.940> it

different<00:06:47.500> things<00:06:47.740> so<00:06:48.490> in<00:06:48.610> my<00:06:48.760> opinion

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
different things so in my opinion

different things so in my opinion
extreme<00:06:49.720> stretching<00:06:50.290> is<00:06:50.410> just<00:06:50.440> one<00:06:50.830> of<00:06:50.860> those

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
extreme stretching is just one of those

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.060 
extreme stretching is just one of those
