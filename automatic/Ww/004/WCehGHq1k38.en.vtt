00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello today I've been recording all day and 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.490
 I agreed that I had such an independent 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.580
 and I'm going to do all the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 things that I'm sitting on I'm sitting 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.949
 was an island because all things 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.949
 thrown around and on the floor that 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.880
 seems to burn a bulb ready 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.880
 for the giants 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 well this one I think this solution 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 of the sin of beauty because there is like 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.640
 that greed and gluttony laziness that is not 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.219
 more law like until the fifth but I'm going to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 start to see the old woman first 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.899
 so they can do the same thing that is a fret 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 super famous came out ready like that 7 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.640
 seen as a title I hope to educate is a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.649
 Maybe this does not say what is your 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.980
 cheapest beauty product what is the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.980
 more expensive 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.300
 I think the cheapest has to be 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.480
 like something from him and he is a brand that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.030
 sells things to a dollar and according to dollar 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.830
 cadivi in ​​exchange officers although yes 4 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.000
 bolivars here will never get anything 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.920
 4 bolivars and I bought a bronze 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.530
 he and one with a blush 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.750
 it's like an embarras blush you know like 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.330
 creamy but the item we liked a lot 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.659
 but other customs which is the most 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.659
 expensive 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.210
 I got the delicate makeup things 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.390
 I do not have many 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.980
 it's like spending almost 100 dollars something 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.290
 of example makeup I do not really know 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.190
 good but it would be one thing that I want 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.190
 buy but 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.770
 but what is the product probably 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.930
 be that if any brush that combines bracho 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.040
 of purchase here yes it cost me like 600 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.880
 bolivars then I believe that of 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.880
 make it more expensive because 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 yes because you know things with the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.830
 dollar purchases with change you get 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.330
 cheaper but if the comparability is 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.620
 which are more expensive and if I think that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.240
 it's a purchase brush that once 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.710
 because I wanted too much to unzip 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.590
 is that I want them that I want the end 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.050
 I was buying and damaged is damaged or is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.420
 that he uses it so much that he does not see it 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.980
 well and it got dirty the two paintbrushes 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.410
 It was a beauty product with which 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.120
 have a love-hate relationship 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.200
 I know that there is something that I 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.330
 I have a relationship has been emptied 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.340
 strongly out of hatred I even think that what 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.110
 It's good I do not really remember which 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.030
 is and I being afraid of this but it can be 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.560
 and it's the liquid eyeliner because I 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.180
 love of imp will be seems that a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.100
 little bit in the eyes really makes you 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.690
 as to highlight the eyes very much is 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.700
 very beautiful and apart prime 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.230
 because everyone is a little bit down but 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.720
 It was because the liquid eyeliner 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.060
 he always knows he runs sometimes that he's like 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.100
 you see there is not a gentleman told me so 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.690
 as there is is painted in the war 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.310
 because he is afraid liquid here and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.230
 it came out I never saw it but the medium that 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.760
 had and really was super unfriendly and 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.100
 sir he said is like gentle but said 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.540
 that and you know I do not know what blix gave him 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.630
 had to run everywhere is a 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.610
 annoyance and I do not know if it is that I have been 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.680
 very good but general does not work very 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.870
 Well it will be because I did not buy it brands 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.879
 to city but 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.160
 I do not know if it's a product you have to discuss 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.290
 to invest I do not know 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.860
 what are your most delicious products 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.030
 the super bowls of saiz are 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.910
 definitely gnaws them 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.940
 right now I do not have a nick cleaning part 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.040
 here I have it, too many ads 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.470
 rich that are sugar and you've made them 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.480
 cast and like 6 times because it 's 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.060
 plundering us the old expense are 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.950
 very good only the two companies that 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.400
 beauty product neglect because of 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.349
 laziness 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.989
 I do not know if this counts but I think that 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.329
 are the brushes because I do not know if 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.370
 the lakes and what clean and when some 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.040
 it's dirty I do not use it anymore but as I have 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.840
 many I say good I do not use this one but I use 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.939
 another that is equivalent say social and 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.129
 that other that is equivalent and really 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.319
 that after game I have to clean are 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.130
 so many that I loosen up afterwards are even more 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.590
 and you love me but then 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.600
 I feel that if I clean them when he does 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.830
 65 dirty would be much more bearable 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.140
 because nothing took me almost two minutes 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.730
 do it but I always have like 30 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.560
 then it 's a pain for me and I 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.730
 I would like to do a little more I do not know more 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.730
 be better 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.449
 Perez to pride that soon of them is 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.389
 confidence in yourself 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.279
 that is to a specific product but I 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.349
 I think everything like makeup that does not 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.870
 everything that creates confidence in yourself 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.729
 but since you do not have that you can not 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.490
 every day good that you wear all 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.839
 the days but if I do not understand the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.839
 days but I myself with what makeup 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:53.599
 daily so if the base and the correct 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.309
 and the mask like that makes you see a 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.479
 little bit beautiful and more to read and more 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.039
 awake is to say I think it makes you 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.780
 feel better and gives you more confidence in you 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.420
 same if I had to choose only one 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.120
 I would choose a concealer because 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.470
 it's like removing the letters with more more 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.820
 Expert also pass mask 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.020
 projectors big stories then 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.900
 that helped me out there 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.099
 to make pride lust what do you think 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.910
 which is the most attractive in beauty 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.910
 female good makeup 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.850
 I feel it is question all the year 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.390
 it is the most attractive the avenue that has 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.390
 different things 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.279
 that is, product of what I like what 

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:34.949
 I get it 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:37.379
 it seems to me that in make-up is that 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.909
 we depend a lot very much on the person 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.069
 but it seems that you put them smoked 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.030
 they are like something that is great for everyone 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.760
 world though 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.870
 what's up all that little music is the 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:53.050
 heladero and many videos that I 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.700
 it seems that the great eyes to 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.650
 most women and they look like their 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.280
 people and if you feel on your person you 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.280
 feel like 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.740
 and the question session on 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.120
 nvidia makeup that articulated and 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.120
 this is given to receive as a gift 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.060
 what later article if the colleague 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.060
 like there is an always wanted air 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.830
 but in any article I would like 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.259
 say it as a gift but there we will see 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.830
 the things that are as crazy as they are 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:31.750
 as 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.670
 it's not a red paint a right something 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.960
 you like things that are weird that 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.760
 they are different that are not achieved in 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.190
 everywhere I can make makeup 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.290
 a little different with them and not what 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.790
 common, not what you see in all 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.190
 makeups that serve smoked with 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.440
 brown or a natural makeup of days to 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.870
 Sometimes things seem super cool to me 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.640
 because it is only people I like 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.340
 and obviously they help everyone see 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.590
 a floor video yes but I liked doing 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.410
 weird things and things that are like 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.680
 colorful and I do not know that they are something 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:06.960
 different and I will lend myself and I would like 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.960
 give me those things because nobody 

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:12.599
 very fast good yes 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.229
 I just that will always happen will 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.229
 especially after all this 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:35.039
 yes
