00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
that have something to do with the

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.569 
that have something to do with the
temperature<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.140> an<00:00:25.259> RV<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
temperature in an RV could be the

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.740 
temperature in an RV could be the
temperature<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.149> air<00:00:27.270> conditioning

at places like Harbor Freight or a lot
of<00:00:46.350> auto<00:00:46.800> parts<00:00:47.190> stores<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.660> neat<00:00:48.810> thing

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
of auto parts stores and the neat thing

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720 
of auto parts stores and the neat thing
about<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.920> runs<00:00:50.130> on<00:00:50.310> a<00:00:50.340> couple<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
about this is it runs on a couple of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.790 
about this is it runs on a couple of
batteries<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.410> pull<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> trigger

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
batteries and when you pull the trigger

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.240 
batteries and when you pull the trigger
it<00:00:53.340> puts<00:00:54.240> out<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.450> laser<00:00:54.990> beam<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.980> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it puts out a laser beam that you that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010 
it puts out a laser beam that you that
you<00:00:56.370> use<00:00:56.490> for<00:00:56.700> aiming<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> it'll<00:00:57.540> read<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you use for aiming and it'll read the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.140 
you use for aiming and it'll read the
temperature<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.220> is<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.579> air

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
temperature now this is not for air

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.300 
temperature now this is not for air
temperature<00:01:00.810> but<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.320> surface<00:01:01.829> temperature

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
temperature but for surface temperature

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.060 
temperature but for surface temperature
but<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:03.000> okay<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.860> air

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
but that's okay because the air

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.639 
but that's okay because the air
temperature<00:01:05.790> around<00:01:06.479> something<00:01:07.259> will<00:01:07.409> help

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
temperature around something will help

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.149 
temperature around something will help
to<00:01:07.829> affect<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.770> surface<00:01:10.770> temperature

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to affect what the surface temperature

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.249 
to affect what the surface temperature
of<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.610> item<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.079> particular

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
of that item is so in this particular

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.930 
of that item is so in this particular
case<00:01:13.770> we'll<00:01:13.979> take<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.190> look<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.729> our<00:01:14.790> air

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
case we'll take a look here at our air

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.670 
case we'll take a look here at our air
conditioner<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.870> a<00:01:15.900> common<00:01:16.440> thing

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
conditioner and this is a common thing

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.380 
conditioner and this is a common thing
for<00:01:17.220> people<00:01:17.370> who<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:17.909> they're<00:01:18.030> having<00:01:18.210> a

the air conditioner so the first thing
that<00:01:35.940> you're<00:01:36.120> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.630> you're<00:01:36.780> going

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that you're going to do is you're going

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.160 
that you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> reading<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:38.190> at<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:39.170> inlet

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
to take a reading here at the inlet

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
to take a reading here at the inlet
where<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.770> filter<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.760> ceiling<00:01:41.970> and

where your filter is on the ceiling and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
where your filter is on the ceiling and
some<00:01:42.570> coaches<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.500> different

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
some coaches will have this in different

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.800 
some coaches will have this in different
places<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:45.119> want<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.330> see<00:01:45.540> what<00:01:45.690> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
places you want to see what the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.180 
places you want to see what the
temperature<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> air<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:47.100> the

temperature of the air going into the
air<00:01:47.310> conditioner<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.170> want<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
air conditioner is and then you want to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.260 
air conditioner is and then you want to
see<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.130> temperature<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.760> coming<00:01:50.970> out

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
see what the temperature is coming out

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.399 
see what the temperature is coming out
and<00:01:51.479> you're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.320> closest

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
and you're going to go to the closest

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.170 
and you're going to go to the closest
register<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.670> find<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.060> the
