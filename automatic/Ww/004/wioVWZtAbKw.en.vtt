00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
so like any game each item has its own

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.250 
so like any game each item has its own
value<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:34.970> in<00:00:35.060> path<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.360> Exile<00:00:35.720> if<00:00:35.900> you<00:00:35.990> sell<00:00:36.230> a

combination of items together you can

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.729 
combination of items together you can
get<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.390> better<00:00:38.600> payout<00:00:39.079> than<00:00:39.260> selling<00:00:39.620> them

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
get a better payout than selling them

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.680 
get a better payout than selling them
individually<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.120> most<00:00:41.329> basic

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
individually so it the most basic

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.479 
individually so it the most basic
example<00:00:41.810> of<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.380> is<00:00:42.560> actually<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.070> currency

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
example of this is actually the currency

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.490 
example of this is actually the currency
used<00:00:43.670> in<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.910> game<00:00:44.090> we<00:00:44.420> cover<00:00:44.629> this<00:00:44.840> a<00:00:44.870> basic

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
used in the game we cover this a basic

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.290 
used in the game we cover this a basic
level<00:00:45.649> in<00:00:45.890> our<00:00:45.949> last<00:00:46.160> video<00:00:46.370> but<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:46.969> want<00:00:47.210> to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
level in our last video but I want to

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.299 
level in our last video but I want to
dive<00:00:47.449> a<00:00:47.480> little<00:00:47.719> bit<00:00:47.899> deeper<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.350> time<00:00:48.410> so

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
dive a little bit deeper this time so

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.189 
dive a little bit deeper this time so
certain<00:00:49.850> items<00:00:50.180> are<00:00:50.300> used<00:00:50.539> as<00:00:50.719> currency<00:00:50.899> in

certain items are used as currency in
path<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.530> Exile<00:00:51.859> each<00:00:52.399> of<00:00:52.609> these<00:00:52.699> items<00:00:53.059> has<00:00:53.210> a

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
path of Exile each of these items has a

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.750 
path of Exile each of these items has a
value<00:00:53.600> compared<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.079> the<00:00:54.230> other<00:00:54.440> items<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.579> the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
value compared to the other items so the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.369 
value compared to the other items so the
baseline<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.300> currency<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.840> scroll<00:00:57.230> of

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.740 
portal scroll but if you sold her three
Scrolls<00:01:43.280> separately<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.180> wouldn't<00:01:44.479> get<00:01:44.600> one

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
Scrolls separately you wouldn't get one

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.990 
Scrolls separately you wouldn't get one
this<00:01:45.409> rule<00:01:45.710> applies<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.130> all<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.790> core

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
this rule applies to all of the core

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.730 
this rule applies to all of the core
currency<00:01:47.479> items<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.259> how<00:01:48.409> bender

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
currency items and this is how bender

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.249 
currency items and this is how bender
recipes<00:01:49.159> work<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.390> after<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.899> currency

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
recipes work so after the currency

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.929 
recipes work so after the currency
exchange<00:01:51.290> system<00:01:52.009> we<00:01:52.159> had<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.399> next<00:01:52.700> most

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
exchange system we had the next most

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.569 
exchange system we had the next most
basic<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.450> recipes<00:01:53.930> selling<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.860> single<00:01:55.100> item

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
basic of recipes selling a single item

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.179 
basic of recipes selling a single item
so<00:01:56.420> if<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.750> sell<00:01:56.960> an<00:01:57.079> unidentified<00:01:57.770> magic

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
so if you sell an unidentified magic

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.100 
so if you sell an unidentified magic
item<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.759> will<00:01:58.880> get<00:01:59.060> two<00:01:59.299> transmutation

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
item you will get two transmutation

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.800 
item you will get two transmutation
shards<00:02:00.560> set<00:02:01.219> a<00:02:01.250> rare<00:02:01.579> identified<00:02:02.299> item<00:02:02.630> and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
shards set a rare identified item and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.230 
shards set a rare identified item and
you'll<00:02:02.930> get<00:02:03.079> five<00:02:03.380> now<00:02:04.310> if<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.610> reveal<00:02:05.030> what

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
you'll get five now if you reveal what

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.639 
you'll get five now if you reveal what
that<00:02:05.360> item<00:02:05.689> has<00:02:05.840> on<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.200> with<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> score<00:02:06.619> of

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
that item has on it with a score of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.109 
that item has on it with a score of
wisdom<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:07.159> will<00:02:07.460> get<00:02:07.579> a<00:02:07.609> different<00:02:07.969> result

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
wisdom you will get a different result

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.420 
wisdom you will get a different result
so<00:02:08.930> for<00:02:09.140> example<00:02:09.560> if<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.710> have<00:02:09.830> an<00:02:09.920> item<00:02:10.070> as

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
so for example if you have an item as

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.980 
so for example if you have an item as
physical<00:02:11.000> damage<00:02:11.330> you'll<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.690> four

physical damage you'll get four
alteration<00:02:12.680> shards<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.060> an<00:02:14.150> item

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
alteration shards if you have an item

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.240 
alteration shards if you have an item
that<00:02:14.630> gave<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.960> maximum<00:02:15.410> value<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:15.770> plus

that gave you a maximum value of plus

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.920 
that gave you a maximum value of plus
physical<00:02:16.700> damage<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.510> would<00:02:17.690> sell<00:02:17.900> for

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
physical damage this would sell for

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.559 
physical damage this would sell for
seven<00:02:18.530> alteration<00:02:19.040> shards<00:02:19.489> most<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.420> your

when<00:03:03.810> you're<00:03:03.900> selling<00:03:04.140> items<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.860> by

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
when you're selling items is by

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.280 
when you're selling items is by
combining<00:03:05.220> them<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:05.910> specific<00:03:06.150> way<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
combining them in a specific way so the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.539 
combining them in a specific way so the
first<00:03:07.500> way<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.680> do<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.220> selling

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
first way to do this is selling

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.240 
first way to do this is selling
identified<00:03:09.120> items<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.840> same<00:03:10.049> name<00:03:10.349> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
identified items of the same name the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.250 
identified items of the same name the
next<00:03:11.549> way<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.880> straight<00:03:12.180> flush<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:13.080> is

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
next way is a straight flush this is

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410 
next way is a straight flush this is
selling<00:03:13.590> items<00:03:13.950> at<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.190> same<00:03:14.430> type<00:03:14.730> with<00:03:15.209> one
