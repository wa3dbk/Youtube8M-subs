00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.239 
website that I always use is Ebates and
I'm<00:01:18.569> not<00:01:18.810> sure<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.139> you've<00:01:19.289> heard<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.619> Ebates

I'm not sure if you've heard of Ebates
it<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.840> probably<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> coolest<00:01:22.170> thing<00:01:22.439> ever<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it is probably the coolest thing ever I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.889 
it is probably the coolest thing ever I
saw<00:01:23.789> someone<00:01:24.090> else<00:01:24.179> on<00:01:24.389> YouTube<00:01:24.719> talking

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
saw someone else on YouTube talking

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:25.910 
saw someone else on YouTube talking
about<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.679> there's<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.829> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
about it and so there's a little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.379 
about it and so there's a little
skeptical<00:01:26.399> at<00:01:26.459> first<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:26.759> basically<00:01:27.270> how

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:27.389 
skeptical at first because basically how

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:28.789 
skeptical at first because basically how
it<00:01:27.509> works<00:01:27.539> is<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.929> get<00:01:28.020> paid<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> shop<00:01:28.560> online

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it works is you get paid to shop online

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.089 
it works is you get paid to shop online

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
so I was like what but it totally is

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.010 
so I was like what but it totally is
real<00:01:32.369> basically<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.029> percentage<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.869> whatever

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
real basically my percentage of whatever

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.139
