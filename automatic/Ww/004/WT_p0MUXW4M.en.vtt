00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello guys let's learn that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.500
 plants need to live you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.240
 you agree that I have explained to you before 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.030
 the plants are living beings just like 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.400
 we, because they also need 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.260
 some things to live and most 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.670
 they are just like people like 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.670
 animals that is agreed by some 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 good air 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.010
 or soul knew what else there was 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.279
 water and one that does not sound so much like 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.600
 we agree as is the light of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.290
 agreement the plants need light air and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.300
 water to live according to part of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.340
 the food like all beings that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 all living beings but plants 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.559
 They mainly need light air and water 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
 to live where they receive everything 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.040
 where they no longer have mouths 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.470
 I really do not watch them light air 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:06.739
 they take it by the leaves very well and the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.739
 water where do you think he takes it for 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.300
 what was his name 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.810
 root worth 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.060
 the root take water through the leaves the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.580
 light and air and food where 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 do you think I am 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.369
 look for the root too 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.780
 the plants as they are planted as their 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.049
 name says they are on the ground they are 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.240
 still at the root they take the water and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.850
 other substances that are in the ground 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.119
 according to 500 organic that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 deposited on the ground by animals and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.399
 by products of other plants and 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.299
 different things that the plants agree 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.200
 those substances take that food from 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.729
 soil through the roots and serves 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.909
 any on any floor for 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.979
 feed a plant true not if 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.409
 we take a plant and put it 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.569
 above the marble floor that has the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.780
 dads in the kitchen because you will not be able to 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.429
 feed truth that the soil does not have 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.410
 that be formed at least the one that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.500
 they feed the plants according to 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.450
 Earth of agreement and remains of beings 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.129
 alive as they can be fruits that are 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.319
 have fallen from trees or even 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.930
 animals that have died and part of 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.060
 his body has already passed to the floor of 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.150
 agreement that soil yes that is good for 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.130
 plants the soil that is stone or 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.290
 the soil that is sandy is not good 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.900
 for the plants agree because there 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.829
 it has no nutrients 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.069
 correct we summarize and remember the 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.019
 Plants need light and air among others 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.269
 things to live light and air the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.360
 receive or feed on them by 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.269
 leaves the plants also need water 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.730
 and other substances in the water and other 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.609
 substances take them by the roots and the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.620
 root are on the ground and the soil we 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.560
 serves any one has to be a 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.019
 soil made of land according to where 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.069
 have passed living beings as that is 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.069
 all guys see you soon
