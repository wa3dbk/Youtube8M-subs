00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
and that wasn't there and so I thought

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.020

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
we were a little impatient down the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.290 
we were a little impatient down the
stretch<00:00:58.300> but<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:59.020> know<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:01.149> there<00:01:01.270> a

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
difference in the first half of the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.710 
difference in the first half of the
second<00:01:02.829> half<00:01:02.949> what<00:01:03.789> guys<00:01:04.089> were<00:01:04.239> able<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.509> do

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720

more<00:01:26.740> in<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:26.920> attack<00:01:27.190> mode<00:01:27.430> I<00:01:28.150> thought<00:01:29.080> that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
more in the attack mode I thought that

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.230

you<00:01:29.890> know<00:01:30.160> we<00:01:30.250> did<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.430> good<00:01:30.550> job<00:01:30.610> with<00:01:30.790> inside

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
you know we did a good job with inside

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.210 
you know we did a good job with inside
outside<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:32.080> know<00:01:32.200> we<00:01:32.320> just<00:01:32.440> just<00:01:33.100> said

knock down shots you know but I felt

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.590 
knock down shots you know but I felt
like<00:01:35.740> we<00:01:35.890> competed<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.490> lot<00:01:36.670> more<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.240> we

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
like we competed a lot more and we

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.870 
like we competed a lot more and we
