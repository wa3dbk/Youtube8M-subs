00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.000
 these are peculiar you would not understand 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 we explain 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.950
 Y 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.200
 ah 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.540
 Y 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 the sensuality of a little encounter 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.200
 common where passion is transformed into 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.360
 sadomasochism these are scenes of 50 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.790
 shades of gray that at its premiere has 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.730
 broken box office records raising more 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.830
 of 158 million dollars in the world 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.670
 in the equator already have seen it around 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.100
 of 250 thousand people but what is it that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 makes so many people want to see it by the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.460
 mystery that has many used 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 masochism I think that is what many 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.290
 we think and we do not say it I think it's very 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.600
 easy to read because it hooks you 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.310
 book is something that here in player like 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.840
 that it has a lot selling one but to the 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.610
 final is in real because all the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.350
 women, we are interested in knowing what 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.930
 to go where it's going to go if it's just a 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.720
 fairytale and ends or really 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.160
 it can be something our real something its fame 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.830
 it's partly due to the great campaign 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.350
 media and the success in sales of the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.450
 best-selling trilogy 50 shades of gray 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.940
 from the British author 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.380
 Languages 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 and has sold more than 100 million 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.970
 copies many critics assure that the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.130
 book is poorly written and that the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.439
 movie is not well achieved but the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 major criticism focuses on the subject 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.149
 Mr. Greg will receive it now 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.549
 love story between a university 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.649
 Anastasia and a young and handsome tycoon 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.689
 cristian grade develops in a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.149
 series of sexual encounters that 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.920
 they become increasingly aggressive until 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.830
 come to the proposal to have a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.360
 sadomasochistic relationship the subject has 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 caused all kinds of criticism 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.940
 favorable and unfavorable for the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.800
 scenes of strong sex and abuse if there 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.770
 a certain touch of violence I think 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.930
 and this movie wakes us up 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.240
 senses and other ways of seeing the part 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.980
 sexual is a subject of both sexes is a 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.350
 male-female domain issue if not 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.970
 can be from woman to men and that in 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.830
 reality is not defined by just one theme 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.880
 of machismo is a subject of mental dominance 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.500
 and point can be quite intimidating 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.620
 but you can also open a lot 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.810
 mind in blogs the discussion is heated 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.420
 with opinions divided how many 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.370
 mediocrity all foreseeable with a 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.680
 Cinderella and the prince who teaches him 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.430
 the paths of eroticism and step those of 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.650
 submission a success of who do not believe 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.690
 that it's porn for moms is just something 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.990
 what we usually write or 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.510
 to read celebrities like madonna say 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.640
 that it's about cheap literature is not 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.550
 very attractive says maybe for some 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.290
 who have not had sex before while 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.660
 which is also in the field of studies 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.090
 of women's health journal who 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.460
 they compare specific parts of the book and 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.740
 whole dialogues with patients who 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.950
 have suffered from sexual abuse 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.230
 You should stay away from me 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.209
 I'm not the man for you for the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.069
 teresa psychologist erases the subject more 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.640
 important that the book and the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.950
 movie is sexual abuse no one takes 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.629
 in consideration that this movie has 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.480
 to see quite a lot also with abuse 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:31.280
 sexual abuse with children and with 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.940
 consequences is so so 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.700
 so concentrated in the erotic part 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.319
 sadomasochist male-female relationship 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.870
 submission that they can not see that other 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.569
 part and that surprised me and is that 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.270
 the sexual affirms teresa borja opaque to a 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.610
 made much more important and serious the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.819
 that the main character of the work 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.640
 was the victim of child sexual abuse on 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.470
 deep that is in between is a 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:04.220
 man who was a battered child 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.370
 abandoned and sexually abused and that 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.560
 in his adult age in front of these 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.180
 traumatic experiences has a 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.430
 important inability to surrender 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.959
 affective way of having a sexuality 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.820
 healthy product of a whole process 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.210
 mistreat him 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.970
 this is what can happen to a person 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.920
 sexually abused is exactly what 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.230
 What can happen to you depending on the 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.300
 eyes that look at this movie and the 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.250
 Reading the book could also 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.990
 make us understand other realities 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.050
 as the reason for a violent relationship 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.480
 and sadomasochism is clearly a 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.230
 association of sexuality with a whole 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.680
 abusive process an associated sexuality 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.949
 with discomfort pain 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.100
 and imposition comes from experiences 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.130
 abusive sexual experiences 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:07.810
 where the pain discomfort the 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.509
 lack of control has been the format in 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.400
 the one that starts despite being a 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.220
 story about the girl you are looking for 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.440
 fall in love with Prince Charming 50 shades of 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.250
 gray reveals a reality very different from 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:25.560
 ideally not all men nor all 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:30.910
 we women are kind protectors 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.910
 affectionate healthy that people in a 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.330
 important proportion have traumas 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.970
 they have difficulties they have dysfunctions 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.680
 sexual abuse is a subject that has 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.620
 consequences that affect all the 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.960
 society and is according to Teresa borja a 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.950
 alarming reality that sexual abuse 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.170
 is 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.050
 and it's a real problem that I just now 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.030
 I'm with research in this area and 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.450
 I have 13 percent of the boys 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.930
 males have been sexually abused and 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:06.050
 if the woman is a participant in this abuse 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.120
 sexual in men the 50 shades of 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.790
 gray they reveal us much more than their 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.130
 controversial scenes seem to provoke 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.650
 next time you watch a movie or 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.020
 read a book think about looking for a reason 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.480
 deeper than you can portray a 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.920
 reality hidden in the shadows and that 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.920
 it needs to be illuminated
