through this example with a simple

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.649 
through this example with a simple
calculator<00:01:01.989> our<00:01:02.800> boat<00:01:03.129> length<00:01:03.399> is<00:01:03.640> 36<00:01:04.570> feet

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
calculator our boat length is 36 feet

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.990 
calculator our boat length is 36 feet
and<00:01:05.199> we've<00:01:05.890> determined<00:01:06.189> in<00:01:06.430> an<00:01:06.520> anchor<00:01:06.820> road

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
and we've determined in an anchor road

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.440 
and we've determined in an anchor road
length<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.630> 100<00:01:08.590> feet<00:01:08.950> we'll<00:01:09.759> be<00:01:09.880> anchoring<00:01:10.299> in

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
length of 100 feet we'll be anchoring in

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.749 
length of 100 feet we'll be anchoring in
10<00:01:10.720> feet<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.080> water<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.710> our<00:01:11.890> bow<00:01:12.070> freeboard

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
10 feet of water and our bow freeboard

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.800 
10 feet of water and our bow freeboard
is<00:01:13.030> 4<00:01:13.750> feet<00:01:14.189> first<00:01:15.189> we<00:01:15.369> want<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.759> square<00:01:16.420> the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
is 4 feet first we want to square the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.010 
is 4 feet first we want to square the
anchor<00:01:17.200> road<00:01:17.439> so<00:01:18.130> we<00:01:18.280> multiply<00:01:18.479> 100<00:01:19.479> times<00:01:19.720> 100

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
anchor road so we multiply 100 times 100

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.609 
anchor road so we multiply 100 times 100
and<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.860> gives<00:01:21.100> 10,000<00:01:22.170> next<00:01:23.170> we<00:01:23.320> want<00:01:23.530> to

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
and this gives 10,000 next we want to

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.880 
and this gives 10,000 next we want to
add<00:01:24.040> our<00:01:24.610> depth<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.450> water<00:01:25.720> plus<00:01:26.259> free<00:01:26.650> board

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
add our depth of water plus free board

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.999 
add our depth of water plus free board
which<00:01:27.549> gives<00:01:27.850> 14<00:01:28.420> feet<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.079> square<00:01:29.799> this

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
which gives 14 feet and square this

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.870 
which gives 14 feet and square this
factor<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:31.479> multiply<00:01:31.960> 14<00:01:32.530> times<00:01:32.860> 14<00:01:33.220> which

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
factor we multiply 14 times 14 which

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.440 
factor we multiply 14 times 14 which
gives<00:01:34.500> 196<00:01:36.119> subtract<00:01:37.439> 196<00:01:38.439> from<00:01:38.740> 10,000<00:01:39.700> which

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
gives 196 subtract 196 from 10,000 which

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.490 
gives 196 subtract 196 from 10,000 which
gives<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.869> factor<00:01:41.259> of<00:01:41.820> 9800<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:42.939> for<00:01:43.380> find<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
gives a factor of 9800 and for find the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.200 
gives a factor of 9800 and for find the
square<00:01:44.829> root<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:45.750> 9,800<00:01:46.750> 4<00:01:47.439> which<00:01:48.009> gives<00:01:48.210> 99

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
square root of 9,800 4 which gives 99
