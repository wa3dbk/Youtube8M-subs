00:00:04.778 --> 00:00:07.778
Hello! This is my second TAS of Crazy Castle. Please watch the first one for more details.

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:11.456
The sequence of the levels via password is wrong, so I begin at S3.

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:19.293
I start moving right to manipulate the red Sylvester out of the way.

00:00:33.697 --> 00:00:36.697
This level has a lot of enemies with little opportunities to manipulate them, so I take a roundabout path.

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:44.035
I turn around here to keep the red Sylvester walking forward. This actually doesn't waste any time.

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:47.696
For entertainment value, I dodge these enemies at exactly the right frames.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
The broken sequence is S3 -&gt; S2 -&gt; S4 -&gt; S1.

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.004
I don't press anything here to manipulate the red Yosemite Sam below.

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:16.598
It seems like every red enemy will pause if you don't press anything.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.319
I have to wait here for a while so that the green Sylvester will go back up the stairs.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:30.725
With a small amount of luck manipulation, the rest of this level is trivial.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:04.187
The right tube is faster than the left.

00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:10.277
Although I have to pause here, going through this block is a lot faster than using two tubes.

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:44.204
Yet another pointlessly long tube.

00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:59.495
As the AVGN would say, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.829
This level is actually quite trivial if you look at the entire thing at once.

00:03:28.243 --> 00:03:31.243
This path only uses 4 tubes, and avoids using the abnormally long one.

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:36.984
See this run's submission text for a picture detailing my path.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.600
After this level, the game directs you to a glitched level that cannot be played.

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:04.089
Due to this game's horrible controls, I can cut off the input 255 frames before I collect the last carrot.

00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:17.051
Once again, thanks for watching!
