down<00:02:48.270> because<00:02:48.510> my<00:02:48.630> shields<00:02:49.020> were<00:02:49.140> low<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
down because my shields were low and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.030 
down because my shields were low and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
then right here you get another

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.470 
then right here you get another
checkpoint<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.820> grab<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.270> active<00:02:54.780> camo<00:02:56.480> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
head up and the best thing to do is just

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.540 
head up and the best thing to do is just
run<00:03:00.140> run<00:03:01.140> past<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.770> them<00:03:02.210> you<00:03:03.210> can<00:03:04.550> this

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
run run past all of them you can this

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.460 
run run past all of them you can this
one<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.820> punch<00:03:06.390> them<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.720> go<00:03:06.840> up<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:09.470> yeah

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
one I punch them as I go up but yeah

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.380 
one I punch them as I go up but yeah
don't<00:03:10.770> slow<00:03:11.190> down<00:03:11.400> because<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.910> active<00:03:12.209> chemo

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
don't slow down because the active chemo

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.490 
don't slow down because the active chemo
doesn't<00:03:12.720> last<00:03:13.170> very<00:03:13.350> long<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.690> part<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.080> do

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
doesn't last very long this part I do

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.460 
doesn't last very long this part I do
take<00:03:19.709> out<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.040> elite<00:03:20.720> because<00:03:21.720> otherwise<00:03:22.170> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
take out the elite because otherwise the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.240 
take out the elite because otherwise the
grunts<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.220> start<00:03:23.880> attacking<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:25.250> which

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
grunts can start attacking you which

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.590 
grunts can start attacking you which
there<00:03:26.550> they<00:03:26.700> did<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> little<00:03:27.090> bit<00:03:27.270> but<00:03:27.390> not<00:03:27.450> very

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
there they did a little bit but not very

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.199 
there they did a little bit but not very
much<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.130> continue<00:03:29.370> along<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:32.209> more

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
much so you continue along and more

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.810 
much so you continue along and more
jackals<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.530> want<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:35.010> take<00:03:35.190> these<00:03:35.370> ones<00:03:35.640> out

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
jackals you want to take these ones out

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.670 
jackals you want to take these ones out
because<00:03:36.150> your<00:03:36.300> active<00:03:36.570> chemo<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:37.170> about<00:03:37.500> to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
because your active chemo is about to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.170 
because your active chemo is about to
disappear<00:03:37.800> see<00:03:38.370> there<00:03:38.790> goes<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:40.730> this<00:03:41.730> one<00:03:41.940> he

punch him run up really quickly and
punch<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.560> one<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:51.470> there's<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.560> group<00:03:52.860> of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
punch this one and there's a group of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.080 
punch this one and there's a group of
jackals<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.550> will<00:03:53.640> come<00:03:53.790> out<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:54.030> that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
jackals that will come out of that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.380 
jackals that will come out of that
little<00:03:54.360> doorway<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:54.989> throw<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.320> grenade<00:03:56.390> jump

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
little doorway so throw a grenade jump

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.890 
little doorway so throw a grenade jump
over<00:03:57.630> here<00:03:58.700> there's<00:03:59.700> one<00:03:59.910> up<00:04:00.030> there<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.600> think

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
over here there's one up there I think

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.270 
over here there's one up there I think
there<00:04:01.110> was<00:04:01.230> actually<00:04:01.500> two<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.010> threw<00:04:02.220> a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
there was actually two so I threw a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.410 
there was actually two so I threw a
plasma<00:04:02.700> grenade<00:04:03.170> didn't<00:04:04.170> take<00:04:04.320> them<00:04:04.470> out<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:06.390> I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
plasma grenade didn't take them out so I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.910 
plasma grenade didn't take them out so I
kind<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.810> hang<00:04:06.989> here<00:04:07.380> through<00:04:07.650> another

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
kind of hang here through another

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.539 
kind of hang here through another
grenade<00:04:08.360> hit<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.510> wall<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.040> made<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.310> move

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
grenade hit the wall but it made to move

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.539 
grenade hit the wall but it made to move
so<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:11.940> was<00:04:12.090> able<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.299> run<00:04:12.540> up<00:04:12.690> really<00:04:13.080> quickly

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
so I was able to run up really quickly

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.729 
so I was able to run up really quickly

the<00:05:23.139> times<00:05:23.319> there<00:05:23.529> isn't<00:05:23.800> if<00:05:23.860> there<00:05:24.039> is<00:05:24.189> just

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
the times there isn't if there is just

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.040 
the times there isn't if there is just
throw<00:05:24.610> sticky<00:05:24.969> grenade<00:05:25.300> here<00:05:25.659> there's<00:05:25.839> also

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
throw sticky grenade here there's also

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.290 
throw sticky grenade here there's also
one<00:05:26.349> so<00:05:26.589> you'll<00:05:26.740> want<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.979> stick<00:05:27.789> him<00:05:28.029> really

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
one so you'll want to stick him really

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.129 
one so you'll want to stick him really
quickly<00:05:28.740> because<00:05:29.740> he<00:05:29.949> has<00:05:30.069> a<00:05:30.099> sword<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:31.139> you

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
quickly because he has a sword and you

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.519 
quickly because he has a sword and you
can't<00:05:32.439> really<00:05:32.620> do<00:05:32.800> melee<00:05:33.370> attacks<00:05:34.210> against<00:05:34.749> in

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.540 

here<00:05:38.529> at<00:05:38.649> the<00:05:38.740> last<00:05:39.039> part<00:05:39.599> as<00:05:41.189> one<00:05:42.189> part<00:05:42.370> where

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
here at the last part as one part where

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.110 
here at the last part as one part where
it's<00:05:42.699> kind<00:05:43.449> of<00:05:43.509> tricky<00:05:44.310> ending<00:05:45.310> up<00:05:45.459> you'll<00:05:45.789> get

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
it's kind of tricky ending up you'll get

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.739 
it's kind of tricky ending up you'll get
a<00:05:46.180> checkpoint<00:05:46.749> right<00:05:47.169> about<00:05:47.560> here<00:05:48.459> so<00:05:49.389> I<00:05:49.449> fade

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 
a checkpoint right about here so I fade

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.219 
a checkpoint right about here so I fade
over<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.909> there's<00:05:51.909> a<00:05:52.089> lot<00:05:52.449> of<00:05:52.479> invisible

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
over and there's a lot of invisible

00:05:53.229 --> 00:06:00.179 
over and there's a lot of invisible
elites<00:05:54.689> so<00:05:57.240> yeah<00:05:58.240> you'll<00:05:58.659> use<00:05:59.409> up<00:05:59.620> all<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.889> your

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:00.189 
elites so yeah you'll use up all of your

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:01.829 
elites so yeah you'll use up all of your
grenades<00:06:00.580> but<00:06:00.789> the<00:06:00.879> thing<00:06:01.060> is<00:06:01.089> occasionally

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:01.839 
grenades but the thing is occasionally

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.170 
grenades but the thing is occasionally
they'll<00:06:02.050> fly<00:06:02.949> through<00:06:03.249> the<00:06:03.310> doorway<00:06:03.610> and<00:06:03.999> a

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
they'll fly through the doorway and a

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.269 
they'll fly through the doorway and a
group<00:06:04.539> of<00:06:04.629> your<00:06:04.810> maids<00:06:05.050> will<00:06:05.379> land<00:06:05.589> through

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
group of your maids will land through

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.080 
group of your maids will land through
the<00:06:06.370> doorway<00:06:06.580> is

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
the doorway is

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
the doorway is
like<00:06:07.300> that<00:06:08.010> and<00:06:09.010> flying<00:06:09.250> through<00:06:09.580> I<00:06:10.110> don't

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
like that and flying through I don't

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.580 
like that and flying through I don't
know<00:06:11.260> if<00:06:11.410> any<00:06:11.500> grenades<00:06:11.710> landed<00:06:12.280> inside<00:06:12.900> not

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.070 

but<00:06:20.400> this<00:06:21.400> suddenly<00:06:21.729> took<00:06:21.910> Manning<00:06:22.300> four<00:06:23.020> or

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
but this suddenly took Manning four or

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.780 
but this suddenly took Manning four or
five<00:06:23.229> tries<00:06:23.560> and<00:06:24.010> the<00:06:24.130> check<00:06:24.310> points<00:06:24.639> right

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
five tries and the check points right

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.370 
five tries and the check points right
there<00:06:24.820> so<00:06:25.240> it's<00:06:25.360> not<00:06:25.510> like<00:06:25.690> going<00:06:25.870> back<00:06:26.139> too

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
there so it's not like going back too

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.659 
there so it's not like going back too
far<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:28.770> yet<00:06:29.770> you<00:06:29.860> can<00:06:30.070> die<00:06:30.310> and<00:06:30.520> use<00:06:30.639> a

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
far and yet you can die and use a

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.270 
far and yet you can die and use a
checkpoint<00:06:31.120> that<00:06:31.330> doesn't<00:06:31.979> fully<00:06:32.979> to<00:06:33.220> the

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
checkpoint that doesn't fully to the

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.350 
checkpoint that doesn't fully to the
achievement<00:06:36.180> and<00:06:37.530> so<00:06:38.530> here<00:06:39.070> I'm<00:06:39.370> thinking

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
achievement and so here I'm thinking

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.210 
achievement and so here I'm thinking
there's<00:06:40.510> still<00:06:40.750> one<00:06:40.870> alive<00:06:41.139> but<00:06:41.560> it<00:06:41.889> turns<00:06:42.100> out

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
there's still one alive but it turns out

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.270 
there's still one alive but it turns out
there<00:06:42.400> isn't<00:06:42.669> so<00:06:42.940> I<00:06:42.970> just<00:06:43.300> sprint<00:06:43.860> sprint<00:06:44.860> for

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
there isn't so I just sprint sprint for

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.820 
there isn't so I just sprint sprint for
the<00:06:45.310> Pelican<00:06:46.919> and<00:06:48.270> jump<00:06:49.270> in<00:06:49.620> and<00:06:50.620> there<00:06:50.740> will

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
the Pelican and jump in and there will

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.080 
the Pelican and jump in and there will
be<00:06:50.860> a<00:06:50.950> cutscene<00:06:51.460> and<00:06:51.700> you'll<00:06:51.790> get<00:06:51.910> your

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090
