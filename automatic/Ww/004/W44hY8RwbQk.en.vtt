00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:15.150 

this<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.520> how<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.790> count<00:00:09.240> mile<00:00:09.510> closer

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.410 

if<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:16.760> find<00:00:17.119> about<00:00:17.560> 380<00:00:18.560> mortals<00:00:19.310> take<00:00:20.240> the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
if you find about 380 mortals take the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.870 
if you find about 380 mortals take the
champ<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:21.050> put<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:21.380> into<00:00:21.590> a<00:00:21.770> sealed<00:00:22.099> box<00:00:24.880> cover

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
champ and put it into a sealed box cover

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:39.450 
champ and put it into a sealed box cover
it<00:00:26.180> up<00:00:29.560> then<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:30.680> put<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.040> phone<00:00:31.340> on<00:00:31.369> top

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.869 

tap<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.300> screen<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:43.090> you<00:00:43.210> take<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.510> picture

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.479 

the<00:00:48.879> picture<00:00:49.120> goes<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.899> a<00:00:49.960> computer<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
the picture goes to a computer the

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.400 
the picture goes to a computer the
computer<00:00:51.640> accounts<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.390> molecules<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.140> send

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
computer accounts the molecules and send

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:04.290 
computer accounts the molecules and send
you<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.710> answer<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.370> that's<00:00:54.610> it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:28.760 

you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.429 

we're<00:01:29.369> using<00:01:29.909> 68<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:31.259> close<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> how

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
we're using 68 pretty close this is how

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.230 
we're using 68 pretty close this is how
you<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.979> flip<00:01:35.429> chip<00:01:35.929> experiment<00:01:38.060> first<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you do flip chip experiment first you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.220 
you do flip chip experiment first you
get<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> sample

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.720 

did<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.100> put<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.550> as<00:01:48.760> a<00:01:48.790> whole

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:07.980 

the<00:01:55.730> new<00:01:55.940> cover<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.540> was<00:01:56.900> set<00:01:57.170> off

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:32.020 

then<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.770> wait<00:02:09.069> until<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.789> goes<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.330> end

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.860 

then<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.240> slip

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.159 

and<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.890> done
