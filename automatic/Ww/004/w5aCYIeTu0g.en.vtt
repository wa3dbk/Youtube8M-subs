00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and then this is actually pushes down or

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.830 
and then this is actually pushes down or
up<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.719> where

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
up I don't know where

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.720 
up I don't know where
so<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.530> actually<00:02:05.770> pushed<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.250> all<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.400> way<00:02:06.580> up

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
so I actually pushed it all the way up

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.460 
so I actually pushed it all the way up
or<00:02:06.910> all<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.120> way<00:02:07.180> down<00:02:07.450> depending<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.320> where

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
or all the way down depending on where

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.070 
or all the way down depending on where
you<00:02:08.590> Y<00:02:08.740> in<00:02:08.890> your<00:02:08.979> back<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.550> have<00:02:10.270> my<00:02:10.300> lower

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
you Y in your back I have my lower

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.780 
you Y in your back I have my lower
position<00:02:11.710> so<00:02:12.700> very<00:02:12.940> neat<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:14.200> actually<00:02:14.790> was

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
position so very neat I I actually was

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390 
position so very neat I I actually was
very<00:02:15.850> skeptical<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:17.050> reviewing<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:17.800> mesh<00:02:18.040> chair

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
very skeptical of reviewing a mesh chair

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.340 
very skeptical of reviewing a mesh chair
because<00:02:18.580> I've<00:02:18.850> had<00:02:19.090> them<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> past<00:02:19.690> and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
because I've had them in the past and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.280 
because I've had them in the past and
these<00:02:20.560> meshes<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.400> tend<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.910> break<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:23.170> way

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
these meshes just tend to break the way

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.680 
these meshes just tend to break the way
I<00:02:23.320> had<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:24.400> was<00:02:24.520> like<00:02:24.640> all<00:02:24.850> metal<00:02:25.240> around<00:02:25.360> in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
I had it was like all metal around in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
I had it was like all metal around in
the<00:02:25.780> metal<00:02:26.050> broke<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.670> was<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.750> huge

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
the metal broke and it was just a huge

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.360 
the metal broke and it was just a huge
nightmare<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:31.240> itself<00:02:31.690> but<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.890> far<00:02:33.100> I'm

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
nightmare in itself but so far I'm

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.770 
nightmare in itself but so far I'm
really<00:02:33.400> happy<00:02:33.820> with<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> Beaver<00:02:34.420> office

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
really happy with the Beaver office

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.800 
really happy with the Beaver office
