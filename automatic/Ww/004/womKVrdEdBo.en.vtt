00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:12.200
 sport phase you know it seems to me that 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 bodybuilding is now at a crossroads 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.520
 the popularity of our sport can in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.710
 the near future just explode it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.380
 can become part of the olympic games 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.269
 become an Olympic discipline finally 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.449
 he will be accepted by the general public 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.410
 in all respects will be on television 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 will be everywhere 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.660
 that only the head will come or can we 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.640
 face full regression 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.559
 bodybuilding will be a subculture again 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.850
 which will be very interesting 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.510
 limited number of people as it were 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.160
 forties 50 and 60 we are pretty hard 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.570
 worked to pull it on 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.879
 surface its 70 and we managed then 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 convince people that this is a beautiful body and 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.170
 now it just seems like people 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.470
 began to perceive bodybuilding as 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.580
 aesthetics like beauty 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.680
 bodybuilding and with it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.689
 professional athletes of our sport 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.549
 moved to a new level where for no reason 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 this body no longer looks so 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 acceptable because they are too 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 big just huge besides for 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.439
 this is no talent so when 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.970
 people are now looking at the scene on 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.240
 bodybuilding competition 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.979
 or even women's tournaments they watch 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 on all these incredible things think about 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.060
 oh god how they do it all these flips 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.100
 twine and jumping dynamics 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.220
 choreography this look this form is 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.229
 all very bright and catchy it can be 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 sell on television easily 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.920
 but when you see guys who 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.450
 go out one by one and do so with 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 difficulty controlling breathing when 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.440
 gets into a pose and then 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:10.759
 and his belly sagged neck 58 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.010
 centimeters and caviar 45 that is proportions 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.810
 no like the old days when you always 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.050
 it was necessary to show something else besides 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.630
 sizes to become a champion in general 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.590
 if everything goes on like this 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.410
 our sport 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.959
 then more and more people will 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.690
 I do not want to reject our sport 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.660
 look like this and the more we will 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.550
 move in a different direction 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.530
 the direction of the golden mean let's say 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.480
 Tennessee has such a vantage point in 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.580
 golf so here if we find something 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.310
 I don't have this in our sport 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.200
 ready solution but in general our whole 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.800
 the dispute should move towards 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.930
 just that goal and then we will take off to 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.970
 heights we will become irresistible 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.880
 we will continue the positive momentum 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.100
 development which we already see I 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.980
 I mean increased sales of magazines 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.350
 sports supplements and everything else that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.620
 becoming so popular lately 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.810
 time 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.090
 so I really hope that we are still 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.769
 find this middle ground because 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.940
 bodybuilding is incredibly positive 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.980
 occupation healthy healthy and we 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.440
 There is every chance in order to achieve 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.070
 success in our crusade for 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.070
 fitness and bodybuilding 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:36.639
