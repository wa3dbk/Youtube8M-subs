sound this thing sounds amazing and I
had<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.510> room<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.870> put<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> larger<00:00:34.410> speaker

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
had more room to put the larger speaker

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.920 
had more room to put the larger speaker
in<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.340> went<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.149> bigger

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
monitors I mean they're hard to find

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.619 
monitors I mean they're hard to find
that<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.670> bigger<00:00:50.850> than<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.449> know<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that are bigger than that but I know a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.560 
that are bigger than that but I know a
couple<00:00:51.809> companies<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.350> made<00:00:52.500> 20<00:00:52.829> inch

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570

couple companies that made 20 inch
laptop<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.440> know<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.590> finally<00:00:55.890> found<00:00:56.039> one

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
laptop so you know I finally found one

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
laptop so you know I finally found one
that<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.180> i<00:00:57.239> could<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
that I really like that i could get a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.619 
that I really like that i could get a
controller<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.850> led<00:00:59.850> backlit<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
controller for that was led backlit that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.410 
controller for that was led backlit that
was<00:01:00.809> pretty<00:01:01.410> important<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.280> doing<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.820> bigger

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
was pretty important with doing a bigger

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
was pretty important with doing a bigger
monitor<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.080> sure<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.320> had<00:01:04.589> enough<00:01:04.619> power

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

that<00:01:20.520> I've<00:01:20.640> built<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.080> I've

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that I've built you can see that I've

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.600 
that I've built you can see that I've
got<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.439> tape<00:01:22.590> over<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> holes<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
got some tape over the holes here with a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.999 
got some tape over the holes here with a
headphone<00:01:24.420> jack<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.500> buttons<00:01:25.830> go

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
headphone jack and and the buttons go

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.710 
headphone jack and and the buttons go
and<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.759> one's<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.240> access<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and this one's going to have access to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.870 
and this one's going to have access to
the<00:01:27.840> infrared<00:01:28.590> remote<00:01:28.770> port<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.700> going

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the infrared remote port so that's going

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.420 
the infrared remote port so that's going
to<00:01:29.970> work<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.079> keys<00:01:31.710> keypad

to work I don't have keys keypad
installed<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.060> actually<00:01:33.509> right<00:01:33.689> there<00:01:34.460> but

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
installed it's actually right there but

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.550 
installed it's actually right there but
I<00:01:35.729> always<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> test<00:01:36.600> fitting<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
I always do a test fitting like this and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.740 
I always do a test fitting like this and
this<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:38.909> opportunity<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.540> show

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
this would be a good opportunity to show

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.240 
this would be a good opportunity to show
off<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.439> doing<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.100> this

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
percent finished pretty much almost all

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.110 
percent finished pretty much almost all
the<00:02:36.260> wirings<00:02:36.620> done<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.280> put<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.880> keep

the wirings done I have to put the keep
at<00:02:38.269> it<00:02:38.300> doesn't<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.760> Wi-Fi<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.209> yet

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
at it doesn't have the Wi-Fi in it yet

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.900 
at it doesn't have the Wi-Fi in it yet
but<00:02:42.260> pretty<00:02:42.709> much<00:02:42.769> it's<00:02:43.100> it's<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:43.700> done<00:02:43.880> I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
there's a little bit more wiring that I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.370 
there's a little bit more wiring that I
got<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.430> then<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.390> move<00:02:47.660> on<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.019> paint

got to do and then I move on to paint
and<00:02:48.620> finish<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.660> paint<00:02:50.930> finish<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.350> a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
and finish so and the paint finish is a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.559 
and finish so and the paint finish is a
pretty<00:02:51.590> big<00:02:51.739> process<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.489> it's<00:02:52.970> got<00:02:53.360> it's

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
pretty big process so it's got it's

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.840 
pretty big process so it's got it's
about<00:02:53.810> 8<00:02:53.989> /<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> five<00:02:54.620> percent<00:02:55.010> finished<00:02:55.430> let<00:02:55.760> me

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
about 8 / a five percent finished let me

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.490 
about 8 / a five percent finished let me
get<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.300> lets<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:57.110> look<00:02:57.290> at<00:02:57.410> the

this little door that I put in right

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.090 
this little door that I put in right
here<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.350> actually<00:03:09.680> attached<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:12.100> dongle

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
here is actually attached to the dongle

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.910 
here is actually attached to the dongle
that<00:03:13.280> controls<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.269> Margaret<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.260> if<00:03:15.739> you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
that controls the Margaret so if you

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
closed so you can close the lid plug it

that negative air pressure cooling

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.129 
that negative air pressure cooling
system<00:04:14.540> work<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:15.049> have<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:17.299> vent<00:04:17.570> fan<00:04:17.840> Vince

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
system work I have to vent fan Vince

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.819 
system work I have to vent fan Vince
here<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:19.280> run<00:04:19.970> over<00:04:20.329> here<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.169> there<00:04:21.380> blowing

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
here and run over here and there blowing

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.340 
here and run over here and there blowing
air<00:04:22.010> out<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.520> case<00:04:22.729> there<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:24.080> over<00:04:24.229> here

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
air out of the case there and over here

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.420 
air out of the case there and over here
and<00:04:24.770> that<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.880> control<00:04:26.810> where<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.470> rest<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
and that I control where the rest of the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.250 
and that I control where the rest of the
air<00:04:28.520> can<00:04:28.669> come<00:04:28.820> into<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.180> case<00:04:29.389> so<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.840> force<00:04:30.139> it

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
air can come into the case so I force it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.379 
air can come into the case so I force it
to<00:04:30.380> come<00:04:30.530> in<00:04:30.620> across<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.860> ISA<00:04:31.280> looks<00:04:32.060> great

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
to come in across the ISA looks great

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.990 
to come in across the ISA looks great
keeps<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.960> heat<00:04:33.080> sink<00:04:33.260> cool<00:04:33.610> allows<00:04:34.610> me<00:04:34.820> to

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
keeps the heat sink cool allows me to

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.790 
keeps the heat sink cool allows me to
shrink<00:04:35.300> it<00:04:35.389> down<00:04:35.419> make<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.320> more<00:04:36.470> compact<00:04:37.389> but

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
shrink it down make it more compact but

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.469 
shrink it down make it more compact but
yeah<00:04:39.800> i'll<00:04:40.070> be<00:04:40.100> doing<00:04:40.490> another<00:04:40.910> update<00:04:41.360> on

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
turning out great i'm hoping to have

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.800 
turning out great i'm hoping to have
both<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.690> these<00:05:17.810> things<00:05:18.139> completely<00:05:18.650> done<00:05:19.280> and

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
both of these things completely done and

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.550 
both of these things completely done and
tested<00:05:20.810> by<00:05:21.520> friday<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.700> next<00:05:22.729> week<00:05:23.150> i<00:05:23.599> actually

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
tested by friday of next week i actually

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.260 
tested by friday of next week i actually
thought<00:05:24.979> that<00:05:25.160> doing<00:05:25.340> two<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.729> them<00:05:25.910> at<00:05:26.060> once

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
thought that doing two of them at once

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.650 
thought that doing two of them at once
would<00:05:26.870> be<00:05:27.139> quicker<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:28.389> but<00:05:29.389> you<00:05:29.539> know

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
would be quicker and but you know

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.909 
would be quicker and but you know
honestly<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:30.139> just<00:05:30.169> takes<00:05:30.530> twice<00:05:30.710> as<00:05:30.770> long

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
honestly it just takes twice as long
