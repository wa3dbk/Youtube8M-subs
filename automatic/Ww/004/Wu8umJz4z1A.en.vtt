when<00:00:00.870> working<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.290> protein<00:00:01.740> it's<00:00:01.949> best<00:00:02.220> to

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
when working in protein it's best to

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.649 
when working in protein it's best to
think<00:00:02.429> that<00:00:02.790> you're<00:00:02.909> actually<00:00:03.060> working<00:00:03.360> with

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
think that you're actually working with

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.680 
think that you're actually working with
clay<00:00:04.160> to<00:00:05.160> give<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.400> an<00:00:05.490> idea<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.299> quirks

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
clay to give you an idea of the quirks

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.000 
clay to give you an idea of the quirks
of the<00:00:06.930> clay<00:00:07.200> i'm<00:00:07.440> going<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.649> show<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:07.830> my

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
of the clay i'm going to show you my

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.430 
of the clay i'm going to show you my
performance<00:00:08.460> index<00:00:08.700> for<00:00:08.910> windows<00:00:09.179> 7<00:00:09.540> i<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:10.410> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
performance index for windows 7 i have a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.879 
performance index for windows 7 i have a
5.3<00:00:11.250> my<00:00:12.000> systems<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:12.599> three<00:00:13.170> years<00:00:13.290> old<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
5.3 my systems about three years old and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.760 
5.3 my systems about three years old and
it<00:00:14.610> works<00:00:14.849> pretty<00:00:14.969> good<00:00:16.820> when<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.740> work<00:00:19.740> with

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
it works pretty good when you work with

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.670 
it works pretty good when you work with
the<00:00:20.189> default<00:00:20.550> settings<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> high<00:00:22.020> res<00:00:22.320> or

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the default settings of the high res or

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.960 
the default settings of the high res or
large<00:00:22.980> resolution<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:25.310> it'll<00:00:26.310> put<00:00:26.460> down<00:00:26.640> clay

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
large resolution it it'll put down clay

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.510 
large resolution it it'll put down clay
pretty<00:00:27.960> slowly<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:31.369> how<00:00:32.369> fast<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:34.520> maneuver

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
pretty slowly and how fast you maneuver

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.430 
pretty slowly and how fast you maneuver
the<00:00:35.640> tool<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.149> determines<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:37.200> kind

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the tool really determines of what kind

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.639 
the tool really determines of what kind
of<00:00:38.629> outcome<00:00:39.629> you're<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.410> pang

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
of outcome you're going to get the pang

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.389 
of outcome you're going to get the pang
on<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:40.890> resolution<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.860> move<00:00:44.040> really

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
on your resolution so if I move really

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.600 
on your resolution so if I move really
slowly<00:00:47.510> I'll<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.890> using<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
slowly I'll get up to using the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.810 
slowly I'll get up to using the
spiritual<00:00:55.550> bed

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
spiritual bed

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.660 
spiritual bed
if<00:00:58.570> we<00:00:58.660> zoom<00:00:58.690> in<00:00:58.989> we<00:00:59.290> can<00:00:59.410> see<00:00:59.980> how<00:01:00.310> sharp<00:01:00.610> that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
if we zoom in we can see how sharp that

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.850 
if we zoom in we can see how sharp that
is<00:01:00.910> that<00:01:01.150> it<00:01:01.450> looks<00:01:01.630> pretty<00:01:01.750> good<00:01:02.050> with<00:01:02.680> high

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
is that it looks pretty good with high

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.640 
is that it looks pretty good with high
resolution

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.220 

even<00:01:11.550> though<00:01:11.670> i<00:01:11.700> use<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> sphere<00:01:12.210> tool<00:01:12.420> when

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
even though i use the sphere tool when

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.290 
even though i use the sphere tool when
you<00:01:13.470> overlap<00:01:13.920> clay<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.060> large

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
you overlap clay just because one large

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.350 
you overlap clay just because one large
piece<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.600> play<00:01:17.030> especially<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> start

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
piece of play especially when you start

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.820 
piece of play especially when you start
working<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.750> other<00:01:18.930> operations<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.440> if

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
working with other operations so if if

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.870 
working with other operations so if if
you're<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.490> best<00:01:23.730> to<00:01:23.850> just

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you're going to start it's best to just

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.140 
you're going to start it's best to just
change<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:25.250> resolution<00:01:26.250> too<00:01:26.430> small<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.030> very

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
change your resolution too small or very

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.570 
change your resolution too small or very
small<00:01:27.540> depending<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.140> what<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.590> performance

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
small depending on what your performance

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.120 
small depending on what your performance
of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.760> system<00:01:29.910> is<00:01:30.590> now<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.800> compare<00:01:34.130> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of the system is now if we compare the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.070 
of the system is now if we compare the
speed<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.700> operation<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.570> add<00:01:36.840> operation

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
speed of the operation the add operation

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.610 
speed of the operation the add operation
with<00:01:37.830> this<00:01:38.340> new<00:01:38.580> low<00:01:38.760> resolution<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.440> see

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
with this new low resolution you can see

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.830 
with this new low resolution you can see
what<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> mean<00:01:41.330> it's<00:01:42.330> fast<00:01:45.530> well<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.830> even

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
what I mean it's fast well I can even

00:01:47.840 --> 00:02:00.890 
what I mean it's fast well I can even
things<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.930> this

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.220 

you<00:02:01.440> go<00:02:01.620> faster

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

so<00:02:06.160> we<00:02:06.700> take<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.910> look<00:02:07.060> at<00:02:07.150> this<00:02:07.800> now<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.130> gonna

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so we take a look at this now it's gonna

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.210 
so we take a look at this now it's gonna
put<00:02:09.970> down<00:02:10.090> clay<00:02:10.360> much<00:02:10.570> faster<00:02:11.050> but<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.470> does

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
put down clay much faster but it does

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.770 
put down clay much faster but it does
not<00:02:12.370> look<00:02:12.550> as<00:02:12.700> good<00:02:12.850> but<00:02:13.510> doesn't<00:02:13.750> really

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
not look as good but doesn't really

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.420 
not look as good but doesn't really
matter<00:02:14.020> you're<00:02:14.290> roughing<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.010> your<00:02:15.160> model

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
matter you're roughing out your model

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.720 
matter you're roughing out your model
you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:16.530> save<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.100> then<00:02:18.190> import<00:02:18.640> it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
you can save this and then import it

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.030 
you can save this and then import it
into<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:19.090> higher<00:02:19.840> resolution<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.680> work<00:02:20.860> out

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
into a higher resolution and work out

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.790 
into a higher resolution and work out
further<00:02:21.400> there
