wanting emergent behavior in your game

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.359 
wanting emergent behavior in your game
means<00:00:21.150> you're<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.420> doing<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.900> job<00:00:22.279> let<00:00:23.279> me

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
you're working on the guard AI for some

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.580 
you're working on the guard AI for some
first-person<00:00:27.510> shooter<00:00:27.810> game<00:00:27.990> when<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
first-person shooter game when the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
first-person shooter game when the
testers<00:00:28.980> passes<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> hall<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.970> says

hey dude I just noticed how if the
player<00:00:31.830> barricades<00:00:32.340> himself<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> room<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
player barricades himself in a room the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.240 
player barricades himself in a room the
guards<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:33.989> throw<00:00:34.230> grenades<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.800> until<00:00:35.160> they

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
guards will throw grenades at until they

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860 
guards will throw grenades at until they
can<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:36.180> pretty<00:00:36.390> cool<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.780> he

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
can get in that's pretty cool that he

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.540 
can get in that's pretty cool that he
knows<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:38.280> which<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
knows how to do that to which you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.569 
knows how to do that to which you
respond<00:00:38.940> yeah<00:00:39.540> pretty<00:00:40.079> cool<00:00:40.350> huh<00:00:40.379> excuse<00:00:41.219> me<00:00:41.399> I

respond yeah pretty cool huh excuse me I
have<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.090> somewhere<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.899> course<00:00:43.079> what

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
have to go somewhere and of course what

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.450 
have to go somewhere and of course what
you're<00:00:43.290> thinking<00:00:43.559> yourself<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> why<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> hell

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you're thinking yourself is why the hell

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.400 
you're thinking yourself is why the hell
is<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.610> doing<00:00:44.910> that

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
is it doing that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
is it doing that
so<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.520> trace<00:00:47.520> through<00:00:47.730> stuff<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> couple

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so you trace through stuff for a couple

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
so you trace through stuff for a couple
hours<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> know<00:00:49.410> then<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> figured<00:00:50.010> out

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
hours and you know then you figured out

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
hours and you know then you figured out
why<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> hell<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.760> doing<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.660> doing

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
why the hell it's doing that it's doing

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.540 
why the hell it's doing that it's doing
that<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.620> occupancy<00:00:53.039> grid<00:00:53.309> blah

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that because the occupancy grid blah

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
that because the occupancy grid blah
blah<00:00:53.789> blah<00:00:53.969> threat<00:00:54.270> calculation<00:00:54.840> Volvo

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
utility blah blah blah cancels out which

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
utility blah blah blah cancels out which
makes<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> guy<00:00:57.510> throw<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> grenade<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
makes the guy throw a grenade and if you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.099 
makes the guy throw a grenade and if you
squint<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.940> right<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.899> how<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
squint just right you can see how that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.009 
squint just right you can see how that
behavior<00:01:01.640> naturally<00:01:02.640> emerges<00:01:03.359> from<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> way

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
behavior naturally emerges from the way

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.830 
behavior naturally emerges from the way
you've<00:01:04.199> set<00:01:04.439> things<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:06.150> when<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.450> then

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you've set things up so when do you then

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620 
you've set things up so when do you then
what<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.310> start<00:01:08.580> getting<00:01:08.880> proud

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
what do you do you start getting proud

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.679 
what do you do you start getting proud
it's<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.950> AI<00:01:11.130> after<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> made<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.479> so

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it's your AI after all you made it so

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
it's your AI after all you made it so
this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.900> technically<00:01:13.740> speaking<00:01:14.040> something

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
this is technically speaking something

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.179 
this is technically speaking something
you<00:01:14.850> did<00:01:15.180> even<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> didn't<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you did even if you didn't really do it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.190 
you did even if you didn't really do it
actually<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.240> even<00:01:18.330> better<00:01:18.659> than<00:01:18.900> something

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
actually it's even better than something

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.690 
actually it's even better than something
you<00:01:19.320> did<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.009> did<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.280> without<00:01:20.340> even

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you did because you did it without even

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
you did because you did it without even
having<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.840> emerged<00:01:22.439> from

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
having to do it it just emerged from

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560 
having to do it it just emerged from
this<00:01:22.830> incredible<00:01:23.430> AI<00:01:23.640> substructure<00:01:24.450> you've

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
this incredible AI substructure you've

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.480 
this incredible AI substructure you've
built<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.619> an<00:01:25.770> AI<00:01:25.979> wizard

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
built up you are an AI wizard

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.030 
built up you are an AI wizard
now<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> an<00:01:30.090> example<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.350> genuinely

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
now this is an example of a genuinely

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
now this is an example of a genuinely
useful<00:01:32.310> feature<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:32.909> says<00:01:33.210> somehow<00:01:33.600> fell

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
useful feature that says somehow fell

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.070 
useful feature that says somehow fell
from<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> sky<00:01:34.440> that's<00:01:35.220> that's<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:36.080> something

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
from the sky that's that's not something

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.859 
from the sky that's that's not something
that<00:01:37.110> generally<00:01:37.590> happens<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that generally happens and I think this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.880 
that generally happens and I think this
is<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> deeper<00:01:40.409> issue<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:41.130> where<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:42.210> start

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
is a deeper issue here where we start

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.380 
is a deeper issue here where we start
valuing<00:01:43.890> emergent<00:01:44.280> behavior<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:45.090> because

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
valuing emergent behavior not because

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.180 
valuing emergent behavior not because
it's<00:01:45.540> useful<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.440> it's<00:01:46.619> emergent

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
it's useful but because it's emergent

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.210 
it's useful but because it's emergent
and<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:48.060> start<00:01:48.409> looking<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> measure

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and we start looking to it as a measure

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
and we start looking to it as a measure
of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.640> quality<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> our<00:01:51.360> AI<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.080> this<00:01:52.619> I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
of the quality of our AI and this I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.320 
of the quality of our AI and this I
think<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> real<00:01:53.250> problem<00:01:53.520> where<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.090> start

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
think is the real problem where we start

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.010 
think is the real problem where we start
to<00:01:54.420> feel<00:01:54.600> beholden<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.560> merchant<00:01:55.950> AI<00:01:56.960> let<00:01:57.960> me

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
to feel beholden to a merchant AI let me

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
to feel beholden to a merchant AI let me
give<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.229> another<00:01:58.259> example<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.190> this<00:01:59.250> one's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
give you another example and this one's

something<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.179> confession<00:02:00.360> really<00:02:01.250> when<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
something of a confession really when I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
something of a confession really when I
came<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.759> work<00:02:02.910> for<00:02:02.970> havoc<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.720> started

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
came to work for havoc and started

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
came to work for havoc and started
working<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.619> havoc<00:02:04.979> AI<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.610> already<00:02:05.789> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
how you know everybody would swirl this

clearing<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:41.010> done<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.579> I<00:02:41.640> made<00:02:41.790> this

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
clearing to be done so I made this

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
clearing to be done so I made this
little<00:02:42.120> tweak<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.260> thought<00:02:43.440> would

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
little tweak and that I thought would

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
little tweak and that I thought would
improve<00:02:44.220> things<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.239> did<00:02:45.450> in

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
improve things and you know it did in

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.699 
improve things and you know it did in
these<00:02:46.700> little<00:02:47.700> situations<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.540> made<00:02:49.380> people

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
these little situations it made people

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.680 
these little situations it made people
get<00:02:50.010> past<00:02:50.160> each<00:02:50.459> other<00:02:50.670> much<00:02:51.239> more<00:02:51.269> quickly

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
get past each other much more quickly

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.810 
get past each other much more quickly
but<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.470> noticed<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> process<00:02:53.640> I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
but then I noticed that in the process I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.120 
but then I noticed that in the process I
had<00:02:54.150> broken<00:02:54.450> vortex<00:02:55.110> formation<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:56.070> know

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
had broken vortex formation you know

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.160 
had broken vortex formation you know
there's<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.940> bit<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.180> swirling<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.079> was

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
there's a little bit of swirling but was

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.810 
there's a little bit of swirling but was
mostly<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.650> every<00:02:58.829> man<00:02:59.010> for<00:02:59.310> himself

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
mostly just every man for himself

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.270 
mostly just every man for himself
and<00:03:00.019> here's<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.140> confession<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.769> spent<00:03:02.160> like

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
and here's the confession I spent like

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.880 
and here's the confession I spent like
two<00:03:02.640> days<00:03:02.940> trying<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.480> fix<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.680> know<00:03:04.769> the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
two days trying to fix this you know the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.039 
two days trying to fix this you know the
old<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.370> new<00:03:05.609> function<00:03:06.060> was<00:03:06.209> better<00:03:06.570> under

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
old the new function was better under

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.349 
old the new function was better under
these<00:03:07.200> certain<00:03:07.950> scenarios<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.640> got<00:03:08.850> people<00:03:09.150> to

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
these certain scenarios it got people to

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.750 
these certain scenarios it got people to
where<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.540> were<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.750> faster<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:11.459> then

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
where they were going faster but then

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.670 
where they were going faster but then
after<00:03:12.090> two<00:03:12.209> days<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.630> started<00:03:12.780> feeling<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.320> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
after two days I started feeling like I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.580 
after two days I started feeling like I
couldn't<00:03:14.340> use<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.720> because<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.870> emergent

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
couldn't use it because this emergent

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.259 
couldn't use it because this emergent
behavior<00:03:17.070> was<00:03:17.250> threatening<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.700> pack<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.150> and

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
behavior was threatening to pack up and

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.660 
behavior was threatening to pack up and
leave<00:03:18.390> if<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.720> didn't<00:03:18.989> keep<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.230> happy<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.739> then

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
leave if I didn't keep it happy and then

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.319 
leave if I didn't keep it happy and then
on<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.820> whim<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.359> tried<00:03:21.959> testing<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.799> two<00:03:23.010> out

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
on a whim I tried testing the two out

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.120 
on a whim I tried testing the two out
specifically<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.870> swirling<00:03:25.680> scenario

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
specifically on this swirling scenario

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.890 
specifically on this swirling scenario
and<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.549> what<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.670> found<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.780> new

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and you know what I found the new

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.380 
and you know what I found the new
function<00:03:28.380> was<00:03:28.709> better<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.820> scenario<00:03:30.090> as

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
function was better in this scenario as

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.759 
function was better in this scenario as
well<00:03:30.420> people<00:03:30.840> got<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.500> where<00:03:31.620> they're<00:03:31.739> going

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
well people got to where they're going

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.800 
well people got to where they're going
on<00:03:32.160> average<00:03:32.459> faster<00:03:32.940> than<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.180> wheel<00:03:33.299> with

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
on average faster than the wheel with

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.080 
on average faster than the wheel with
the<00:03:33.840> old<00:03:34.049> system<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.620> was<00:03:34.920> less<00:03:35.130> emergent<00:03:35.819> but

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
the old system it was less emergent but

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.520 
the old system it was less emergent but
it<00:03:36.180> was<00:03:36.269> more<00:03:36.510> efficient<00:03:37.019> see

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
it was more efficient see

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.350 
it was more efficient see
I'd<00:03:38.620> become<00:03:38.830> beholden<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.610> this<00:03:39.730> emergent

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
I'd become beholden to this emergent

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.900 
I'd become beholden to this emergent
behavior<00:03:40.930> when<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.709> first<00:03:42.069> shows<00:03:42.250> up<00:03:42.520> it's

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
behavior when it first shows up it's

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.449 
behavior when it first shows up it's
like<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.360> gold<00:03:43.959> star<00:03:44.440> suggesting<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.370> you

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
like this gold star suggesting to you

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.010 
like this gold star suggesting to you
that<00:03:45.490> you're<00:03:45.700> doing<00:03:45.910> something<00:03:46.450> right

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
that you're doing something right

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.440 
that you're doing something right
I<00:03:47.340> think<00:03:48.340> we<00:03:48.730> get<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.000> feeling<00:03:49.420> that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
I think we get this feeling that

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.780 
I think we get this feeling that
emergent<00:03:49.900> behavior<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:50.620> sort<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.130> our<00:03:51.340> reward

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
emergent behavior is sort of our reward

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.900 
emergent behavior is sort of our reward

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
should be emergent so even if we didn't

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.180 
should be emergent so even if we didn't
intend<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.660> initially<00:03:59.230> now<00:03:59.860> all<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.160> sudden

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.890 
intend it initially now all of a sudden
we<00:04:00.489> value<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.270> point<00:04:01.450> where<00:04:01.600> we're

we value it to the point where we're

throwing a grenade to clear barricades

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.880 
throwing a grenade to clear barricades
you<00:04:07.060> know<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.600> feels<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:08.050> little<00:04:08.230> dirty<00:04:08.530> to

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
is not your friend what are you going to

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.890 
is not your friend what are you going to
do<00:04:21.700> when<00:04:21.850> somebody<00:04:22.150> tells<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.480> make<00:04:22.630> some

do when somebody tells you to make some

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.810 
do when somebody tells you to make some
change<00:04:23.230> like<00:04:23.500> have<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.830> guy<00:04:23.950> only<00:04:24.100> throw<00:04:24.400> cue

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
change like have the guy only throw cue

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.370 
change like have the guy only throw cue
grenades<00:04:25.120> instead<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.570> three<00:04:25.810> well<00:04:26.230> you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
grenades instead of three well you

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.050 
grenades instead of three well you
barely<00:04:26.680> know<00:04:26.980> why<00:04:27.160> he<00:04:27.340> throws<00:04:27.580> two<00:04:27.790> grenade

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
barely know why he throws two grenade

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.880 
barely know why he throws two grenade
three<00:04:28.390> grenades<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:28.990> have<00:04:29.080> no<00:04:29.320> idea<00:04:29.680> what

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
three grenades and you have no idea what

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.020 
three grenades and you have no idea what
you<00:04:29.979> could<00:04:30.130> change<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.580> make<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:30.729> throw<00:04:30.970> two

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
you could change to make it throw two

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.120 
you could change to make it throw two
you're<00:04:31.720> gonna<00:04:31.780> say<00:04:32.110> sorry<00:04:32.500> that's<00:04:32.770> just<00:04:32.979> not

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
you're gonna say sorry that's just not

how it emerged and what are you going to

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.950 
how it emerged and what are you going to
do<00:04:35.890> when<00:04:36.100> somebody<00:04:36.340> asks<00:04:36.790> or<00:04:37.060> somebody<00:04:37.750> when

do when somebody asks or somebody when
you<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.200> make<00:04:38.290> a<00:04:38.350> change<00:04:38.650> for<00:04:38.710> something

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
you have to make a change for something

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.500 
you have to make a change for something
outside<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.760> need<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:39.910> drop<00:04:40.150> down<00:04:40.389> the

want to do and it does it the emergent
behavior<00:05:01.870> you're<00:05:02.350> at<00:05:02.530> its<00:05:02.680> mercy<00:05:02.910> you<00:05:03.910> try<00:05:04.360> to

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
behavior you're at its mercy you try to

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.180 
behavior you're at its mercy you try to
keep<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.780> happy<00:05:05.140> and<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.440> get<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:05.770> do<00:05:05.890> kind

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
keep it happy and to get it to do kind

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.440 
keep it happy and to get it to do kind
of<00:05:06.340> what<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:06.550> want<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.820> do<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.330> then<00:05:07.419> you

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
of what you want to do and then you

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.080 
of what you want to do and then you
basically<00:05:07.690> have<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.140> accept<00:05:08.710> what<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.520> gives

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
basically have to accept what it gives

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.730 
basically have to accept what it gives
back<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.360> you<00:05:10.660> it's<00:05:10.840> like<00:05:10.990> you<00:05:11.260> work<00:05:11.560> for<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.010> I

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
back to you it's like you work for it I

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.010 
back to you it's like you work for it I
guess<00:05:14.740> it's<00:05:15.130> not<00:05:15.250> surprising<00:05:16.150> though<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.900> we

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
guess it's not surprising though that we

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.710 
guess it's not surprising though that we
value<00:05:17.200> these<00:05:17.530> little<00:05:18.070> emergencies<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:19.030> mean<00:05:19.630> we

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
value these little emergencies I mean we

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.050 
value these little emergencies I mean we
work<00:05:19.930> with<00:05:20.110> these<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.350> eyes<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:20.830> long<00:05:21.100> we<00:05:21.729> invest

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
work with these a eyes so long we invest

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.450 
work with these a eyes so long we invest
so<00:05:22.210> much<00:05:22.270> into<00:05:22.630> their<00:05:22.750> growth<00:05:23.190> they're<00:05:24.190> kind

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
so much into their growth they're kind

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.000 
so much into their growth they're kind
of<00:05:24.520> like<00:05:24.669> our<00:05:24.820> children<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.740> what<00:05:26.740> does<00:05:26.830> every

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
of like our children and what does every

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.890 
of like our children and what does every
parent<00:05:27.340> want<00:05:27.490> for<00:05:27.700> their<00:05:27.820> child<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.419> that<00:05:28.750> it

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
parent want for their child and that it

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.380 
parent want for their child and that it
should<00:05:29.050> surpass<00:05:29.440> them<00:05:29.910> that<00:05:30.910> they<00:05:31.120> should

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
should surpass them that they should

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.330 
should surpass them that they should
think<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.870> things<00:05:32.169> do<00:05:32.530> things<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.039> we<00:05:33.160> never

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
think of things do things that we never

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.490 
think of things do things that we never
even<00:05:33.430> conceived<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.870> know<00:05:34.960> we<00:05:35.080> guide<00:05:35.260> and

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
even conceived of you know we guide and

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.900 
even conceived of you know we guide and
correct<00:05:35.770> them<00:05:35.890> where<00:05:36.039> we<00:05:36.160> can<00:05:36.190> but<00:05:36.669> at<00:05:36.789> the<00:05:36.880> end

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
correct them where we can but at the end

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.700 
correct them where we can but at the end
of<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.150> day<00:05:37.270> it's<00:05:37.479> like<00:05:37.660> eventually<00:05:38.289> we<00:05:38.590> have

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
of the day it's like eventually we have

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.350 
of the day it's like eventually we have
to<00:05:38.860> stop<00:05:39.070> holding<00:05:39.370> their<00:05:39.520> hand<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.000> send<00:05:40.270> them

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
to stop holding their hand and send them

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.510 
to stop holding their hand and send them
out<00:05:40.419> into<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.780> world

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
out into the world

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.059 
out into the world
but<00:05:43.520> you<00:05:43.610> know<00:05:43.759> what<00:05:44.080> you're<00:05:45.080> a<00:05:45.110> I<00:05:45.289> is<00:05:45.469> not<00:05:45.830> your

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
but you know what you're a I is not your

but you know what you're a I is not your
child<00:05:46.399> your<00:05:47.330> AI<00:05:47.569> is<00:05:47.749> your<00:05:48.020> mindless

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:48.439

automatons servant and your highest
aspirations<00:05:51.139> for<00:05:51.349> it<00:05:51.469> should<00:05:51.649> be<00:05:51.710> a<00:05:52.009> that<00:05:52.580> it

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
aspirations for it should be a that it

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.489 
aspirations for it should be a that it
does<00:05:52.849> only<00:05:53.119> in<00:05:53.360> exactly<00:05:53.809> what<00:05:53.930> you<00:05:54.020> told<00:05:54.199> it<00:05:54.409> to

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:54.499 
does only in exactly what you told it to

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
do and be that what you told her to do

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.850 
do and be that what you told her to do
makes<00:05:56.689> the<00:05:56.809> game<00:05:56.960> a<00:05:56.990> hell<00:05:57.229> of<00:05:57.319> a<00:05:57.379> lot<00:05:57.499> of<00:05:57.619> fun

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
makes the game a hell of a lot of fun

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.799 
makes the game a hell of a lot of fun
that's<00:05:58.189> it<00:05:59.110> now<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:00.379> know<00:06:00.589> this<00:06:00.889> sounds

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:01.809 
that's it now I know this sounds

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.459 
that's it now I know this sounds
limiting<00:06:02.809> and<00:06:03.110> rigid<00:06:04.039> and<00:06:04.990> yeah<00:06:05.990> maybe<00:06:06.259> at<00:06:06.409> a

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
limiting and rigid and yeah maybe at a

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.029 
limiting and rigid and yeah maybe at a
certain<00:06:06.740> point<00:06:06.919> we<00:06:07.189> do<00:06:07.460> want<00:06:07.879> to<00:06:08.409> have<00:06:09.409> agents

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
certain point we do want to have agents

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.089 
certain point we do want to have agents
that<00:06:10.189> can<00:06:10.430> plan<00:06:10.849> and<00:06:11.330> reason<00:06:12.289> and<00:06:12.649> take

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
that can plan and reason and take

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.799 
that can plan and reason and take
buckets<00:06:13.520> off<00:06:13.669> their<00:06:13.849> heads<00:06:14.059> without<00:06:14.419> being

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:14.809 
buckets off their heads without being

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.269 
buckets off their heads without being
specifically<00:06:15.259> programmed<00:06:15.589> with<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:15.949> bucket

specifically programmed with a bucket

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.219 
specifically programmed with a bucket
check<00:06:16.550> and<00:06:16.849> you<00:06:17.419> know<00:06:17.509> I<00:06:17.569> really<00:06:17.869> do<00:06:17.990> think

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
check and you know I really do think

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:19.659 
check and you know I really do think
that<00:06:18.439> someday<00:06:18.680> we'll<00:06:18.979> get<00:06:19.189> there<00:06:19.459> and

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
that someday we'll get there and

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.519 
that someday we'll get there and
emergent<00:06:20.389> behavior<00:06:20.719> become<00:06:21.020> a<00:06:21.050> part<00:06:21.319> of<00:06:21.379> our

emergent behavior become a part of our

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.909 
emergent behavior become a part of our
toolkit<00:06:22.719> but<00:06:23.719> not<00:06:23.930> yet<00:06:24.169> and<00:06:24.379> you<00:06:24.589> know<00:06:24.709> how<00:06:24.889> I

toolkit but not yet and you know how I
know<00:06:25.069> not<00:06:25.399> yet<00:06:25.610> because<00:06:26.419> of<00:06:26.509> your<00:06:26.659> own

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:26.809 
know not yet because of your own

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:29.320 
know not yet because of your own
distrust<00:06:27.379> for<00:06:27.589> your<00:06:27.709> AI<00:06:27.969> look<00:06:28.969> if<00:06:29.119> somebody

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
distrust for your AI look if somebody

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.719 
distrust for your AI look if somebody
came<00:06:29.569> to<00:06:29.779> you<00:06:29.869> and<00:06:29.990> said<00:06:30.050> can<00:06:30.709> your<00:06:30.860> AI<00:06:30.979> do<00:06:31.129> X<00:06:31.490> Y

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
came to you and said can your AI do X Y

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.149 
came to you and said can your AI do X Y
Z<00:06:32.029> and<00:06:32.209> you're<00:06:32.599> like<00:06:32.779> yeah<00:06:33.259> it<00:06:33.379> does<00:06:33.589> I<00:06:33.619> put<00:06:34.069> it

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
Z and you're like yeah it does I put it

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.889 
Z and you're like yeah it does I put it
in<00:06:34.249> a<00:06:34.339> check<00:06:34.550> specifically<00:06:35.089> for<00:06:35.240> that<00:06:35.360> that's

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:35.899 
in a check specifically for that that's

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:38.529 
in a check specifically for that that's
you<00:06:36.110> doing<00:06:36.439> your<00:06:36.559> job<00:06:36.669> if<00:06:37.669> on<00:06:38.089> the<00:06:38.180> other<00:06:38.270> hand

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
you doing your job if on the other hand

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.179 
you doing your job if on the other hand
you<00:06:38.629> said<00:06:38.869> well<00:06:39.379> I<00:06:39.409> haven't<00:06:39.619> specifically

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
you said well I haven't specifically

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:42.219 
you said well I haven't specifically
tested<00:06:40.669> that<00:06:40.819> but<00:06:41.029> I<00:06:41.059> assume<00:06:41.479> so<00:06:41.749> because<00:06:42.080> my

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
tested that but I assume so because my

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:43.899 
tested that but I assume so because my
system<00:06:42.529> is<00:06:42.589> designed<00:06:42.709> to<00:06:43.039> robustly<00:06:43.459> handle
