00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.270
 ah 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.330
 good your fingers to a new video here 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.889
 we are in black ops and good basically 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 I wanted to tell you a few things 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.650
 I recorded this game quite a while ago 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.390
 before leaving on a trip to the games and 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 others and good basically because he has 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.500
 strike to comment a few 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 little things when I did not need and now it's 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.360
 the good moment the game the truth not 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 is that it is super mega spectacular of 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.780
 made me stay without throwing one a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.059
 helicopter and it fucks me a lot not being able to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.240
 throwing it the truth is the mega putada 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.980
 well basically I want to comment 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.320
 lately as you know I'm 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.840
 going up quite well mario kart and what 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.450
 what is ufc basically that is what soil 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.250
 always up for what is new 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.380
 in videogames yesterday upload 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.540
 sniper elite 3 had it since it came out 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.140
 of the game but I had not dared to 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.690
 upload anything because you could not see it 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.690
 I saw in a way that people would then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.180
 like to see 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.580
 the missions so very entertaining and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.410
 showy for but good to do 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.910
 videos and in fact in fact the 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.310
 Multiplayer games I would like to upload 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:19.800
 some but I know it 's normal there's no 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.750
 that change in that in that game all 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.400
 world does it logically go only 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.560
 with the sniper is the only weapon 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 useful we could say that you have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.960
 apart from the machine gun but all the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.790
 world goes with the sniper and 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.290
 Logically, they are all above 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.450
 house if you have to do 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.250
 logically the same with what then 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.140
 I do not think it's too fun 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.570
 to watch a game of 20 minutes because 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.520
 They last 20 minutes from a person then 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.159
 uploaded to a house and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.320
 waiting for there was on the street it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.299
 come out on the map and shoot him does not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.469
 it seems a little bit too bored with 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.990
 which is a game that I have 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.960
 bought almost for almost anything not to 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.569
 to pass it to me once and period is a 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 game that I wanted to upload videos and other 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:04.049
 but good playing it because it gives me 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.610
 mind that it has been fun and that's why 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.420
 only one campaign has been uploaded or 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.420
 be a mission of the tlc or a mission of 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.069
 the campaign that was Hitler's and how 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 I found it entertaining and funny 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.260
 I wished there were, I do not know if I went up more 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.060
 As I say no, I do not have a fucking idea 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.910
 but good the channel will continue as always 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.500
 I'm not waiting to record from the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.540
 trash know when I find it a bit 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.549
 well because it's not that I do much 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.730
 grace to get into a game to pass it 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.519
 wrong and scream those that make me special 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.799
 illusion and good still with the blue water 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.230
 so I'll go with mario kart and continue with the 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.720
 opc you already know that good unfortunately 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.120
 this month only not unfortunately or 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.730
 fortunately, it only comes out of the stanza 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 will be mastered on July 29 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.030
 I probably have it very probably 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.769
 just to see how the game looks on 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.390
 high definition at 1080 presentations 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.370
 per second and to play it again 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.049
 what would be the opera multiplayer 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.110
 In addition, the TLC are new, not the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.730
 I bought in precision three see also the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.040
 dlc de live and jane that neither 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.810
 judges are three and then already 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.849
 I take advantage of what they catch in companies 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.319
 four and well all started again and 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.329
 I do not know, I guess I'll go up 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.879
 multiplayer but surely because I 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.620
 it costs a lot to lose again the 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.450
 tranquillo no longer remembers me in Ã¡lava 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.629
 rope or lame things were manufactured neither 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.920
 nothing I swear it or be since I am departures 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.629
 of that game because I do not remember 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.150
 absolutely a tail or in the 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.620
 agreement of nothing at all and nothing 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.079
 then already if we go to August in August 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.250
 there is nothing there is no game or it is not 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.799
 I know if I'm wrong to tell the 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.209
 comments I mean game good no longer 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.680
 no no no there is no july august 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.450
 there is no 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.299
 there is nothing the whole look of September 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.950
 see if something comes out I think it's about 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.290
 how many games but July and August now 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.040
 only of the remastered verses 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.370
 and the little more dance in September comes out 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.980
 that 204 but good in the eyes that I'm going to 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.829
 upload the naruto that yes sure 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.859
 I saw it and I raised it I liked it 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.530
 pretty fifa 15 I also think it's in 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.239
 September I do not know I do not know what else I do not 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.669
 agreement to the same one that I do not know but 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.560
 it will also come out but well yes they will be 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.120
 few who especially if they are 15 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.460
 because I will not serve up logically 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.919
 not playing soccer games and on the road 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.840
 see if they do not catch it I do not know that I do not know what 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.770
 I will do is and on campaign mode mode 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.210
 multiplayer because it's not mode 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.720
 multiplayer you also have each 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.460
 beating that is water that me before I do not know if 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.169
 simply in this game you dedicate yourself to 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.270
 just play that game or we go or 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.940
 nothing although young this game 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.370
 directly stress is what super mega 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.529
 and there are no games that there are people already very very 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.019
 very 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.779
 well I do not blame them done the same with 

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:53.539
 many logic games but good the 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:54.829
 percentage of people in the naruto 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.179
 I mean the percentage that there is of 

00:04:54.829 --> 00:05:01.659
 people in good bad is very tall or 

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:05.269
 There are many good people, that is, 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:07.099
 awesome csn the game I say it in 

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:10.369
 serious is in the game that more good people 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.769
 and for every player I've ever seen or 

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:15.349
 is it really that I mean it or is it 

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:17.269
 and just watching the demo there is a level that 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.879
 it's awesome or it's like it's 

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:21.559
 take years playing take him 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.929
 surely with the previous ones in 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:25.939
 adults but it's awesome 

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:27.739
 cancer with forests and I do not know I do not know how much 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:31.329
 that you run out of sticks traction a 

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:34.039
 convoy of 50 machines is impressive 

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:37.429
 it just ends up breaking something safe or 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.919
 be if you're a no and you really think 

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:41.869
 that you can play this game online and 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.659
 win I take everything out of my head and why 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:46.409
 because it's not very difficult if you cross 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.149
 with someone very bad good 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.099
 believe me it will cost you to cross with 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:52.339
 someone bad so good nothing else 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.339
 kids 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.129
 Y
