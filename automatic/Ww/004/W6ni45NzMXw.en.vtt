it dries in place and this won't be able

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.820 
it dries in place and this won't be able
to<00:04:45.090> peel<00:04:45.300> anymore<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.080> only<00:04:46.229> around<00:04:46.470> for

perfectly because it was just a little

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.610 
perfectly because it was just a little
bit<00:04:54.240> bigger<00:04:54.419> than<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.870> mannequin<00:04:55.320> here<00:04:55.500> that

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
next bent into what looks like a regular

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.570 
next bent into what looks like a regular
neck<00:05:19.259> and<00:05:19.530> it's<00:05:19.650> your<00:05:19.830> own<00:05:19.860> cool<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.370> stuff

and if you want you can also do the back
piece<00:05:22.949> but<00:05:23.460> it'll<00:05:23.699> be<00:05:23.789> real<00:05:24.060> hard<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.449> get<00:05:24.630> your
