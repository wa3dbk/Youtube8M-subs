00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.460
 as a wrestling fan I'm 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.780

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.780
 well look I do not fight against the fight 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.700
 well fought against fought was the first 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.770
 movie that started in this new stage 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.830
 I liked it because there was never 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.200
 made a movie with wrestlers 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.260
 I once made a small particle 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.420
 with my friends to rest before 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.910
 juniors we made a movie where 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.860
 we are fighters I had fun 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.290
 a lot but it's practically a 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.140
 full movie where where is a 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.230
 fought a llama taco vendor fought 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.080
 and suddenly he likes the fight a lot 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.450
 free and he gets who he is fighter 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.880
 professional but can not but be 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.970
 occurs persists of woman and triumphs 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.980
 totally but you to nothing and for 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.590
 drawn from one of the fighters and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:52.459
 then the promoter and the fight then 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:56.510
 I am a man, I am a man, above all, who is 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.700
 something a difficult sport but yes 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.489
 exactly what was your experience the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.480
 see is to know the wrestling one up 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.480
 of the ring as a fighter 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.959
 they proposed a coconut list of those 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.799
 but I do them study for a long time 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.259
 character then this very good the 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.340
 winner many times for my height 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:28.550
 and my strength and skill I always win a lot 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.200
 a lot of how karateca but I'm going with 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.870
 the years already 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.790
 the possibilities are diminishing everything and 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.880
 also in the movie I could not do 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.880
 nothing because he supposedly knew nothing 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:56.720
 of those but very funny but to me 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.540
 I like wrestlers a lot this is 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.450

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:09.280

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:21.330
 it's an art and now the importance that you 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.889

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.020
 good because they gave him a very good arm 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.020

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.070

 As you say, I paint, I do not, and I 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.569
