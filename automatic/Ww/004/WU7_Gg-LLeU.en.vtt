00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.159
 the years to be developed 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.299
 asked if it is not too much exaggeration to finalize the game 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.049
 may be somewhat unlikely 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.570
 Say I would love to do it quicker clear. 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.820
 but is that we want to do something new for us also everything has to be 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.720
 Perfect

 to stop the process the values ​​are not disclosed 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.000
 but it is estimated that to develop such a game and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.649
 you need to invest nothing less 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:37.389
 twenty-five million dollars these stories by stopping at the hands of the team 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:43.259
 of martini fausto the Brazilian who is one of the directors of art since he who 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.509

 proportion of work and more 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.879
 it's important to see next year as well as a superhuman 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.919
 the idea is to get to the end product our neighborhood 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.919
 it's not because in that thing that the mayor 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.200
 these models 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.480
 are passed on to the animators who make movement tests 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.080
 never in history has to be as close as possible to reality 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.370
 the information has been days 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.990

 fly samaranch hair and the areas to do as single frame some 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.790

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.260
 faces as real as this was no more than me to undertake. 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.509
 worries 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.599
 why sell the controversial project some different actors for example a 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.569
 client only he has a very interesting program the sebrae-sp input some 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.580
 parts that are 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.220
 very interesting and I ended up using a nose of him as a reference has to 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.710
 there is a naturalness so you have to look at things and 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.930
 finally you have to believe that there really is some place 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.680
 so I same sex 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.089
 the world will do 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.089
 two minutes of film can take six months 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.300
 up to two years of work the result of all this is to envy the cinemas 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.560
 as if it were a film overall length of the buyer's bank 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.939
 further up the language of the foot of the planet boaventura as focus 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.020
 and still have option 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.430
 several sessions with various materials 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.529
 to produce teaching audio 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.360
 the world currently lives 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.800
 sometimes it takes time for the judge to be the same work as a composer only 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.370
 it's a different song fred says the newspaper says have the sound designer him

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.510
 pedestrians who saw drawings of movements and sounds 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.479
 by game strategy 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.240

 box the whole group tell me this is a great idea is very cool 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:04.419
