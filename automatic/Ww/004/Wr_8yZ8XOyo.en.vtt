your<00:02:14.870> hand<00:02:15.170> now<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.770> compared<00:02:16.100> well<00:02:16.460> with

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
your hand now this compared well with

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.030 
your hand now this compared well with
cards<00:02:17.030> like<00:02:17.350> ultra<00:02:18.350> ball<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:18.890> get

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
become quite interesting draw card

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.760 
become quite interesting draw card
because<00:02:23.209> it's<00:02:23.390> not<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.959> normal<00:02:24.230> support<00:02:24.590> that

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
because it's not the normal support that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.260 
because it's not the normal support that
we've<00:02:24.860> seen<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.220> draw<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.430> card<00:02:25.700> as<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> trainer

we've seen to draw a card as a trainer
so<00:02:26.780> much<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.080> how<00:02:27.200> many<00:02:27.260> people<00:02:27.560> are<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.800> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.320 
so much so how many people are going to
be<00:02:27.950> using<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:28.670> I'm<00:02:28.790> sure<00:02:28.820> people<00:02:29.239> will

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
be using this but I'm sure people will

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.570 
be using this but I'm sure people will
try<00:02:29.510> out<00:02:29.690> my<00:02:30.110> combo<00:02:30.470> well<00:02:30.620> with<00:02:30.770> Sableye<00:02:31.310> and

try out my combo well with Sableye and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.760 
try out my combo well with Sableye and
heavy<00:02:32.420> counts<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.840> ultra<00:02:33.140> balls<00:02:33.290> we<00:02:33.440> might<00:02:33.590> see

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
heavy counts of ultra balls we might see

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.770 
heavy counts of ultra balls we might see
in<00:02:33.920> some<00:02:33.950> dark<00:02:34.310> deck<00:02:34.520> later<00:02:34.730> on<00:02:35.030> another<00:02:35.540> very

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
in some dark deck later on another very

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.870 
in some dark deck later on another very
interesting<00:02:35.930> card<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.070> we<00:02:37.160> also<00:02:37.310> get<00:02:37.640> some

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
interesting card and we also get some

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.360 
interesting card and we also get some
very<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.510> nice<00:02:38.810> pace<00:02:39.350> spec<00:02:39.680> cards<00:02:40.070> they<00:02:40.190> seem

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
very very nice pace spec cards they seem

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.070 
very very nice pace spec cards they seem
to<00:02:40.430> be<00:02:40.489> pushing<00:02:40.820> this<00:02:40.880> expect<00:02:41.390> card<00:02:41.600> thing<00:02:41.870> I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
to be pushing this expect card thing I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.449 
to be pushing this expect card thing I
think<00:02:42.440> it's<00:02:42.560> going<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.770> take<00:02:42.920> off<00:02:43.100> with<00:02:43.310> these

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
think it's going to take off with these

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.110 
think it's going to take off with these
new<00:02:43.640> ones

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
new ones

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.360 
new ones
the<00:02:44.330> first<00:02:44.570> one<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.900> gold<00:02:45.110> potion<00:02:45.620> not<00:02:46.190> too

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
the first one is gold potion not too

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520 
the first one is gold potion not too
interesting<00:02:46.940> but<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.540> do<00:02:47.690> get<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.870> kill<00:02:48.110> 90

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
interesting but you do get to kill 90

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.470 
interesting but you do get to kill 90
damage<00:02:48.800> from<00:02:48.950> your<00:02:49.070> Active<00:02:49.400> Pokemon<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:50.330> no

side<00:02:50.720> effects<00:02:51.050> Knights<00:02:51.860> damage<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.370> usually

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
side effects Knights damage is usually

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.160 
side effects Knights damage is usually
going<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.150> be<00:02:53.239> quite<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.510> crucial<00:02:53.930> amount

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
going to be quite a crucial amount

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.780 
going to be quite a crucial amount
because<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.590> may<00:02:54.739> expect<00:02:55.070> card<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.489> don't

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
because this may expect card I don't

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.520 
because this may expect card I don't
think<00:02:56.000> too<00:02:56.120> many<00:02:56.269> people<00:02:56.390> will<00:02:56.720> use<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
think too many people will use it the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.770 
think too many people will use it the
healing<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.920> nice<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:58.400> very<00:02:58.459> situational<00:02:59.420> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
healing is nice but very situational and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.970 
healing is nice but very situational and
you<00:02:59.870> can't<00:03:00.080> get<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.290> back<00:03:00.410> unless<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.830> both

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
you can't get it back unless you both

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.940 
you can't get it back unless you both
Sableye<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:02.049> interesting<00:03:03.049> card<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:03.620> will

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950

only<00:03:09.980> one<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.370> card<00:03:10.670> but<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.570> expect<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.989> see

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
only one of card but I can expect to see

dark patch such as one card at any time

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.660 
dark patch such as one card at any time
can<00:03:48.049> just<00:03:48.260> be<00:03:48.440> such<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.860> clutch<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.430> going<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.610> be

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
can just be such a clutch is going to be

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.070 
can just be such a clutch is going to be
such<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.879> clutch<00:03:50.209> card<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.690> when<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.900> draw

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
such a clutch card that when you draw

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.750 
such a clutch card that when you draw
you<00:03:51.319> can<00:03:51.470> just<00:03:51.709> put<00:03:52.190> your<00:03:52.220> mind<00:03:52.519> at<00:03:52.640> ease

you can just put your mind at ease

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.759 
you can just put your mind at ease
basically<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.629> think<00:03:54.019> most<00:03:54.170> decks<00:03:54.379> were<00:03:54.500> knit

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
basically I think most decks were knit

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.350 
basically I think most decks were knit
just<00:03:54.920> because<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.400> one<00:03:55.670> card<00:03:55.940> can<00:03:55.970> be<00:03:56.090> so

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
just because that one card can be so

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.880 
just because that one card can be so
crucial<00:03:56.629> in<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.930> game<00:03:57.079> and<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.680> can<00:03:57.799> help

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
crucial in a game and it can help

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.229 
crucial in a game and it can help
towards<00:03:58.190> your<00:03:58.310> strategy<00:03:58.670> as<00:03:58.760> well<00:03:58.909> in<00:03:59.060> terms

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
towards your strategy as well in terms

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.149 
towards your strategy as well in terms
of<00:03:59.420> energy<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.230> another<00:04:00.440> right<00:04:00.620> card<00:04:00.890> and

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
of energy so another right card and

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.470 
of energy so another right card and
we've<00:04:01.250> got<00:04:01.400> some<00:04:01.579> more<00:04:01.700> talked<00:04:01.970> about<00:04:02.000> as<00:04:02.299> well

we've got some more talked about as well

we've got some more talked about as well

increases poison damage to 20 in between

about we could see some better things in

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:06.689

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
the future maybe championship points

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.979 
the future maybe championship points
won't<00:06:06.849> be<00:06:07.029> awarded<00:06:07.329> the<00:06:07.389> passwords<00:06:07.869> anymore

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:07.989 
won't be awarded the passwords anymore

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:10.049 
won't be awarded the passwords anymore
maybe<00:06:08.739> the<00:06:08.829> price<00:06:09.069> supports<00:06:09.489> change<00:06:09.759> maybe

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:10.059 
maybe the price supports change maybe

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.699 
maybe the price supports change maybe
the<00:06:10.209> championship<00:06:10.809> points<00:06:11.110> have<00:06:11.199> you<00:06:11.289> changed

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:11.709 
the championship points have you changed

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:13.139 
the championship points have you changed
there's<00:06:12.159> a<00:06:12.219> lot<00:06:12.369> that<00:06:12.459> you<00:06:12.519> can<00:06:12.639> consider<00:06:12.939> they

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:13.149 
there's a lot that you can consider they

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:14.699 
there's a lot that you can consider they
might<00:06:13.329> even<00:06:13.449> be<00:06:13.659> changing<00:06:14.049> the<00:06:14.139> Swiss<00:06:14.349> rounds

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:14.709 
might even be changing the Swiss rounds

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:16.769 
might even be changing the Swiss rounds
to<00:06:14.889> best<00:06:15.399> of<00:06:15.579> three<00:06:15.909> you<00:06:16.209> don't<00:06:16.299> really<00:06:16.509> know

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
to best of three you don't really know

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.799 
to best of three you don't really know
so<00:06:17.759> overall<00:06:18.759> this<00:06:18.969> is<00:06:19.029> a<00:06:19.089> very<00:06:19.299> controversial

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:19.809 
so overall this is a very controversial

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.659 
so overall this is a very controversial
