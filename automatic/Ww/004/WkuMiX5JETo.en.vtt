00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
you just simply hit enter and this will

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.570 
you just simply hit enter and this will
run<00:01:16.240> this<00:01:16.420> process<00:01:16.869> for<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.229> while<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:18.490> will

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
run this process for a while it will

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.150 
run this process for a while it will
compress<00:01:18.880> all<00:01:19.300> these<00:01:19.840> files<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.590> can<00:01:20.890> it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
compress all these files and it can it

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.249 
compress all these files and it can it
can<00:01:21.190> take<00:01:21.550> quite<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.819> while<00:01:21.910> so<00:01:22.240> just<00:01:22.420> give<00:01:22.959> time

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
can take quite a while so just give time

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.499 
can take quite a while so just give time
due<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.530> about<00:01:23.740> maybe<00:01:23.979> 20<00:01:24.399> minutes<00:01:24.670> my<00:01:25.209> tank

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
due to about maybe 20 minutes my tank

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.480 
due to about maybe 20 minutes my tank
longer<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:25.929> might<00:01:25.990> not<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:27.039> I<00:01:27.069> didn't<00:01:27.340> let<00:01:27.459> that

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
longer it might not so I didn't let that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.219 
longer it might not so I didn't let that
process<00:01:27.819> go<00:01:28.179> all<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.479> way<00:01:28.509> through<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.869> simply

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
process go all the way through it simply

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.010 
process go all the way through it simply
because<00:01:29.560> i<00:01:29.849> just<00:01:30.849> recently<00:01:31.090> did<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.569> myself

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
because i just recently did it myself

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.990 
because i just recently did it myself

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
to do that CD / thing before after that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.490 
to do that CD / thing before after that
you're<00:03:36.600> going<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.780> want<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.960> go<00:03:37.050> in<00:03:37.200> safe<00:03:37.470> mode

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
you're going to want to go in safe mode

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.260 
you're going to want to go in safe mode
and<00:03:37.890> do<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.190> steps<00:03:38.370> again<00:03:38.580> because

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
and do all the steps again because

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.520 
and do all the steps again because
because<00:03:39.630> when<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.840> do<00:03:39.960> that<00:03:40.080> originally

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
because when you do that originally

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.470 
because when you do that originally
right<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:40.860> on<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.040> windows<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:42.060> weren't

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
right here on the windows you weren't

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.240 
right here on the windows you weren't
able<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.840> access<00:03:43.200> as<00:03:43.440> many<00:03:43.710> files<00:03:43.950> and

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
able to access as many files and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.730 
able to access as many files and
compress<00:03:44.550> as<00:03:44.700> many<00:03:44.880> files<00:03:45.090> because<00:03:45.300> they<00:03:45.600> were

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
compress as many files because they were

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.770 
compress as many files because they were
protected<00:03:46.740> in<00:03:46.890> some<00:03:47.700> way<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.450> if<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.600> go<00:03:48.720> on

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
protected in some way so if you go on

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.150 
protected in some way so if you go on
the<00:03:48.840> safe<00:03:49.020> mode<00:03:49.260> you'll<00:03:49.440> be<00:03:49.560> able<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.740> edit<00:03:49.860> you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
the safe mode you'll be able to edit you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.060 
the safe mode you'll be able to edit you
can<00:03:50.190> basically<00:03:50.490> do<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.060> same<00:03:51.240> thing<00:03:51.660> again

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
can basically do the same thing again

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.000 
can basically do the same thing again
now<00:03:53.070> these<00:03:53.730> steps<00:03:54.030> will<00:03:54.180> see<00:03:54.810> if<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.230> good

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
now these steps will see if you a good

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.280 
now these steps will see if you a good
bit<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.220> hard<00:03:56.490> drive<00:03:56.670> space<00:03:56.700> let's<00:03:57.270> go<00:03:58.020> to<00:03:58.080> my

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
bit of hard drive space let's go to my

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.480 
bit of hard drive space let's go to my
hard<00:03:58.560> drive<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:58.890> I'll<00:03:58.980> show<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.190> what<00:03:59.370> I'm

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
hard drive and I'll show you what I'm

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.080 
hard drive and I'll show you what I'm
talking<00:03:59.550> about<00:04:00.710> okay<00:04:01.710> so<00:04:02.100> originally<00:04:02.760> on<00:04:02.910> this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
talking about okay so originally on this

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.710 
talking about okay so originally on this
particular<00:04:03.390> drive<00:04:03.840> right<00:04:04.080> here<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.560> was<00:04:04.770> act<00:04:05.040> I

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
particular drive right here I was act I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.040 
particular drive right here I was act I
had<00:04:06.720> 63<00:04:07.650> gigabytes<00:04:08.460> left<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.150> compressed<00:04:09.870> it

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
had 63 gigabytes left I compressed it

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.540 
had 63 gigabytes left I compressed it
and<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.230> got<00:04:10.380> down<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.680> eighty<00:04:10.950> five<00:04:11.190> gigabytes

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
and I got down the eighty five gigabytes

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.640 
and I got down the eighty five gigabytes
left<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.120> that's<00:04:12.300> like<00:04:12.480> however<00:04:13.440> many

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
left so that's like however many

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.890 
left so that's like however many
gigabytes<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:14.790> say<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.240> get<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.780> many

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
gigabytes that you say you get that many

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.420 
gigabytes that you say you get that many
more<00:04:16.320> gigabytes<00:04:16.620> left<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.190> when<00:04:17.400> I

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
more gigabytes left and when I

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.729 
more gigabytes left and when I
benchmarked<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.330> had<00:04:18.989> not<00:04:19.170> lost<00:04:19.410> any

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
benchmarked it I had not lost any

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.070 
benchmarked it I had not lost any
performance<00:04:20.370> at<00:04:20.520> all<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.930> very

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
performance at all so this is a very

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.410 
performance at all so this is a very
simple<00:04:22.290> way<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.890> mean<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:23.490> not<00:04:23.700> it's<00:04:23.970> not<00:04:24.090> too

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
simple way I mean it's not it's not too

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.080 
simple way I mean it's not it's not too
complicated<00:04:24.890> but<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.100> will<00:04:26.340> compress<00:04:26.850> all

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
complicated but this will compress all

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.120 
complicated but this will compress all
your<00:04:27.360> files<00:04:27.570> get<00:04:28.140> you<00:04:28.290> more<00:04:28.410> hard<00:04:28.710> drive<00:04:28.979> space

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
your files get you more hard drive space

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.700 
your files get you more hard drive space
and<00:04:29.460> hopefully<00:04:29.820> more<00:04:30.060> read<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:30.990> write<00:04:31.169> speed

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
and hopefully more read and write speed

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.060 
and hopefully more read and write speed
thank<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.640> I'll
