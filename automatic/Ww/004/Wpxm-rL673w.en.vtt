do go through my whole wash the big

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.849 
do go through my whole wash the big
sections<00:01:51.009> this<00:01:51.369> time<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.020> just<00:01:53.320> applied

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
sections this time and so I just applied

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.429 
sections this time and so I just applied
small<00:01:54.280> amounts<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:54.969> it<00:01:55.119> with<00:01:55.390> my<00:01:55.600> fingers<00:01:56.140> and

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
small amounts to it with my fingers and

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.270 
small amounts to it with my fingers and
then<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.890> second<00:01:57.280> time<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:57.789> used<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:59.280> condiment

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
then the second time I used a condiment

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.330 
then the second time I used a condiment
bottle<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.409> filled<00:02:02.770> what<00:02:03.070> was

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
bottle and I just filled what was

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.550 
bottle and I just filled what was
remaining<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.570> product<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:05.200> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
remaining of the product in the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.370 
remaining of the product in the
condiment<00:02:06.159> bottle<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.780> like<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:07.990> ketchup

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
condiment bottle that's like a ketchup

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.770 
condiment bottle that's like a ketchup
mustard<00:02:08.770> type<00:02:09.340> bottle<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:10.000> think<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.330> got<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.599> for

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
mustard type bottle I think I got it for

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.970 
mustard type bottle I think I got it for
$2<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.530> changing<00:02:11.950> Kmart

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
$2 and changing Kmart

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.830 
$2 and changing Kmart
but<00:02:13.129> it<00:02:13.250> was<00:02:13.370> easier<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.030> control<00:02:14.420> how<00:02:14.659> much

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
but it was easier to control how much

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.690 
but it was easier to control how much
product<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.440> was<00:02:15.560> using<00:02:16.069> by<00:02:16.250> using<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
product I was using by using the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.750 
product I was using by using the
condiment<00:02:17.269> bottle<00:02:17.629> so<00:02:18.409> I<00:02:18.739> definitely<00:02:19.069> will<00:02:19.730> be

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
condiment bottle so I definitely will be

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
continuing to use that method when I

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.320 
continuing to use that method when I
deal<00:02:23.989> with<00:02:24.019> deep<00:02:24.409> conditioners<00:02:25.099> also<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.239> a

a<00:03:16.609> call<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:17.090> curl<00:03:17.419> teased<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.380> yeah<00:03:18.680> my<00:03:18.919> hair

a call that curl teased but yeah my hair

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.670 
a call that curl teased but yeah my hair
had<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.669> very<00:03:20.000> subtle<00:03:20.329> Sheen<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.440> looks

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
had a very subtle Sheen to it it looks

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.309 
had a very subtle Sheen to it it looks
super<00:03:21.889> super<00:03:22.400> moisturize<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.450> was<00:03:23.989> really

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
super super moisturize it was really

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.610 
super super moisturize it was really
soft<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.069> still<00:03:25.609> very<00:03:25.910> well<00:03:26.630> detangled

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
soft and still very well detangled

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.460 
soft and still very well detangled
and<00:03:28.359> that's<00:03:29.359> something<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.959> really<00:03:30.290> like

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
and that's something that I really like

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.009 
and that's something that I really like
because<00:03:30.859> some<00:03:31.130> deep<00:03:31.340> conditioners<00:03:31.970> tend<00:03:32.780> to

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
because some deep conditioners tend to

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.379 
because some deep conditioners tend to
harden<00:03:33.440> up<00:03:33.590> your<00:03:33.769> hair<00:03:34.099> especially<00:03:34.760> ones<00:03:35.239> with

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
harden up your hair especially ones with

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.680 
harden up your hair especially ones with
protein<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.099> I<00:03:37.370> was<00:03:37.609> really<00:03:37.910> glad<00:03:38.359> that

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
protein in it so I was really glad that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.379 
protein in it so I was really glad that
my<00:03:38.750> hair<00:03:39.200> was<00:03:39.380> still<00:03:39.650> soft<00:03:40.180> especially<00:03:41.180> after

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
my hair was still soft especially after

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.330 
my hair was still soft especially after
how<00:03:41.690> long<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:42.169> left<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.560> product<00:03:42.980> in<00:03:43.130> my<00:03:43.310> hair

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
how long I left this product in my hair

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.759
