00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.709 

Sun<00:00:07.350> in<00:00:07.710> Taurus<00:00:08.250> if<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.150> are<00:00:09.389> one<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> those

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
Sun in Taurus if you are one of those

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.270 
Sun in Taurus if you are one of those
people<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.200> Sun<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.650> Taurus

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
people with Sun in Taurus

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.150 
people with Sun in Taurus
I<00:00:11.309> think<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.090> tourists<00:00:12.809> as<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.440> earthly

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
I think of tourists as the earthly

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.820 
I think of tourists as the earthly
experience<00:00:14.960> this<00:00:15.960> has<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.500> these

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
experience this has to do with these

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.609 
experience this has to do with these
senses<00:00:17.520> being<00:00:17.880> awakened<00:00:18.779> more<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.260> more<00:00:19.470> over

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
senses being awakened more and more over

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.679 
senses being awakened more and more over
the<00:00:19.710> course<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.670> life<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.240> also<00:00:21.270> has

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the course of the life but it also has

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.870 
the course of the life but it also has
to<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.050> becoming<00:00:22.410> more<00:00:22.880> present

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
to do with becoming more present

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.300 
to do with becoming more present
enjoying<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.230> moment<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.980> find

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
enjoying the moment that you find

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.480 
enjoying the moment that you find
yourself<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:27.930> paying<00:00:28.680> absolute

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
yourself in as well paying absolute

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.130 
yourself in as well paying absolute
attention<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.720> front<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
attention to what is in front of you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.889 
attention to what is in front of you
this<00:00:31.470> becomes<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.009> way<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.610> gaining<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.360> sense<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
this becomes a way of gaining a sense of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.950 
this becomes a way of gaining a sense of
self<00:00:34.489> finding<00:00:35.489> who<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
self finding who you really are and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
self finding who you really are and
stepping<00:00:37.440> into<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.770> version<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.489> yourself<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
stepping into a version of yourself that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.639 
stepping into a version of yourself that
you<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.500> much<00:00:40.940> with<00:00:41.940> Torian<00:00:42.570> energy<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you like very much with Torian energy I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.889 
you like very much with Torian energy I
think<00:00:44.100> about<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.030> whole<00:00:45.180> idea<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.600> being<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
think about this whole idea of being a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.920 
think about this whole idea of being a
connoisseur<00:00:46.820> deciding<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.690> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
connoisseur deciding what it is that is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.069 
connoisseur deciding what it is that is
good<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.789> that's<00:00:50.969> only<00:00:51.210> good<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.870> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
good and if that's only good for you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.740 
good and if that's only good for you
then<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.920> than<00:00:53.129> enough<00:00:53.600> but<00:00:54.600> there

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
then that's more than enough but there

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959 
then that's more than enough but there
tends<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.199> an<00:00:55.379> element<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.010> sort<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
tends to be an element of sort of the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.630 
tends to be an element of sort of the
taste<00:00:57.300> buds<00:00:57.660> being<00:00:57.960> heightened<00:00:58.640> an

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
taste buds being heightened an

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119 
taste buds being heightened an
appreciation<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.899> smells<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.949> what

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
appreciation of what smells good what

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.810 
appreciation of what smells good what
looks<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.730> feels<00:01:03.210> good<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.840> well<00:01:04.170> and

looks good what feels good as well and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
looks good what feels good as well and
this<00:01:05.820> idea<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.330> having<00:01:06.720> fabrics<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.890> feel

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
this idea of having fabrics that feel

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.170 
this idea of having fabrics that feel
great<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.240> skin<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:10.520> foods<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.060> an

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
amazing texture not just the taste but

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.810

feel really soothing all of these fall

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.539 
feel really soothing all of these fall
under<00:01:20.729> ways<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.500> Torian<00:01:23.040> energy

under ways in which that Torian energy
that<00:01:23.729> Sun<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.270> Taurus<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.810> awakened<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
that Sun in Taurus is awakened and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
that Sun in Taurus is awakened and
empowered<00:01:26.990> Taurus<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.560> also<00:01:29.070> noted<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.549> being

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
empowered Taurus is also noted for being

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.569 
empowered Taurus is also noted for being
very<00:01:30.689> persistent<00:01:31.020> being<00:01:31.710> very<00:01:31.920> diligent<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
very persistent being very diligent it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.719 
very persistent being very diligent it
is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> fixed<00:01:33.299> sign<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.950> also<00:01:35.280> noted<00:01:35.700> for

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is a fixed sign and it's also noted for

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.960 
is a fixed sign and it's also noted for
having<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:37.020> certain<00:01:37.470> focus<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.280> well<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.880> know

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
having a certain focus as well you know

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.210 
having a certain focus as well you know
they<00:01:39.119> say<00:01:39.299> Taurus<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.960> Bull<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.130> be

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
they say Taurus the Bull and to be

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.670 
they say Taurus the Bull and to be
bullheaded<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.360> these<00:01:42.509> aren't<00:01:42.750> bad<00:01:43.020> things

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
bullheaded as if these aren't bad things

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.850 
bullheaded as if these aren't bad things
I<00:01:43.710> think<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> Taurus<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:45.439> committed<00:01:46.439> yes

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
I think of Taurus as committed yes

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.520 
I think of Taurus as committed yes
having<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.820> strong<00:01:48.180> sense<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.810> where<00:01:49.229> it's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
having a strong sense of where it's

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.249 
having a strong sense of where it's
going<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.329> trusting<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> process<00:01:52.079> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
going and trusting the process this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
going and trusting the process this
tends<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.799> true<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.399> earth<00:01:53.700> signs<00:01:54.060> but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
tends to be true for all earth signs but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.870 
tends to be true for all earth signs but
what<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> distinct<00:01:55.799> about<00:01:55.979> '''but<00:01:56.399> Orion

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
what is distinct about '''but Orion

what is distinct about '''but Orion
energy<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.860> commits<00:01:59.310> it

of where you find a sense of yourself is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.469 
of where you find a sense of yourself is
