00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.700
 good good friends and again those are 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.609
 33 this time I will have the unboxing of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 Huawei make 600 this team already 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 can get on movilnet with a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.390
 price close to 5 thousand bolivars and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.789
 well knowing him a little bit let's see 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 over here on the side of the box to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.619
 see what he tells us we have a screen 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.960
 5 inch 5 point touch a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.860
 1.3 GHz dual core processor 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.930
 an android 4.2 internal or rom memory 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.489
 which is 4 gigs and as for the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 multimedia we have a dual camera 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 we have a front camera and we have a camera 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 back and capture video in 720p has 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.060
 services like gps and also has 13 h 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.420
 plus 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.340
 ok before unpacking leave it to me 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 tell them that we are seeing or we are 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.830
 before a phone exactly equal to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.000
 previous already known that 511 so 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.080
 well let's see what the difference is 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.080
 we proceed to unpack what 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.149
 and here is the phone a phone 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.820
 obviously large is a screen of 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.560
 5 inches nonetheless also has a 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.509
 pretty big casing look at the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.299
 distance between the screen and the edges 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.979
 which makes the phone 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.920
 big enough that the camera is 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.130
 frontal its its horn 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.570
 the three useful android buttons here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 on the right side we have the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.710
 power button off and lock the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.159
 volume buttons here in the part 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.830
 top we have the jack input 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.840
 3.5 mm on the left side no 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.920
 there is nothing and at the bottom and a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.289
 side we have the loading port and the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.180
 good microphone is a pretty phone 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.090
 large at hand is not very comfortable 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.880
 really I really do not adapt very 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.330
 well to him we have here back the camera 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.239
 back or good the main camera the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.950
 cornet and nothing else this camera 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.160
 it does not have flash as you can see 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.780
 if we look for a comparison here I have in 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.780
 the optimus ge that has a screen 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.150
 4.7 inches and how they can be fixed is 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.580
 a phone a lot but a lot more 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.660
 big 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.980
 well let's see what is inside the box 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.980
 here is your battery 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.730
 which is 2 thousand 150 thousand and in this 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.650
 case we have a pretty big battery 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.280
 for a screen that consumes much more 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.299
 energy we have here the charger was the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.299
 charger adapter 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.060
 his hands free which is 3.5 millimeters 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.370
 we have here the cable that is micro usb and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.790
 we talk about that and finally we have 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.160
 Guarantee certificate and its way of use 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.100
 Quick 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.360
 it really brings us a lot not to bring 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.360
 a micro usb memory 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.730
 but remember, it has its slot 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.360
 for memory expansion 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.360
 ok let's go 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.599
 by reordering quickly here 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.400
 and here in the back as you 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.470
 can fix has its slot for the the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.700
 sim card and here is the slot for 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.450
 microsd let's put the battery 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.810
 we proceed to turn it on 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.760
 he vibrates when pressing the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.600
 start button and 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.040
 louis 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.040
 to this your screen pot 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.240
 classic and current Huawei phones 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.170
 let's know then to see what 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.170
 interface has 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.700
 well here is 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.530
 as you can see it does not bring the emotion and wii 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.530
 it's more 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.990
 a launcher similar to pure android 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.340
 we will turn up a little sparkle to the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.780
 screen so you can see 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.190
 best 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.049
 What I do notice is that the colors 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.240
 they are quite vivid the screen is 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.050
 it behaves very well 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.050
 I must admit that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.970
 but in terms of size I do not think what 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.340
 ideal and this would be in the 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.170
 personal scope for those who like 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.140
 the big screen phones 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.230
 would be quite ideal well we're going to the 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.300
 cntu bains marc and let's know the 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.540
 hardware features that has 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.540
 this team 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.040
 let's hope it loads and here in the info 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:05:01.280
 says so we have a huawei of 600 and 151 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:05.630
 an android operating system 4.2.2 a 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:11.330
 cpu mtk mts and 572 the same one that has the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:14.110
 of 511 the 330 and the jet 321 a gp a 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:18.650
 Mali 400 a screen resolution of 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.350
 480 x 854 pixels a rear camera of 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.660
 5 megapixels regarding the ram we have 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.650
 512 MB of which we only have 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.510
 usable 468 in terms of memory 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.180
 of the system we have for installation of 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.310
 applications 118 gigas of which 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.870
 we only have one gig available and in the 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.680
 internal memory which is for 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.900
 multimedia we have 1.27 gigas 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.210
 as for the CPU that is two cores 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.819
 at a frequency of 1.3 giga hertz 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.250
 on the screen we have the Mali 400 of 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:52.740
 that we had already discussed the resolution and 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.039
 we have 240 of bay that is in the 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.669
 pixel density of the screen here 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:03.430
 in the camera a good 5 megapixels ago 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.729
 and 0.3 megapixels in front 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.309
 all right 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.949
 despite everything we do not have a phone 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:12.960
 high- end however we have a 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.689
 pretty big phone had already 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.779
 commented that the size is not very comfortable 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:21.059
 it really is just a screen 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.710
 great already but you can not underestimate 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.809
 the fact that the screen has very 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.790
 good quality and the phone despite 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:29.770
 everything is pretty fluid 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.410
 already in the in-depth review we will give 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.130
 what is this all about and if the 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.620
 phone meets the expectations that 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.710
 are expected from a Huawei phone for a 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.690
 price of around 5 thousand bolivars and 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.730
 well guys this has been all for 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.590
 this video I hope you liked the 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.200
 same way I hope you liked the 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.870
 phone remember you should get 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.630
 on mobile phones for an approximate price of 5 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.510
 thousand bolivars you know we need the 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.200
 thorough review and we'll see you until the 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.200
 next video
