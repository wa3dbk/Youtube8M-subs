00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.650
 hello everyone and this is the last lesson on 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.930
 vocal change of light in this course 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.139
 and here we will try to deal with 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.639
 new problems in this photo and 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.460
 also something new we learn about 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.890
 landscapes in order to start we first 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.020
 let's see a little theory about landscapes 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.970
 in order to understand how to convey 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.670
 volume in the image we dip a little bit 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.980
 in art history around the 15th century 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.380
 when it is considered to learn at the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.629
 da vinci began to believe again 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.970
 one of the principles that 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.220
 called aerial perspective exactly 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.620
 he began to use it in addition to 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.390
 linear perspective what is it 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.040
 if you pay attention to the landscape behind 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.780
 Madonnas this notice that he 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.640
 is located as if in layers and 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.800
 each new layer becomes lighter 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.720
 previous what is meant 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.670
 In a particular case, you seem to be 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.800
 look at the fog that is, the further 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.440
 the object from you is the more hazy 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.110
 absorbs but fog is a particular example and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.030
 he is very very very very very rude 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.399
 exaggerated naturally this technique 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.380
 very often used by their modern 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.020
 digital painting and if you pay 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.459
 attention to the mountains you will notice that what 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.639
 further object from us so they become 

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:16.100
 such more blurry and lighter 

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:18.590
 plus they are also painted a little more 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.569
 in the color of the sky that is blue the same 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.549
 prominent on such landscapes only on this 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.939
 times the example of the land the closer the land 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.340
 to us it is darker and this applies not 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.439
 only landscapes of nature and urban 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.740
 landscapes including well and if you 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.679
 think it will be used but only in 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.179
 digital or in ordinary painting sinks 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.130
 photography too often exploit this 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.310
 reception because this reception is 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.079
 part of the real world just in 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.630
 photos and in the real world he is wrong 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.490
 strongly manifested but if you pay 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.419
 attention in this photo above london 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.579
 He also has the further building of the TASS 

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:57.829
 more they are covered in haze and leaves 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.130
 such a light blur despite 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.749
 what does not cacambo to speech does not go 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 accordingly, we see that distant 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.610
 building such on a lot on 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.950
 less contrast and those that are close to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.950
 us they are contrasting and cutting
