you<00:00:35.940> could<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:37.020> hydroponic<00:00:37.980> rocks<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you could use a hydroponic rocks and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.010 
you could use a hydroponic rocks and
have<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> hydroponic<00:00:39.149> solution<00:00:39.690> down<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020

they<00:00:47.910> screwed<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> lid<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> they<00:00:49.110> put<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
they screwed the lid on and they put a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.560 
they screwed the lid on and they put a
little<00:00:49.649> hole<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.520> used<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.969> wick<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
little hole and they used a wick now the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.470 
little hole and they used a wick now the
wick<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.230> anything<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.969> actually

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
wick can be anything that will actually

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.799 
wick can be anything that will actually
take<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> draw<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> water<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
take the draw the water up so it's a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
take the draw the water up so it's a
great<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.199> system<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.520> can

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
great little system to use and you can

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
great little system to use and you can
actually<00:00:59.960> some<00:01:00.960> people<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:01.739> screw

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
actually some people just actually screw

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.369 
actually some people just actually screw
away<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> lid<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> fill<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> water<00:01:04.260> up

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
away the lid and fill the water up

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
away the lid and fill the water up
higher<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> bottom<00:01:06.720> part<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
higher and just so the bottom part of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.929 
higher and just so the bottom part of
the<00:01:07.080> lid<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.260> sits<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> water<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the lid just sits in the water but the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
the lid just sits in the water but the
only<00:01:09.060> problem<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> water

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
only problem with that is as the water

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.310 
only problem with that is as the water
evaporates<00:01:10.950> away<00:01:11.150> then<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.689> plants<00:01:13.049> light<00:01:13.200> in

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
evaporates away then the plants light in

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
evaporates away then the plants light in
the<00:01:13.380> water<00:01:13.619> anymore<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> wicks<00:01:15.030> are

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the water anymore so the wicks are

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.810 
the water anymore so the wicks are
really<00:01:15.689> good<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:15.960> substitute<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
really good little substitute and you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.429 
really good little substitute and you
know<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.509> want<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.170> there

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
know you don't want to have to go there

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.130 
know you don't want to have to go there
and<00:01:19.500> water<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> time<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.689> container

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and water all the time and the container

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 
and water all the time and the container
is<00:01:22.320> great<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.799> you're<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> bit<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.400> recycler

that<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.280> before<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.909> put<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> seed<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:51.990> or

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that you before you put the seed in or

that you before you put the seed in or
put<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> plant<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.119> that

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
put the plant in that you get that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.990 
put the plant in that you get that
medium<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.009> there<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.399> soil<00:01:56.700> potting

you put this evening your net and if
you're<00:02:02.830> going<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.010> sprout<00:02:03.310> seed<00:02:03.670> do<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.510> a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
you're going to sprout seed do it in a

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.219 
you're going to sprout seed do it in a
warm<00:02:05.380> spot<00:02:05.560> out<00:02:06.010> of<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.250> Sun<00:02:06.960> possibly<00:02:07.960> even

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
warm spot out of the Sun possibly even

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.680 
warm spot out of the Sun possibly even
on<00:02:08.530> your<00:02:08.770> heater<00:02:09.490> or<00:02:09.759> something<00:02:10.179> like<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.540> or

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
on your heater or something like that or

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.500 
on your heater or something like that or
on<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> warm<00:02:11.520> windowsill<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.880> you'll<00:02:13.240> find

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
on a warm windowsill and you'll find

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.900 
on a warm windowsill and you'll find
that<00:02:13.630> after<00:02:13.810> time<00:02:14.250> yeah<00:02:15.250> they'll<00:02:15.490> start<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
that after time yeah they'll start to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.120 
that after time yeah they'll start to
sprout<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.480> grow<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.960> it's<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.440> great<00:02:17.830> little

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
sprout and grow and it's a great little

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.220 
sprout and grow and it's a great little
way<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.310> use<00:02:18.700> up<00:02:18.730> these<00:02:19.180> these<00:02:19.540> bottles<00:02:19.990> that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
way to use up these these bottles that

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.470 
way to use up these these bottles that
you<00:02:20.620> know<00:02:21.070> there<00:02:21.370> are<00:02:21.400> never-ending<00:02:21.730> resource

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
you know there are never-ending resource

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.600 
you know there are never-ending resource
that's<00:02:22.750> for<00:02:22.960> sure<00:02:23.140> okay<00:02:24.010> let's<00:02:24.250> go<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
that's for sure okay let's go to the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.020 
that's for sure okay let's go to the
next<00:02:24.820> one<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.500> can<00:02:29.680> see<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.250> created<00:02:30.910> a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
next one here you can see is created a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.000 
next one here you can see is created a
vertical<00:02:31.690> bottle<00:02:32.110> garden<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.680> he's<00:02:32.770> growing

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
vertical bottle garden and he's growing

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.890 
vertical bottle garden and he's growing
lots<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.370> lettuce<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.910> things<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.420> there<00:02:34.660> and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
lots of lettuce and things in there and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.690 
lots of lettuce and things in there and
you<00:02:35.320> know<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> great<00:02:36.220> little<00:02:36.490> system

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
you know this is a great little system

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.730 
you know this is a great little system
but<00:02:37.090> what<00:02:37.450> he's<00:02:37.540> done<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.050> paint<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.470> black

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
but what he's done is you paint it black

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.980 
but what he's done is you paint it black
around<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> outside<00:02:39.820> where<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.570> root<00:02:40.780> area

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
around the outside where the root area

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.500 
around the outside where the root area
is<00:02:41.350> because<00:02:41.920> I'm<00:02:42.160> some<00:02:42.700> people<00:02:42.970> believe<00:02:43.240> that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
is because I'm some people believe that

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.360 
is because I'm some people believe that
the<00:02:43.690> light<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> roots<00:02:44.530> affects<00:02:44.950> them<00:02:45.160> I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the light on the roots affects them I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.340 
the light on the roots affects them I
found<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.940> just<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.480> parent<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.930> you're<00:02:47.170> very

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
found that just a parent if you're very

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.010 
found that just a parent if you're very
strong<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:47.950> I'm<00:02:48.010> not<00:02:48.220> yes<00:02:48.580> if<00:02:49.480> you're<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:49.840> low

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
strong so I'm not yes if you're in low

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.290 
strong so I'm not yes if you're in low
light<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.920> doesn't<00:02:51.250> really<00:02:51.580> matter<00:02:52.000> too

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
light then it doesn't really matter too

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.060 
light then it doesn't really matter too
much<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:53.140> there's<00:02:53.380> some<00:02:53.530> plenty<00:02:53.860> great

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
much but there's some plenty great

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.920 
much but there's some plenty great
systems<00:02:54.550> around<00:02:54.820> like<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.209> on<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> net<00:02:55.750> that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
systems around like this on the net that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.510 
systems around like this on the net that
you<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.320> find<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:58.050> they<00:02:59.050> work<00:02:59.350> really<00:02:59.920> quite

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
you can find and they work really quite

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.310 
you can find and they work really quite
well<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:01.600> you're<00:03:01.720> limited<00:03:02.110> for<00:03:02.290> space

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
well and if you're limited for space

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.580 
well and if you're limited for space
going<00:03:02.920> vertical<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.790> using<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.350> type

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
going vertical and using this this type

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.560 
going vertical and using this this type
of<00:03:05.620> system<00:03:06.130> where<00:03:06.550> it's<00:03:06.730> all<00:03:06.910> linked<00:03:07.209> up<00:03:07.300> so

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
of system where it's all linked up so

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.970 
of system where it's all linked up so
you<00:03:07.660> water<00:03:07.900> at<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.110> top<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> all<00:03:08.800> runs

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
you water at the top and it all runs

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.640 
you water at the top and it all runs
through<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.640> oh<00:03:09.850> yeah<00:03:10.269> save<00:03:10.959> water<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.410> then

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
through and oh yeah save water and then

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.800 
through and oh yeah save water and then
you<00:03:11.739> can<00:03:11.890> gather<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.310> again<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.120> go<00:03:13.269> again<00:03:13.570> so

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
you can gather it again and go again so

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.289 
you can gather it again and go again so
you<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.170> use<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> hydroponic<00:03:15.190> system<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:16.120> can

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
you can use a hydroponic system you can

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.170 
you can use a hydroponic system you can
use<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:17.080> normal<00:03:17.530> potting<00:03:18.190> mixes<00:03:18.489> or<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.030> can

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
use just normal potting mixes or you can

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.940 
use just normal potting mixes or you can
actually<00:03:19.360> even<00:03:19.780> these<00:03:20.019> studies<00:03:20.380> get<00:03:20.560> organic

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
actually even these studies get organic

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.699 
actually even these studies get organic
hydroponics<00:03:21.820> which<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.239> would<00:03:22.720> recommend<00:03:22.810> for

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
hydroponics which I would recommend for

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.830 
hydroponics which I would recommend for
a<00:03:23.950> system<00:03:24.580> such<00:03:24.910> as<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.180> one<00:03:25.420> because<00:03:25.720> they

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
a system such as this one because they

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.090 
a system such as this one because they
just<00:03:26.019> stay<00:03:26.290> nice<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.590> clean

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
just stay nice and clean

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.150 
just stay nice and clean
alright<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.330> that's<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.690> for<00:03:28.930> me<00:03:29.080> I'm<00:03:29.920> going<00:03:30.100> to
