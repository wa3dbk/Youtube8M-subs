00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.660
 So we had the feeling today and there Klinsmann Klinsmann was called 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.340
 every player was celebrated a movie pretends the impression or to the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.950
 Smokers now feel the time in the defense is actually starting 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.630
 Only want to carry crew 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.130
 yes that was our feeling I'm interested is the dancer very much 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.399
 euphoric 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.310
 and he celebrated only one single player 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.910
 especially nice atmosphere 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.130
 Kresnik be that behind us now what percent 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.830
 is relaxing 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.690
 again and again disappointed to come Iceland 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.870
 and to have enjoyed a perfect postler but ours only for sight or me 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.710
 for the colleagues 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.580
 Century not to workout but mad of this 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.600
 Stress is coming and still waiting for us in the camp you have there 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 Not so much felt and therefore I believe 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.710
 that is very very pleasant 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.960
 Use Lienz this week 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 I was very surprised they are not quite complete after 5 40 minutes from the place 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 happy by the umpires in advance percent portrays 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.660
 yes that is but if that was planned 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.810
 Now they do not want to use every free minute to deal with the defense 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770
 einzuspielen 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.109
 her house was spoken in advance 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.460
 different the first 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.460
 so as not to be in the second half of over 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.530
 because I have the core problem 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.790
 I think these are decisions of the coaches and 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.440
 it has to be full 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.700
 in% a great season played at Arsenal Londen are now the number 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.719
 but one in the German goal also have these 19 4 minutes 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.840
 in the champions league endgame experienced the dismissal 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.409
 and have always said human that i've ticked off how can you do that so fast 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.550
 APA 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 Reich will always be 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.890
 from people like Linux 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.490
 Of course, even from Becher's mouth it is very much so that I think then 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.310
 but 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.740
 to harvest training work here with the national team percent 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.720
 it is completely pushed aside it certainly gives him «When my times 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.630
 come where I think about it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.270
 but right now 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.599
 maybe you also say human who knows what it was good for me there 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.599
 not now with the absolute sense of achievement needs 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.179
 Of course I hope 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.179
 I think if you play such a game 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.209
 After that, I do not want to play well and the next one of his new ones 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.099
 July 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.250
 we are working hard for it and of course we hope that we will work with the 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.799
 Support the fans as much as we enjoyed today very much 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.749
 come far and make that possible 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.629
 Of course the question is very much appreciated 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.389
 in games there we have some problems of 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.930
 Joachim Löw is also in Geneva doing that sometimes really sour because the game 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.379
 from the defense often did not work out 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.829
 can this work out so quickly and get in and wm-ripe 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.539
 the advantage is yes that is compared to this 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.069
 four teams 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.069
 the same time all the same time 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.799
 that is to say 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.769
 Rome is perfect to make it difficult 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.099
 but also in comparison with the others 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.229
 and I hope 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.219
 Pröll is better off 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.909
 and that is only right 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.319
 if you look at the guys by Petersen Mertesacker who was unsure in the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.109
 second round 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.519
 Dyson hat has played a little as with Zeller who can fight Ude 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.660
 Nowottny was not always a national team for two years 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.909
 how good, then, really percent among us so well 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.909
 they feel behind such a defense behind such a central defense 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.099
 the real basis 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.649
 because the experience was made 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.639
 In the last year with percent sees different defensive formations played 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.419
 have 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.419
 and they all have a training camp as well 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.919
 and we never played there 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.299
 the advantage is that a victor has enumerated 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.439
 with the stories they also called percent that they all 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.039
 have to pay a lot of numbers 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.699
 Walton just did not play that much or through various other stuff 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:50.669
 to 7 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.259
 in the last song handicap 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.799
 So one learns for them have the positive thinking in any case in sight 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.290
 there was a survey in the skin line editorship here on ZDF 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.969
 Who is currently the best goalkeeper in the world 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.280
 they are by far ahead of the game and Cech 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.330
 is this now German optimism or to the people 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.149
 the renovation concept from the Westerwald 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.209
 I think there is one 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.299
 a few good tips he very good goalie 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.249
 and now, of course, there is more 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.319
 Percent of relatively successful songs could play with Orson but as I said 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.860
 I almost never alone but I have 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.210
 perfectly working 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.680
 Team played 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.840
 behind one 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.789
 great organized save around 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.279
 that was of course a bit higher rated 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.800
 but if it pleases me too 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.960
 thanks a lot Jens Lehmann and we wish him again «whole team 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.200
 of course Kafka's success
