00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.799
 all along this trip we are accompanied by our satellite 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:17.839
 she is there on other screens and at the same time 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.659
 in front of your window 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.659
 your screen is the local pub spaceship earth 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.019
 the moon and almost a month to make a complete turn around the earth 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.310
 seen from the earth the moon seems to follow roughly the same path as the sun 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.030
 she rises at ease he lies to the west like the sun 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.730
 but beware 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 if the sun seems to get up in the morning and go to bed at night 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.200
 it is that the earth turns while the sun remains firmly 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 center of the solar system 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.980
 so every day around noon we find the sun in the same 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 portion of the sky 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.920
 with the city these different 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.860
 it is she who turns around the earth 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.290
 slowly 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.470
 and every day she shifts 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.730
 at the same time you will not see it in the same place as today 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.380
 but this width tomorrow 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 further left 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.710
 advancing on his name 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.890
 the moon comes the one nor with distant planets it allows you to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 find them in the sky 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 saturne for example at the other end of the solar system 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.710
 the city here 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 illarine width of left hand 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 if you take saturne as a landmark 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.990
 you can measure the daily lag of the moon 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 one evening the moon is to the right of this winter 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.070
 she will be passed 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.190
 with saturated conches 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.840
 every day the light seems shifted to the left of dollars a day 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.610
 tomorrow 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.450
 but every day the moon passes with 50 minutes late on the eve 50 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.060
 minutes 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.679
 it's time for the moon but to walk the width of tomorrow 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.679
 to get to where he was yesterday at the same time 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.919
 every night different life 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.879
 she keeps changing 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.099
 one day this growing appetite 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.989
 the next day a croissant a little thicker 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.299
 and a day later 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.299
 even more and maybe not 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.759
 but why a crescent 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.259
 in space the moon always has a shop run by the sun 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.369
 but from the earth the moon in another perspective 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:42.259
 for us 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.259
 it departs every day a little more sun 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.779
 when the skylight barely offset from the sun 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:50.979
 he appears to us almost against 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.979
 and we see that a small part of his shop 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.949
 a croissant 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.519
 the sun goes down 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.829
 he is there right just below their stake 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.279
 that's where he is at night 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.929
 the crescent and always directed to the sun of course since this is the 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.149
 sun that lights 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.149
 and every day the moon departs a little more sun 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.889
 every day from the earth we see a wider part of his half 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.279
 clairet 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.939
 a croissant that is growing every day 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.939
 and who will become 2009 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.949
 it's in its 2009 phase 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.199
 that the moon flies over three orbits 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.199
 she crosses the path that the earth has just traveled 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.879
 every day the earth takes a turn on itself 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.189
 during this day laguna continue his journey 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.689
 we perceive it so shift to the left 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.269
 she will reach the line on which was the day before 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.269
 with 50 minutes late 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.829
 by crossing their life from the earth 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.939
 the halfpipe becomes late landmarks that allows us to imagine our own 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.589
 course 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.589
 normally we can not really see where the earth is going 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.870
 the day of the half-moon 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.239
 we can see where he comes from 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.259
 when you see the middle this is where the earth stood 4 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.469
 watch your watches 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.110
 look at 2010 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.889
 it's up there in this sky 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.740
 ouf yourself you were four years ago 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.840
 and in four years 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.800
 the half-moon will have taken our place it will be there we are for this moment 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.400
 even 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.389
 for once 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.779
 looking at the half moon you can imagine I will be nothing visible 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.370
 who drives us for a year around the sun 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.210
 the moon shifting more and more 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.099
 and spend every night 50 minutes later 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.770
 ended up not only appearing at night but also the day 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.189
 when it enters the second quarter of its orbit 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.629
 she becomes so bright that we can see her two days 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.629
 afternoon in the southeast 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.120
 where does the full moon come from 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.830
 I do not really know 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.550
 maybe at the beginning when the primitive earth was not yet enough 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.550
 compact but which tone is mounted very quickly 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.729
 bomber eventually came off 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.729
 decades this tour around the earth 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.490
 but one may also come 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.439
 a distant part of the solar system 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.110
 passing too close to the earth she was captured by the forces of attraction 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.050
 put into orbit 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:05:59.869
 a collision 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.869
 with an asteroid 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.770
 the debris little by little did not agglomerate 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.770
 and finally formed what is today our struggle 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.429
 a moon that accompanies us throughout our journey around the sun 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.740
 seeing one of the qualities of the evening 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.740
 we can imagine his journey around the earth 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.580
 we can also imagine the crs 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.580
 in which the moon is moving around the earth 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.509
 and when the late limit of 50 minutes 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.930
 it's a time lag 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.240
 the same thing happens so in space and in time 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.639
 during this trip we will see 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.339
 space 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:59.339
 they are very close cousins 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.129
 we are here 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.520
 we provide along our orbit hassan 7000 kilometers an hour 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:07.419
 in two months we arrive there 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.719
 other vernal point 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:12.490
 which means the weight of spring 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.889
 a hole in space 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:14.750
 or in points in time
