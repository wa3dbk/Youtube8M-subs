00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
wow you're buying a kids game so it's a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.740 
wow you're buying a kids game so it's a
little<00:02:37.660> bit<00:02:37.780> different<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:40.060> think

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
little bit different but I think

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.750 
little bit different but I think
Nintendo<00:02:41.440> will<00:02:41.590> get<00:02:41.739> away<00:02:41.920> with<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.519> they

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
Nintendo will get away with it and they

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.090 
Nintendo will get away with it and they
can<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.150> sell<00:02:43.780> splatoon<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.380> know<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.799> fine

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
can just sell splatoon you know so fine

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.099 
can just sell splatoon you know so fine
but<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.819> will<00:02:45.970> definitely<00:02:46.269> hurt<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.840> sales

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
but this will definitely hurt the sales

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.770 
but this will definitely hurt the sales
