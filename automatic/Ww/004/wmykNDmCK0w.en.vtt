00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.399
 or what is current we are back 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.309
 and we did not find this time in a video 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.950
 to inform them about the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.139
 good xbox minecraft update 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.020
 for the moment I connected and well now 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 It's 12 with your account and 2 as well 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.929
 half an hour I connected and it turned out that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.949
 he asked me for a minecraft update of 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:27.660
 durban and well I saw the weight that are 570 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.169
 megabytes I thought it was the update 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.590
 large that will come out of 1.6 point 4 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.899
 of pc but good describes it and then I 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 I can check it out and it's just the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 update an update 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.420
 correction of errors is coming 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 the t4 for xbox one since the output of 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.710
 minecraft xbox one would be like had 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.699
 one the following error correction 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.890
 it was the all 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.390
 the previous correction errors is the you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.270
 3 and this one is coming out now 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.360
 or that they will leave the update 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.500
 of minecraft is 4 and it would be good 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.880
 equivalent to your 19 if we were 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.580
 in minecraft 360 would be the 39 if it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 update minecraft 360 I know it's 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.500
 Now 18 would be the two 19 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.810
 equivalent to your 9 then the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.009
 next update that comes out if it's 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.290
 the big update that we are 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.920
 waiting all then you will be the 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.250
 sub-20 for all the consoles but 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.440
 well now we are in the 4 of xbox one 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.300
 and on 18 of 360, I imagine that 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.090
 place interest there is always station 4 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.050
 there will be in updates too but 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.119
 good 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.240
 I thought it was behind the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.740
 big update but baby not in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.250
 how much did I go to 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.560
 I went to the game I opened one of my maps and 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.100
 I saw that everything was normal to open in 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.560
 creative all the objects and just 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.299
 they were the same objects but well 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.009
 I hope you are soon update 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.500
 that means that it will soon come out 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.959
 and the update maybe they are 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.130
 fine tuning minecraft so that for 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.480
 that is according to the update 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.269
 coming 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.400
 the big update that comes and it 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.040
 can play correctly since there are 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.830
 many new modalities that were going to go 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.380
 to come out in the new update the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.470
 which have to adjust them to the game 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.910
 so you can put them in and you can 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.100
 play perfectly well on consoles like this 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.040
 that's good if they have minecraft of 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.630
 facebook go and have not checked go and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.500
 you will see that there is an update with a 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.030
 very heavy weight of 570 megabytes is 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.660
 too heavy for his I thought that the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 big update 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.000
 in 300 the updates are not very 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.850
 heavy are small but in the world 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.780
 one obvious good because the maps are more 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.860
 big bigger ones and that's why I think 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.420
 that because of that it weighs a little bit more and 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.150
 well I was also downloading master 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.730
 chief collection and I had to cancel it 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.740
 to be able to download this update 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.320
 but well this one we must surprise that 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.050
 it's not what I expected so good 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.680
 I hope I hope you serve this the t4 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.130
 of xbox one and between 60 is had it 18 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.620
 if you update the 360's as well 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.570
 Now the one is going to be called the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.840
 19 and then the next update 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.230
 bigger would be your 20 unless 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.290
 out another error correction 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.629
 and that's all thanks for being in this 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.629
 piece of video we see each god
