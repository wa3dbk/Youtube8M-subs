00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
primary root chord so here's your G

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.390 
primary root chord so here's your G
chord<00:00:23.900> but<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:25.080> move<00:00:25.289> over<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> C<00:00:26.070> chord

G now when you're a C chord you go from

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.200 
G now when you're a C chord you go from
seeing<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> root<00:01:13.020> position<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:14.310> F<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.909> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
seeing the root position to F in this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.990 
seeing the root position to F in this
second<00:01:15.720> inverted<00:01:16.170> position<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> back<00:01:17.789> to

second inverted position and back to
seeing<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> root<00:01:18.600> position<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:23.700> time<00:01:23.759> we're

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
seeing the root position this time we're

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.020 
seeing the root position this time we're
going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.539> use<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.799> soul<00:01:26.130> gospel<00:01:26.369> technique

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
to use a really easy one here and that's

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.350 
to use a really easy one here and that's
just<00:02:46.000> we<00:02:46.150> play<00:02:46.420> left<00:02:47.200> hand<00:02:47.410> solid<00:02:47.980> chord<00:02:48.360> and

you<00:04:26.610> get<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> idea<00:04:27.210> like<00:04:27.390> that<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:27.870> that's<00:04:27.960> a

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
you get the idea like that so that's a

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.770 
you get the idea like that so that's a
real<00:04:28.590> simple<00:04:28.890> pattern<00:04:29.370> we'll<00:04:30.240> try<00:04:30.420> some<00:04:30.630> other

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
real simple pattern we'll try some other

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.200 
real simple pattern we'll try some other
patterns<00:04:31.170> here<00:04:31.350> too<00:04:31.590> okay<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:32.790> time<00:04:32.820> we're

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
patterns here too okay this time we're

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.280 
patterns here too okay this time we're
going<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.600> do<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.220> more<00:04:35.220> complicated<00:04:35.640> type<00:04:36.150> of

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
going to do a more complicated type of

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.450 
going to do a more complicated type of
comping<00:04:37.290> pattern<00:04:37.320> not<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.070> say<00:04:38.250> there<00:04:38.430> are

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
comping pattern not like I say there are

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.310 
comping pattern not like I say there are
thousands<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.000> ways<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.450> can<00:04:39.570> comp<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.050> song

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.589 
playing this this chord here in the
second<00:05:24.750> inverted<00:05:25.110> position<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:25.620> get<00:05:25.770> G

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
second inverted position so you get G

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.420 
second inverted position so you get G
and<00:05:27.599> C<00:05:27.990> in<00:05:28.259> the<00:05:28.349> second<00:05:28.740> inverted<00:05:29.039> position

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
and C in the second inverted position

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.850 
and C in the second inverted position
the<00:05:30.360> back<00:05:30.539> to<00:05:30.659> G

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.989 

like<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:36.039> so<00:05:36.159> you<00:05:36.219> could<00:05:36.399> use<00:05:36.550> that<00:05:36.580> cop

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:36.999 
like that so you could use that cop

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.939 
like that so you could use that cop
pattern<00:05:37.449> and<00:05:37.659> the<00:05:37.869> backup<00:05:38.229> acquire<00:05:38.589> something

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
pattern and the backup acquire something

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.010 
pattern and the backup acquire something
like<00:05:39.099> that<00:05:39.339> so<00:05:40.029> I'll<00:05:40.300> play<00:05:40.479> a<00:05:40.509> few<00:05:40.629> measures

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
like that so I'll play a few measures

00:05:41.020 --> 00:06:08.230 
like that so I'll play a few measures
doing<00:05:41.679> this<00:05:41.770> for<00:05:42.009> you

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.990 

blah

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
blah

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.850 
blah
I

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.470 

but<00:06:17.860> last<00:06:18.070> ending<00:06:18.430> there<00:06:18.640> is<00:06:18.760> called<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.030> Amen

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
but last ending there is called the Amen

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.920 
but last ending there is called the Amen
ending<00:06:19.810> goes<00:06:19.960> like<00:06:20.110> this<00:06:24.390> let's<00:06:25.390> back<00:06:25.600> up<00:06:25.630> now

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
ending goes like this let's back up now

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.890 
ending goes like this let's back up now
you<00:06:25.990> see<00:06:26.290> the<00:06:26.920> last<00:06:27.100> two<00:06:27.310> measures<00:06:27.730> you<00:06:28.180> have<00:06:28.420> a

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
you see the last two measures you have a

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.610 
you see the last two measures you have a
G<00:06:29.590> chord<00:06:29.620> in<00:06:30.280> the<00:06:30.780> second<00:06:31.780> inverted<00:06:32.050> position

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.490 

the<00:06:35.620> D<00:06:35.860> chord<00:06:36.130> I<00:06:36.810> and<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.960> last<00:06:38.140> voice<00:06:38.350> should

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
the D chord I and the last voice should

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.990 
the D chord I and the last voice should
be<00:06:38.530> G<00:06:38.890> but<00:06:39.130> instead<00:06:39.310> of<00:06:39.370> going<00:06:39.550> to<00:06:39.670> a<00:06:39.760> G<00:06:39.970> chord

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
be G but instead of going to a G chord

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.250 
be G but instead of going to a G chord
we'll<00:06:40.390> just<00:06:40.540> go<00:06:40.630> to<00:06:40.720> a<00:06:40.840> C<00:06:41.050> chord<00:06:41.520> C<00:06:43.080> and<00:06:44.080> there's

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
we'll just go to a C chord C and there's

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.130 
we'll just go to a C chord C and there's
drop<00:06:44.500> it<00:06:44.620> down<00:06:44.740> to<00:06:45.010> a<00:06:45.040> G<00:06:45.370> chord<00:06:45.400> like<00:06:45.730> that<00:06:46.140> and

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
drop it down to a G chord like that and

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.830 
drop it down to a G chord like that and
then<00:06:47.290> down<00:06:47.440> like<00:06:47.620> this<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.820> I<00:06:49.450> kept<00:06:49.660> running

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
then down like this and I kept running

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.719 
then down like this and I kept running
out<00:06:50.050> of<00:06:50.080> space<00:06:50.350> for<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.740> other<00:06:51.370> hand

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.510 

let's<00:06:56.729> assume<00:06:57.120> the<00:06:57.360> thumb<00:06:57.600> stays<00:06:57.870> steady<00:06:58.520> and

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
let's assume the thumb stays steady and

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.550 
let's assume the thumb stays steady and
then<00:06:59.820> your<00:07:00.000> pinky<00:07:00.479> middle<00:07:00.870> finger<00:07:01.110> move<00:07:01.320> down

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
then your pinky middle finger move down

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.030 
then your pinky middle finger move down
a<00:07:01.590> key<00:07:01.910> move<00:07:02.910> down<00:07:03.120> another<00:07:03.330> key<00:07:03.630> I<00:07:03.900> live<00:07:04.830> down

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
a key move down another key I live down

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.940 
a key move down another key I live down
another<00:07:05.280> key<00:07:05.870> right<00:07:06.870> here<00:07:06.900> the<00:07:07.139> same<00:07:07.380> thing

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.490 

it's<00:07:10.430> called<00:07:10.640> the<00:07:10.730> Amen<00:07:11.090> ending<00:07:11.420> ok<00:07:12.140> well<00:07:12.350> this

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
it's called the Amen ending ok well this

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.610 
it's called the Amen ending ok well this
