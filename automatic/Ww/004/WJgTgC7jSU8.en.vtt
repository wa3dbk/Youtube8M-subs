00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
and I wanted to go and building a little

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.980 
and I wanted to go and building a little
damn<00:00:24.470> riding<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.590> sewer<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.039> suits<00:00:26.400> green

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
damn riding that sewer that suits green

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
damn riding that sewer that suits green
yeah<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.890> how<00:00:29.039> there's<00:00:29.250> erosion<00:00:29.849> then

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
yeah and see how there's erosion then

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.440 
yeah and see how there's erosion then
what<00:00:30.990> generally<00:00:31.439> causes<00:00:31.710> erosion<00:00:32.600> water<00:00:33.980> okay

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
what generally causes erosion water okay

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
what generally causes erosion water okay
so<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> natural<00:00:37.230> place<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> put<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so it would be a natural place to put a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.889 
so it would be a natural place to put a
little<00:00:38.520> storage<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.270> there<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.450> could<00:00:39.690> build

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
little storage in there I could build

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.840 
little storage in there I could build
one<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.469> i'll<00:00:40.829> build<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> i'll<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.760> on

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
one in there i'll build it i'll get on

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
one in there i'll build it i'll get on
the<00:00:41.969> bulldozer<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.780> i'll<00:00:43.770> build<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.250> make

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the bulldozer and i'll build to make

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.950 
the bulldozer and i'll build to make
achiever<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:47.190> could<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> builder<00:00:48.360> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
achiever and we could go and builder you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.959 
achiever and we could go and builder you
know<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.289> five<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.620> five<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.520> ten<00:00:50.760> acre

foot<00:00:51.270> pond<00:00:51.600> there<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.430> we'd<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.520> able<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
foot pond there and we'd be able to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
foot pond there and we'd be able to
catch<00:00:53.969> put<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.079> little<00:00:55.199> wings<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> which

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and we just have to build a little pot

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.720 
and we just have to build a little pot
there<00:02:57.139> which<00:02:57.379> doesn't<00:02:57.799> take<00:02:58.010> up<00:02:58.189> much<00:02:58.250> too

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
there which doesn't take up much too

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.119 
there which doesn't take up much too
much<00:02:58.909> space<00:02:59.269> and<00:02:59.629> then<00:03:00.349> we've<00:03:00.620> got<00:03:00.650> something

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
much space and then we've got something

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.800 
much space and then we've got something
there<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:01.519> we<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.970> then<00:03:02.000> irrigate<00:03:02.569> some

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
there that we can then irrigate some

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.990 
there that we can then irrigate some
pasture<00:03:03.049> with<00:03:03.409> later<00:03:03.709> now<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.790> good<00:03:04.939> thing

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
pasture with later now the good thing

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.170 
pasture with later now the good thing
about<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.659> is<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:06.139> if<00:03:06.439> we<00:03:06.680> irrigate<00:03:07.189> pasture

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
about it is to if we irrigate pasture

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.809 
about it is to if we irrigate pasture
then<00:03:08.720> we<00:03:08.959> radically<00:03:09.260> increase<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.489> amount<00:03:10.730> of

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
then we radically increase the amount of

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.140 
then we radically increase the amount of
carbon<00:03:11.030> dioxide<00:03:12.459> sequestered<00:03:13.459> as<00:03:13.579> well<00:03:13.819> so

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
carbon dioxide sequestered as well so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.970 
carbon dioxide sequestered as well so
it's<00:03:14.299> got<00:03:14.629> its<00:03:15.199> got<00:03:15.349> some<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.709> know<00:03:15.829> you've

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
it's got its got some you know you've

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.250 
it's got its got some you know you've
got<00:03:16.010> some<00:03:16.419> multiple<00:03:17.419> benefits<00:03:17.930> what<00:03:18.109> you'll

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
got some multiple benefits what you'll

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.659 
got some multiple benefits what you'll
call<00:03:18.349> synergies<00:03:19.359> involved<00:03:20.359> here<00:03:20.650> yeah<00:03:21.669> so

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
call synergies involved here yeah so

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.970 
call synergies involved here yeah so
yeah<00:03:22.849> he'll<00:03:23.569> know<00:03:23.750> that's<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.049> dumb<00:03:24.500> just

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
yeah he'll know that's just dumb just
