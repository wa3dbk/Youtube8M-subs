00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
work on next-gen I don't know at all i

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.200 
work on next-gen I don't know at all i
have<00:06:07.600> is<00:06:07.720> the<00:06:07.900> previous<00:06:08.320> gen<00:06:08.560> 360<00:06:09.190> but<00:06:10.000> it

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
have is the previous gen 360 but it

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.730 
have is the previous gen 360 but it
works<00:06:10.480> on<00:06:10.600> ps4<00:06:11.050> okay<00:06:11.350> I've<00:06:11.440> just<00:06:11.590> got

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
works on ps4 okay I've just got

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.200 
works on ps4 okay I've just got
confirmation<00:06:11.920> from<00:06:12.310> somebody<00:06:12.760> in<00:06:12.790> my<00:06:12.940> stream

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
confirmation from somebody in my stream

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.480 
confirmation from somebody in my stream
and<00:06:13.450> it<00:06:13.510> works<00:06:13.720> on<00:06:13.870> ps4<00:06:14.500> as<00:06:14.620> well<00:06:14.830> so<00:06:15.400> that's

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
and it works on ps4 as well so that's

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.890 
and it works on ps4 as well so that's
saying<00:06:15.730> that<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.000> works<00:06:16.150> on<00:06:16.300> next-gen<00:06:16.720> and

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
saying that it works on next-gen and

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.620 
saying that it works on next-gen and
previous<00:06:17.410> gen<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:18.160> there's<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.150> simple<00:06:19.480> glitch

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
previous gen so there's a simple glitch

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.760 
previous gen so there's a simple glitch
I<00:06:19.810> guess<00:06:19.960> we're<00:06:20.110> going<00:06:20.230> to<00:06:20.290> test<00:06:20.410> right<00:06:20.590> now<00:06:20.620> to

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
I guess we're going to test right now to

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.730 
I guess we're going to test right now to
see<00:06:20.980> if<00:06:21.010> you<00:06:21.190> can<00:06:21.370> see<00:06:21.640> it<00:06:21.670> in<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:22.090> game<00:06:22.740> did

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
try not next-gen yourself if it doesn't

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.810 
try not next-gen yourself if it doesn't
