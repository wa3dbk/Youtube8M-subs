strategy<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.269> Town<00:00:16.199> Hall<00:00:16.470> level<00:00:16.500> 7<00:00:17.279> i'm

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
strategy for Town Hall level 7 i'm

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.580 
strategy for Town Hall level 7 i'm
starting<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> bubble<00:00:18.510> six<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.109> i'm<00:00:19.380> almost

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
starting to bubble six and i'm almost

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.920 
starting to bubble six and i'm almost
level<00:00:19.980> seven<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.609> i<00:00:20.880> guess<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.600> compatible

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
level seven so i guess it's compatible

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.490 
level seven so i guess it's compatible
with<00:00:22.230> both<00:00:23.090> later<00:00:24.090> Town<00:00:24.660> Hall<00:00:24.689> level<00:00:24.869> 7<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
with both later Town Hall level 7 it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.210 
with both later Town Hall level 7 it
might<00:00:25.680> not<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.890> ideal<00:00:26.449> anyway<00:00:27.449> um<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.410> yeah<00:00:28.529> so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
might not be ideal anyway um so yeah so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.890 
might not be ideal anyway um so yeah so
that<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.519> don't<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.760> them<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.630> best

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that I don't have them with the best

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
that I don't have them with the best
video<00:00:31.230> quality<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.250> simply
