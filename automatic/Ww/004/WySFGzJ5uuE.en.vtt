can do as well so if you're just looking
through<00:03:03.680> generally<00:03:04.130> try<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.700> find<00:03:04.850> some

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
cheap players on an open bid and if you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.440 
cheap players on an open bid and if you
can't<00:03:07.250> find<00:03:07.460> them<00:03:07.700> then<00:03:07.880> look<00:03:08.150> for<00:03:08.330> each

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
can't find them then look for each

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.480 
can't find them then look for each
player<00:03:08.720> individually<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.160> might<00:03:10.310> want<00:03:10.460> to

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
player individually so you might want to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.700 
player individually so you might want to
look<00:03:10.580> with<00:03:10.760> zero<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.510> just<00:03:12.140> stage<00:03:12.320> in<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.560> min

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
look with zero and just stage in a min

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.020 
look with zero and just stage in a min
and<00:03:12.920> then<00:03:13.130> after<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.670> might<00:03:13.820> want<00:03:13.970> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
and then after that you might want to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.540 
and then after that you might want to
look<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.840> de<00:03:15.200> novo<00:03:15.320> marlin<00:03:16.010> then<00:03:16.310> after

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
look for a de novo marlin then after

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.160 
look for a de novo marlin then after
that<00:03:16.670> Walcott's<00:03:17.180> something<00:03:17.600> like<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.930> and

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
that Walcott's something like that and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.990 
that Walcott's something like that and
also<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:19.160> well<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.520> might<00:03:19.670> want<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.880> look<00:03:19.940> at

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
also as well you might want to look at

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.699 
also as well you might want to look at
them<00:03:20.120> out<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.540> position<00:03:20.660> because<00:03:21.500> that's<00:03:21.650> a

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
them out of position because that's a

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.229 
them out of position because that's a
good<00:03:21.860> way<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.040> make<00:03:22.220> coins<00:03:22.459> as<00:03:22.640> well<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.000> say

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
good way to make coins as well so say

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.930 
good way to make coins as well so say

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
for example as used in a striker if you

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.130 
for example as used in a striker if you
want<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> look<00:03:26.270> them<00:03:26.420> up<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.720> sentiment

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
want to look them up in a sentiment

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.080 
want to look them up in a sentiment
because<00:03:27.290> people<00:03:27.709> do<00:03:27.800> convey<00:03:28.130> at<00:03:28.190> them<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.580> you

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
because people do convey at them and you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.520 
because people do convey at them and you
might<00:03:29.300> find<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.630> really<00:03:29.750> tube<00:03:29.989> deal<00:03:30.230> as<00:03:30.380> well

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.590 
might find a really tube deal as well
that's<00:03:30.920> one<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.250> look<00:03:31.340> out<00:03:31.459> for<00:03:31.520> also<00:03:32.330> look<00:03:32.450> off

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
and to be honest that's pretty much the

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.540 
and to be honest that's pretty much the
best<00:03:36.170> way<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.410> do<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.890> like<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.190> preferred<00:03:37.520> it

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
home kit goes around okay i believe so

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.120 
home kit goes around okay i believe so
it<00:04:11.840> might<00:04:11.989> go<00:04:12.140> up<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.320> down<00:04:12.470> correct<00:04:13.010> me<00:04:13.040> if

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
it might go up and down correct me if

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.100 
it might go up and down correct me if
I'm<00:04:13.250> wrong<00:04:13.280> but<00:04:13.430> if<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.239> goes<00:04:14.360> for<00:04:14.510> okay<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.050> I

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
I'm wrong but if it goes for okay and I

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.229 
I'm wrong but if it goes for okay and I
think<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.440> yellow<00:04:15.650> one<00:04:15.860> goes<00:04:16.370> for<00:04:16.519> out<00:04:16.609> 600<00:04:16.940> to

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
think the yellow one goes for out 600 to

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.120 
think the yellow one goes for out 600 to
650<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.169> if<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.380> can<00:04:18.500> try<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.739> pick<00:04:18.890> them<00:04:19.040> up
