00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.480
 Hi, I'm jeavá hartmann and I work at 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.790
 university of são paulo in the group d 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.450
 for magnetism together with the teacher 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.309
 Ricardo you met in module 1 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.350
 during the four years my PhD I 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.679
 I collected analyzed about 600 fragments 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.199
 of brick churches and old houses of the 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.239
 bahia sao paulo and rio de janeiro 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.800
 holy spirit 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.869
 these bricks searched the field 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.899
 magnetic of Brazil in the past 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.640
 in the same way as the rocks the bricks 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.740
 when they are trained they acquire a 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 called land 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.160
 remnants can see more details in the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.720
 handbook good as you already know the field 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.900
 magnetic field is all the time 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.570
 varying so that the fragments of 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.340
 constructions of different ages 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.630
 record field values ​​as well 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.300
 different 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.010
 my goal in this work was to meet 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.080
 as the variable magnetic field in the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.230
 Brazil in the last 500 years 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.269
 so I prepared these samples in the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.930
 format of cubes with one centimeter of 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.420
 side 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.760
 then I put the samples in the oven 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.400
 magnetic pole that after successive 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.560
 heating was possible. 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.060
 rescue intensity orientation 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 magnetic field 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.490
 at a time when the brick clay 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.740
 It was burned for the first time after 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.900
 heat and cool in the oven and medium 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.210
 magnetometer samples from each location 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.010
 that I visited I find out about the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.930
 variation in field strength 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.360
 magnetic field in each of the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.370
 studied 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.890
 the results of my work showed 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.450
 that the magnetic field in Brazil is 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.200
 far from presenting a behavior 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.690
 ideal that can be compared to the field 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.049
 magnetic field of a clay brother a field 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.369
 dust in both the northeast and the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.040
 southeastern Brazil 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.290
 the magnetic field is complex and presents 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.430
 strong influences and components not 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.710
 polar these cases the compass needle 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.110
 presents a strong flexion with 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.979
 to the north, which can reach more than 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.930
 of 20 degrees and in Europe for example the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.300
 magnetic field is different from the field 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.230
 Brazil with predominance of the field 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.010
 take off 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.280
 if the earth were a brother almost 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.909
 the effect and the reflections regarding the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.489
 north does not receive 15 degrees 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.560
 therefore the rocks and artifacts can 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.450
 provide important information about the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.430
 magnetic field of the past 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.900
 that's why it's so important to study 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.900
 about the magnetism of rocks
