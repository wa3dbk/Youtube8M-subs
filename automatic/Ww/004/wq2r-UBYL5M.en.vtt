I thought the best part of the song was
Claudio's<00:04:16.680> vocals<00:04:17.489> within<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> track<00:04:19.070> track

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
number 12 gravity's Union this was the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.250 
number 12 gravity's Union this was the
demo<00:04:23.220> track<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:24.030> thought<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.870> demo<00:04:25.229> version

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
demo track I thought the demo version

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.840 
demo track I thought the demo version
was<00:04:26.040> a<00:04:26.070> lot<00:04:26.400> better<00:04:26.669> than<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:28.850> completed

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
was a lot better than the completed

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.280 
was a lot better than the completed
version<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.810> all<00:04:30.990> in<00:04:31.229> all<00:04:31.350> with<00:04:31.910> dissension<00:04:32.910> I

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
version so all in all with dissension I

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.219 
version so all in all with dissension I
definitely<00:04:34.290> thought<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.950> was<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> better<00:04:35.640> album

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
definitely thought it was a better album

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.920 
definitely thought it was a better album
