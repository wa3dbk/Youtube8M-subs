00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.800 
I'll just say that my mod selection has
been<00:02:02.460> influenced<00:02:03.000> by<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.360> mods<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
been influenced by what mods I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.950 
been influenced by what mods I
personally<00:02:04.439> used<00:02:04.649> enjoyed<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:05.939> own<00:02:06.180> play

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
personally used enjoyed in my own play

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.589 
personally used enjoyed in my own play
of<00:02:07.079> Skyrim<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> last<00:02:07.920> year<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:09.360> mods

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
of Skyrim in the last year and what mods

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.210 
of Skyrim in the last year and what mods
I<00:02:09.840> believe<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.259> provide<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.590> good<00:02:10.860> balance

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I believe will provide a good balance

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.910 
I believe will provide a good balance
between<00:02:11.310> realism<00:02:11.910> fun<00:02:12.900> gameplay<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
between realism fun gameplay and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490 
between realism fun gameplay and
making<00:02:14.160> entertainment<00:02:14.430> videos<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:16.290> does

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
making entertainment videos this does

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.990 
making entertainment videos this does
mean<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.740> some<00:02:17.160> mods<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> would

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
mean that some mods that I would

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.040 
mean that some mods that I would
personally<00:02:18.630> use<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.800> either<00:02:20.099> modified<00:02:21.050> or

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
personally use I have either modified or

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.160 
personally use I have either modified or
removed<00:02:22.950> entirely<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.940> think

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
removed entirely because I think

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.640 
removed entirely because I think
basically<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.500> people<00:02:26.430> find<00:02:26.700> them<00:02:26.910> boring

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
basically that people find them boring

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.050 
basically that people find them boring
to<00:02:28.650> watch<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.650> mod<00:02:31.800> selection<00:02:32.430> has<00:02:32.790> been
