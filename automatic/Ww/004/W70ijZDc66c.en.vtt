00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
this one and slide it in the function so

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.500 
this one and slide it in the function so
I<00:01:53.230> have<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.680> have<00:01:54.010> my<00:01:54.280> target<00:01:54.550> stood<00:01:55.120> up<00:01:55.240> right

cool<00:02:17.140> about<00:02:17.170> these<00:02:17.590> targets<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.400> they<00:02:18.550> have

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
cool about these targets is they have

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.760 
cool about these targets is they have
each<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.270> them<00:02:19.390> have<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.630> little<00:02:19.990> hole<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.470> you

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
each of them have a little hole and you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.890 
each of them have a little hole and you
could<00:02:20.920> try<00:02:21.130> stringing<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.940> hang<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.720> from

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
could try stringing it and hang it from

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.190 
could try stringing it and hang it from
like<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> tree<00:02:23.620> or<00:02:24.280> hang<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:25.000> your<00:02:25.210> room<00:02:25.480> it

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:48.270 

okay<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> got<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.939> one

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.840 

hit<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.610> blue<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:49.240> did

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:16.449 

I<00:02:52.910> hit<00:02:53.210> them<00:02:53.390> all<00:02:53.570> down

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.050 

so<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.510> where<00:03:17.659> I<00:03:17.689> think<00:03:17.810> about<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.290> gun<00:03:18.470> I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
so this is where I think about the gun I

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.819 
so this is where I think about the gun I
like<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.540> would<00:03:20.720> recommend<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.349> I<00:03:21.530> would

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
like it and I would recommend it I would

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.360 
like it and I would recommend it I would
buy<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.040> because<00:03:22.909> it's<00:03:23.569> cool<00:03:24.049> because<00:03:24.370> not

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
buy it because it's cool because not

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.339 
buy it because it's cool because not
many<00:03:25.549> nerf<00:03:25.849> guns<00:03:26.090> come<00:03:26.480> what<00:03:26.689> targets<00:03:27.140> and

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
many nerf guns come what targets and

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.649 
many nerf guns come what targets and
this<00:03:27.470> one<00:03:27.709> actually<00:03:27.890> comes<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.400> targets<00:03:28.939> so

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
this one actually comes with targets so

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.619 
this one actually comes with targets so
if<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.870> like<00:03:30.079> target<00:03:30.560> practice<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:32.000> good<00:03:32.480> it

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
if you like target practice it's good it

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.479 
if you like target practice it's good it
comes<00:03:32.810> with<00:03:33.019> three<00:03:33.290> targets<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.159> three

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
comes with three targets and three

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.849 
comes with three targets and three
bullets<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.150> yeah<00:03:35.959> it's<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.319> relative<00:03:36.709> for

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
bullets so yeah it's a relative for

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.130 
bullets so yeah it's a relative for
target<00:03:37.189> practice<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.849> by<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.120> way<00:03:38.359> this<00:03:38.930> is

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
target practice and by the way this is

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.220
