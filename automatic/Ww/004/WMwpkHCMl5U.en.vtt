tutorial I'm going to be showing you
guys<00:00:03.929> how<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.440> create<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.130> gradient<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:06.120> goes

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
guys how to create a gradient that goes

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.410 
guys how to create a gradient that goes
over<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:06.960> image<00:00:07.760> kind<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.880> like<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> lens

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
over this image kind of like a lens

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.110 
over this image kind of like a lens
flare<00:00:09.570> effect<00:00:10.019> but<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.920> mean<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.400> similar<00:00:11.820> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
flare effect but I mean it is similar to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.030 
flare effect but I mean it is similar to
the<00:00:12.240> other<00:00:12.269> tutorials<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.049> I've<00:00:13.230> made<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:13.799> I

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
the other tutorials that I've made but I

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.250 
the other tutorials that I've made but I
want<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.910> specifically<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> left

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
want to do it specifically to the left

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.810 
want to do it specifically to the left
side<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.740> photo<00:00:16.980> just<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> show<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.730> guys

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
side of the photo just to show you guys

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.570 
side of the photo just to show you guys
the<00:00:18.150> different<00:00:18.449> ways<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> doing<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.080> now<00:00:19.580> you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the different ways of doing it now you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.460 
the different ways of doing it now you
can<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.880> get<00:00:21.029> any<00:00:21.210> normal<00:00:21.869> image<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.380> you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
can just get any normal image that you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.089 
can just get any normal image that you
have<00:00:22.550> go<00:00:23.550> over<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.410> tab<00:00:25.410> right<00:00:25.680> here<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
have go over to this tab right here and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.269 
have go over to this tab right here and
go<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> gradient<00:00:27.289> now<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.859> thing<00:00:29.010> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
go to gradient now the first thing that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.849 
go to gradient now the first thing that
I<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.609> select<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.630> white<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.560> transparent

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I do is select a white to transparent

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.180 
I do is select a white to transparent
gradient<00:00:32.960> just<00:00:33.960> finding<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:35.040> annoying

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gradient just finding it can be annoying

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.420 
gradient just finding it can be annoying
because<00:00:35.520> white<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.630> can't<00:00:36.870> really<00:00:36.960> tell

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
because white you can't really tell

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.530 
because white you can't really tell
there<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.670> i<00:00:38.700> found<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
there we go i found it it's like a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.799 
there we go i found it it's like a
needle<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> haystack<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> change<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> angle

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
needle in a haystack so change the angle

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
needle in a haystack so change the angle
of<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> going

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
of it so that it's kind of going

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.420 
of it so that it's kind of going
downwards<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.230> just<00:00:46.230> by<00:00:46.379> clicking<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.100> your

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
downwards and just by clicking on your

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
downwards and just by clicking on your
actual<00:00:47.969> photo<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.510> change<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> movement

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
actual photo you can change the movement

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
actual photo you can change the movement
as<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.820> back<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.120> forth

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
as you can see I'm going back and forth

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.369 
as you can see I'm going back and forth
you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.320> change<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.930> wanted<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
kind of be a little stronger like up to

kind of only going to that side now now
that<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.689> base<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.860> first<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that we have a base the first thing that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.649 
that we have a base the first thing that
you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.820> add<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.000> colors<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
want so make a new layer and you can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530 
want so make a new layer and you can
select<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.439> red<00:01:34.650> color<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.820> could<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.360> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
gradient fill so you can kind of pick

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
gradient fill so you can kind of pick
whichever<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.240> want<00:01:45.360> i'm<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> go

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
whichever one you want i'm going to go

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.060 
whichever one you want i'm going to go
from<00:01:46.740> normal<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.460> overlay<00:01:48.710> i'm<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
from normal to overlay i'm just going to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.649 
from normal to overlay i'm just going to
go<00:01:50.759> over<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.149> image<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.780> slightly<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.560> then

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
go over the image very slightly and then

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.690 
go over the image very slightly and then
make<00:01:54.659> another<00:01:54.930> new<00:01:55.409> layer<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.610> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
make another new layer this is going to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.050 
make another new layer this is going to
require<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> layers<00:01:58.399> from<00:01:59.399> normal<00:01:59.850> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
require a lot of layers from normal to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.149 
require a lot of layers from normal to
screen<00:02:00.420> now<00:02:00.899> screen<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.979> be

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
screen now screen is really going to be

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.699 
screen now screen is really going to be
bringing<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.640> color<00:02:02.939> out

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.660 

you<00:02:09.709> can<00:02:09.890> change<00:02:10.100> i<00:02:10.250> think<00:02:10.459> i'm<00:02:10.520> going<00:02:10.610> to

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
you can change i think i'm going to

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.059 
you can change i think i'm going to
change<00:02:10.880> my<00:02:10.970> color<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> lighter<00:02:12.230> pink<00:02:12.500> so

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
change my color to a lighter pink so

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.449 
change my color to a lighter pink so
we'll<00:02:13.250> show<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> little<00:02:13.640> more<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:16.130> there<00:02:16.280> we<00:02:16.430> go

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
we'll show a little more so there we go

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.630 
we'll show a little more so there we go
it's<00:02:16.760> kind<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:19.010> know<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.430> lighter

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
it's kind of you know it's a lighter

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.960 
it's kind of you know it's a lighter
pink<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.060> going<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.270> show<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> little<00:02:20.630> bit<00:02:20.750> more

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
pink is going to show a little bit more

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.479 
pink is going to show a little bit more
so<00:02:22.970> that's<00:02:23.569> one<00:02:23.840> way<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:24.020> doing<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.980> could

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
so that's one way of doing that I could

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.960 
so that's one way of doing that I could
add<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:26.270> yellow<00:02:26.840> color<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.560> top<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.700> as

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
add a yellow color on top of this as

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.180 
add a yellow color on top of this as
well<00:02:29.150> from<00:02:29.959> normal<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.680> overlay<00:02:33.010> okay<00:02:34.010> that's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
well from normal to overlay okay that's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.000 
well from normal to overlay okay that's
really<00:02:34.430> not<00:02:34.520> what<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.730> was<00:02:34.819> expecting<00:02:36.010> okay

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
really not what I was expecting okay

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.270 
really not what I was expecting okay
let's<00:02:37.220> lower<00:02:37.550> this<00:02:41.769> yeah<00:02:42.769> so<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.040> doesn't

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
let's lower this yeah so that doesn't

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.370 
let's lower this yeah so that doesn't
look<00:02:43.540> well<00:02:44.540> that's<00:02:44.780> not<00:02:44.900> really<00:02:45.170> what<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.320> had

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
look well that's not really what I had

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.229 
look well that's not really what I had
in<00:02:45.530> my<00:02:45.709> head<00:02:45.860> that's<00:02:46.640> really<00:02:46.850> not<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:47.060> I

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
in my head that's really not what I

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.970 
in my head that's really not what I
expected<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.989> color<00:02:48.200> touch<00:02:48.470> are<00:02:48.620> not<00:02:48.800> like

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
expected the color touch are not like

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.110 
expected the color touch are not like
let's<00:02:49.970> choose<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> purple<00:02:51.380> color<00:02:51.970> least<00:02:52.970> you're

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
let's choose a purple color least you're

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.140 
let's choose a purple color least you're
seeing<00:02:53.330> trial<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.840> error<00:02:53.959> right<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
seeing trial and error right and the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.790 
seeing trial and error right and the
last<00:02:59.330> thing<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.690> want<00:02:59.930> to<00:02:59.959> do<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.140> add<00:03:00.500> a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
last thing that I want to do is add a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.620 
last thing that I want to do is add a
white<00:03:01.519> color<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.459> I'm<00:03:05.150> going<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.300> lower<00:03:05.450> my

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
white color and I'm going to lower my

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:15.250 
white color and I'm going to lower my
opacity<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:06.650> twenty-two<00:03:07.220> percent<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:14.260> to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
opacity to twenty-two percent and to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.800 
opacity to twenty-two percent and to
kind<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.470> connect<00:03:15.829> this<00:03:15.980> all<00:03:16.250> together<00:03:16.810> layer

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
kind of connect this all together layer

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.000 
kind of connect this all together layer
new<00:03:18.140> adjustment<00:03:18.170> layer<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.739> then<00:03:18.829> go<00:03:18.980> to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
new adjustment layer and then go to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.500 
new adjustment layer and then go to
curves<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.750> kind<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:21.019> add<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:25.510> danna

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
curves you can kind of add in a danna

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.390 
curves you can kind of add in a danna
curves<00:03:26.810> layer<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.170> kind<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.440> solidify<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:28.310> a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
curves layer to kind of solidify it a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.180 
curves layer to kind of solidify it a
little<00:03:28.549> bit<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:30.140> i'll<00:03:30.290> show<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.920> before

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
little bit and i'll show you that before

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.160 
little bit and i'll show you that before
and<00:03:31.549> after<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:34.640> can<00:03:34.760> always<00:03:35.030> change<00:03:35.299> how

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
and after you can always change how

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.470 
and after you can always change how
intense<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.769> colors<00:03:37.130> are<00:03:37.340> again<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:38.450> give

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
intense the colors are again just give

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.710 
intense the colors are again just give
you<00:03:38.660> an<00:03:38.840> idea<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.170> how<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.440> would<00:03:39.530> look<00:03:40.540> now<00:03:41.540> if

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
you an idea of how it would look now if

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.690 
you an idea of how it would look now if
i<00:03:41.840> were<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.110> delete<00:03:42.380> all<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> brush<00:03:42.950> ones<00:03:43.400> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
i were to delete all the brush ones and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.460 
i were to delete all the brush ones and
then<00:03:43.790> use<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.420> gradient<00:03:44.810> fill<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.230> i<00:03:45.290> just

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
then use just a gradient fill so i just

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.050 
then use just a gradient fill so i just
have<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.890> first<00:03:46.250> gradient<00:03:46.700> fill<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.000> I

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
have that first gradient fill that I

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.560 
have that first gradient fill that I
made<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.560> would<00:03:48.560> go<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.739> gradient<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.420> would

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
made I would go to gradient and I would

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.449 
made I would go to gradient and I would
pick<00:03:50.840> any<00:03:51.109> gradient<00:03:51.470> color<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.010> want<00:03:52.310> and

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
pick any gradient color that I want and

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.020 
pick any gradient color that I want and
I<00:03:52.489> would<00:03:52.609> keep<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:53.230> transparent<00:03:54.250> so<00:03:55.250> choose

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
I would keep it transparent so choose

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:03.400 
I would keep it transparent so choose
this<00:03:56.180> color<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:59.590> again<00:04:00.590> keep<00:04:00.799> an<00:04:00.980> angle<00:04:02.410> and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
this color and again keep an angle and

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.560 
this color and again keep an angle and
if<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.590> was<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.920> go<00:04:04.070> to<00:04:04.100> overlay<00:04:04.700> something<00:04:05.450> like

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
if I was to go to overlay something like

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.830 
if I was to go to overlay something like
overlay<00:04:05.989> or<00:04:06.549> screen<00:04:07.549> that's<00:04:08.299> kind<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.630> how<00:04:08.810> it

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
overlay or screen that's kind of how it

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.970 
overlay or screen that's kind of how it
would<00:04:08.989> look<00:04:09.019> like<00:04:09.579> um<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:11.600> brush<00:04:11.870> does<00:04:12.530> take<00:04:12.950> a

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
would look like um the brush does take a

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.090 
would look like um the brush does take a
little<00:04:13.280> bit<00:04:13.660> more<00:04:14.660> time<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.440> you<00:04:15.739> kinda<00:04:15.949> have

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
little bit more time and you kinda have

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.849 
little bit more time and you kinda have
to<00:04:16.130> be<00:04:16.310> familiar<00:04:16.790> with<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.500> layer<00:04:18.500> settings

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
to be familiar with the layer settings

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.310 
to be familiar with the layer settings
to<00:04:19.160> kind<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.370> get<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.549> good<00:04:19.730> well

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.840 

if<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.440> add<00:04:23.590> one<00:04:23.920> more<00:04:24.220> radiant<00:04:25.120> layer<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:27.730> i

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
if I add one more radiant layer so if i

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.990 
if I add one more radiant layer so if i
added<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.510> let's<00:04:29.350> see<00:04:32.700> don't<00:04:33.700> really<00:04:33.850> have<00:04:33.970> that

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
added a let's see don't really have that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.400 
added a let's see don't really have that
many<00:04:34.150> options<00:04:34.660> i<00:04:34.840> just<00:04:35.020> have<00:04:35.110> like<00:04:35.200> pillow

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
many options i just have like pillow

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:43.160 
many options i just have like pillow
here<00:04:35.710> we<00:04:35.770> go<00:04:35.890> bloop<00:04:36.210> add<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.270> nice<00:04:37.780> blue<00:04:38.110> i

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.790 

change<00:04:44.170> that<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.500> overlay<00:04:44.920> as<00:04:45.070> well<00:04:46.620> but<00:04:47.620> i'm

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
change that to overlay as well but i'm

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800 
change that to overlay as well but i'm
going<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.280> select<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.910> mask<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.390> make<00:04:49.630> sure

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
going to select a mask and make sure

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.590 
going to select a mask and make sure
that<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.080> is<00:04:50.230> not<00:04:50.380> going<00:04:50.620> over<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.270> side

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
that this is not going over to the side

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.730 
that this is not going over to the side
because<00:04:52.750> i<00:04:52.870> wanted<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.200> just<00:04:53.350> kind<00:04:53.590> of

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
because i wanted to just kind of

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.840 
because i wanted to just kind of
strictly<00:04:54.340> be<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:54.970> side<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:56.640> you<00:04:57.640> can<00:04:57.790> do

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
strictly be on that side and you can do

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.040 
strictly be on that side and you can do
this<00:04:57.940> with<00:04:58.000> all<00:04:58.300> your<00:04:58.480> other<00:04:58.600> layers<00:04:58.900> just

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
this with all your other layers just

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.100 
this with all your other layers just
kind<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.470> click<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.890> layer<00:05:00.070> mask<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.990> look<00:05:01.990> at

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
kind of click the layer mask and look at

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.160 
kind of click the layer mask and look at
the<00:05:02.170> difference<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.590> it<00:05:02.800> makes<00:05:03.900> keeping<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
the difference that it makes keeping the

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.020 
the difference that it makes keeping the
low<00:05:05.290> opacity<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:06.160> ideal<00:05:06.490> because<00:05:06.670> you<00:05:06.880> don't

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
low opacity is ideal because you don't

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:17.010 
low opacity is ideal because you don't
want<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.210> make<00:05:07.360> such<00:05:07.600> harsh<00:05:07.900> lines<00:05:16.020> so

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
want to make such harsh lines so

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.440 
want to make such harsh lines so
something<00:05:17.380> kind<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.650> like<00:05:17.830> that<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:18.700> you<00:05:19.330> can

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
something kind of like that and you can

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.780 
something kind of like that and you can
always<00:05:19.600> add<00:05:19.840> more<00:05:19.870> you<00:05:20.320> can<00:05:20.410> add<00:05:20.530> less<00:05:20.800> i<00:05:21.160> will

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
always add more you can add less i will

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.690 
always add more you can add less i will
show<00:05:22.000> you<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.210> difference<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:23.580> is<00:05:24.580> without

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
show you the difference that is without

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.850 
show you the difference that is without
the<00:05:24.940> curves<00:05:25.210> layer<00:05:25.450> but<00:05:25.720> this<00:05:25.840> is<00:05:25.990> without<00:05:26.470> any

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
the curves layer but this is without any

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.260 
the curves layer but this is without any
of<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.640> flair<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:29.820> so<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:30.850> would<00:05:31.240> be

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
of that flair to it so that would be

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.010 
of that flair to it so that would be
before<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.940> oh<00:05:33.940> I'm<00:05:34.360> sorry<00:05:34.540> okay<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:34.960> would

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
before and oh I'm sorry okay that would

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.320 
before and oh I'm sorry okay that would
be<00:05:35.110> without<00:05:35.260> any<00:05:35.590> picture<00:05:35.890> so<00:05:36.700> this<00:05:37.120> would<00:05:37.300> be

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
be without any picture so this would be

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.690 
be without any picture so this would be
after<00:05:37.780> and<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.860> would<00:05:38.950> be<00:05:38.979> before<00:05:39.220> so<00:05:39.550> this

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
after and that would be before so this

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.010 
after and that would be before so this
is<00:05:39.820> kind<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.060> if<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.300> want<00:05:40.479> to<00:05:40.540> add<00:05:40.660> like<00:05:40.990> a

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
is kind of if you want to add like a

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.560 
is kind of if you want to add like a
nice<00:05:41.260> flare<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.800> your<00:05:41.830> pictures<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.610> very

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
nice flare to your pictures a very

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.540 
nice flare to your pictures a very
subtle<00:05:43.810> gradient<00:05:44.410> even<00:05:44.979> if<00:05:45.070> this<00:05:45.220> is<00:05:45.370> really

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
subtle gradient even if this is really

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.520 
subtle gradient even if this is really
not<00:05:45.729> that's<00:05:46.120> not<00:05:46.240> all<00:05:46.450> but<00:05:46.660> it's<00:05:47.260> okay

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
not that's not all but it's okay

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.140 
not that's not all but it's okay
whatever<00:05:47.830> just<00:05:48.370> do<00:05:48.490> whatever<00:05:48.640> you<00:05:48.820> want<00:05:49.000> you

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
whatever just do whatever you want you

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.020 
whatever just do whatever you want you
think<00:05:49.330> it<00:05:49.390> looks<00:05:49.419> good<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:49.870> looks<00:05:49.900> good<00:05:51.030> so

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
think it looks good it looks good so

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.850 
think it looks good it looks good so
those<00:05:52.540> are<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.720> two<00:05:52.810> ways<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.260> doing<00:05:53.530> it<00:05:53.650> I

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
those are the two ways of doing it I

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.909 
those are the two ways of doing it I
would<00:05:54.190> prefer<00:05:54.400> doing<00:05:54.790> it<00:05:55.030> with<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.240> brush<00:05:55.479> um

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
would prefer doing it with the brush um

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.370 
would prefer doing it with the brush um
was<00:05:56.919> it<00:05:56.950> really<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.370> best<00:05:57.700> example<00:05:58.360> but<00:05:58.630> I

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
was it really the best example but I

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.670 
was it really the best example but I
kind<00:05:59.650> of<00:05:59.680> had<00:05:59.830> to<00:05:59.860> do<00:06:00.010> this<00:06:00.100> impromptu

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
kind of had to do this impromptu

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.640 
kind of had to do this impromptu
gradients<00:06:03.270> gradients<00:06:04.270> are<00:06:04.360> very<00:06:04.600> easy<00:06:04.840> if

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
gradients gradients are very easy if

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.469 
gradients gradients are very easy if
your<00:06:05.830> first<00:06:06.100> experimenting<00:06:07.090> with<00:06:07.120> it<00:06:07.240> so<00:06:07.450> I

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
your first experimenting with it so I

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.140 
your first experimenting with it so I
would<00:06:07.750> go<00:06:07.960> with<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.200> gradients<00:06:09.150> hopefully

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
would go with the gradients hopefully

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.210 
would go with the gradients hopefully
this<00:06:10.300> was<00:06:10.419> helpful<00:06:10.710> let<00:06:11.710> me<00:06:11.830> know<00:06:11.919> any<00:06:12.100> other

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
this was helpful let me know any other

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.620 
this was helpful let me know any other
suggestions<00:06:12.729> that<00:06:12.850> you<00:06:12.880> have<00:06:13.090> and<00:06:13.300> thank<00:06:13.479> you
