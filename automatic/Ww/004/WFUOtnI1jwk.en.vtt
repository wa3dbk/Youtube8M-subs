ground you drive it up and then from

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
ground you drive it up and then from
here<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.020> soon<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.259> he<00:01:25.380> gets<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> knee<00:01:25.860> level

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
here as soon as he gets the knee level

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
here as soon as he gets the knee level
again<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> hip<00:01:27.780> movement<00:01:28.229> ok<00:01:28.740> we

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
again now it's a hip movement ok we
