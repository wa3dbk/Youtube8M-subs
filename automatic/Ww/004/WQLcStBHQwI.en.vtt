modded<00:00:09.929> ps3<00:00:10.230> controller<00:00:10.889> basically<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:12.120> I

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
modded ps3 controller basically what I

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.600 
modded ps3 controller basically what I
did<00:00:12.210> was<00:00:12.540> get<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> comp<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.740> carbon<00:00:14.280> fiber<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
did was get a comp of carbon fiber a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.939 
did was get a comp of carbon fiber a
final<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.599> wrap<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.260> around<00:00:16.289> my<00:00:16.529> controller

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
final and wrap it around my controller

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.640 
final and wrap it around my controller
I'm<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.420> do<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> quick<00:00:18.720> close<00:00:19.260> up<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
I'm just going to do a quick close up of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.019 
I'm just going to do a quick close up of
this<00:00:21.199> as<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.650> there<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.580> looks<00:00:23.789> quite

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this as you can see there it looks quite

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.300 
this as you can see there it looks quite
cool<00:00:24.800> but<00:00:26.869> there<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.260> creases<00:00:28.800> at<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
cool but there was some creases at the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.040 
cool but there was some creases at the
bottom<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.789> stuff<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.689> very

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
bottom and stuff because it was very

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
bottom and stuff because it was very
hard<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.309> had<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.610> use<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> heat

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
hard to do this you had to use a heat

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.400 
hard to do this you had to use a heat
gun<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.329> everything<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.899> get<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> all

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
gun and everything to get this all

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
gun and everything to get this all
wrapped<00:00:34.680> around<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.239> flat

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
wrapped around because it's just a flat

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.709 
wrapped around because it's just a flat
sheet<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.020> carbon<00:00:37.739> fiber<00:00:38.100> vinyl<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
sheet of carbon fiber vinyl and it is

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
sheet of carbon fiber vinyl and it is
quite<00:00:40.020> hard<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.920> did<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.489> it

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
quite hard to do this but I did get it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.549 
quite hard to do this but I did get it
done<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> end<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.440> how

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
done in the end and as you can see how

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.920 
done in the end and as you can see how
the<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.100> has<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.210> Sony<00:00:45.539> sticker

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the back there has the that Sony sticker

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.100 
the back there has the that Sony sticker
I<00:00:46.309> just<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> heat<00:00:48.390> gun<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> take<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.050> out

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I just use the heat gun to take that out

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
I just use the heat gun to take that out
of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> back<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.800> controller<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
of the back of the controller and then I

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
of the back of the controller and then I
just<00:00:51.180> stuck<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.690> top<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> make<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.350> look<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
just stuck it on top to make it look but

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.729 
just stuck it on top to make it look but
bear<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> carbon<00:00:54.899> fiber<00:00:55.110> vinyl<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.649> I've

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
bear the carbon fiber vinyl that I've

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
bear the carbon fiber vinyl that I've
using<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.129> controller<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.789> textured<00:00:57.329> as

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
using this controller is textured as

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
using this controller is textured as
well<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.199> hear<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.920> these

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
well as you can hear like that and these

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.889 
well as you can hear like that and these
quite<00:00:59.850> comfortably<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.390> hand<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
quite comfortably in the hand with that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.840 
quite comfortably in the hand with that
texture<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.440> well<00:01:01.469> ok<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
texture as well ok so this is the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.719 
texture as well ok so this is the
controller<00:01:03.239> next<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> original<00:01:04.409> black

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
I've used my carbon fiber vinyl on and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.600 
I've used my carbon fiber vinyl on and
I've<00:01:15.960> done<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.290> ipod<00:01:16.650> touch<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.340> fourth

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
also my laptop as you consider I'll just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
also my laptop as you consider I'll just
open<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.820> show<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> inside

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
open that up and show you the inside

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560 
open that up and show you the inside
this<00:01:34.290> does<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> inside<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.670> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
this does it inside of it as well so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.149 
this does it inside of it as well so
that<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:37.049> shows<00:01:37.079> how<00:01:37.229> many<00:01:37.470> things<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.890> can

that just shows how many things you can

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.359 
that just shows how many things you can
actually<00:01:39.650> carbonize<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.009> want<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.250> say

ebay<00:01:46.880> quite<00:01:47.880> cheap<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.360> gotta<00:01:48.689> roll<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.439> was

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
ebay quite cheap I gotta roll that was

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.370 
ebay quite cheap I gotta roll that was
like<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.950> meter<00:01:50.250> by<00:01:51.149> 30<00:01:51.570> centimeters<00:01:52.140> long

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
like one meter by 30 centimeters long

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100 
like one meter by 30 centimeters long
for<00:01:52.799> six<00:01:53.130> pounds<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:54.720> probably<00:01:54.869> about

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
for six pounds and that's probably about

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.859

probably<00:01:56.100> about<00:01:56.219> ten<00:01:56.490> dollars<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.750> not

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
probably about ten dollars so it's not

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.440 
probably about ten dollars so it's not
that<00:01:57.930> expensive<00:01:58.229> either<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.909> besties<00:02:00.420> a

that expensive either and this besties a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
that expensive either and this besties a
heat<00:02:00.810> gun<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.140> well<00:02:01.170> together<00:02:01.469> around<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
heat gun as well together around the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
heat gun as well together around the
edges<00:02:02.219> especially<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.360> my<00:02:03.450> lap<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.869> was

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
edges especially for my lap to it was

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
edges especially for my lap to it was
quite<00:02:04.170> hard<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.619> also<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> controller

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
quite hard and also the controller

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.940 
quite hard and also the controller
dollars<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.540> hardest<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> heat<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
dollars are hardest you have to heat the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.219 
dollars are hardest you have to heat the
value<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.610> lot<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.690> all<00:02:09.869> around<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
value of a lot to get it all around the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.230 
value of a lot to get it all around the
edges<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> stretch<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.400> around

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
edges and you have to stretch it around

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.720 
edges and you have to stretch it around
but<00:02:12.420> overall<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.260> worth<00:02:13.620> doing<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.400> it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
but overall it is worth doing it is it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.150 
but overall it is worth doing it is it
doesn't<00:02:15.090> cost<00:02:15.360> how<00:02:15.570> much<00:02:15.630> either<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.860> also

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
doesn't cost how much either and also

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.800 
doesn't cost how much either and also
you<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.460> use<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.610> hair<00:02:17.880> dryer<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.420> forgot<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
you can use a hair dryer so I forgot to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
you can use a hair dryer so I forgot to
mention<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.200> instead<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.890> heat<00:02:20.100> gun<00:02:20.220> if

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
mention that instead of a heat gun if

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.590 
mention that instead of a heat gun if
you<00:02:20.460> don't<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.730> heat<00:02:20.970> going<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.420> use

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
you don't have a heat going you just use

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.200 
you don't have a heat going you just use
a<00:02:21.630> hair<00:02:21.900> dryer<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.620> works<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.820> as<00:02:24.000> well

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
a hair dryer it works just just as well

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.990 
a hair dryer it works just just as well
as<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.690> heat<00:02:24.870> gun<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.490> yeah<00:02:26.640> that's<00:02:26.820> pretty

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
as the heat gun so yeah that's pretty

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
as the heat gun so yeah that's pretty

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
the things I've carbonized with carbon

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.310 
the things I've carbonized with carbon
fiber<00:02:31.710> vinyl<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.480> yeah<00:02:33.630> thanks<00:02:33.930> for<00:02:33.960> watching
