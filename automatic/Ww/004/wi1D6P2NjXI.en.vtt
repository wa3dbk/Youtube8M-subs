00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
efficient in pedaling and also we have a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.069 
efficient in pedaling and also we have a
really<00:01:03.649> good<00:01:04.070> linkage<00:01:04.519> now<00:01:04.729> for<00:01:05.149> the<00:01:05.239> shop<00:01:05.899> and

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
the bike is main thing is get more speed

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.510 
the bike is main thing is get more speed
role<00:01:10.729> better<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.590> more<00:01:13.010> efficient<00:01:13.400> in

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
role better and and is more efficient in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.780 
role better and and is more efficient in
a<00:01:13.880> shock<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:14.360> it's<00:01:15.200> I'm<00:01:15.619> quite<00:01:16.460> happy<00:01:16.580> with

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
a shock so it's I'm quite happy with

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.690 
a shock so it's I'm quite happy with
with<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.540> result<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.950> we've<00:01:19.280> got<00:01:19.490> now

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
with the result that we we've got now

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.109 
with the result that we we've got now
and<00:01:20.140> every<00:01:21.140> time<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:21.770> write<00:01:22.100> with<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.400> bike<00:01:22.610> I

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
and every time we write with the bike I

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.580 
and every time we write with the bike I
had<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.420> feeling<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:23.900> faster<00:01:24.290> than<00:01:24.470> the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
had the feeling it's faster than the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.679 
had the feeling it's faster than the
previous<00:01:24.950> one<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.760> good<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.360> think<00:01:26.570> it's

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
previous one so it's good I think it's

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.350 
previous one so it's good I think it's
good<00:01:26.840> for<00:01:27.049> Sam<00:01:27.409> for<00:01:27.650> for<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.159> work<00:01:28.310> up<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
good for Sam for for the work up the

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.420 
good for Sam for for the work up the
suspension<00:01:29.780> design<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.590> platform<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.400> a

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
suspension design and platform it is a

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.820 
suspension design and platform it is a
something<00:01:32.210> I'm<00:01:32.540> not<00:01:32.659> familiar<00:01:32.990> with<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:33.590> on

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
something I'm not familiar with on on

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.170 
something I'm not familiar with on on
any<00:01:33.979> bikes<00:01:34.250> out<00:01:34.460> there<00:01:34.490> can<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.030> maybe

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
any bikes out there can you maybe

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
any bikes out there can you maybe
explain<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.750> what<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.470> actually<00:01:36.680> happening

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
explain it what is actually happening

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.510 
explain it what is actually happening
I'm<00:01:39.200> not<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.710> design<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.060> rare<00:01:41.270> so

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
I'm not the design of the of the rare so

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.740 
I'm not the design of the of the rare so
little<00:01:43.520> bit<00:01:43.670> hard<00:01:43.939> for<00:01:44.000> me<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.450> explain

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
little bit hard for me to explain

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.530 
little bit hard for me to explain
everything<00:01:45.080> but<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:46.610> thing<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.150> can<00:01:47.360> have

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
everything but the thing is you can have

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.580 
everything but the thing is you can have
a<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:49.280> pivot<00:01:50.240> point<00:01:50.600> like<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:50.900> single<00:01:51.409> pivot

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
a like I pivot point like a single pivot

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.429 
a like I pivot point like a single pivot
point<00:01:51.950> quite<00:01:52.189> high<00:01:52.400> with<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.270> bottom<00:01:54.079> bracket

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
point quite high with a bottom bracket

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.980 
point quite high with a bottom bracket
who<00:01:54.770> there<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> link<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.720> bottom

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
who there is a link and the bottom

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.679 
who there is a link and the bottom
bracket<00:01:57.290> move<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.340> he's<00:01:58.640> not<00:01:58.820> moving<00:01:59.119> just<00:01:59.270> to

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
bracket move but he's not moving just to

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.190 
bracket move but he's not moving just to
keep<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.290> same<00:02:00.650> length<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.880> chain<00:02:01.909> it's<00:02:02.869> just

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
keep the same length of chain it's just

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.469 
keep the same length of chain it's just
it's<00:02:03.380> moving<00:02:03.829> like<00:02:04.040> lakiya<00:02:04.640> want<00:02:04.909> it's<00:02:05.090> moving

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
it's moving like lakiya want it's moving

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.229 
it's moving like lakiya want it's moving
and<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:07.250> why<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:07.430> out<00:02:07.700> for<00:02:07.909> me<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.090> to

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
and so it's why it's out for me to to

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.509 
and so it's why it's out for me to to
explain<00:02:08.659> it<00:02:08.840> perfectly<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:09.500> after<00:02:10.189> we<00:02:10.399> have<00:02:10.489> a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
explain it perfectly and after we have a

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.360 
explain it perfectly and after we have a
separate<00:02:10.970> things<00:02:11.689> with<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.110> linkage<00:02:12.709> easy

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
separate things with the linkage easy

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.970 
separate things with the linkage easy
also<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.909> change<00:02:14.450> into<00:02:14.689> try<00:02:15.349> different<00:02:15.739> link

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
also to change into try different link

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.159 
also to change into try different link
for<00:02:16.309> the<00:02:16.459> rear<00:02:16.639> shock<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.120> also<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.779> bike<00:02:17.959> is

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:18.169 
for the rear shock and also the bike is

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:19.720 
for the rear shock and also the bike is
quite<00:02:18.590> lighter<00:02:18.859> than<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.370> prey

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
quite lighter than the prey

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.020 
quite lighter than the prey
one<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.090> almost<00:02:20.690> ours<00:02:21.200> kilo<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.280> now<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.879> think

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
one is almost ours kilo so now I think

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.160 
one is almost ours kilo so now I think
we<00:02:23.360> are<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.590> same<00:02:25.180> target<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.390> then

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
we are in a in the same target that then

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.979 
we are in a in the same target that then
the<00:02:27.440> lighter<00:02:27.950> bike<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.150> resin<00:02:29.540> carbon

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
the lighter bike and the resin carbon

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.199 
the lighter bike and the resin carbon
fiber<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:31.010> geometry<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.549> easy<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.970> ashes

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
fiber the geometry is easy to ashes

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.300 
fiber the geometry is easy to ashes
because<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.659> just<00:02:33.049> have<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.470> for<00:02:33.830> example<00:02:33.890> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
because you just have to for example to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.610 
because you just have to for example to
change<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.790> rear<00:02:35.299> part<00:02:35.659> so<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.379> move

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
change the rear part so you can move

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.220 
change the rear part so you can move
your<00:02:36.680> your<00:02:37.400> item<00:02:38.000> bottom<00:02:38.239> bracket<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:38.989> this

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
your your item bottom bracket with this

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.070 
your your item bottom bracket with this
also<00:02:39.799> you<00:02:40.040> have<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.730> headset<00:02:41.150> with<00:02:41.480> a

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
also you have the the headset with a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.910 
also you have the the headset with a
dangle<00:02:43.120> change<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:45.200> adjust<00:02:45.319> really

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
dangle change so you can adjust really

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.729 
dangle change so you can adjust really
the<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.280> back<00:02:46.430> like<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.730> want<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:48.440> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
the the back like you want so and and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.259 
the the back like you want so and and
the<00:02:48.920> suspension<00:02:49.250> platform<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.060> something

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
the suspension platform is it something

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.150 
the suspension platform is it something
that<00:02:50.450> maybe<00:02:50.780> will<00:02:51.019> evolve<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.680> longer

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
that maybe will evolve to the longer

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.949 
that maybe will evolve to the longer
travel<00:02:52.489> trail<00:02:52.670> bikes<00:02:52.910> or<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.420> this<00:02:53.569> just<00:02:53.629> for

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
travel trail bikes or is this just for

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.289 
travel trail bikes or is this just for
th<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.560> don't<00:02:55.040> want<00:02:55.280> adjust<00:02:55.640> for<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:55.970> because

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
th I don't want adjust for this because

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.140 
th I don't want adjust for this because
it's<00:02:56.450> quite<00:02:56.660> complicated<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:58.040> build<00:02:58.310> into<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's quite complicated to build into a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.900 
it's quite complicated to build into a
range<00:03:00.049> for<00:03:00.290> for<00:03:00.620> cross-country<00:03:00.980> bike<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.489> think

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
range for for cross-country bike I think

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.839 
range for for cross-country bike I think
the<00:03:02.060> idea<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.720> go<00:03:03.200> further<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.010> it's<00:03:04.609> too

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
the idea is to go further but it's too

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.150 
the idea is to go further but it's too
early<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.209> know<00:03:05.690> if<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.049> would<00:03:06.200> walk<00:03:06.440> but<00:03:06.950> it

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
early to know if you would walk but it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.710 
early to know if you would walk but it
works<00:03:07.489> really<00:03:07.730> well<00:03:07.849> for<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.239> Donald<00:03:08.569> bike

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
works really well for the Donald bike

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.140 
works really well for the Donald bike
the<00:03:09.140> bike<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.500> pretty<00:03:09.769> good<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.160> pedaling<00:03:10.609> we

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
the bike is pretty good in pedaling we

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.360 
the bike is pretty good in pedaling we
did<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.420> test<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.840> honest<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.379> you<00:03:13.099> have<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
did the test and honest is you have the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.030 
did the test and honest is you have the
feeling<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.760> bike<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.090> really<00:03:14.329> light<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.040> and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
feeling the bike is really light and and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.000 
feeling the bike is really light and and
enrolled<00:03:16.940> well<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.569> just<00:03:17.959> brand<00:03:18.500> new<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.859> now

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
enrolled well so just brand new so now

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.069 
enrolled well so just brand new so now
we<00:03:19.069> need<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> little<00:03:20.030> bit<00:03:20.180> more<00:03:20.359> more<00:03:20.629> tests<00:03:20.900> to

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
we need a little bit more more tests to

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.009 
we need a little bit more more tests to
be<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.500> be<00:03:21.650> sure<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.430> p2<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.599> result<00:03:23.900> at

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
be to be sure but a p2 to the result at

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.199 
be to be sure but a p2 to the result at
the<00:03:24.109> moment<00:03:24.380> it's<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.310> sick<00:03:25.549> looking<00:03:25.669> back<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
the moment it's a sick looking back and

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.420 
the moment it's a sick looking back and
are<00:03:26.900> now<00:03:27.200> I've<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.500> been<00:03:27.919> running<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.400> for

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
are now I've just been running it for

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.420 
are now I've just been running it for
three<00:03:29.239> days<00:03:29.419> now<00:03:29.450> yeah<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.500> first<00:03:30.739> runner<00:03:30.980> it

happy with it so and I know it's tough
such<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.269> short<00:03:44.480> time<00:03:44.690> less<00:03:45.109> than<00:03:45.260> two<00:03:45.440> weeks

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
such a short time less than two weeks

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.770 
such a short time less than two weeks
between<00:03:45.769> two<00:03:46.160> big<00:03:46.340> races<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.599> something

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
between two big races is it something

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.140 
between two big races is it something
like<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:49.099> guys<00:03:49.280> would<00:03:49.549> notice<00:03:50.060> a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
like that you guys would notice a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.550 
like that you guys would notice a
difference<00:03:50.299> right<00:03:50.599> away<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.169> would<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.440> be

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
difference right away and would it be

cut a little bit of feedback from blinky
and<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:40.040> few<00:04:40.220> runs<00:04:40.400> down<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.730> track<00:04:41.080> pretty

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
and a few runs down the track pretty

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.690 
and a few runs down the track pretty
well<00:04:42.230> dialed<00:04:42.410> within<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.860> first<00:04:43.070> two<00:04:43.220> days<00:04:43.250> so

wouldn't<00:05:05.210> have<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.510> same<00:05:05.660> setting<00:05:06.020> that

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
wouldn't have the same setting that

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.650 
wouldn't have the same setting that
blinky<00:05:06.440> runs<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:06.890> then<00:05:07.430> another<00:05:08.090> question

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
blinky runs and then another question

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.480 
blinky runs and then another question
that<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:09.080> everyone<00:05:09.650> in<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.860> world<00:05:10.070> wants<00:05:10.430> to
