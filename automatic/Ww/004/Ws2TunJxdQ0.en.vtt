racism it's a nebulous topic right and
it's<00:02:50.550> nebulous<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.989> not

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
it's nebulous because it's it's not

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.440 
it's nebulous because it's it's not
necessarily<00:02:53.010> clearly<00:02:53.400> defined<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.090> because
