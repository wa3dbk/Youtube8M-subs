00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.940
 in 1959 the Soviet spacecraft 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.379
 luna-3 handed down to earth photos of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.500
 what land they never saw 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.150
 the back of the moon we all see one 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.040
 same side of the moon because the moon 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.780
 rotates around its axis exactly one 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.910
 times during the period of revolution around the earth 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.410
 if she didn't rotate at all we would 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
 could see its entire surface by 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 at least 1 time per lap and if she 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.199
 rotated twice as fast we would see the whole 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.849
 its surface more than once per 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.010
 circulation period but instead 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.779
 our motions are as much as periods 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.219
 rotation and circulation of most other 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.469
 moons in the solar system 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.390
 perfectly synchronized so it was not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.950
 always presumably our moon 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.930
 formed as a result of the fall 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.430
 giant asteroid and its initial 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.140
 spinning and giddy 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 nine o'clock orbit almost certainly not 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 were synchronized although we don't know 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.390
 what was faster on such a close 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.070
 Earth gravity distance 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 warped the moon so one of his 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.120
 ends was directed toward the earth 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.039
 the ends of the moon quickly ceased to be 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.870
 on the same ground line due to differences in 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.070
 the periods of rotations and the inversion of the moon but 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.260
 earth's gravity again and again 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 warped the moon moreover such 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.830
 gravitational influence for sure 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.510
 would have affected the rotation of the moon if she 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.220
 rotated more often than once per period 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.630
 circulation of the earth would attract the moon under 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.010
 a slight angle against the direction 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.930
 rotations slowing and and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.729
 and if the moon was slower than 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 now the earth would draw her in 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.460
 backward direction rather rotation 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.200
 like everything else there 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.580
 the earth took almost 1000 years to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.840
 change the speed of rotation of the moon in 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.549
 enough for her to 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.240
 rotated exactly once per period 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.729
 appeal 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 but because all the time was to the ground 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.509
 one side we see a little more 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 than one side due to the fact that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.530
 the elliptical orbit of the moon allows us 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.990
 look beyond the western eastern horizon 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.430
 the moon and the slope of the axis leads to the lunar 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.729
 season showing us more 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.110
 north and south pole but these zones in 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.970
 the amount of give us only additional 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.220
 nine percent leaving 41 percent 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.899
 moons hidden from earths satellites 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.549
 starting from moon 3 let us create 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.810
 maps of the rest of the surface but you can with 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.479
 confidence to say that our relationship 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.479
 with the moon still pretty one-sided
