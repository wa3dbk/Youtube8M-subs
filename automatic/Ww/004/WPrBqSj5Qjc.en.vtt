and<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.060> coral<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.230> knew<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> wasn't<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and a coral and I knew I wasn't going to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
and a coral and I knew I wasn't going to
wear<00:00:26.099> those<00:00:26.279> much<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.090> figured<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.539> only

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
wear those much so I figured I only

wear those much so I figured I only
wanted<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.050> buy<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> eight<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.740> was

actually<00:00:29.039> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> wear<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:29.849> these

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
actually going to wear because these

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.749 
actually going to wear because these
cost<00:00:30.330> $22<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> little<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.579> more

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.729

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but you do have to be a little bit quick

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.500 
but you do have to be a little bit quick
because<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.110> starts<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> dry<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:12.060> far<00:01:12.360> as

vitamin<00:01:51.000> E<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.320> makes<00:01:52.530> them<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> little

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
vitamin E so that makes them a little

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.770 
vitamin E so that makes them a little
bit<00:01:53.070> moisturizing<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.790> wouldn't<00:01:54.119> say<00:01:54.360> by<00:01:54.600> any

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
it's that one on bottom and it's one of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.770 
it's that one on bottom and it's one of
their<00:03:01.459> lip<00:03:01.909> creams<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.450> believe<00:03:02.629> they're

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
their lip creams I believe they're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.479 
their lip creams I believe they're
called<00:03:02.930> they're<00:03:03.139> $13<00:03:03.889> and<00:03:04.069> even<00:03:04.280> though<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
called they're $13 and even though the

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.910 
called they're $13 and even though the
bottle<00:03:04.819> is<00:03:04.970> smaller<00:03:05.359> when<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.379> read<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
bottle is smaller when you read the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.619 
bottle is smaller when you read the
amount<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.459> product<00:03:07.909> it's<00:03:08.090> actually<00:03:08.450> more

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
amount of product it's actually more

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.300 
amount of product it's actually more
product<00:03:09.079> than<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.349> Stila<00:03:09.739> one<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.190> it's

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
product than the Stila one so it's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.000 
product than the Stila one so it's
definitely<00:03:10.730> cheaper<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.409> that<00:03:12.409> one<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.829> on

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
definitely cheaper and that one is on

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.550 
definitely cheaper and that one is on
top<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.549> is<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.090> $13<00:03:14.690> one<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.319> from

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.409 
top and that is the $13 one that's from
Sephora<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.250> definitely<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.849> dupe<00:03:17.150> for<00:03:17.180> the

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419

nice

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.040 

this<00:04:30.050> next<00:04:30.410> read<00:04:30.680> is<00:04:30.919> called<00:04:31.190> beso<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:32.050> they

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
this next read is called beso and they

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.110 
this next read is called beso and they
say<00:04:33.229> that<00:04:33.410> this<00:04:33.530> one<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> true<00:04:34.220> read<00:04:34.490> so<00:04:34.850> I

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
say that this one is a true read so I

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.120 
say that this one is a true read so I
think<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.660> last<00:04:35.870> one<00:04:36.020> in<00:04:36.259> this<00:04:36.350> one<00:04:36.530> are<00:04:36.650> super

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
think the last one in this one are super

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.189 
think the last one in this one are super
close<00:04:37.340> but<00:04:37.639> I'm<00:04:37.789> assuming<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.840> one<00:04:39.050> just

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
close but I'm assuming this one just

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.659 
close but I'm assuming this one just
comes<00:04:39.320> out<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.530> little<00:04:39.710> bit<00:04:39.889> brighter<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.490> it's

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
comes out a little bit brighter and it's

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.029 
comes out a little bit brighter and it's
also<00:04:40.850> kind<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.539> a<00:04:41.630> neutral<00:04:41.840> or<00:04:42.229> blue<00:04:42.530> undertone

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
also kind of a neutral or blue undertone

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.620 
also kind of a neutral or blue undertone
not<00:04:43.310> orange<00:04:43.639> at<00:04:43.759> all<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.090> this<00:04:44.300> definitely

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
not orange at all so this definitely

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.300 
not orange at all so this definitely
helps<00:04:44.960> making<00:04:45.380> your<00:04:45.530> teeth<00:04:45.740> look<00:04:45.919> white<00:04:46.100> which

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
helps making your teeth look white which

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.100 
helps making your teeth look white which
is<00:04:46.460> always<00:04:46.850> what<00:04:47.030> I<00:04:47.060> look<00:04:47.270> for<00:04:47.479> in<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.720> red<00:04:47.900> and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
is always what I look for in a red and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.020 
is always what I look for in a red and
then<00:04:48.770> I'm<00:04:48.860> just<00:04:48.889> going<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.190> show<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.430> guys<00:04:49.669> its

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
transfer proof once you let it dry it

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.499 
transfer proof once you let it dry it
doesn't<00:04:52.220> get<00:04:52.520> out<00:04:52.639> anything<00:04:52.940> else<00:04:53.210> which<00:04:53.479> is

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509
