work<00:02:32.629> this<00:02:33.629> is<00:02:33.840> wrong

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.240 

the<00:02:45.960> other<00:02:46.110> major<00:02:46.350> complaint<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.860> have<00:02:46.980> about

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the other major complaint I have about

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.340 
the other major complaint I have about
the<00:02:47.340> site<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.330> text<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.840> extraordinarily

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
the site is the text is extraordinarily

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.190 
the site is the text is extraordinarily
small<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.980> contrast<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.970> bad<00:02:57.200> anyway

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
small and the contrast is bad anyway

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.570 
small and the contrast is bad anyway
that's<00:02:59.160> enough<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.730> Notre<00:03:00.450> Dame<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:02.160> that

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
that's enough of Notre Dame and that
