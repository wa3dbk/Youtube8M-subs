00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
phrasing similar to that from from my

of match that or I might think the
opposite<00:01:50.509> if<00:01:50.630> he's<00:01:50.779> playing<00:01:51.049> staccato<00:01:51.469> I

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
opposite if he's playing staccato I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.709 
opposite if he's playing staccato I
might<00:01:52.009> play<00:01:52.189> something<00:01:52.490> legato<00:01:52.939> he's<00:01:53.479> playing

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
something or vice versa but what he's

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.419 
something or vice versa but what he's
talking<00:01:57.529> about<00:01:57.560> in<00:01:57.740> particular<00:01:57.799> I<00:01:58.159> think<00:01:58.189> is

or some type of formal idea it may be

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.110 
or some type of formal idea it may be
tonal<00:02:45.689> in<00:02:46.689> the<00:02:46.840> sense<00:02:47.079> that<00:02:47.200> he<00:02:47.829> plays<00:02:48.120> he's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
tonal in the sense that he plays he's

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.670 
tonal in the sense that he plays he's
down<00:02:49.389> in<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.659> lower<00:02:49.840> register<00:02:50.079> of<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.500> tenor

down in the lower register of the tenor
saxophone<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.819> might<00:02:52.060> play<00:02:52.209> my<00:02:52.449> ride<00:02:52.689> cymbal

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
saxophone so I might play my ride cymbal

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.009 
saxophone so I might play my ride cymbal
which<00:02:53.260> has<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.919> higher<00:02:54.129> pitch<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.790> would<00:02:55.359> lend

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
which has a higher pitch and would lend

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.209 
which has a higher pitch and would lend
more<00:02:56.199> clarity<00:02:56.500> rather<00:02:56.769> than<00:02:56.949> playing<00:02:57.129> the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 
more clarity rather than playing the

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.360 
more clarity rather than playing the
dark<00:02:57.549> cave<00:02:57.879> that<00:02:58.449> has<00:02:58.659> just<00:02:59.019> washed<00:02:59.769> away<00:02:59.980> and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
dark cave that has just washed away and

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.289 
dark cave that has just washed away and
with<00:03:00.909> him<00:03:01.090> flying<00:03:01.329> down<00:03:01.449> there<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.909> the<00:03:03.909> same

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
with him flying down there and the same

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.550 
with him flying down there and the same
thing<00:03:04.359> would<00:03:04.629> happen<00:03:04.719> with<00:03:04.930> at<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.230> piano<00:03:05.379> I

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
thing would happen with at the piano I

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.080 
thing would happen with at the piano I
would<00:03:05.829> believe<00:03:06.159> that<00:03:06.219> he<00:03:06.519> was<00:03:06.639> playing<00:03:06.879> down

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
would believe that he was playing down

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.509 
would believe that he was playing down
there<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:08.079> pianist<00:03:08.560> wouldn't<00:03:08.859> get<00:03:09.099> down<00:03:09.310> in

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
there the pianist wouldn't get down in

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.369 
there the pianist wouldn't get down in
the<00:03:09.609> low<00:03:09.760> end<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.060> piano<00:03:10.359> playing<00:03:10.599> something

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
the low end the piano playing something

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.199 
the low end the piano playing something
that<00:03:11.530> would<00:03:11.650> sound<00:03:11.889> muddy<00:03:12.189> but<00:03:12.849> we've<00:03:13.000> kind<00:03:13.180> of

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
that would sound muddy but we've kind of

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.729 
that would sound muddy but we've kind of
in<00:03:13.389> the<00:03:13.540> mid<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.930> upper<00:03:13.959> range<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:14.650> do

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
in the mid to upper range and do

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.259 
in the mid to upper range and do
something<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:15.220> could<00:03:15.310> complement<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.909> and

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
something that could complement that and

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.780 
something that could complement that and
so<00:03:17.139> we<00:03:17.379> have<00:03:17.409> an<00:03:17.650> opportunity<00:03:18.159> to<00:03:18.310> have<00:03:18.759> a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
so we have an opportunity to have a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.479 
so we have an opportunity to have a
three-way<00:03:19.299> conversation<00:03:19.599> as<00:03:20.290> well<00:03:21.250> as<00:03:21.459> a

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
three-way conversation as well as a

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.089 
three-way conversation as well as a
two-way<00:03:21.849> conversation<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.689> what<00:03:23.229> we<00:03:23.829> can<00:03:23.979> get

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
two-way conversation and what we can get

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.670 
two-way conversation and what we can get
into<00:03:24.310> from<00:03:24.939> the<00:03:25.000> bass<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.359> drums<00:03:25.629> back<00:03:26.470> talk

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
into from the bass and drums back talk

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.770 
into from the bass and drums back talk
about<00:03:26.919> if<00:03:27.129> you<00:03:27.609> have<00:03:27.759> a<00:03:27.790> second<00:03:28.239> used<00:03:28.389> to<00:03:28.569> play

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
about if you have a second used to play

00:03:28.780 --> 00:04:55.930 
about if you have a second used to play
a<00:03:29.189> compa<00:03:30.189> blues<00:03:30.430> or<00:03:30.729> something<00:03:31.060> and
