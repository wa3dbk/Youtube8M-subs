we're<00:00:01.140> now<00:00:01.260> working<00:00:01.530> with<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.920> Seberg<00:00:02.520> SPS<00:00:03.680> 160

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
we're now working with a Seberg SPS 160

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.870 
we're now working with a Seberg SPS 160
jukebox<00:00:05.279> which<00:00:05.580> i<00:00:05.700> believe<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.060> from<00:00:06.299> 1972<00:00:07.880> we

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
jukebox which i believe is from 1972 we

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.910 
jukebox which i believe is from 1972 we
had<00:00:09.030> worked<00:00:09.300> on<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.599> jukebox<00:00:09.900> about<00:00:10.650> five

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
had worked on this jukebox about five

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.690 
had worked on this jukebox about five
years<00:00:11.309> ago<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.559> fixed<00:00:13.559> some<00:00:13.710> problems<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
years ago and fixed some problems on it

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.060 
years ago and fixed some problems on it
but<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.480> looks<00:00:15.719> like<00:00:16.020> there<00:00:16.230> may<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.650> problem

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
but it looks like there may be a problem

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.349 
but it looks like there may be a problem
which<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> recurred<00:00:18.750> after<00:00:19.400> all<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.730> time<00:00:21.060> of

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
which is recurred after all this time of

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.529 
which is recurred after all this time of
use<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:23.100> related<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> reversing

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
use and it's related to the reversing

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.170 
use and it's related to the reversing
switch<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> motor

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
switch on the motor

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.169 
switch on the motor
here's<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.449> motor<00:00:28.220> here's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.429> mechanism

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
here's the motor here's the mechanism

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.010 
here's the motor here's the mechanism
here<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.700> right<00:00:32.700> down<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
here and right down here is the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.580 
here and right down here is the
reversing<00:00:34.710> switch<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.079> switch<00:00:37.079> gets

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
reversing switch and that switch gets

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.090 
reversing switch and that switch gets
activated<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.760> mechanism<00:00:39.629> travels<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
activated when the mechanism travels to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.170 
activated when the mechanism travels to
either<00:00:41.460> end<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.040> track<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.879> in

picked<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.969> complaint<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.140> was

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
picked out the complaint on this was

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.349 
picked out the complaint on this was
that<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.370> speed<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.320> intermittent<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.370> let

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
that the speed is intermittent and let

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
that the speed is intermittent and let
me<00:01:03.449> go<00:01:03.629> ahead<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.199> let<00:01:04.710> me<00:01:04.739> go<00:01:04.979> ahead<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.309> load

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.929 
me go ahead and let me go ahead and load
a<00:01:05.670> record<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:07.350> gonna<00:01:07.619> let<00:01:08.460> me<00:01:08.549> turn<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
a record here I'm gonna let me turn it

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.289 
a record here I'm gonna let me turn it
on<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> I'll<00:01:09.420> reject<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:14.060> complaint<00:01:15.060> was

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
on and I'll reject it the complaint was

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.490 
on and I'll reject it the complaint was
just<00:01:15.630> dragging<00:01:16.409> speed<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.450> luckily<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.290> had

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
just dragging speed and luckily I had

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.859 
just dragging speed and luckily I had
kept<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> journal<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.689> can

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
kept a journal on this which you can

00:01:21.869 --> 00:02:12.710 
kept a journal on this which you can

now let's actually I'm going to get back
there<00:02:15.879> we<00:02:16.750> can<00:02:16.930> check<00:02:17.200> out<00:02:17.410> those<00:02:17.590> switch

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
there we can check out those switch

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:36.620 
there we can check out those switch
contacts<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:18.910> hear<00:02:19.300> what<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.629> doing

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.030

let's<00:03:46.180> try<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.540> again<00:03:46.720> here<00:03:47.790> see<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.819> arcing

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.589 

so<00:03:56.860> we've<00:03:57.099> definitely<00:03:57.310> got<00:03:57.909> a<00:03:57.940> problem<00:03:58.330> with

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
so we've definitely got a problem with

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.259 
so we've definitely got a problem with
those<00:03:58.750> switch<00:03:59.049> contacts<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.129> if<00:04:00.879> you're<00:04:01.090> ever

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
those switch contacts and if you're ever

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.500 
those switch contacts and if you're ever
working<00:04:01.540> with<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.379> these<00:04:03.180> jukeboxes<00:04:04.180> be

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
working with with these jukeboxes be

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.509 
working with with these jukeboxes be
very<00:04:04.810> careful<00:04:05.379> when<00:04:05.530> you<00:04:05.620> do<00:04:05.830> what<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.069> just<00:04:06.160> did

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
very careful when you do what I just did

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.460 
very careful when you do what I just did
because<00:04:07.450> there's<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.720> hundred<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.170> twenty

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
because there's a hundred and twenty

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.460 
because there's a hundred and twenty
volts<00:04:09.420> 120<00:04:10.420> volts<00:04:10.750> right<00:04:10.930> there<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.319> those

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
volts 120 volts right there on those

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.190 
volts 120 volts right there on those
contacts<00:04:12.099> and<00:04:12.519> also<00:04:12.760> on<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.299> upper<00:04:13.450> contacts

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
contacts and also on the upper contacts

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.830 
contacts and also on the upper contacts
up<00:04:14.470> there<00:04:14.739> as<00:04:14.920> well<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:16.239> just<00:04:16.359> got<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.750> be

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
up there as well so you just got to be

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.500 
up there as well so you just got to be
really<00:04:17.139> careful<00:04:17.440> if<00:04:17.859> you're<00:04:18.039> touching<00:04:18.510> any

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
really careful if you're touching any

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.659 
really careful if you're touching any
switch<00:04:20.019> activating<00:04:20.799> levers<00:04:21.160> with<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.459> power

switch activating levers with the power

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.370 
switch activating levers with the power
on<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.889> we<00:04:24.699> we<00:04:25.000> cure<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.570> problem<00:04:26.110> five

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
on so I we we cure the problem five

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.560 
on so I we we cure the problem five
years<00:04:26.800> ago<00:04:27.190> by<00:04:28.410> bending<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.590> little<00:04:30.570> support

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
years ago by bending the little support

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.180 
years ago by bending the little support
on<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.870> contacts<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.770> give<00:04:32.889> more

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
on the contacts to give more

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.659 
on the contacts to give more
follow-through<00:04:34.289> but<00:04:35.289> we'll<00:04:36.010> have<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.220> try

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
follow-through but we'll have to try

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.770 
follow-through but we'll have to try
various<00:04:37.210> things<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.139> we<00:04:38.350> may<00:04:38.530> need<00:04:38.740> to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
various things on this we may need to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.379 
various things on this we may need to
burnish<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.930> contacts<00:04:41.500> again<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:43.210> then

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
burnish the contacts again and and then

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.040 
burnish the contacts again and and then
try<00:04:44.280> try<00:04:45.280> again

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
try try again

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.140 
try try again
just<00:04:47.050> reforming<00:04:47.800> them<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.729> that<00:04:48.910> we<00:04:49.000> get

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
just reforming them so that we get

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.740 
just reforming them so that we get
better<00:04:49.450> contact<00:04:50.200> pressure<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:52.450> may<00:04:52.690> be

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
better contact pressure and it may be

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.050 
better contact pressure and it may be
that<00:04:52.990> those<00:04:53.229> points<00:04:53.800> are<00:04:53.950> just<00:04:54.190> burnt<00:04:54.789> and

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that those points are just burnt and

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.430 
that those points are just burnt and
even<00:04:58.060> though<00:04:58.180> we're<00:04:58.389> able<00:04:58.539> to<00:04:58.750> fix<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.169> years

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
even though we're able to fix it years

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.950 
even though we're able to fix it years
ago<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.979> may<00:05:00.190> not<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:01.030> may<00:05:01.090> be<00:05:01.389> that<00:05:01.780> they're

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
ago it may not it may be that they're

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.830 
ago it may not it may be that they're
they're<00:05:02.260> going<00:05:02.349> to<00:05:02.440> have<00:05:02.650> trouble<00:05:02.979> staying<00:05:03.849> in

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
they're going to have trouble staying in

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.370 
they're going to have trouble staying in
a<00:05:05.620> proper<00:05:06.070> working<00:05:06.310> condition

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
a proper working condition

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.500 
a proper working condition
so<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.560> may<00:05:08.710> might<00:05:09.280> have<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.729> resort<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:10.240> go

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
so it may might have to resort to go

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.740 
so it may might have to resort to go

maybe from Victory glass but that's

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.210 
maybe from Victory glass but that's
definitely<00:05:25.810> what's<00:05:25.990> causing<00:05:26.289> the<00:05:26.590> problem<00:05:26.770> on

causing I knew there had to be arcing
somewhere<00:05:49.210> but<00:05:49.960> I<00:05:49.990> was<00:05:50.229> wondering<00:05:50.440> if<00:05:50.650> it

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
somewhere but I was wondering if it

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.589 
somewhere but I was wondering if it
might<00:05:50.919> have<00:05:51.039> been<00:05:51.099> in<00:05:51.250> a<00:05:51.340> triac<00:05:51.940> inside<00:05:52.450> the

might have been in a triac inside the

might have been in a triac inside the
control<00:05:53.020> center<00:05:53.440> or

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879 
control center or

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.209 
control center or
or<00:05:54.659> if<00:05:54.869> there's<00:05:55.080> another<00:05:55.199> relay<00:05:55.889> that<00:05:56.099> was

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
or if there's another relay that was

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.129 
or if there's another relay that was
arcing<00:05:56.610> or<00:05:56.699> something<00:05:57.059> but<00:05:57.300> luckily<00:05:57.599> I<00:05:57.839> made

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
arcing or something but luckily I made

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.489 
arcing or something but luckily I made
that<00:05:58.379> Journal<00:05:58.949> years<00:05:59.279> ago<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.259> had<00:06:01.259> written

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:01.499 
that Journal years ago and had written

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.589 
that Journal years ago and had written
about<00:06:01.740> arcing<00:06:02.369> at<00:06:02.490> those<00:06:02.699> points<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:03.479> that

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
about arcing at those points and that

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.329 
about arcing at those points and that
led<00:06:03.809> me<00:06:03.990> right<00:06:04.020> back<00:06:04.409> to<00:06:04.469> it<00:06:05.479> and<00:06:06.740> make<00:06:07.740> another
