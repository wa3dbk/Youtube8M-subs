I'd<00:00:00.840> like<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.140> finish<00:00:01.319> up<00:00:01.589> my<00:00:01.740> series<00:00:02.159> on

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
I'd like to finish up my series on

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.519 
I'd like to finish up my series on
straight<00:00:03.179> bowing<00:00:03.570> or<00:00:03.689> parallel<00:00:04.110> bowing<00:00:04.410> we're

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
straight bowing or parallel bowing we're

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.840 
straight bowing or parallel bowing we're
going<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.799> introduce<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.339> new<00:00:05.460> technique

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
going to introduce a new technique

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.390 
going to introduce a new technique
called<00:00:05.910> figure<00:00:06.540> eight<00:00:06.720> bowing<00:00:07.160> but<00:00:08.160> first

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
called figure eight bowing but first

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.669 
called figure eight bowing but first
let's<00:00:08.610> just<00:00:08.849> briefly<00:00:09.389> review<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.469> talked

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
let's just briefly review what we talked

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.669 
let's just briefly review what we talked
about<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> first<00:00:11.370> couple<00:00:11.550> videos<00:00:12.679> really

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
about in the first couple videos really

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.279 
about in the first couple videos really
quickly<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.370> idea<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.910> bowing<00:00:15.630> straight<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
quickly the idea of bowing straight is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.710 
quickly the idea of bowing straight is
so<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.859> can<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.580> full<00:00:18.420> sound

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so that you can have a full sound

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.630 
so that you can have a full sound
without<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> fuzziness<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.369> would<00:00:20.490> be

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
without a fuzziness that would be

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.179 
without a fuzziness that would be
created<00:00:21.210> when<00:00:21.390> you're<00:00:21.510> both<00:00:21.660> slides<00:00:22.140> away<00:00:23.010> or

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
created when you're both slides away or

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.730 
created when you're both slides away or
towards<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.580> bridge<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.600> told<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
towards the bridge and I told you to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.710 
towards the bridge and I told you to
just<00:00:25.949> stare<00:00:26.430> at<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.699> contact<00:00:27.119> point<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
just stare at your contact point and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.650 
just stare at your contact point and
watch<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.880> moving<00:00:30.330> away<00:00:30.510> or

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
watch it and see if it's moving away or

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.749 
watch it and see if it's moving away or
towards<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.949> does<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.160> should<00:00:32.610> be

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
towards you and if it does you should be

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
towards you and if it does you should be
able<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> hear<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.780> creates<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.320> fuzziness

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
able to hear that it creates a fuzziness

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.250 
able to hear that it creates a fuzziness
and<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.670> want<00:00:38.690> don't<00:00:39.690> project<00:00:39.899> better

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and what you want don't project better

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
and what you want don't project better
practice<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.399> middle<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> then

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
practice that in the middle and then

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170 
practice that in the middle and then
start<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> work<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.590> bigger<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.730> bigger<00:00:44.879> pose

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
start to work to bigger and bigger pose

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.450 
start to work to bigger and bigger pose
marks<00:00:45.660> Dreamboats<00:00:46.140> okay<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:47.070> let's<00:00:47.250> take<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
marks Dreamboats okay now let's take it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970 
marks Dreamboats okay now let's take it
a<00:00:47.640> step<00:00:47.789> further<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.660> watched<00:00:49.110> my<00:00:49.469> videos

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
a step further if you watched my videos

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.490 
a step further if you watched my videos
on<00:00:50.160> tone<00:00:50.399> production<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.870> most<00:00:52.079> recent

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
on tone production in the most recent

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.959 
on tone production in the most recent
ones<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.829> talked<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.399> actually<00:00:55.969> changing

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ones I talked about actually changing

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.779 
ones I talked about actually changing
lanes<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.170> say<00:00:58.559> I'd<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:59.190> parallel<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
lanes so say I'd be going parallel to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.380 
lanes so say I'd be going parallel to
the<00:00:59.879> bridge

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the bridge

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.959 
the bridge
pull<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> boat<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> move<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.460> pulled

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
pull the boat back and move it I pulled

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.260 
pull the boat back and move it I pulled
it<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.589> let<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> boat<00:01:04.949> slip<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.850> towards<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it in let the boat slip out towards the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.090 
it in let the boat slip out towards the
fingerboard<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.080> I'd<00:01:07.229> straighten<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
fingerboard and then I'd straighten it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.850 
fingerboard and then I'd straighten it
out<00:01:08.250> again<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.240> use<00:01:09.450> those

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
out again and I can use those

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.340 
out again and I can use those
adjustments<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.340> change<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.970> lanes

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
adjustments to actually change the lanes

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
adjustments to actually change the lanes
now<00:01:13.350> let's<00:01:13.710> talk<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.100> those<00:01:14.460> angles<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
now let's talk about those angles if you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.649 
now let's talk about those angles if you
become<00:01:16.790> crooked<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> boat

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
become crooked with the boat

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
become crooked with the boat
okay<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.680> bow<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> do

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
okay the bow is going to want to do

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.399 
okay the bow is going to want to do
something<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> go<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.560> Oh<00:01:23.390> with<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> boat<00:01:24.720> in

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
something if I go up Oh with the boat in

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.490 
something if I go up Oh with the boat in
towards<00:01:25.860> my<00:01:25.979> body<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:27.630> see<00:01:27.810> how<00:01:27.930> crooked<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.350> am

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
towards my body you see how crooked I am

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
towards my body you see how crooked I am
it's<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> pull<00:01:29.759> towards<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it's going to want to pull towards the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.929 
it's going to want to pull towards the
bridge<00:01:30.560> if<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:31.950> bow<00:01:32.520> with<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.729> bow

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
bridge if I go down bow with the bow

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.740 
bridge if I go down bow with the bow
leaning<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.479> way<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> pull

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
leaning this way it's gonna want to pull

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
leaning this way it's gonna want to pull
towards<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> bridge<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> opposite

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
towards the bridge and the opposite

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
towards the bridge and the opposite
would<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.119> true<00:01:39.210> awesome<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.320> let's<00:01:40.829> use<00:01:41.070> that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
would be true awesome so let's use that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.690 
would be true awesome so let's use that
subtle<00:01:42.090> angle<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.250> actually<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.549> we

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
subtle angle and actually see if we

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.359 
subtle angle and actually see if we
can't<00:01:44.939> change<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:46.259> we're<00:01:46.409> doing<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.890> what

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
can't change what we're doing here what

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
can't change what we're doing here what
I<00:01:47.399> want<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.170> assuming<00:01:49.439> you've

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
I want you to do this is assuming you've

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.859 
I want you to do this is assuming you've
already<00:01:49.979> learned<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> vote<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
already learned how to vote with a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
already learned how to vote with a
reasonably<00:01:52.530> straight<00:01:52.799> bow<00:01:53.040> using<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> whole

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
reasonably straight bow using the whole

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.660 
reasonably straight bow using the whole
thing<00:01:54.350> remember<00:01:55.350> though<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.130> watch<00:01:56.310> great

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
thing remember though if you watch great

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.910 
thing remember though if you watch great
violinists<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.930> almost<00:01:58.110> never<00:01:58.530> look

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
violinists they almost never look

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.200 
violinists they almost never look
absolutely<00:01:59.579> parallel<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> bridge

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
absolutely parallel to the bridge

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.140 
absolutely parallel to the bridge
time<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.690> will<00:02:01.900> see<00:02:02.400> little<00:02:03.400> circles<00:02:03.970> or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
time you will see little circles or

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.780 
time you will see little circles or
motions<00:02:04.600> because<00:02:05.590> our<00:02:05.740> wrists<00:02:06.040> work<00:02:06.670> in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
motions because our wrists work in

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.760 
motions because our wrists work in
circles<00:02:07.180> aren't<00:02:07.450> half<00:02:08.140> circle<00:02:08.560> here

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
circles aren't half circle here

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.760 
circles aren't half circle here
everything<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.670> around<00:02:10.000> okay<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:11.260> if<00:02:11.590> that's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
everything is around okay so if that's

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.380 
everything is around okay so if that's
all<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:12.610> don't<00:02:12.970> want<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> both

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
all right we just don't want the both

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.660 
all right we just don't want the both
sliding<00:02:14.170> around<00:02:14.290> every<00:02:14.740> time<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.069> change<00:02:15.400> our

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
sliding around every time we change our

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
sliding around every time we change our
bow<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.480> what<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.690> want<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.080> do<00:02:17.640> again<00:02:18.690> let's

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
bow so what I want you to do again let's

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.860 
bow so what I want you to do again let's
set<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.350> near<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.530> tip<00:02:20.920> pull<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.390> little<00:02:22.540> bit

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
set it near the tip pull in a little bit

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.960 
set it near the tip pull in a little bit
now<00:02:23.860> you're<00:02:24.010> going<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.370> firm<00:02:24.760> enough

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
now you're going to have a firm enough

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.440 
now you're going to have a firm enough
hand<00:02:25.380> thumb<00:02:26.380> up<00:02:26.680> fingers<00:02:27.520> down<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.300> you're

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
hand thumb up fingers down that you're

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.210 
hand thumb up fingers down that you're
not<00:02:28.600> going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> let<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.230> boat<00:02:29.410> slide<00:02:29.830> towards

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
not going to let the boat slide towards

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.960 
not going to let the boat slide towards
the<00:02:30.430> bridge

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the bridge

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.880 
the bridge
if<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.420> pull<00:02:31.630> back<00:02:31.780> severely<00:02:32.319> it's<00:02:32.590> going<00:02:32.800> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
if you pull back severely it's going to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.140 
if you pull back severely it's going to
slide<00:02:33.100> for<00:02:33.340> sure<00:02:33.459> but<00:02:33.610> let's<00:02:33.790> just<00:02:33.910> pull<00:02:34.120> back

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
slide for sure but let's just pull back

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.300 
slide for sure but let's just pull back
a<00:02:34.300> little<00:02:34.420> bit<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.350> see<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.739> I'm<00:02:35.860> parallel

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
a little bit you see that I'm parallel

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.300 
a little bit you see that I'm parallel
to<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> bridge<00:02:36.700> there<00:02:37.120> now<00:02:38.019> I'm<00:02:38.200> not<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.220> I'm

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
to the bridge there now I'm not but I'm

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.400 
to the bridge there now I'm not but I'm
gonna<00:02:39.459> hang<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.600> my<00:02:40.630> fingers<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
gonna hang on to it on my fingers and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.860 
gonna hang on to it on my fingers and
I'm<00:02:41.830> going<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.250> see<00:02:42.459> if<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.670> can't<00:02:42.940> make<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.300> stay

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
I'm going to see if I can't make it stay

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.199 
I'm going to see if I can't make it stay
in<00:02:44.140> one<00:02:44.560> place<00:02:46.560> okay<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.830> firmness<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:49.150> I

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
in one place okay that firmness that I

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.670 
in one place okay that firmness that I
feel<00:02:49.600> allows<00:02:50.380> me<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:52.209> grab<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.080> string<00:02:53.380> and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
feel allows me to grab the string and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.860 
feel allows me to grab the string and
that<00:02:54.010> subtle<00:02:54.370> tension<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.209> boat<00:02:55.510> pulling

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
that subtle tension of the boat pulling

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.720 
that subtle tension of the boat pulling
towards<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.470> bridge<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.920> actually<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.430> good

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
towards the bridge is actually a good

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.270 
towards the bridge is actually a good
thing<00:02:57.790> because<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:59.290> can<00:02:59.500> create<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.890> really

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
thing because you can create a really

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.729 
thing because you can create a really
full<00:03:00.700> fat<00:03:01.030> sound<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.600> way<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.440> trying

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
full fat sound that way if it's trying

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.559 
full fat sound that way if it's trying
to<00:03:02.860> pull<00:03:03.040> towards<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.400> fingerboard<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.480> know

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
to pull towards the fingerboard you know

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.030 
to pull towards the fingerboard you know
you're<00:03:04.780> not<00:03:04.959> going<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.440> quality

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you're not going to have a quality

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.860 
you're not going to have a quality
course<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.120> you're<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.540> going<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.720> get<00:03:07.810> a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
course and you're just going to get a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.580 
course and you're just going to get a
fuzzy<00:03:08.110> Sam

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
fuzzy Sam

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.650 
fuzzy Sam
but<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.070> pulling<00:03:09.579> towards<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.060> bridge<00:03:10.329> is

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
but that pulling towards the bridge is

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.720 
but that pulling towards the bridge is
really<00:03:11.200> important<00:03:11.860> this<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.400> one<00:03:12.579> of<00:03:12.670> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
really important this is one of the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.940 
really important this is one of the
reasons<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.780> say<00:03:14.019> well<00:03:14.290> set<00:03:14.590> your<00:03:14.769> hair

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
reasons that we say well set your hair

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.740 
reasons that we say well set your hair
so<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.340> they're<00:03:15.489> flat<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.000> lean<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.390> boat

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
so that they're flat and lean the boat

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.039 
so that they're flat and lean the boat
just<00:03:17.079> slightly<00:03:17.799> away<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:19.090> that's<00:03:19.299> cutting<00:03:19.750> in

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
just slightly away so that's cutting in

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.390 
just slightly away so that's cutting in
you<00:03:20.350> know<00:03:20.440> what<00:03:20.530> cellist<00:03:20.950> would<00:03:21.130> do<00:03:21.250> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
you know what cellist would do the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.460 
you know what cellist would do the
opposite<00:03:21.970> if<00:03:22.209> they're<00:03:22.840> holding<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.440> this

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
opposite if they're holding it like this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.190 
opposite if they're holding it like this
they<00:03:23.950> would<00:03:24.160> lean<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.640> boat<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
they would lean the boat so that the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.620 
they would lean the boat so that the
wood<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:26.829> leaning<00:03:27.489> towards<00:03:27.940> their<00:03:28.209> from<00:03:28.450> their

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
wood is leaning towards their from their

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.530 
wood is leaning towards their from their
nose<00:03:28.870> right<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:30.459> wood<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.820> leading<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.299> but<00:03:31.510> a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
nose right the wood is leading in but a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.720 
nose right the wood is leading in but a
violinist<00:03:32.019> would<00:03:32.350> lean<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.489> wood<00:03:33.700> is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
violinist would lean so the wood is

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.150 
violinist would lean so the wood is
going<00:03:34.480> away<00:03:34.780> from<00:03:34.989> their<00:03:35.380> nose<00:03:35.590> because<00:03:36.130> of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
going away from their nose because of

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.680 
going away from their nose because of
the<00:03:36.400> difference<00:03:36.730> here<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.239> what<00:03:37.420> we're<00:03:37.540> trying

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
the difference here so what we're trying

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.840 
the difference here so what we're trying
to<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.049> is<00:03:38.200> slightly<00:03:38.739> cut<00:03:39.040> into<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.579> string

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
to do is slightly cut into the string

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.270 
to do is slightly cut into the string
you<00:03:40.390> can<00:03:40.420> use<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.930> slight<00:03:41.470> angle<00:03:41.860> on<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.130> up

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
you can use this slight angle on the up

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.610 
you can use this slight angle on the up
OH<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:43.299> grab<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.870> string

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
OH to grab the string

from you and you watch a contact point

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.300 
from you and you watch a contact point
and<00:04:04.870> don't<00:04:05.200> let<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.410> go<00:04:05.620> now<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:05.890> have<00:04:06.040> to

and don't let it go now you have to

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.979 
and don't let it go now you have to
learn<00:04:06.459> how<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.700> turn<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.209> bow<00:04:07.390> around<00:04:07.450> at<00:04:07.900> each

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
learn how to turn the bow around at each

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.440 
learn how to turn the bow around at each
end<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:09.099> we'll<00:04:09.310> start<00:04:09.519> with<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.760> a<00:04:09.790> bow<00:04:10.150> pull

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
end so we'll start with the a bow pull

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.250 
end so we'll start with the a bow pull
it<00:04:10.569> in<00:04:11.549> when<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.640> get<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:13.090> almost<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.930> point<00:04:14.110> the

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
it in when I get to almost the point the

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.409 
it in when I get to almost the point the
turn<00:04:14.470> you'll<00:04:14.739> notice<00:04:15.129> that<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.400> do<00:04:15.670> this<00:04:15.879> slight

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
turn you'll notice that I do this slight

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.530 
turn you'll notice that I do this slight
rotation<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:17.200> have

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.260 

let's<00:04:20.200> difficut

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.720 

you'll<00:04:23.569> see<00:04:23.840> circles<00:04:24.379> and<00:04:25.039> each<00:04:25.220> end

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
you'll see circles and each end

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.020 
you'll see circles and each end
you<00:04:27.510> come<00:04:27.690> up<00:04:27.870> like<00:04:28.530> them<00:04:28.740> up<00:04:28.890> here<00:04:29.160> watch<00:04:29.700> my

you come up like them up here watch my

it's<00:04:32.730> not

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
it's not

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.740 
it's not
jumping<00:04:34.680> around<00:04:34.830> it's<00:04:35.370> grabbing<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:36.570> I'm

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
jumping around it's grabbing so I'm

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.130 
jumping around it's grabbing so I'm
actually<00:04:37.010> doing<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.460> lot<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.120> motion<00:04:39.810> with<00:04:40.110> my

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
actually doing a lot of motion with my

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.710 
actually doing a lot of motion with my
bow<00:04:40.500> change<00:04:40.860> but<00:04:41.460> hopefully<00:04:41.850> still<00:04:42.240> keeping

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
bow change but hopefully still keeping

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.010 
bow change but hopefully still keeping
my<00:04:42.930> contact<00:04:43.530> point<00:04:44.000> like<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> laser<00:04:45.420> beam<00:04:45.780> I

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
my contact point like a laser beam I

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.410 
my contact point like a laser beam I
have<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.380> focus<00:04:46.680> sound<00:04:47.190> that's<00:04:48.030> what<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.390> of

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
have this focus sound that's what one of

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.270 
have this focus sound that's what one of
my<00:04:48.510> teachers<00:04:48.750> called<00:04:49.140> figure-eight<00:04:49.770> bowing

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
my teachers called figure-eight bowing

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.700 
my teachers called figure-eight bowing
it's<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:51.000> neat<00:04:51.210> technique<00:04:51.720> especially<00:04:52.170> I'm

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
it's a neat technique especially I'm

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.800 
it's a neat technique especially I'm
really<00:04:53.160> long<00:04:53.550> those<00:04:53.880> that<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.210> want<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.480> full

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
really long those that you want a full

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.780 
really long those that you want a full
sound<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.410> want<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.650> pull<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.280> sound<00:04:56.580> out

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
sound and you want to pull the sound out

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.580 
sound and you want to pull the sound out
of<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.970> instrument<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.840> can<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.320> it<00:04:58.470> up

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
of the instrument so you can on it up

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.610 
of the instrument so you can on it up
but<00:04:58.770> pull<00:04:59.010> in<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> little<00:04:59.700> bit<00:04:59.850> and<00:05:00.410> really<00:05:01.410> just

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
but pull in a little bit and really just

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.070 
but pull in a little bit and really just
pull<00:05:02.040> that<00:05:02.070> sound<00:05:02.670> out<00:05:02.850> and<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.510> opposite<00:05:03.960> is

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
pull that sound out and the opposite is

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.900 
pull that sound out and the opposite is
true<00:05:04.140> on<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.440> down<00:05:04.680> bow<00:05:04.920> away<00:05:05.250> from<00:05:05.670> your<00:05:05.760> body

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
true on the down bow away from your body

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.940 
true on the down bow away from your body
so<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.750> can<00:05:06.900> practice<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.320> with<00:05:07.620> fairly

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
so you can practice that with fairly

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.420 
so you can practice that with fairly
small<00:05:08.250> bows<00:05:08.780> figure<00:05:09.780> eights<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.380> then<00:05:11.160> start

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
small bows figure eights and then start

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.550 
small bows figure eights and then start
their<00:05:11.580> work<00:05:11.670> larger<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.450> larger<00:05:12.600> stare<00:05:13.440> at

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
their work larger and larger stare at

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.920 
their work larger and larger stare at
your<00:05:13.710> contact<00:05:14.160> point

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
your contact point

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.150 
your contact point
remember<00:05:15.930> it's<00:05:16.110> not<00:05:16.200> really<00:05:16.770> about<00:05:16.890> whether

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
remember it's not really about whether

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.770 
remember it's not really about whether
you're<00:05:17.430> both<00:05:17.610> moving<00:05:18.030> parallel<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.690> the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
you're both moving parallel to the

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.510 
you're both moving parallel to the
bridge<00:05:18.960> or<00:05:19.140> not<00:05:19.290> it's<00:05:19.800> about<00:05:19.950> whether<00:05:20.250> you're

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
bridge or not it's about whether you're

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.700 
bridge or not it's about whether you're
not<00:05:20.640> whether<00:05:21.150> you're<00:05:21.570> staying<00:05:21.960> in<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.470> lane

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
not whether you're staying in the lane

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.970 
not whether you're staying in the lane
you<00:05:23.010> need<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.400> be<00:05:24.169> otherwise<00:05:25.169> your<00:05:25.710> tone

quality changes in the middle of a

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.650 
quality changes in the middle of a
phrase<00:05:28.110> it's<00:05:28.890> very<00:05:29.070> hard<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.430> be<00:05:29.580> musical<00:05:30.120> when

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
phrase it's very hard to be musical when

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.930 
phrase it's very hard to be musical when
your<00:05:30.810> sound<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.230> being<00:05:31.500> disrupted<00:05:32.130> by<00:05:32.310> your

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
your sound is being disrupted by your

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.500 
your sound is being disrupted by your
bow<00:05:33.230> okay<00:05:34.230> so<00:05:35.040> hopefully<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:36.000> will<00:05:36.210> give<00:05:36.419> you

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
bow okay so hopefully that will give you

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.390 
bow okay so hopefully that will give you
an<00:05:36.660> idea<00:05:36.840> how<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.320> take<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:37.650> one<00:05:38.130> more<00:05:38.160> step

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
an idea how to take it one more step

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.550 
an idea how to take it one more step
just<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:39.330> you<00:05:39.419> know<00:05:39.510> I<00:05:39.630> don't<00:05:39.930> do<00:05:40.140> this<00:05:40.350> every

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
just so you know I don't do this every

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.310 
just so you know I don't do this every
time<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:41.010> use<00:05:41.160> long<00:05:41.460> bows<00:05:41.730> by<00:05:41.970> any<00:05:42.150> means<00:05:42.450> but<00:05:42.570> it

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
time I use long bows by any means but it

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.960 
time I use long bows by any means but it
becomes<00:05:43.710> automatic<00:05:43.890> so<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:44.490> don't<00:05:44.730> even<00:05:44.820> think

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
becomes automatic so I don't even think

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.870 
becomes automatic so I don't even think
about<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.480> anymore<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:46.320> it's<00:05:47.310> important<00:05:47.850> that

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
about it anymore and it's important that

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.820 
about it anymore and it's important that
you've<00:05:48.150> practiced<00:05:48.690> it<00:05:48.870> outside<00:05:49.350> of<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.650> piece

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
you've practiced it outside of the piece

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.560 
you've practiced it outside of the piece
and<00:05:50.040> then<00:05:50.130> you<00:05:50.310> start<00:05:50.550> applying<00:05:50.760> it<00:05:51.060> maybe<00:05:51.300> to

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
and then you start applying it maybe to

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.700 
and then you start applying it maybe to
a<00:05:51.620> slow<00:05:52.620> a<00:05:52.650> tube<00:05:53.100> of<00:05:53.340> holmen's<00:05:53.960> okay<00:05:54.960> anyway

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
a slow a tube of holmen's okay anyway

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.300 
a slow a tube of holmen's okay anyway
there's<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.880> final<00:05:57.270> installment<00:05:58.020> on<00:05:58.320> bowing

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
there's the final installment on bowing

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.900 
there's the final installment on bowing
stray<00:05:59.580> figure<00:06:00.150> eight<00:06:00.270> bowing<00:06:00.540> good<00:06:00.750> luck
