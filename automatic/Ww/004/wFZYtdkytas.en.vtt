00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.590
 hello sweet not really hearty again 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.210
 to a new video of me 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 and I have one again today 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.160
 we smaller for you it is about one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.949
 baby cream around this one this is the east 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 are protection like cream complete touch of 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 foundation with max factor that was before 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 some time in the dm darling box 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 and I could test her for her 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.080
 fits my skin tone is 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.149
 namely for the darker types of skin and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 sun protection factor 15 for the coming 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.340
 summer 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.219
 which I at baby crems always very much 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 very important 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.460
 cost is around six euros 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.730
 in the dm if I am not mistaken 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 and here are 50 milliliters 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.440
 you see she is coming here in this 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 carton again extra packed and then 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.250
 is also still not clogged the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.120
 pore light texture and pulls fast 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.219
 on 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.280
 yes she just takes out and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.190
 from optical here I find very similar 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.470
 the baby cream by patrice, however 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.659
 here are 50 milliliters and included 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.189
 from patrice i believe that only contains 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 30 milliliters if I am not now 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.229
 deceive yes that in addition then I have to say 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.390
 I tested it and I'm in 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.189
 first moment really super excited 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.140
 I can give you the consistency now 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.659
 In short, they do not show it too viscous 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 which is not too thin 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.240
 just right as maybe see here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.759
 You can then if you spread them so 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.130
 she is not unbelievably good, she really 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.060
 has no intrusive perfumed fragrance 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.210
 but a really creamy light 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 flowery scent but that is pleasant so 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.159
 you do not think about it somehow 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.630
 So at least that was with me so 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 then as she already promises 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.970
 she pulls really super super fast 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.159
 So I really do not have to wait 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.009
 It is in principle still draws 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.500
 take in more normal day care 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.900
 and you certainly know 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.790
 foto leaves the care series and pays 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.450
 even from max factor so one 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.009
 small puff make up must contain 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.260
 I think it's awesome because it just is not 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.240
 is too thick in consistency 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.890
 right now in summer and that's why 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.050
 I think the bibi prince is also in the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.260
 general currently totally in 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.530
 and as I said so she pulls as 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.690
 Insight really top and you just have 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.730
 not at all the feeling one wears 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.380
 some foundation but really 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.940
 Just one has all the cream on the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.170
 face and I think so great 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.290
 this one, yes, I have to say 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.510
 In spite of all that is personally for 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.880
 me now why not 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.340
 simply because she really is like that 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.290
 extremely rich for you 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.959
 Mixed skin is not suitable because they 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.910
 you then just a few hours shines 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.790
 that was the case, at least for me too 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.860
 when I have powdered off I have to say 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.500
 I have about three to four 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.180
 hours so shining so that 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.519
 was really extreme 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.709
 and I can well imagine that the 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.140
 really great is dry skin though 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.540
 for mixed hide for greasy skin for oily 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.880
 I can not recommend skin 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.610
 keep your fingers off because he does so 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.470
 Often you can not go to brother 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.390
 willi states how strong it shines 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.340
 So because they are so rich 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.959
 So that's the important thing I have 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.350
 really the feeling it's just one 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.390
 Day cream and so a tinted 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.489
 day cream - what I mean 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.940
 and that is actually for me now 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.980
 personally definitely too rich 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.570
 that's why it's me anyway 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.680
 they think they are great because they are fast 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.780
 moves in because she smells so super 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.800
 Fell but it is mine 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.290
 Skin types definitely not suitable 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.750
 way also gets them to light 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.000
 There are skin types I believe in two 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.940
 shades of color as I said medium to tal and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.260
 then also respectively from or 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.750
 in a light do 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.310
 so you do not have to worry 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.020
 if you just give it a try 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.050
 I wanted to recommend it to you 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.250
 but definitely only on dry skin 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.950
 because we do not shine for it today 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.110
 if your light foundation order and 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.910
 then it brings you nothing and nothing 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.440
 including the cushion does not have much 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.080
 The short time has come 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.720
 has stopped and then I have to say 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.630
 one day at the end of the day 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.610
 power definitely does not limit anything 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.010
 for me and my skin and that's why 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.390
 I can only do it for the dry one 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.520
 Cottages among you recommend as you 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.990
 So I have dry skin on you 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.770
 I would definitely get it back 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.410
 buy more 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.880
 so I think that's really great so you 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.800
 Really does not notice that one 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.780
 it is pasted on the contrary 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.660
 just so a fresh kick so care 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.070
 kick and in itself I think it's good 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.040
 just not from my skin which I very much 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.669
 very much a pity yes I could 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.230
 just about you from this baby cream 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.390
 report to angeles 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.430
 I hope the video has you a little 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.890
 helped a bit further when you left 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.840
 I'm still looking for a great body 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.120
 cream, there is currently really like that 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.380
 many like creams from so many companies 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.010
 You really have to be on the market 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.740
 look 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.450
 for which one decides there are 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.130
 but also I think like queens for 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.780
 especially greasy skin so mixed skin 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.850
 this of course better for me though 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.290
 in itself for dry skin I find the 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.800
 really great and I can give it to you 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.510
 Definitely recommend and leave me 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.370
 but please feel free to leave your feedback as 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.140
 you've already tested these and 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.240
 which also finds great or you say 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.470
 you do not like them then write me 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.530

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.180
 interested and otherwise we will see each other 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.560
 if you like in my next video 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.060

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.060
 nice day until then
