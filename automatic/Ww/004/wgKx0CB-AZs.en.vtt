 and with that 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.679
 I am Irina Lipina 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.789

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.750
 regular video review of the cycle 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.439

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.080
 speech in this review

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.369
 foreigners 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.289
 the test can be two scenarios in 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.210
 whichever 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.119
 not finished school 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.640
 most 100 country but also continues 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.020
 stay situation 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.999
 when in canadian educational institutions 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.389
 enrolls persons graduated from school for 

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:37.480
 outside of canada 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.720
 for example in Russia 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.910
 other cases is proceeds 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.860
 foreigners graduating from school in quarantine 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.520
 need to say that such people 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.030
 every year it becomes more and more 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.800
 and more 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.710
 including 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.100
 and cis countries 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.590
 as more wealthy people 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160
 sends its children canada to study 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.580
 pesto schools 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.639
 anyway but 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.340
 from this very moment 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.120
 teaching foreigners canadian school when 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.890
 this has several advantages 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.719
 they customer us a cat 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.239
 and university entrance or 

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.760
 college 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 passes according to the general scheme when the rest 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 Canadian students 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.939
 I remind you that in Canada at universities and 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.110
 colleges no introductory 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.070
 exams 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.250
 admission is based on ratings 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890
 received by school 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.140
 usually the average score which is receptionist 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.400
 commission of the century account 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.020
 troops estimated boots received 12 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.380
 m classes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.670
 therefore very important 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.550
 so that the average score was as high as possible 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.570
 ending high school in canada 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.420
 a foreigner 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.360
 has a set of necessary 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.350
 items 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.430
 and grades and understandable to the selection committee 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.990
 or by university 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.790
 another important moment of students 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.520
 finished the groove school 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.240

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.210
 English language 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.040
 publish a special train 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920
 since the successful ending is Canadian 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.460
 schools 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.320
 means 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.440
 that from sympathy enough 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.180
 finally studying in high school 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.360
 high school 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.690
 allows foreigners 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.560

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.049
 you need to consider that training in Canadian 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.689

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.249
 intense 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.389
 In the first courses there is a big dropout 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.549
 not everyone copes with loads 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.540
