00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
an E major scale down the neck so it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.490 
an E major scale down the neck so it
sounds<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.649> this

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.590 

okay<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:03.070> melody<00:01:03.610> is<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.089> next<00:01:04.330> thing<00:01:04.449> you

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
okay the melody is the next thing you

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.850 
okay the melody is the next thing you
have<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.809> get<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.440> what<00:01:05.560> I'm<00:01:05.620> going<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.770> do

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
have to get and so what I'm going to do

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.160 
have to get and so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:05.979> play<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.340> melody<00:01:06.580> at<00:01:07.030> normal<00:01:07.450> tempo<00:01:07.780> twice

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
is play the melody at normal tempo twice

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.780 
is play the melody at normal tempo twice
and<00:01:08.530> I'm<00:01:08.800> going<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.040> break<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.370> down<00:01:09.490> into

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
and I'm going to break it down into

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.880 
and I'm going to break it down into
patterns<00:01:10.090> very<00:01:10.600> slowly<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.140> there<00:01:11.530> by<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.680> end

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
patterns very slowly so there by the end

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.740 
patterns very slowly so there by the end
of<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.100> video<00:01:12.340> you'll<00:01:13.090> have<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.540> entire

of this video you'll have the entire

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.690 
of this video you'll have the entire
introduction<00:01:14.410> of<00:01:14.560> boku<00:01:14.830> no<00:01:14.860> atama<00:01:15.250> figure<00:01:15.640> it

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
introduction of boku no atama figure it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:27.890 
introduction of boku no atama figure it
out<00:01:15.850> okay<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.010> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.830 

hey

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.510 

ok<00:01:33.840> here's<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.500> first<00:01:34.620> pattern<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.370> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
ok here's the first pattern in that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.480 
ok here's the first pattern in that
melody<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.260> played<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.470> slow<00:01:37.800> tempo<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
melody and it's played a slow tempo is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.180 
melody and it's played a slow tempo is
going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.510> go<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.870> second<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:41.160> the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
going to go from the second to the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.850 
going to go from the second to the
fourth<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:42.120> this<00:01:42.300> sixth<00:01:42.810> slide<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
fourth to this sixth slide to the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.400 
fourth to this sixth slide to the
seventh<00:01:44.400> and<00:01:44.580> again<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.480> only<00:01:45.630> string<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
seventh and again the only string that

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.740 
seventh and again the only string that
you're<00:01:46.560> playing<00:01:46.800> is<00:01:47.160> your<00:01:47.820> fretting<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.510> going

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you're playing is your fretting is going

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.230 
you're playing is your fretting is going
to<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.010> D<00:01:50.220> string<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.820> you're

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
to be on the D string and you're

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
to be on the D string and you're
plucking<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.870> open<00:01:52.230> e<00:01:52.410> open<00:01:52.800> B<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.430> be

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
plucking the open e open B can be

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:03.340 
plucking the open e open B can be
together<00:01:53.940> ok<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.810> here's<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> first<00:01:55.560> pattern

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.200 

ok<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.650> second<00:02:05.040> pattern<00:02:05.400> he<00:02:05.610> jumps<00:02:05.940> down<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
ok the second pattern he jumps down to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.040 
ok the second pattern he jumps down to
the<00:02:06.330> ninth<00:02:06.570> fret<00:02:06.890> hammer<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> 11th

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
the ninth fret hammer on to the 11th

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.080 
the ninth fret hammer on to the 11th
back<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.380> ninth<00:02:10.700> slide<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
back to the ninth slide up to the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.120 
back to the ninth slide up to the
seventh<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> second<00:02:13.560> pattern<00:02:13.800> sounds

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
seventh so the second pattern sounds

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:25.580 
seventh so the second pattern sounds
like<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.590> third<00:02:22.890> pattern<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:25.260> some

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
like this the third pattern is just some

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.620 
like this the third pattern is just some
seventh<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> ninth<00:02:26.700> back<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> seventh

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
seventh to the ninth back to the seventh

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.110 
seventh to the ninth back to the seventh
and<00:02:27.840> then<00:02:28.410> pull<00:02:28.860> off<00:02:29.100> from<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> 7th<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> the
