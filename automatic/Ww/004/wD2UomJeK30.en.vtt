00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
sound of what we call the slap bass this

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.150 
sound of what we call the slap bass this
goes<00:02:47.030> back<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.330> ways<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.740> evolution

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
goes back a ways to the to the evolution

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.040 
goes back a ways to the to the evolution
of<00:02:49.250> country<00:02:49.670> before<00:02:50.090> there<00:02:50.420> was<00:02:50.540> drums<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
of country before there was drums and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.140 
of country before there was drums and
they<00:02:51.530> use<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.890> bass<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.280> create<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.820> rhythm

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
they use the bass to create the rhythm

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.270 
they use the bass to create the rhythm
so<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.480> basic<00:02:54.200> go<00:02:54.290> took<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.800> katuk<00:02:55.100> they'd

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
so the basic go took the katuk they'd

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.430 
so the basic go took the katuk they'd
literally<00:02:55.580> let<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> string<00:02:56.360> slap<00:02:56.900> off<00:02:57.200> the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
literally let the string slap off the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.020 
literally let the string slap off the
neck<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.890> bass<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.610> get<00:02:58.730> this<00:02:58.820> very

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
neck of the bass and you get this very

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.020 
neck of the bass and you get this very
particular<00:02:59.180> kind<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.750> sound<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:01.550> also<00:03:01.700> had

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
particular kind of sound you also had

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.640 
particular kind of sound you also had
what<00:03:02.240> was<00:03:02.360> called<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.660> dead<00:03:02.930> string<00:03:03.260> guitar

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
what was called a dead string guitar

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.050 
what was called a dead string guitar
where<00:03:03.890> they<00:03:03.980> would<00:03:04.130> take<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.340> dollar<00:03:04.790> bill<00:03:05.000> or

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
where they would take a dollar bill or

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.610 
where they would take a dollar bill or
some<00:03:05.360> paper<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.750> weave<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:06.110> into<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.320> strings

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
some paper and weave it into the strings

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.820 
some paper and weave it into the strings
and<00:03:06.800> you'd<00:03:06.890> literally<00:03:07.130> hear<00:03:08.380> just<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.500> dead
