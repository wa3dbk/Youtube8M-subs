00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
now one of the really cool features

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.580 
now one of the really cool features
about<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.880> f4<00:00:17.210> phantom<00:00:17.240> simulator<00:00:18.080> is<00:00:18.380> that

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
about the f4 phantom simulator is that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.800 
about the f4 phantom simulator is that
it<00:00:18.740> has<00:00:18.919> a<00:00:18.950> fully<00:00:19.310> functional<00:00:20.000> EDG<00:00:20.599> suit

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
it has a fully functional EDG suit

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.700 
it has a fully functional EDG suit
system<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.099> what's<00:00:22.310> in<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.610> DTC<00:00:23.090> system<00:00:23.630> will<00:00:24.619> in

about seven and a half or so I'm pretty
good

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.560 

there's<00:03:07.840> about<00:03:07.930> seven<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.470> half<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.800> think

there's about seven and a half I think

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.420 
there's about seven and a half I think
on<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:10.810> pole

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
on that pole

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.380 
on that pole
see<00:03:12.430> those<00:03:12.550> guys<00:03:12.730> down<00:03:12.970> there<00:03:13.090> right<00:03:13.270> there

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.040 
see those guys down there right there
four-wheelers<00:03:13.900> sure<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:16.180> got<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.360> stop<00:03:16.810> there

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
four-wheelers sure we got a stop there

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.730 
four-wheelers sure we got a stop there
for<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.260> second

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
for a second

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:27.350 
for a second
big<00:03:18.130> it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.600 

now<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.200> simulator<00:03:28.740> what<00:03:29.130> we<00:03:29.280> use<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
now in the simulator what we use the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.800 
now in the simulator what we use the
ATTC<00:03:30.210> for<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.590> hue<00:03:32.070> system<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.630> that

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
ATTC for this is a hue system so that

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.130 
ATTC for this is a hue system so that
the<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.890> pilot<00:03:35.160> can<00:03:35.670> feel<00:03:35.970> what<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.960> aircraft

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
the the pilot can feel what the aircraft

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.670 
the the pilot can feel what the aircraft
is<00:03:37.740> doing<00:03:38.190> now<00:03:38.610> without<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.090> G<00:03:39.270> suit<00:03:39.680> people

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
is doing now without the G suit people

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.770 
is doing now without the G suit people
said<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.980> simulator<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:42.060> call<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.300> hygiene

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
said the simulator you call a hygiene

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.500 
said the simulator you call a hygiene
turn<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:43.860> don't<00:03:44.070> think<00:03:44.220> twice<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.880> but

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
turn and you don't think twice and I but

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.110 
turn and you don't think twice and I but
that's<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:46.050> realistic<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.790> fighter

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that's not realistic and a fighter

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.110 
that's not realistic and a fighter
you're<00:03:48.990> affected<00:03:49.590> by<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.830> physical<00:03:50.550> strain

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
you're affected by the physical strain

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.950 
you're affected by the physical strain
of<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> term<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:53.100> what<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.700> G<00:03:53.880> suit<00:03:54.150> does<00:03:54.420> is

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
of the term so what the G suit does is

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.890 
of the term so what the G suit does is
it<00:03:55.200> puts<00:03:55.380> pressure<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:55.980> your<00:03:56.430> stomach<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.720> your

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
it puts pressure on your stomach in your

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.010 
it puts pressure on your stomach in your
lower<00:03:58.110> legs<00:03:58.610> so<00:03:59.610> two<00:04:00.180> things<00:04:00.390> happened<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
lower legs so two things happened it

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.180 
lower legs so two things happened it
actually<00:04:01.350> makes<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.680> kind<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:01.920> hard<00:04:02.130> to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
actually makes it kind of hard to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.280 
actually makes it kind of hard to
breathe<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.620> actually<00:04:04.620> kind<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.920> hurts<00:04:05.250> so

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
breathe and actually kind of hurts so

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.949 
breathe and actually kind of hurts so
after<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.320> few<00:04:07.380> moments<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.250> naturally

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
after a few moments you just naturally

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.260 
after a few moments you just naturally
stop<00:04:09.959> pulling<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.560> hygiene<00:04:10.980> terms<00:04:11.370> like<00:04:12.060> you

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
stop pulling the hygiene terms like you

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.060 
stop pulling the hygiene terms like you
would<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.630> real<00:04:12.720> aircraft<00:04:13.020> so<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.920> end

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
would in the real aircraft so the end

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.780 
would in the real aircraft so the end
result<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.700> when<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.270> use<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.690> ATTC<00:04:16.080> system

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
result is when you use the ATTC system

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.580 
result is when you use the ATTC system
your<00:04:17.790> flying<00:04:18.239> techniques<00:04:18.660> are<00:04:19.109> much<00:04:19.320> more

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
your flying techniques are much more

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.250 
your flying techniques are much more
realistic<00:04:20.330> now<00:04:21.330> I'm<00:04:21.750> going<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.080> demonstrate

f4 phantom pilot

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.510 
f4 phantom pilot
it's<00:04:56.160> called<00:04:56.370> sunny<00:04:56.669> Kaitlyn<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.740> VC<00:04:59.010> has

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
it's called sunny Kaitlyn so this VC has

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:09.240 
it's called sunny Kaitlyn so this VC has
a<00:04:59.550> lot<00:04:59.820> of<00:04:59.850> our<00:05:00.090> cool

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.470 

okay<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:11.110> when<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.800> GC<00:05:12.190> complains<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:13.270> air

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
okay so when the GC complains the air

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.590 
okay so when the GC complains the air
pushes<00:05:14.050> here<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:15.550> pushes<00:05:15.910> here<00:05:16.090> on<00:05:16.210> your<00:05:16.360> legs

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
pushes here and pushes here on your legs

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.390 
pushes here and pushes here on your legs
and<00:05:16.990> also<00:05:17.350> your<00:05:17.590> lower<00:05:17.830> legs

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
and also your lower legs

this<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.990> hose<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.680> connects<00:05:21.070> into<00:05:21.400> the

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
this is the hose that connects into the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.780 
this is the hose that connects into the
bowel<00:05:22.480> and<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.620> air<00:05:23.770> goes<00:05:23.980> through<00:05:24.040> here<00:05:24.520> in

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
bowel and the air goes through here in

bowel and the air goes through here in
place<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.240> suit<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:26.500> now<00:05:26.680> that<00:05:26.740> I<00:05:26.920> have<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.340> G

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
place the suit so now that I have the G

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.220 
place the suit so now that I have the G
suit<00:05:27.700> on<00:05:27.910> let's<00:05:28.480> go<00:05:28.630> check<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.870> out<00:05:29.080> the

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
suit on let's go check it out the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.710 
suit on let's go check it out the
simulator
