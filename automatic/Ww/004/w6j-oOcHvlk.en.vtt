graduate architects students who are

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.140 
graduate architects students who are
putting<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.980> full<00:00:26.220> time<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.730> try<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> make

putting in full time and try to make
this<00:00:27.300> Hyperloop<00:00:27.840> thing<00:00:28.050> happen<00:00:28.519> they're

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
this Hyperloop thing happen they're

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.890 
this Hyperloop thing happen they're
staying<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.060> thing<00:00:30.300> could<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> ran<00:00:30.750> off

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
staying at this thing could be ran off

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.459 
staying at this thing could be ran off
full<00:00:31.410> solar<00:00:32.040> power<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.290> set<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:35.420> these

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
full solar power and set up in these

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.100 
full solar power and set up in these
tubes<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.950> are<00:00:38.010> pressurized<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.110> they

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
tubes that are pressurized and they

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.889 
tubes that are pressurized and they
would<00:00:40.230> basically<00:00:40.379> use<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.700> compressor<00:00:42.360> from

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
would basically use a compressor from

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200 
would basically use a compressor from
the<00:00:43.020> back<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.770> power<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.850> motion

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the back to power this thing the motion

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.760 
the back to power this thing the motion
saying<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.289> could<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
saying that this thing could get up to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.920 
saying that this thing could get up to
700<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.989> 60<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.200> miles<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.590> hour

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
700 in 60 some miles an hour

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.510 
700 in 60 some miles an hour
now<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.079> state<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> distances<00:00:53.160> they

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
now they state that the distances they

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.799 
now they state that the distances they
look<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:54.120> cover<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:55.879> around<00:00:56.879> 400<00:00:57.239> miles

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
look to cover would be around 400 miles

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.459 
look to cover would be around 400 miles
to<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.879> any<00:01:00.270> cities<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
to start off with so any cities that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
to start off with so any cities that
fall<00:01:01.770> within<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.190> range<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.600> try<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
fall within that range they would try to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.030 
fall within that range they would try to
connect<00:01:04.710> these<00:01:04.890> tubes<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:06.770> looking<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
connect these tubes to looking as a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.149 
connect these tubes to looking as a
means<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> quick<00:01:08.970> cheap<00:01:10.159> transportation

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
means of quick cheap transportation

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.429 
means of quick cheap transportation
energy<00:01:11.659> efficient<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.020> running<00:01:13.229> off

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
energy efficient would be running off

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.090 
energy efficient would be running off
solar<00:01:13.710> power<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:15.320> they<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:16.860> I'm<00:01:17.070> sure

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
solar power and they would also I'm sure

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.570 
solar power and they would also I'm sure
try<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> incorporate<00:01:18.740> other<00:01:19.740> features<00:01:20.280> into

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
try to incorporate other features into

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.140 
try to incorporate other features into
it<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:20.970> go<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.210> well<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.790> mean<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it as they go as well but I mean it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.440 
it as they go as well but I mean it's
it's<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:25.110> crazy<00:01:25.350> talk<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.880> they're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's pretty crazy talk but they're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's pretty crazy talk but they're
working<00:01:27.840> hard<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.710> happen

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
working hard to really make this happen

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.039 
working hard to really make this happen
and<00:01:29.369> they're<00:01:29.909> gonna<00:01:30.030> start<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> somewhere

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and they're gonna start it somewhere

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.530 
and they're gonna start it somewhere
they're<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> incorporate<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
they're going to incorporate it but you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.950 
they're going to incorporate it but you
know<00:01:34.070> traveling<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.189> speeds<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> 700

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
know traveling at speeds of up to 700

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.130 
know traveling at speeds of up to 700
hundred<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> some<00:01:37.770> miles<00:01:38.430> per<00:01:38.700> hour

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
hundred and some miles per hour

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.719 
hundred and some miles per hour
it's<00:01:40.140> pretty<00:01:40.439> scary<00:01:42.259> because<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:44.220> thing<00:01:44.460> goes

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it's pretty scary because one thing goes

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.050 
it's pretty scary because one thing goes
wrong<00:01:45.530> there<00:01:46.530> isn't<00:01:46.860> nobody<00:01:47.250> living<00:01:48.710> so

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
wrong there isn't nobody living so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.980 
wrong there isn't nobody living so
they're<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.180> mentioning<00:01:51.689> those<00:01:51.930> things

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
they're not mentioning those things

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.679 
they're not mentioning those things
nonetheless<00:01:55.520> that's<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.790> scoop<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
nonetheless that's the scoop with it I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.030 
nonetheless that's the scoop with it I
wanted<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> bring<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> guys's

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
wanted to bring it to you guys's

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.950 
wanted to bring it to you guys's
attention<00:01:59.579> because<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.570> sure<00:02:00.719> they're<00:02:00.869> gonna

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
attention because I'm sure they're gonna

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
attention because I'm sure they're gonna
roll<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.469> here<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> future<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.490> looks
