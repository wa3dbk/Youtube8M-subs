00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
mountains here um and so obviously you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
mountains here um and so obviously you
know<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.360> try<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.720> tame<00:01:15.900> him<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.229> shoot<00:01:16.380> him

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
know you try and tame him or shoot him

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
know you try and tame him or shoot him
from<00:01:16.740> any<00:01:16.890> distance<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.909> without

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
from any distance really up here without

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.910 
from any distance really up here without
a<00:01:18.210> parachute<00:01:18.509> cloak<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.590> will<00:01:19.740> die

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
a parachute cloak and you will die

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
a parachute cloak and you will die
basically<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.630> two<00:01:21.810> methods

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
basically so you there are two methods

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710 
basically so you there are two methods
one<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.009> either<00:01:23.130> fly<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.540> down

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
one you can either fly to about down

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.679 
one you can either fly to about down
here<00:01:24.750> shoot<00:01:25.619> him<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.520> parachute<00:01:27.420> cloak

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
here shoot him and then parachute cloak

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.390 
here shoot him and then parachute cloak
your<00:01:27.900> way<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.680> land<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> statue

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
your way down I would land on the statue

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
your way down I would land on the statue
actually<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.390> land<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.049> be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
actually but you can land here and be

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.840 
actually but you can land here and be
safe<00:01:31.380> you'll<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.400> low<00:01:32.640> health

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
safe you'll just have really low health

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.899 
safe you'll just have really low health
um<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.810> only<00:01:33.990> problem<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.409> he<00:01:34.979> moon<00:01:35.369> fires<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
um the only problem is he moon fires you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.020 
um the only problem is he moon fires you
for<00:01:36.150> about<00:01:36.299> 30<00:01:36.689> k<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.070> very<00:01:38.369> likely<00:01:38.549> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
for about 30 k so it's very likely that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.920 
for about 30 k so it's very likely that
you<00:01:39.270> will<00:01:39.299> die<00:01:39.829> it<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.040> work<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.720> people

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you will die it can work I I know people

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.420 
you will die it can work I I know people
on<00:01:43.140> my<00:01:43.229> server<00:01:43.500> who<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.710> gotten<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.250> way

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
on my server who have gotten it this way

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.270 
on my server who have gotten it this way
but<00:01:45.149> however<00:01:45.390> i<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.530> engineering<00:01:47.040> up

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
but however i do not have engineering up

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
but however i do not have engineering up
high<00:01:47.460> enough<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> parachute<00:01:48.540> cloak<00:01:48.720> so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
high enough for a parachute cloak so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.730 
high enough for a parachute cloak so
what<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.790> tree<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.740> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
what you have to do this tree here this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.160 
what you have to do this tree here this
tree<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:54.210> you're<00:01:54.420> looking<00:01:54.780> directly<00:01:54.960> at

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
tree it's if you're looking directly at

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.069 
tree it's if you're looking directly at

person<00:03:01.139> comes<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.739> kills<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.659> then<00:03:03.659> like

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
person comes up and kills it then like

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.539 
person comes up and kills it then like
they<00:03:04.560> don't<00:03:04.590> really<00:03:04.889> have<00:03:05.010> an<00:03:05.099> incentive<00:03:05.340> to

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
they don't really have an incentive to

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.800 
they don't really have an incentive to
kill<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.849> because<00:03:05.970> you've<00:03:06.180> already<00:03:06.299> tagged<00:03:06.629> it

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
kill it because you've already tagged it

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.420 
kill it because you've already tagged it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.589 
so they won't get anything by killing it
