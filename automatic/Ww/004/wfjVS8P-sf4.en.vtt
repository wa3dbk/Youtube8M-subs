 review of the latest model of the fiat panda 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.279
 then practically closed off some first-generation first-generation names 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.900

 or they are positions we all know 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.610
 then this serves to give me yum travel brackets 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.620
 toast 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.540

 then there is the rotunda baroni 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.970
 this instead 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.080
 I think we are the rear fog lights 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.700
 we do not know who is following you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.580
 this is the most important work 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.510
 it can break 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.210
 good desserts you can hide candies put good things in it 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.000
 and then closes again 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.540
 but here instead polish and intoxicants are hot and cold and 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.520
 especially in the summer months 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.280
 and it is just as if behind the state forests perhaps a filter that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.489
 reproduces the same scents in equatorial forests and on the web. Street 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.979

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.119

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:24.479
 this control cedar allows perhaps to get air out up to speed

 Wimp 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.999
 and here we can set the air on the cold 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.119

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.529
 a second 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:40.089
 then you have to go to the right helicopter if you were already using the arrow 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:41.989
 directional 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.269
 this instead allows to direct the air on the window or 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.209
 under the feet 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.480
 and here we have 3 29 levels of Verona
