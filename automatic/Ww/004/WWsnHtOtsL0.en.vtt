started digging away now I came up with
a<00:02:21.090> few<00:02:21.270> theories<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:22.350> they're<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.100> theories

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
a few theories and they're just theories

section and I came across this number

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.820 
section and I came across this number
that<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.540> only<00:02:39.720> reveal<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.410> hit<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
very last frequently asked question now

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.260 
very last frequently asked question now
if<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.190> look<00:02:44.310> there's<00:02:44.520> some<00:02:44.700> coordinates

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
if you look there's some coordinates

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.170 
if you look there's some coordinates
down<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> googled<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> coordinates

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
down there so I googled the coordinates

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.699 
down there so I googled the coordinates
and<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.810> see<00:02:48.959> what<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> will<00:02:49.290> bring<00:02:49.470> up

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
for me and it actually is a relocation

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.050 
for me and it actually is a relocation
guys<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.830> actually<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.340> moon<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
guys this is actually on the moon and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.130 
guys this is actually on the moon and
say<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> crater<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> moon<00:02:54.989> that

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
say a crater on the moon that

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.380 
say a crater on the moon that
astrologers<00:02:55.950> used<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.700> kind<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.209> measure

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
astrologers used to kind of measure

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.910 
astrologers used to kind of measure
distance<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.080> time<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:00.060> based<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:01.290> kind<00:03:01.860> of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
distance and time and based this kind of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.580 
distance and time and based this kind of
got<00:03:02.040> my<00:03:02.160> gears<00:03:02.580> turning<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.180> one<00:03:03.590> but

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
got my gears turning on that one but

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.890 
got my gears turning on that one but
turned<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.160> actually<00:03:05.400> Hollis's<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> story

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
turned out actually Hollis's is a story

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.510 
turned out actually Hollis's is a story
element<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.470> couple<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:07.950> other<00:03:08.160> people<00:03:08.400> have

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
element in a couple of other people have

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.150 
element in a couple of other people have
already<00:03:08.910> pointed<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.959> think<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
already pointed to this I think it's the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.680 
already pointed to this I think it's the
a<00:03:11.190> part<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.820> story<00:03:12.030> element<00:03:12.420> that's<00:03:12.540> in

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
a part of the story element that's in

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.690 
a part of the story element that's in
destiny<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> think<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> location<00:03:14.400> of

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
destiny I think this is the location of

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.810 
destiny I think this is the location of
the<00:03:14.910> hive<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.690> are<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.140> moon<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.980> you

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
the hive that are on the moon so you

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.630 
the hive that are on the moon so you
know<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.840> there<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:19.980> kept<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.430> digging

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
know then in there so I kept on digging

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.400 
know then in there so I kept on digging
and<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.600> started<00:03:21.870> looking<00:03:21.959> through<00:03:22.110> all<00:03:22.320> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
and I started looking through all the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.600 
and I started looking through all the
pictures<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.549> then<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.150> ran<00:03:24.299> across<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.959> one

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
pictures and then I ran across this one

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.150 
pictures and then I ran across this one
okay<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:26.790> if<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.910> look<00:03:27.120> closely<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:28.040> kind<00:03:29.040> of

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
okay now if you look closely I kind of

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.259 
okay now if you look closely I kind of
highlighted<00:03:29.489> here<00:03:29.900> you've<00:03:30.900> got<00:03:31.190> 343<00:03:32.190> right<00:03:33.150> in

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
highlighted here you've got 343 right in

numbers together and you add them up
you've<00:03:51.840> got<00:03:52.110> ya<00:03:53.150> 113<00:03:54.150> days<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:55.140> that's<00:03:55.350> about

the average length of a beta de Milo
saying<00:03:58.079> man<00:03:58.290> my<00:03:58.620> theory<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:58.980> correct<00:03:59.040> I'm

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
saying man my theory is correct I'm

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.830 
saying man my theory is correct I'm
another<00:03:59.880> theory<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.269> someone<00:04:00.540> had<00:04:00.630> brought

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
another theory that someone had brought

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.870 
another theory that someone had brought
forward<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.320> believe<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:02.400> pusher<00:04:02.700> was<00:04:02.850> a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
forward I believe that the pusher was a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.660 
forward I believe that the pusher was a
bat<00:04:03.209> hunter<00:04:03.739> he<00:04:04.739> had<00:04:04.920> also<00:04:05.250> said<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.519> you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
bat hunter he had also said that you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.210 
bat hunter he had also said that you
know<00:04:05.880> if<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.090> take<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:07.470> three<00:04:07.680> numbers<00:04:07.829> you

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
know if you take the three numbers you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.759 
know if you take the three numbers you
add<00:04:08.400> them<00:04:08.549> up<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.850> then<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:08.970> got<00:04:09.180> 94<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.590> I

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
add them up and then you got 94 and I

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.830 
add them up and then you got 94 and I
would<00:04:10.920> possibly<00:04:11.130> put<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.610> dead<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.090> beta

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
would possibly put the dead the beta

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.770 
would possibly put the dead the beta
running<00:04:13.350> until<00:04:13.709> along<00:04:14.420> September<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.540> fourth

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
running until along September the fourth

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.409 
running until along September the fourth
and<00:04:15.989> that's<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.350> damn<00:04:16.620> long<00:04:16.950> beta<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:18.000> go<00:04:18.150> for

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
and that's a damn long beta to go for

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.780 
and that's a damn long beta to go for
almost<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.140> month<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.530> half<00:04:19.560> I'm<00:04:20.459> not<00:04:20.579> saying

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
almost a month and a half I'm not saying

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.310 
almost a month and a half I'm not saying
I<00:04:20.970> wouldn't<00:04:21.180> bother<00:04:21.329> me<00:04:21.479> i<00:04:21.630> would<00:04:22.020> love<00:04:22.229> to
