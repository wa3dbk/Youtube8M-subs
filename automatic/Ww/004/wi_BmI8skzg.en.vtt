and<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.210> happen<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.600> 3w<00:01:58.350> hours<00:01:58.649> here

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
and just happen to have 3w hours here

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.210 
and just happen to have 3w hours here
let's<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.380> how<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> works

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.400 

so<00:02:08.220> everything<00:02:09.150> is<00:02:09.240> like<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.660> soft<00:02:10.170> type

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so everything is like like a soft type

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.250 
so everything is like like a soft type
of<00:02:10.440> material<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.310> soft<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.210> silicone<00:02:12.600> I'm

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.970 
of material a soft have a silicone I'm
press<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.590> power<00:02:13.740> button<00:02:13.800> once<00:02:14.780> second<00:02:15.780> time

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
press the power button once second time

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.100 
press the power button once second time
so<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.220> brighter<00:02:17.540> there<00:02:18.540> are<00:02:18.630> time<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:18.960> as

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
so a bit brighter there are time now as

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.840 
so a bit brighter there are time now as

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
strobes forth turns off turn the high

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.170 
strobes forth turns off turn the high
brightness<00:02:24.060> setting<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.990> then<00:02:25.140> twist<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:26.180> now

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
brightness setting and then twist it now

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.740 
brightness setting and then twist it now
it's<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.600> portable<00:02:28.530> camp<00:02:28.800> lamp<00:02:29.480> pretty<00:02:30.480> neat
