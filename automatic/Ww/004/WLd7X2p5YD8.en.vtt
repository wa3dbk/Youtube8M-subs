00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hi they broke in this video 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.190
 answer the question how long it takes 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.109
 to increase muscle mass 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.670
 is a question I get very often is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.740
 surely if you are a beginner or 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.840
 however it is starting or even in reality 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.219
 if you are advanced this can arise 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.260
 doubt definitely a time when 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.449
 we start we all want results 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430
 concrete already in the early days is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.359
 obviously within certain limits this can 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.830
 occur 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.720
 surely the good news is that in the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.550
 moment in which of course land of a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.990
 effective training context and for 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.060
 I send them the butterfly method 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 being the body fasting if obviously 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.790
 if the first weapons 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.710
 the results may be greater 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 because obviously the body will be 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.100
 subjected to a stress stimulus 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.260
 that the training to which it is not 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.300
 accustomed and therefore surely we say 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 will respond with greater improvement 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.890
 in fact if you are constant and motivated already 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.899
 in the first months in the first two three four 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.739
 months can have excellent results of its own 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.739
 because the body 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.510
 let's say yes just better suited to one 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.010
 stimulus to which he is not accustomed after 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.050
 which instead is no better in which one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.789
 will begin to adapt to this stimulus 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.609
 training results can 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.870
 let's say slower and lower 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.369
 in fact it is much more difficult we say 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.229
 improve the time when tele da 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.850
 a long time and if already close to yours 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.799
 genetic limit rather than when yes 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 at the beginning so this as far as not 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.950
 is wanted by the body is a 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.420
 excellent stimulus to have excellent 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 results because obviously the best in 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.500
 which started with short results 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.880
 own term obviously motivate you is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.560
 what happened to me in the early days 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.110
 which I trained of course is immediately 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 excellent results and this obviously not 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.329
 can that we are really motivated and by a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 purely scientific point of view 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.570
 you can consider to get the idea of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.390
 some numbers that the body cannot 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.049
 increase more than 20 25 grams of mass 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.000
 muscular 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.320
 let's say then without the fat to the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.510
 day and we tell you to understand this 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.159
 let's say it's important to understand here that 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.830
 the body increases muscle mass is 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.240
 a luxury because our body reasons 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.580
 It still works 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.800
 and in many ways still in terms of 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.240
 survival then increase the mother 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.950
 however, muscle mass means 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.540
 increase caloric expenditure e 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.430
 increases caloric expenditure for the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.810
 our body is a luxury is a luxury 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.420
 why obviously not be ours 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.590
 body we still say evolved in terms 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.240
 purely for survival 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.030
 this means having more need of 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.230
 calories and food note obviously with 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.930
 our awareness today 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.950
 we know very well that for ours 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.480
 goal for our life anyway 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.450
 calories are not a problem either 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.530
 food, however, obviously our body 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.690
 still working according to principles and 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.640
 very very ancient archaic of course 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.709
 site finds itself forced to have to 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.270
 maximize all the same increase 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.209
 muscle mass happens for reasons 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.580
 purely survival and I repeat and every 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.350
 increase is always say weighted 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.300
 good from the body makes quotes because it wants to 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.709
 say more calories required and this 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.060
 obviously then I risk a moment 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.650
 where these calories fail 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.930
 therefore to the point of view purely 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.180
 let's say mathematical numbers in the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.680
 best of all those best poses 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.390
 the best food is the best 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.950
 training and telemann from the method 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.260
 butterfly and obviously also one 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.170
 very good genetics already increase by 20 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.030
 25 grams of muscle mass net 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.549
 of fat every day is excellent 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.709
 result therefore tendentially and half 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.030
 kg of muscle mass per month this 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.989
 obviously I can repeat it in 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.090
 when all these variables 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.190
 are say satisfied in full 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.440
 above all it is easier to happen 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.450
 for the beginning as I told you before in the 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.890
 moment when you start being the body a 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.790
 workout fasting stress is 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.680
 greater 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.780
 but as you adapt, it will be a lot 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.489
 in fact more difficult to increase more 6 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.170
 advanced the more we say can be 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.299
 difficult that it probably will be 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.040
 increase muscle mass 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.900
 on the contrary, you will already know rather advanced 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.239
 already increase half a kilogram of mass 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.100
 pure muscle less fat is 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.750
 really a great result 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.100
 obviously then we say in the course 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.320
 of the time he will then refine the two techniques 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.880
 will change your training and so on 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.620
 but the important thing is beginning and this 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.120
 surely we say what you can do 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.530
 a little trick a secret actually 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.480
 it's nothing revolutionary though 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.280
 effective when he left 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.850
 try to be zero at the beginning of the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.560
 and let's say 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.810
 regular as possible the more motivated but 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.340
 you start and say you are when settling 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.320
 while he will not see results as in all 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.490
 things for dry motivation then 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.820
 as a first star then given a goal 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.650
 that it is specific to follow him and 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.420
 obviously being constant in such a way 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.070
 that the first results can give you 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.900
 motivation the motivation to lead ad 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.700
 train yourself and this then obviously creates 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.680
 a virtuous circle that leads you to 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.630
 have very good results the right one 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.060
 effort therefore would impose in terms of 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.580
 pure mathematics we have seen how much more 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.830
 increase muscle mass I repeat 20 c 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.810
 20 cpg per day at best 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.450
 with training at rest 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.280
 truly tailored and better sewn 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.020
 genetics tend to be obviously 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.640
 value for the average gym user 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.650
 how then can we all be a bit 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.820
 will be lower because obviously not 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.440
 all must be able to maximize 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.560
 these variables really known but 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.210
 genetics and therefore to answer precisely 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.160
 the summary question we can say that 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.950
 it is very relative obviously depends on 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.990
 so many variables even from the single one 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.760
 individuality of each person, however, has 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.830
 the very good the excellent news that to 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.510
 moment when he left motivated then by 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.310
 first severe good results because 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.660
 obviously the body just like 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.390
 closed before a stimulus responds 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.590
 different so it grows faster 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.580
 then given the time the motivation 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.280
 at the beginning to see the first results 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.360
 create this virtuous circle and know that 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.860
 even the best cases anyway 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.410
 going over a pound a month is 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.760
 impossible indeed as said is much 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.920
 easy to stay below 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.750
 this was a short video to explain you 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.580
 we say to give the answer to this 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.710
 question i hope i have provided you with a 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.300
 some useful ideas as always if you want 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.190
 know how to revolutionize your form 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.790
 physics then contact me at my address 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.100
 e-mail 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.210
 and I also advise you to follow me up 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.540

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.540
 Hello
