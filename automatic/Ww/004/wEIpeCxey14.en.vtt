a trip but that is a fantastic price I
cannot<00:03:28.049> wait<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.409> get<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.799> system<00:03:29.190> turn

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
cannot wait to get this in a system turn

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.920 
cannot wait to get this in a system turn
it<00:03:29.579> on<00:03:29.640> but<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:29.970> think<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.450> pretty<00:03:30.629> much<00:03:30.720> wraps

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
it on but I think that pretty much wraps

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.550 
it on but I think that pretty much wraps
up<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.409> scope<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.099> your<00:03:32.190> house<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.090> iOS<00:03:33.560> that

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
okay I haven't seen it yet on a board I

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.140 
okay I haven't seen it yet on a board I
just<00:04:08.010> don't<00:04:08.129> know<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.489> don't<00:04:08.640> know<00:04:08.760> either<00:04:08.909> but

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.940 
just don't know I don't know either but
that's<00:04:09.450> why<00:04:09.720> there's<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.019> review<00:04:10.319> so<00:04:10.560> as<00:04:10.769> we

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
that's why there's a review so as we

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.500 
that's why there's a review so as we
find<00:04:11.160> out<00:04:11.250> yeah<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.519> don't<00:04:11.639> know<00:04:11.790> we're<00:04:12.419> going

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
find out yeah I don't know we're going

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.460 
find out yeah I don't know we're going
to<00:04:12.599> find<00:04:12.690> out<00:04:12.750> what<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.109> will

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
to find out what that is and will

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.170 
to find out what that is and will
mention<00:04:13.709> nother<00:04:13.829> of<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.069> but<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.819> think<00:04:15.060> that
