00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 what do we all need for beer 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.379
 brewed 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.629
 we are going to split our supplies into 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.270
 two parts 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.810
 what goes on in four years and what else 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.990
 need to make beer 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.300
 The first ingredient is our market but 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 agree and see that grain that team 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.210
 fermentable sugars and us here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.820
 but they are very bitter 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.570
 taste to their 4 and ensures better 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.989
 shelf life we have again 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.650
 who brings alcohol into us here and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.989
 as last natural water for it 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.820
 processing the animal 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.360
 we need a pot to start 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.290
 to warm him heavily and and shit 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.379
 what 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.570
 to leave you here too we have one 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.360
 special how tight and precise 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.670
 a lifting hose 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.110
 on bags of Christmas medium and and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.110
 scrap mill needed 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.179
 now we are going to be the first women here 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.939
 that we must do 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.659
 before we can start cooking it is 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.840
 weigh up our ingredients when it 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.880
 Resistance of successful bass so we favor it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.109
 8 idea who who needs 1200 grams of lager malt 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:40.249
 800 grams people there are 20 grams half 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:44.069
 on it and a bag say farmer who yeasts 50 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:47.219
 we also have a total of 16 liters of water 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.109
 needed for brewing itself and also 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.789
 a lot for crossing the 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.619
 pots 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.850
 know about half the water 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.579
 fumes away 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.829
 and they cook it or get lost at the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.499
 initial filtering 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.659
 after weighing start with something gates 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.060
 from our joke 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.209
 with types we let our coach through one 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.540
 mill going not to buy help for 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.200
 So the and healer perform these 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.819
 Enzymes are our fermentable sugars 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.819
 which we dissolve in the water 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.610
 what how 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.380
 the shot market in 90 where are now 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.500
 temperature and timing 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.870
 very important the first 30 minutes 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.920
 it is heated to a temperature 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.850
 from 68 degrees afterwards 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.730
 25 minutes or that scene reigns 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.000
 then in 40 minutes on 18 very too 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.000
 roam 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.530
 This ensures every kind of enzyme can 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.280
 dissolved hit the internet does not taste 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.280
 our pot full but certainly different from whole one 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 solved 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.380
 you now have to slide the solid components 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.410
 the law because that we can 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.540
 unfortunately do 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.540
 for this we cast everything in one mind 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.940
 a time we will add a liter 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.550
 water to 48 we stop it 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.860
 how much the family and the guards 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.380
 components are naturally a sigh 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.630
 filter dutch be 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.290
 we now have a very sweet syrupy 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:44.080
 fluid with which we continue to work 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.080
 everything that is left over as a miniature trot 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.240
 now goes into the liquid for one hour boil 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.760
 This is all unwanted what's in here 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.040
 still in it 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.739
 the last 20 we are adding ours 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.550
 hop for the bitter taste and the 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.730
 good heart we did not have this from 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.630
 the start would all boil 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.750
 aromas 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.040
 insist on getting out of here then 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.040
 and we certainly do not want that 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.280
 when we're done and you have to cook it 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.420
 we don't leave muscle as quickly as possible 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:34.110
 Or else we would be new and unwanted 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.270
 bacteria and us coming in bad 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.940
 taste 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.450
 that's why we put the pot and some of the carts 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:46.640
 water and let's cool our beer anyway 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.640
 at a temperature of 20 degrees 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.820
 Now it's time to we add to our 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.090
 start softening a guide 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.110
 so that you have already become active for genes 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.110
 who hears that name 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.710
 we put our mind in our barrel together with 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.080
 our beer and we keep it in one place 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.420
 but in average temperature and less 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.390
 then 10 degrees 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.390
 jolan vb drury keep it in the basement 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.050
 after a week in the basement 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.180
 the yeast has done its job very well 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.740
 the yeast has eaten the sugars and there 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.170
 alcohol and air 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.210
 the air must escape because 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.460
 otherwise have a small bomb at home 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.050
 their airlock use this for this 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.760
 system ensures that air can 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.440
 escape on without putting bacteria in 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.440
 the chance in us what we three 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.190
 now we have to get our beer from the yeast 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.050
 divorce unfortunately has jolanvb brewery 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.120
 not the capital to invest in the 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.560
 proper equipment to do that 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.720
 so then we just have to do it with one 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.310
 Hevelslang this sometimes gives a problem 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.370
 that a little bit of yeast comes along 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.900
 and you will see that in the pension 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.880
 then we now switch to bottling 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.920
 of our management before we add bottling 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.760
 we quickly add some extra sugar to us 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.770
 beer 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.220
 the other yeast cells they eat in this 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.290
 and hear extra CO2 and alcohol 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.220
 it is that co2 that gives the pixel in us 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.230
 beer 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.870
 after adding a thorough cleaning with beer in 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.970
 our bottles you're on February pencil 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.870
 in special beer bottles words beer 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.870
 bottles and wine bottles 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:58.249
 After a week of fermentation in the bottle 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.719
 ready as beer 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:02.349
 I was already curious and have already finished 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.349
 tasted beforehand 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:22.410
 now nice it is certainly not the best 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.060
 beer but you have to take that into account 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.140
 this building we have with a limited 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.590
 knowledge 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.590
 tasty
