00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:44.629
 hard is the way 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:47.739

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.490
 patricia sosa 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.100

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:56.350
 and I know it's not easy I do not know if there will be 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.350
 time to rest 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.960
 in this adventure 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:11.570
 and love and courage you just have to close the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.570
 eyes and take flight 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.740
 and when the heart gallops strong 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.740
 I have light 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.120
 There is reason overcomes the passion 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.720

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.200
 Suzanne 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.750
 but lose time listen to the wind 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.260

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.260

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.220
 lu2 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.670
 is this the world I do not ask for forgiveness 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.790
 scream even if it hurts you cry if you do 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:32.300
 lack 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:37.300
 clean wounds that heal love 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.300
 and when the heart beats strong 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:50.300
 there is the reason that dense passion and 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.300

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.080
 you alone 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:15.100
 but neither does he hear the wind sing for 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:18.620
 What will come is not so difficult 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.620
 that you learn 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.620

 spiritual I'm living a 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.400

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.570

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:44.190
 tonight we forget everything 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.190
 single 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.110

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.960
 Betis is impeccable 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.960

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.960
 the truth 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:13.130
 a situation has been created on the floor and 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.979
 an awesome vibration quality and 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.150
 It was not time we lived it congratulate 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.150

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.630
 I say that in the essay sometimes you 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.460

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.710
 what you just said you pact that 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.289

 and told marley friend what 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.630
 it really was difficult that it touched him I say 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.000
 Torres is a great artist but very 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.580
 difficult to imitate artists that are not 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.470
 picturesque that do not have anything 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.470
 rare as it looked for example 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:24.370
 this family accuse her sister 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.620
 but it does not end here, I mean , weird 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.080
 that unique personality like that of 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.990
 patricia for example to the saved that is 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.170
 the way of singing to be able to move 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.600
 that there really is no other person 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.460
 the same or similar and you can tell that she studies 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.930

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.670
