 I want to open the sky from the right , draw a yellowish blue from the left , and explain how to strike a fade. 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.430
 I think 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:25.970
 The swing is like a cat now has such an arc 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:30.270
 Inside of the arc of inside- in, you go from inside to inside of the target line and science 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.910
 First of all when you hit a straight ball Although this is poised is 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:38.060

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.790
 Face eyes are pointing straight 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.940

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:58.000

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.540
 That's how the grip end looks like 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.370

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.060
 Please go to the left rather than the middle 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.210

 It is this kind of action 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.560
 It feels like holding the handle of a gold hand car holding the handle a bit , turning the handle to the right 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.250
 You 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.890
