00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.080
 now I have another question 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.750
 I have a friend who is a photographer he uses a lot the word is 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.909
 yes it has to do with the exhibition but I do not know what it means 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.979
 is the term this is a type of unit of measure used in all scales 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.589
 of photographic values 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.849
 is used both for the time scale and for the pair of 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.099
 diaphragms and the sensitivity 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.689
 practically a tow is equivalent to a duplication with a reduction to 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.479
 half of a certain amount according to the direction to which we are moving 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:30.329
 on the scale of values 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.670
 this is chin 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.020
 it means that I'm commenting a quantity increased a this to the 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.320
 opening of the diaphragm 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.590
 means letting twice as much light into the interior of the camera 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.090
 and halving the amount of exposure time still clung 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.640
 being a this the exposure time 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.980
 the state is used has the same unit of measure for all scales 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.850
 so that these values ​​can be worked in operating conditions 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.850
 simplify the variations of one or another scale 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.720
 lest 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.040
 if you take a picture or a 124th part of the second and f 8 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.660
 and then take the same picture of the same light conditions or using about 50 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.460
 s maps three seconds but f4 you will have the same result because you have progressed 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.500
 two states in the diaphragm scala 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.070
 and it has produced two sixth shutter times 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.280
 so in this case I will have got two identical photos 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.540
 well the two photos were identical from the point of view of quantity 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.350
 of light in play will have taken the same amount of light and exposure but 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.759
 there will be an aesthetic difference between the two photos by quoting values ​​of 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.630
 diaphragm and different times the photos were different from each other this 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.159
 but 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.190
 we will see soon as we deepen these aspects promise me 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.480
 promised 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.180
 Then, in the lesson, we have deepened in all aspects of the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.440
 exposure 'shutter time aperture diaphragm values 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.430
 sensitivity how the sixths and meters work and how they measure light 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.500
 finally you have all the elements together with the lessons 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.600
 we have already done to start consciously taking your images 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.819
 because we have also seen the origin of photography as it works 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.489
 photographic procedures is how light is used to produce 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.589
 images 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.639
 the evolution of photographic equipment and all its components and 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.239
 functions 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.489
 So you have all the elements to follow your photographic work like this 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.879
 that tomorrow awakened at five to photograph the sky that act 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.359
 Goodbye, goodbye
