00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
up my classes here now I've got three

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.350 
up my classes here now I've got three
classes<00:00:36.220> made<00:00:36.400> for<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:36.730> particular<00:00:37.180> test

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
classes made for this particular test

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.180 
classes made for this particular test
that<00:00:37.540> i'm<00:00:37.629> going<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:37.780> show<00:00:37.900> you<00:00:37.930> one<00:00:38.890> is<00:00:39.129> a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
that i'm going to show you one is a

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.160 
that i'm going to show you one is a
class<00:00:39.790> like<00:00:39.820> i<00:00:40.150> would<00:00:40.360> normally<00:00:40.480> run<00:00:40.900> it's<00:00:41.080> a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
class like i would normally run it's a

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.560 
class like i would normally run it's a
primary<00:00:41.620> with<00:00:41.830> no<00:00:41.980> secondary<00:00:42.489> most<00:00:43.360> of<00:00:43.480> you

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
primary with no secondary most of you

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.820 
primary with no secondary most of you
should<00:00:43.720> know<00:00:43.809> this<00:00:43.960> i<00:00:44.110> don't<00:00:44.260> run<00:00:44.379> a<00:00:44.410> secondary

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
should know this i don't run a secondary

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.380 
should know this i don't run a secondary
because<00:00:45.100> i'd<00:00:45.220> rather<00:00:45.400> have<00:00:45.519> an<00:00:45.910> extra<00:00:46.210> perk

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
because i'd rather have an extra perk

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.240 
because i'd rather have an extra perk
point<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.930> also<00:00:47.440> there's<00:00:47.680> tons<00:00:47.980> of<00:00:48.129> guns

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
point and also there's tons of guns

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.500 
point and also there's tons of guns
laying<00:00:48.520> around<00:00:48.820> all<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.000> got<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.180> do<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.360> run

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
laying around all you got to do is run

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.330 
laying around all you got to do is run
over<00:00:49.719> one<00:00:49.840> holding<00:00:50.200> x<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.559> you'll<00:00:50.920> pick<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.129> up

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
over one holding x and you'll pick it up

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.040 
over one holding x and you'll pick it up
so<00:00:51.579> there's<00:00:52.059> really<00:00:52.210> no<00:00:52.480> need<00:00:52.510> for<00:00:52.930> me<00:00:53.020> to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
so there's really no need for me to

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.110 
so there's really no need for me to
waste<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.350> point<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.649> secondary<00:00:54.100> now<00:00:54.730> this<00:00:54.969> is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
waste a point on a secondary now this is

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.459 
waste a point on a secondary now this is
more<00:00:55.270> of<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.450> standard<00:00:55.719> class<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.989> lot<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.289> people

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
more of a standard class a lot of people

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.470 
more of a standard class a lot of people
run<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.649> primary<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.399> secondary<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:58.090> then

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
run a primary and a secondary and then

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.150 
run a primary and a secondary and then
there's<00:00:58.629> this<00:00:58.809> class<00:00:59.079> where<00:00:59.590> there<00:00:59.770> is<00:00:59.920> no

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
there's this class where there is no

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.040 
there's this class where there is no
primary<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:00.820> they<00:01:00.940> give<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.270> combat<00:01:01.870> knife

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
primary so they give you a combat knife

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.049 
primary so they give you a combat knife
now<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:02.379> black<00:01:02.590> ops<00:01:02.800> 2<00:01:02.949> if<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.640> didn't<00:01:03.910> have<00:01:04.000> a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
now in black ops 2 if you didn't have a

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.969 
now in black ops 2 if you didn't have a
primary<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:04.750> you<00:01:05.199> just<00:01:05.350> ran<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.560> secondary

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
primary and you just ran a secondary

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.279 
primary and you just ran a secondary
only<00:01:06.250> like<00:01:06.399> a<00:01:06.430> be<00:01:06.640> 23<00:01:06.759> only<00:01:07.360> then<00:01:07.960> you'd<00:01:08.110> have<00:01:08.140> a

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
only like a be 23 only then you'd have a

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.460 
only like a be 23 only then you'd have a
combat<00:01:08.710> knife<00:01:08.920> if<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.880> ran<00:01:10.149> just<00:01:10.899> like<00:01:11.289> say<00:01:11.440> a

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
PDW or something and no secondary you'd

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.050 
PDW or something and no secondary you'd
still<00:01:14.110> have<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.320> combat<00:01:14.740> knife<00:01:14.950> in<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.759> game

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.370 
to reload YY and I'm holding both
triggers<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.420> that's<00:01:49.599> how<00:01:49.750> long<00:01:49.989> it<00:01:50.170> took<00:01:50.319> for

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
triggers and that's how long it took for

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.370 
triggers and that's how long it took for
me<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.649> actually<00:01:50.860> shoot<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:51.789> reload<00:01:52.660> YY<00:01:53.080> hold

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
me to actually shoot so reload YY hold

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.859 
me to actually shoot so reload YY hold
both<00:01:53.560> triggers<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.250> there's<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.090> big<00:01:55.569> delay

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
both triggers and there's a big delay

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.690 
both triggers and there's a big delay
between<00:01:56.200> one<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.619> why<00:01:56.890> why<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.160> when<00:01:57.459> I<00:01:57.489> can

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
between one I why why and when I can

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.330 
between one I why why and when I can
actually<00:01:58.030> shoot<00:01:58.270> again<00:01:58.539> now<00:01:59.259> if<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.950> reload

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
actually shoot again now if I reload

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.279 
actually shoot again now if I reload
canceled<00:02:00.759> by<00:02:00.910> sprinting<00:02:01.539> I'm<00:02:01.750> pretty<00:02:02.110> sure

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
canceled by sprinting I'm pretty sure

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.020 
canceled by sprinting I'm pretty sure
it's<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.500> lot<00:02:02.709> faster<00:02:02.950> than<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.429> so<00:02:03.670> let's<00:02:03.910> go

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
it's a lot faster than that so let's go

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.749 
it's a lot faster than that so let's go
like<00:02:04.209> this<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.539> then<00:02:04.750> up<00:02:04.929> sprint<00:02:05.349> so<00:02:06.160> I<00:02:06.190> can

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
like this and then up sprint so I can

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.330 
like this and then up sprint so I can
actually<00:02:07.119> shoot<00:02:07.569> faster<00:02:08.080> by<00:02:08.200> sprint<00:02:08.800> reload

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
actually shoot faster by sprint reload

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.699 
actually shoot faster by sprint reload
canceling<00:02:09.910> rather<00:02:10.479> than<00:02:10.720> y<00:02:10.959> wine<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.560> let's

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
canceling rather than y wine so let's

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.309 
canceling rather than y wine so let's
try<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.920> one<00:02:12.010> more<00:02:12.069> time<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:13.180> reload<00:02:13.900> cancelled

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
try it one more time up reload cancelled

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.030 
try it one more time up reload cancelled
boom<00:02:15.569> reload<00:02:16.569> cancel<00:02:16.989> boom<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.349> it's<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.560> lot<00:02:17.830> a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
boom reload cancel boom so it's a lot a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.780 
boom reload cancel boom so it's a lot a
lot<00:02:18.099> faster<00:02:18.580> now<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.370> out<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> way

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
lot faster now with that out of the way

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.790 
lot faster now with that out of the way
let's<00:02:21.880> change<00:02:22.420> classes<00:02:22.720> here<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.380> got<00:02:23.740> to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
let's change classes here I got to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.220 
let's change classes here I got to
change<00:02:23.950> my<00:02:24.130> team<00:02:24.340> first<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.360> let's<00:02:25.570> go<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> my

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
change my team first now let's go to my

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.210 
change my team first now let's go to my
normal<00:02:26.500> class<00:02:26.830> where<00:02:27.070> I

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
normal class where I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.520 
normal class where I
wouldn't<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.580> secondary<00:02:28.090> weapon<00:02:28.530> well

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
wouldn't have a secondary weapon well

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.770 
wouldn't have a secondary weapon well
I'm<00:02:29.740> hitting<00:02:29.860> why<00:02:30.280> why<00:02:30.910> why<00:02:31.090> why<00:02:31.240> why<00:02:31.420> why<00:02:31.600> why

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
I'm hitting why why why why why why why

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.240 
I'm hitting why why why why why why why
why<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:31.990> nothing's<00:02:32.470> happening<00:02:32.890> because<00:02:33.070> I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
why and nothing's happening because I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.580 
why and nothing's happening because I
don't<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:33.910> any<00:02:34.210> any<00:02:34.840> kind<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.260> secondary

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
don't have any any kind of a secondary

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.470 
don't have any any kind of a secondary
no<00:02:35.800> combat<00:02:36.190> knife<00:02:36.430> know<00:02:37.000> anything<00:02:37.300> like<00:02:37.450> that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
no combat knife know anything like that

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.260 
no combat knife know anything like that
so<00:02:37.870> basically<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.650> only<00:02:38.890> way<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.730> reload

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
so basically the only way I can reload

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.040 
so basically the only way I can reload
cancel<00:02:40.750> would<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:42.720> reload<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.900> then

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
cancel would be to reload and then

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.110 
cancel would be to reload and then
sprint<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.220> problem<00:02:45.520> with<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.790> i'm

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
sprint but the problem with that is i'm

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.870 
sprint but the problem with that is i'm
pretty<00:02:46.330> sure<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.720> class<00:02:47.050> i<00:02:47.350> have<00:02:47.860> let<00:02:48.790> me

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
pretty sure on this class i have let me

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.710 
pretty sure on this class i have let me
just<00:02:49.060> check<00:02:49.240> yes<00:02:50.050> i<00:02:50.320> have<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.700> go<00:02:51.910> which<00:02:52.540> is

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
just check yes i have on the go which is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.080 
just check yes i have on the go which is
you<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.380> sprint<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.130> reload<00:02:54.700> at<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.880> same

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
you can sprint and reload at the same

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.160 
you can sprint and reload at the same
time<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:55.690> basically<00:02:56.620> i<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.850> no<00:02:58.510> way<00:02:58.810> of

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
time so basically i have no way of

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.560 
time so basically i have no way of
reload<00:02:59.650> canceling<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.520> if<00:03:01.120> i<00:03:01.209> get<00:03:01.390> into<00:03:01.510> a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
reload canceling and if i get into a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.210 
reload canceling and if i get into a
situation<00:03:01.750> where<00:03:02.230> i<00:03:02.290> shoot<00:03:02.530> someone<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.100> then

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
situation where i shoot someone and then

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.550 
situation where i shoot someone and then
i'm<00:03:03.310> reloading<00:03:03.790> i'm<00:03:03.940> screwed<00:03:04.900> until<00:03:05.200> i'm<00:03:05.530> done

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
i'm reloading i'm screwed until i'm done

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.440 
i'm reloading i'm screwed until i'm done
reloading<00:03:06.280> i<00:03:06.459> mean<00:03:06.700> i<00:03:06.760> usually<00:03:06.910> run<00:03:07.180> sleight

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
reloading i mean i usually run sleight

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.480 
reloading i mean i usually run sleight
of<00:03:07.480> hand<00:03:07.750> but<00:03:07.900> still<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.860> never<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.160> like

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
of hand but still you never know like

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.190 
of hand but still you never know like
that<00:03:09.700> reload<00:03:10.060> canceled<00:03:10.480> by<00:03:10.570> sprinting<00:03:10.990> thing

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
that reload canceled by sprinting thing

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.230 
that reload canceled by sprinting thing
could<00:03:11.350> save<00:03:11.530> your<00:03:11.650> life<00:03:11.709> sometimes<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.550> that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
could save your life sometimes so that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.690 
could save your life sometimes so that
is<00:03:13.510> kind<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.440> drawback<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.400> go<00:03:15.550> and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
is kind of a drawback of on the go and

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.720 
is kind of a drawback of on the go and
i'm<00:03:15.820> thinking<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.480> i<00:03:16.510> might<00:03:17.160> stop<00:03:18.160> using<00:03:18.520> it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
i'm thinking that i might stop using it

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.910 
i'm thinking that i might stop using it
just<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.150> particular<00:03:19.840> point<00:03:20.350> but

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
just for that particular point but

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.910 
just for that particular point but
besides<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.660> let's<00:03:22.660> go<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.959> final<00:03:23.290> load

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
besides that let's go to the final load

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.470 
besides that let's go to the final load
out<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.280> i<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.520> here<00:03:24.550> i<00:03:24.880> got<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.330> change

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
out that i have here i got to change

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720 
out that i have here i got to change
teams<00:03:25.720> first<00:03:25.930> okay<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:26.890> let's<00:03:27.250> go<00:03:27.340> down<00:03:27.520> here

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
teams first okay so let's go down here

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.610 
teams first okay so let's go down here
now<00:03:27.880> I've<00:03:28.000> got<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.209> combat<00:03:28.660> knife<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.440> have<00:03:29.590> a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
now I've got a combat knife and I have a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.430 
now I've got a combat knife and I have a
secondary<00:03:30.130> well<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.570> can<00:03:32.110> reload

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
secondary well with that I can reload

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.229 
secondary well with that I can reload
cancel<00:03:32.860> because<00:03:32.980> technically<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.580> have<00:03:33.940> two

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
cancel because technically I have two

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.420 
cancel because technically I have two
weapons<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:35.200> if<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.380> pull<00:03:35.590> out<00:03:35.620> my<00:03:35.769> secondary

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
weapons so if I pull out my secondary

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.000 
weapons so if I pull out my secondary
here<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.030> shoot<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.660> little<00:03:37.840> bit<00:03:38.019> i<00:03:38.260> go<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> reload

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
here I shoot a little bit i go to reload

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.550 
here I shoot a little bit i go to reload
i<00:03:39.250> can<00:03:39.670> why<00:03:39.820> why<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.330> there<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:40.930> right

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
i can why why and there you go right

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.310 
i can why why and there you go right
this<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:41.890> why<00:03:42.580> why<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.940> for<00:03:43.570> some<00:03:43.750> reason<00:03:43.780> I

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
this is why why and for some reason I

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.110 
this is why why and for some reason I
could<00:03:44.680> shoot<00:03:44.860> faster<00:03:45.370> now<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.550> think<00:03:45.850> what<00:03:46.030> it

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
could shoot faster now I think what it

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.180 
could shoot faster now I think what it
is<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.239> because<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.959> type<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.140> weapon<00:03:47.709> the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
is is because of the type of weapon the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.949 
is is because of the type of weapon the
fact<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.489> it's<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.730> secondary<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.750> I'm<00:03:49.810> going

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
fact that it's a secondary so I'm going

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.900 
fact that it's a secondary so I'm going
to<00:03:50.019> shoot<00:03:50.170> reload<00:03:50.920> why<00:03:51.220> why<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.730> could

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
to shoot reload why why and I could

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.180 
to shoot reload why why and I could
shoot<00:03:52.060> immediately<00:03:52.239> again<00:03:52.989> whereas<00:03:53.769> with<00:03:53.800> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
shoot immediately again whereas with the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.970 
shoot immediately again whereas with the
the<00:03:54.670> SMG<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.180> could<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.350> maybe

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
the SMG I could not do that so maybe

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.440 
the SMG I could not do that so maybe
it's<00:03:57.190> because<00:03:57.340> as<00:03:57.580> secondary<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.360> it's

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
it's because as secondary and it's

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.030 
it's because as secondary and it's
lighter<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.110> you<00:03:59.170> know<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.650> takes<00:03:59.799> less<00:04:00.010> time

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
lighter so you know it takes less time

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.830 
lighter so you know it takes less time
or<00:04:00.430> something<00:04:00.730> I'm<00:04:01.120> not<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.450> hundred<00:04:01.630> percent

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
or something I'm not a hundred percent

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.640 
or something I'm not a hundred percent
sure<00:04:02.489> but<00:04:03.489> that's<00:04:03.670> basically<00:04:04.260> what<00:04:05.260> i<00:04:05.290> mean<00:04:05.500> by

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
sure but that's basically what i mean by

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.500 
sure but that's basically what i mean by
say<00:04:05.950> goodbye<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.250> why<00:04:06.459> why<00:04:06.670> why<00:04:07.239> why<00:04:07.450> the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
say goodbye to why why why why the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.450 
say goodbye to why why why why the
reload<00:04:08.080> canceled<00:04:08.530> is<00:04:08.709> not<00:04:09.580> as<00:04:09.760> beneficial<00:04:10.180> as

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
reload canceled is not as beneficial as

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.160 
reload canceled is not as beneficial as
printing<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:11.000> guess<00:04:11.660> unless<00:04:11.810> if<00:04:12.050> you're

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
printing I guess unless if you're

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
printing I guess unless if you're
running<00:04:12.380> with<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.530> second<00:04:12.860> year<00:04:12.950> or<00:04:13.070> whatever

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
running with the second year or whatever

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.800 
running with the second year or whatever
I<00:04:13.370> guess<00:04:13.520> it<00:04:13.670> doesn't<00:04:13.820> really<00:04:13.910> matter<00:04:14.180> but

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
I guess it doesn't really matter but

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.230 
I guess it doesn't really matter but
with<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.020> primary<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.650> seems<00:04:15.920> as<00:04:16.160> though<00:04:16.240> why

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:17.240 
with the primary it seems as though why

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.740 
with the primary it seems as though why
lying<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.870> kind<00:04:18.140> of<00:04:18.230> no<00:04:18.470> longer<00:04:18.980> a<00:04:19.250> factor<00:04:19.940> so

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
lying is kind of no longer a factor so

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.530 
lying is kind of no longer a factor so
keep<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.350> in<00:04:21.560> mind<00:04:21.700> no<00:04:22.700> more<00:04:22.880> why<00:04:23.060> why<00:04:23.270> make

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
keep that in mind no more why why make

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.560 
keep that in mind no more why why make
sure<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.750> sprint<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.170> reload<00:04:24.440> cancel<00:04:24.860> and
