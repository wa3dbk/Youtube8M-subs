00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.590
 she beauty that rafael from the sound shop 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.380
 automotive and today I will give some tips 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.480
 for you how to eliminate fluids from 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.730
 your automotive sound 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.310
 good guys come what may be 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.800
 happening is that sailing the car of your 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.300
 car may be bad or even in your 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.920
 radio your radio may be 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.500
 presenting some problems as 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.520
 Check it out first so we can 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.109
 can already eliminate these factors there are 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.269
 generating include in your car 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:37.999
 the main factors that generate a bad one 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:42.170
 car installation and use of cables 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:44.659
 RC installation and use of here 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.929
 positive and negative cables and module 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:51.260
 your car, for example in the 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:54.379
 use of the car was the important 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.989
 is to leave it far from any source of 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.929
 for example any whip that 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.899
 It 's important to leave it far away. 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.030
 if the whip is going through the Case 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.689
 The drummer passing the left side has to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.659
 pass the right side squeal or else 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.219
 under the carpet even only this 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.960
 If you are going to give a little more work 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.049
 for you right? 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.390
 but try to keep it away from the cables 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.710
 positive leave so that they do not occur 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.369
 noises 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.630
 Another important factor is the use of 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.119
 rent in new zealand 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.549
 this one is the simplest car and he 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.740
 It's not if you make the call. 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.320
 in your system 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.359
 it will not make a single noise that the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.539
 his right problem that staff 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:45.079
 a little confused is that no movie in the 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.810
 among them is that he here in the staff 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.409
 generally use this wire to relieve 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.200
 the radio remote does not use this 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.079
 movie to connect the remote to the radio that 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.229
 there may also cause noise in this 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.880
 movie to land in case of 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.950
 noise in your system 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.920
 in the swamp shannon always look 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.800
 land a tip only 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.989
 the car is not put boss two 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.980
 can cause even more noise 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.209
 If your car is not bad, do not 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.640
 has this movie 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:25.280
 just get a little wire and you 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.209
 aquino soldier negative of the car in 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.030
 end né 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.230
 I'm going to do some marketing and put it here. 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.019
 in Ceará and land that car will 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.069
 function in the same way as this 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.290
 wire here we can use is also 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.140
 this type of cable that is the cable is and will be 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.410
 armored and has several basic factors 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.450
 features on the protection cable 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.440
 against the law of the sound system 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.959
 automotive 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.630
 apart from their clubs better be right 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.000
 more flexible and also withstands 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.269
 temperature and it is very 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.549
 recommended for anyone who wants a system 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.040
 good quality and do not want to have noise 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.930
 in the hands of a car 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.060
 in the case of interference from the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.430
 energy the important is how you go 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.100
 make the connection of your ground 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.000
 example if I have only one battery and one 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.269
 applicator 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.269
 the ideal is that you pull the positive there 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.519
 the battery to get the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.650
 the applicator and try to pull the 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.049
 negative for a negative of the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.840
 amplifier rather than positive pull 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:36.380
 here and do the grounding in the slaughter 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.480
 when you have two indicators it is more 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.239
 important because when you 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.350
 grounding the most various uses 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.180
 chance of having noise in your sound 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.269
 when I play important if you use 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.760
 two amplifiers and in case you would 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:59.239
 that a direct battery and that will connect 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.319
 a small positive and before the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.799
 negative 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.650
 the amplifier if it is the most powerful 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.850
 that the other can also generate noise for 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.030
 take the test 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.190
 try turning off an applicator and see if it comes out. 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.980
 here in the audio player of 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.829
 certifier ac some noise and vice 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.739
 versa 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.220
 no and see if it's leaving minutes if 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:27.360
 to stop the noise is because this link here 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.969
 janko you accomplished is to factor 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.069
 decisive to make noise in your system 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.889
 if you have a more powerful system and 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.870
 uses two batteries and will make the 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.810
 amplifiers link here 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.629
 the important thing is to use thick cables're 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.870
 for example if you use an amplifier 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:49.580
 here with a 20 minute cable 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:55.620
 just connect here on the negative and the positive 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:57.840
 My second battery here is only what 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.330
 promote function perfectly 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.039
 that same 20-minute cable that you 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.759
 use that positive 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:08.400
 You have to use negative pro here. 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:11.490
 here from the second to the first battery 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.460
 because what will happen if you have a 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.300
 20 minutes cable here and another 9 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.270
 praterra it will pull all energy 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.759
 of 20 books it will return the energy 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.800
 20 minutes here just will not go 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.699
 get grounded why you're going to have 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.349
 a cable here for example is smaller 19 top 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.900
 example of 91 yen 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.050
 if your cof battery is far away 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.279
 the second battery you have for the 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.719
 your automotive sound 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:44.849
 you can is not to use a cable here 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:48.089
 so thick is not it if you do not 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:51.360
 want to spend but then you do 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:56.250
 grounding of this second battery in the 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.680
 chassis with the 20-minute cable or cable 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.219
 What are you using here positive? 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.900
 so that it can draw energy and 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.599
 get grounded 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.300
 the same thing is important if you 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:11.099
 make another tool here is that you 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.169
 I know the place enough 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.569
 It's good if you have two 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.389
 amplifiers and need to connect 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.230
 second battery you just see that the 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.820
 gauge of your cable for example 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.710
 I have a victory of six boys 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.720
 Here, I stand and ask to call. 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.840
 positive and negative 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.980
 just make this call only on time 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.160
 from the earth 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:35.290
 bush another cable from your enemies 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.640
 or if you do not buy a cable 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:42.070
 which is the sum of this cable here of me more 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.970
 of six boys this example is 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:49.600
 for the battery to provide power and 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.550
 amplifiers can land and this 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.700
 energy that is coming back 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.100
 another tip is location of installation 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.240
 What are you going to do about the amplifiers and 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:04.450
 the crossovers never let the applicator already 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.320
 is cheap used in the vehicle can always 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.600
 put some wood is something that 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.410
 you do not already ground the 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.290
 applicator 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.850
 if you put already in the vehicle can the 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.560
 applicator will already be buried 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.110
 remembering that there are also some 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.360
 Globe suppression is tense people 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.370
 including 12 volts they serve more 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.660
 for old cars where noise 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.910
 battery sale 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.800
 it is very hard to do it 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.530
 needed sa noise 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.780
 he already has a better efficiency, right? 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.700
 is installed there on the cable 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.260
 This is for people who do not want to mess around 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.510
 installation of your car 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:44.200
 it will serve to decrease or eliminate 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:46.330
 totally the idol of your automotive sound 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.100
 The guys that's it, I hope you guys 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.770
 have enjoyed any doubt comment 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.170
 Do not forget a video on the 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.120
 video to subscribe to the channel so that 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.610
 people can perfect our work and 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.960
 make more videos there for you 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.960
 thanks for the next
