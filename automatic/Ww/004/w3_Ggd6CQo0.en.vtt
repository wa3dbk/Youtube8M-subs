00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.609 
add the face right and then you put the
heads<00:01:44.689> now<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.750> haven't<00:01:45.990> tried<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.470> before

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
heads now we haven't tried this before

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
heads now we haven't tried this before
we<00:01:46.950> actually<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:47.939> did<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.329> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
we actually we actually did a lot of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940 
we actually we actually did a lot of
research<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.810> figure<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.259> some<00:01:49.409> blood<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
research to figure out some blood it is

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
research to figure out some blood it is
and<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.820> theory<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.630> whenever<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.290> us

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and the theory is is whenever I like us

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.530 
and the theory is is whenever I like us
right<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.610> hero<00:01:53.880> Brian<00:01:54.090> will<00:01:54.299> spawn

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
right here is that hero Brian will spawn

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.819 
right here is that hero Brian will spawn
somewhere<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.020> works<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.470> whenever<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
somewhere in this works or whenever I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
somewhere in this works or whenever I
whenever<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.060> we're<00:01:57.299> gonna<00:01:57.360> go

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
whenever I like this we're gonna go

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.819 
whenever I like this we're gonna go

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.130 
dark cables I don't know for it okay and
this<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.820> this<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> first<00:02:17.660> episode<00:02:18.110> to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
this is this is the first episode to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.050 
this is this is the first episode to
Sophie<00:02:18.620> if<00:02:18.800> we<00:02:19.100> do<00:02:19.310> find<00:02:19.580> him<00:02:19.760> which<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.000> don't

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
Sophie if we do find him which I don't

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.730 
Sophie if we do find him which I don't
think<00:02:20.300> he<00:02:20.510> exists<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:20.960> if<00:02:21.080> we<00:02:21.230> find<00:02:21.470> him<00:02:21.620> on

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.020 
think he exists but if we find him on
this<00:02:21.830> episode<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.280> guess<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.580> series<00:02:22.850> will<00:02:23.000> be

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.270 
this episode I guess the series will be
done<00:02:23.240> why<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.200> find<00:02:24.500> out<00:02:24.710> we're<00:02:25.160> gonna

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280

done why so we find out we're gonna
we're<00:02:25.640> gonna<00:02:25.730> keep<00:02:26.060> trying<00:02:26.570> different<00:02:26.750> things

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
we're gonna keep trying different things

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720 
we're gonna keep trying different things
so<00:02:27.260> what<00:02:27.410> I'm<00:02:27.500> gonna<00:02:27.620> do<00:02:27.800> right<00:02:27.830> now<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.400> I'm

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
don't think that that would work but it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.850 
don't think that that would work but it
was<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.580> very<00:03:13.700> popular<00:03:14.180> one<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.110> definitely<00:03:15.590> had

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
to test it may take time so I mean I

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.310 
to test it may take time so I mean I
don't<00:03:18.440> know<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.799> tested<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.220> new<00:03:19.730> unique

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
don't know we tested a new unique
