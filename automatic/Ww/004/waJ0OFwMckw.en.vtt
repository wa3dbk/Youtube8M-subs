00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
though guys I think getting everyone

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.130 
though guys I think getting everyone
giving<00:01:32.880> everyone<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.270> free<00:01:33.420> case<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> fair

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
giving everyone a free case is a fair

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.569 
giving everyone a free case is a fair
compromise<00:01:34.470> i<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.520> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
compromise i think that you know it's a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.819 
compromise i think that you know it's a
good<00:01:35.670> idea<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.930> doesn't<00:01:37.229> solve<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
good idea it doesn't solve all the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.770 
good idea it doesn't solve all the
iphone<00:01:38.159> four<00:01:38.369> issues<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.939> still<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.479> kind

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
iphone four issues and still it's kind

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.600 
iphone four issues and still it's kind
of<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.049> bit<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
of a bit of it you know it's not that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.130 
of a bit of it you know it's not that
great<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140

great to see that you know you have to
have<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> case<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.799> phone<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.310> device

you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.759> lose<00:01:44.970> reception<00:01:45.299> i<00:01:45.659> think<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.259> will

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you can lose reception i think it will

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.620 
you can lose reception i think it will

the iphone now or in September going

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.850 
the iphone now or in September going
good<00:02:02.670> now<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.719> once<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> wait<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> sep<00:02:04.680> tember

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
good now in once you wait to sep tember
actually<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> case<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.939> end<00:02:06.180> so

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
actually that's when the case is end so

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
actually that's when the case is end so
i<00:02:07.290> mean<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:08.160> i<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.489> think<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
i mean really i don't think that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.430 
i mean really i don't think that
anything<00:02:09.000> else

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
anything else

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.560 
anything else
be<00:02:09.560> happening<00:02:10.040> I<00:02:10.220> think<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.820> Apple<00:02:11.180> said<00:02:11.420> what

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
be happening I think the Apple said what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
be happening I think the Apple said what
they're<00:02:11.660> going<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.840> say<00:02:12.050> they're<00:02:12.290> not<00:02:12.440> going

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
they're going to say they're not going

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.920 
they're going to say they're not going
to<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.770> know<00:02:13.000> all<00:02:14.000> sudden<00:02:14.300> start<00:02:14.660> recalling

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
to you know all sudden start recalling

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.080 
to you know all sudden start recalling
it<00:02:15.170> later<00:02:15.410> unless<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.400> issue<00:02:16.640> gets<00:02:16.910> bigger

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it later unless the issue gets bigger

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.490 
it later unless the issue gets bigger
bad<00:02:17.330> think<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.050> probably<00:02:18.140> going<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
bad think that this is probably going to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.110 
bad think that this is probably going to
just<00:02:18.710> hold<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.950> off<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.370> it's<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:19.910> kind<00:02:20.090> of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
just hold it off and it's just kind of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.280 
just hold it off and it's just kind of
kind<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.420> start<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> fade<00:02:20.870> away<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.840> heard<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
kind of start to fade away you heard the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.170 
kind of start to fade away you heard the
iphone<00:02:24.590> 4<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.100> test<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.910> not<00:02:26.120> sure

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
iphone 4 is just a test I'm not sure

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.460 
iphone 4 is just a test I'm not sure
what<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> mean<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.900> are<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.230> talking<00:02:27.440> about

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
what you mean you are you talking about

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.670 
what you mean you are you talking about
like<00:02:27.890> as<00:02:28.130> in<00:02:28.760> testing<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.630> new<00:02:29.840> antenna<00:02:30.380> or

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
like as in testing the new antenna or

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.630 
like as in testing the new antenna or
not<00:02:31.400> sure<00:02:32.590> if<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.710> get<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> glass<00:02:34.160> case<00:02:34.460> will

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
not sure if you get a glass case will

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.190 
not sure if you get a glass case will
that<00:02:34.760> cancel<00:02:35.210> out<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.420> death<00:02:35.600> grip<00:02:35.720> I've

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that cancel out the death grip I've

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.680 
that cancel out the death grip I've
never<00:02:36.590> heard<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.950> glass<00:02:37.130> case<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:38.660> probably

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
never heard of a glass case it probably

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.960 
never heard of a glass case it probably
will<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.800> main<00:02:40.010> thing<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.490> main<00:02:40.520> reason<00:02:40.940> that

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
will the main thing the main reason that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.810 
will the main thing the main reason that
the<00:02:41.120> death<00:02:41.330> grip<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.990> that<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.640> your

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
the death grip is is that the that your

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820 
the death grip is is that the that your
skin<00:02:44.120> when<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.390> touches<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.780> bridges<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> two

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
skin when it touches the bridges the two

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.770 
skin when it touches the bridges the two
antennas<00:02:46.340> together<00:02:46.670> then<00:02:47.240> it<00:02:47.390> can't<00:02:47.600> let

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
antennas together then it can't let

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.210 
antennas together then it can't let
starts<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.200> kind<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.440> really<00:02:48.680> degrade<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
starts to kind of really degrade the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.940 
starts to kind of really degrade the
signal<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:50.390> anything<00:02:50.720> really<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.290> keeps<00:02:51.770> you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
signal so anything really that keeps you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.650 
signal so anything really that keeps you
from<00:02:52.220> touching<00:02:52.490> that<00:02:52.760> will<00:02:52.940> probably<00:02:53.150> work<00:02:53.300> I

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
from touching that will probably work I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.750 
from touching that will probably work I
assume<00:02:54.320> glass<00:02:54.560> footwork<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.100> honestly<00:02:55.610> don't

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
assume glass footwork I honestly don't

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.950 
assume glass footwork I honestly don't
know<00:02:55.850> never<00:02:56.090> even<00:02:56.240> heard<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.540> glass<00:02:56.690> case

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
know never even heard of a glass case

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.170 
know never even heard of a glass case
but<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.170> imagine<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.650> probably<00:02:58.010> would<00:02:58.190> you

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
but I imagine it probably would you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.820 
but I imagine it probably would you
think<00:02:59.330> android<00:02:59.720> will<00:02:59.900> overpower<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.410> iPhone

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
think android will overpower the iPhone

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.330 
think android will overpower the iPhone
and<00:03:01.130> iOS<00:03:01.340> four<00:03:01.790> by<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.000> end<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.240> this<00:03:02.360> year

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and iOS four by the end of this year

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.800 
and iOS four by the end of this year
probably<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.760> think<00:03:05.030> androids<00:03:05.510> really

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
probably not I think androids really

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.230 
probably not I think androids really
building<00:03:06.260> everything<00:03:06.650> but<00:03:06.920> Ivan<00:03:07.310> for<00:03:07.610> even

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
building everything but Ivan for even

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.030 
building everything but Ivan for even
with<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.540> problem<00:03:08.840> is<00:03:09.140> still<00:03:09.470> probably<00:03:09.740> one

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
with this problem is still probably one

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.920 
with this problem is still probably one
of<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.190> best<00:03:10.370> phones<00:03:10.640> around<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.690> don't

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
of the best phones around and I don't

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.410 
of the best phones around and I don't
think<00:03:12.170> android<00:03:12.650> might<00:03:12.950> have<00:03:13.100> more<00:03:13.310> phones<00:03:13.670> but

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
think android might have more phones but

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.960 
think android might have more phones but
as<00:03:14.660> far<00:03:15.080> as<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.320> single<00:03:15.770> phone<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.370> think<00:03:16.640> iphone

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
as far as a single phone I think iphone

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.260 
as far as a single phone I think iphone
still<00:03:17.180> go<00:03:17.330> stay<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.690> top<00:03:18.370> would<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.459> reading

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
still go stay on top would you reading

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.570 
still go stay on top would you reading
from<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.480> iphone<00:03:20.750> 3g<00:03:21.170> now<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.100> we've<00:03:22.250> seen

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
from the iphone 3g now that we've seen

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.790 
from the iphone 3g now that we've seen
what<00:03:23.120> all's<00:03:23.330> going<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.810> with<00:03:23.930> iPhone<00:03:24.050> for<00:03:24.440> that

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
what all's going on with iPhone for that

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.260 
what all's going on with iPhone for that
like<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.400> said<00:03:25.459> they're<00:03:25.820> going<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.090> give<00:03:26.209> away

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
like I said they're going to give away

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.199 
like I said they're going to give away
free<00:03:26.540> cases<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:27.200> think<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:29.000> will

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
free cases I think that that will

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.970 
free cases I think that that will
probably<00:03:29.780> be<00:03:30.050> enough<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.620> go<00:03:30.709> ahead<00:03:30.770> and

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
probably be enough to go ahead and

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.760 
probably be enough to go ahead and
upgrade<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.400> mean<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.660> 3g<00:03:33.050> is<00:03:33.200> pretty<00:03:33.440> decent

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
upgrade I mean the 3g is pretty decent

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.110 
upgrade I mean the 3g is pretty decent
but<00:03:33.890> it's<00:03:34.010> starting<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.340> get<00:03:34.430> old<00:03:34.489> especially

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
but it's starting to get old especially

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.330 
but it's starting to get old especially
with<00:03:35.239> near<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.570> iOS<00:03:35.900> four<00:03:36.170> update<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:37.010> it's

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
with near the iOS four update so it's

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.830 
with near the iOS four update so it's
probably<00:03:37.550> about<00:03:37.730> time<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:38.060> upgrade<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.660> I

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
probably about time to upgrade and I

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.300 
probably about time to upgrade and I
think<00:03:39.140> even<00:03:39.410> though<00:03:39.800> I'm<00:03:39.890> not<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.040> hundred

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
think even though I'm not a hundred

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.970 
think even though I'm not a hundred
satisfied<00:03:41.060> with<00:03:41.300> what<00:03:42.019> you<00:03:42.050> know<00:03:42.290> Steve<00:03:42.709> Jobs

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
satisfied with what you know Steve Jobs

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.729 
satisfied with what you know Steve Jobs
everybody<00:03:43.610> just<00:03:43.850> announced<00:03:44.450> with<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.140> free

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
bumpers and everything I think that yeah

bumpers and everything I think that yeah
3<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.980> time<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.459> think<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:49.850> iphone<00:03:50.239> 4

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
3 is that time I think that iphone 4

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.360 
3 is that time I think that iphone 4
will<00:03:50.600> is<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:51.590> going<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:51.830> have<00:03:52.040> some<00:03:52.220> issues

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
will is it's going to have some issues

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.920 
will is it's going to have some issues
but<00:03:52.700> with<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.970> case<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.390> should<00:03:53.720> be<00:03:53.900> okay<00:03:54.670> oh

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
that says that you know this isn't

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.550 
that says that you know this isn't
working<00:04:59.090> or<00:04:59.509> there's<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.870> bigger<00:05:00.050> problem<00:05:00.229> then

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
working or there's a bigger problem then

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.809 
working or there's a bigger problem then
yeah<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.770> can<00:05:00.979> see<00:05:01.159> that<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:01.430> know<00:05:01.460> they<00:05:01.669> might

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
yeah I can see that you know they might

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:03.670 
yeah I can see that you know they might
have<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.539> know<00:05:02.629> try<00:05:03.050> some<00:05:03.259> other<00:05:03.319> measures

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
have to you know try some other measures

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.439 
have to you know try some other measures
but<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.219> be<00:05:04.310> honest<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.789> think<00:05:05.090> this<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.240> about

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
but to be honest I think this is about

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:06.879 
but to be honest I think this is about
the<00:05:05.690> end<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.229> don't<00:05:06.469> think<00:05:06.620> we're<00:05:06.740> really

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
the end of it I don't think we're really

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.580 
the end of it I don't think we're really
going<00:05:07.009> to<00:05:07.069> be<00:05:07.159> hearing<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.490> whole<00:05:07.639> Lyle's<00:05:08.590> do

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
going to be hearing a whole Lyle's do

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.749 
going to be hearing a whole Lyle's do
you<00:05:09.680> think<00:05:09.830> prices<00:05:10.009> coming<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.520> apple

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
you think prices coming to the apple

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.490 
you think prices coming to the apple
iphone<00:05:10.819> now<00:05:11.240> like<00:05:11.449> i<00:05:11.569> just<00:05:11.599> said<00:05:11.900> i<00:05:12.110> think<00:05:12.379> it's

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
iphone now like i just said i think it's

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.899 
iphone now like i just said i think it's
a<00:05:12.590> pretty<00:05:12.710> good<00:05:12.949> chance<00:05:13.159> that<00:05:13.490> now<00:05:13.639> that<00:05:13.819> they

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
a pretty good chance that now that they

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.580 
a pretty good chance that now that they
can<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.150> know<00:05:14.210> especially<00:05:14.360> they<00:05:14.780> said<00:05:15.139> that<00:05:15.379> a

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
can you know especially they said that a

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.580 
can you know especially they said that a
CT<00:05:16.580> is<00:05:16.699> one<00:05:16.849> of<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.000> bigger<00:05:17.210> issues<00:05:17.719> about<00:05:18.229> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
CT is one of the bigger issues about the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.499 
CT is one of the bigger issues about the
death<00:05:18.770> grip<00:05:18.949> because<00:05:19.159> obviously<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:20.240> death

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
death grip because obviously the death

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.209 
death grip because obviously the death
grip<00:05:20.659> you<00:05:21.050> know<00:05:21.169> turns<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.740> signal<00:05:22.039> down<00:05:22.190> a

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
grip you know turns the signal down a

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:23.860 
grip you know turns the signal down a
little<00:05:22.400> bit<00:05:22.580> but<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.090> course<00:05:23.150> if<00:05:23.569> there's<00:05:23.659> not

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
little bit but of course if there's not

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.570 
little bit but of course if there's not
a<00:05:23.900> bunch<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.349> signal<00:05:24.680> round<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.129> begin<00:05:25.400> with

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
a bunch of signal round to begin with

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.149 
a bunch of signal round to begin with
you<00:05:25.699> know<00:05:25.819> that's<00:05:26.300> going<00:05:26.419> to<00:05:26.509> really<00:05:26.690> hurt<00:05:26.930> you

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
thought you know the cases were pretty

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.570 
thought you know the cases were pretty
decent<00:05:36.289> i<00:05:36.349> guess<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:36.860> you<00:05:37.310> know<00:05:37.400> hopefully

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
decent i guess and you know hopefully

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.430 
decent i guess and you know hopefully
that<00:05:37.969> should<00:05:38.000> be<00:05:38.270> able<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.509> fix<00:05:38.690> everybody<00:05:39.169> I'm

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
that should be able to fix everybody I'm

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.469 
that should be able to fix everybody I'm
you<00:05:39.949> all<00:05:40.069> get<00:05:40.250> free<00:05:40.460> cases<00:05:40.880> for<00:05:41.029> your<00:05:41.120> iphone

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
you all get free cases for your iphone

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.439 
you all get free cases for your iphone
so<00:05:42.050> hopefully<00:05:42.740> that's<00:05:42.949> pretty<00:05:43.250> decent<00:05:43.580> anyway

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
so hopefully that's pretty decent anyway

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.370 
so hopefully that's pretty decent anyway
