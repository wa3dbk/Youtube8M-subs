00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello together and welcome back to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.220
 a canal 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.950
 I had you some videos before 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.790
 I once told these problems with 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.920
 have my opel knives in the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.690
 Form me the fair with moisture 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.449
 here in the frontal area here so strong 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.660
 I do not swell it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.900
 can open or close more if I 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.240
 have a little google or synonymous 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.609
 my information source number 1 so 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.300
 youtube interviewed and there different 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.399
 Solutions found a way 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.989
 The knife is in hot 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.730
 candle wax to dive 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.290
 as you probably are here now 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 think this is mine 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 preferred variant for today i 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.920
 try another one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.579
 possibility would be to co-incite with 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.870
 Hot glue here on the front side 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 I can well imagine if that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.980
 Hot glue here feeds that too 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.239
 has a corresponding effect and there 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.609
 I still have a third solution 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.660
 someone has the knife in there 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.479
 cooked hot oil in a saucepan so 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.479
 that the knife thereby the wood thereby 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.430
 was impregnated according as 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.140
 I just think the cable is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.600
 now the easiest way is the variant with 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.299
 the candle wax and thus the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.299
 I have the following works 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.070
 I came here from the out of the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.710
 drawer from my girlfriend one 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.979
 little one has a tealight with one 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.990
 a cash register is brought equal 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.400
 here these wooden blocks top right and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.380
 lie down left so the cat still 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.630
 gets enough air if I then 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.250
 Ultimately , the big tealight up here 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.340
 with the candle wax on it 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.799
 so that enough wax is available around 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.259
 dip the opels accordingly 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.610
 ok then I build very briefly by moving a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.850
 bit of cardboard under and then we see 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.759
 us right back last order 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.310
 Amazon a piece of the pop cartonage 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.290
 defeated and I'll go now 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.290
 light tealight in here 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:15.120
 the pieces of wood right and left 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.550
 place and then the tealights 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.860
 On top of that, let's see if that is 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.720
 enough makes it grow time 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.150
 bit smaller so the hands on to 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.150
 melt up looks good and 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:38.550
 Marked here a few parts wax 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.290
 in and then I just wait for that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.330
 the whole thing has melted whole 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.910
 now certainly took five minutes 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.910
 In the meantime I have the wink 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:54.840
 removed from the open and become it now 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:00.780
 with the front side here once in 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.950
 Hot wax reins out what it 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.950
 a little bit up and close 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.629
 it's either going through the wax now 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.629
 comes at the moment wonderfully easy 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:36.610
 I clean the knife directly and leave 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.349
 that sounds like doing the same thing 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.150
 we still with the opel number 12 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.630
 I take the clasp from the knife 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.550
 easy to open and then open the blade 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:56.769
 and then the lock ring jumps 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:04:02.890
 Just go up and now we'll do it 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:05.280
 same with this opel is also there 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.510
 I'm very curious but so pure 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.690
 Theoretically, the growth of the wood must be 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.730
 year up well so i am 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.730
 actually quite good things 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.860
 is the knife from the two I will 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.160
 Opels now often times in wet 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.890
 take the environment and report to you 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.540
 of course if the effort was worth it 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:45.390
 or whether that is an appropriate measure 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:49.070
 for the impregnation of opener knives 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.970
 is okay thanks for seeing and 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.770
 I'll be glad when we get back on 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.770
 see a canal until then many thanks
