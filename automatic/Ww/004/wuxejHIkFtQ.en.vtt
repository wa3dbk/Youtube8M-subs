00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
a lot of people ask if they can freeze

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.969 
a lot of people ask if they can freeze
their<00:00:06.390> geigerrig<00:00:06.750> hydration<00:00:06.840> engine<00:00:07.439> the

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:07.979 
their geigerrig hydration engine the

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.500 
their geigerrig hydration engine the
answer<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.459> yes<00:00:08.700> depending<00:00:08.940> on<00:00:09.209> what<00:00:09.360> you're

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510

answer is yes depending on what you're
doing<00:00:09.559> you<00:00:10.559> actually<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.429> freeze<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
doing you actually can freeze it

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.299 
doing you actually can freeze it
but<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:12.960> traditional<00:00:13.469> packs<00:00:13.740> are<00:00:13.920> there<00:00:14.219> are

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
but with traditional packs are there are

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
but with traditional packs are there are
kind<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.549> two<00:00:14.610> main<00:00:14.940> reasons<00:00:15.179> why<00:00:15.480> people<00:00:15.509> want

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
kind of two main reasons why people want

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.530 
kind of two main reasons why people want
to<00:00:16.500> freeze<00:00:16.740> their<00:00:16.890> hydration<00:00:17.220> engine<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.360> two

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
to freeze their hydration engine the two

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.870 
to freeze their hydration engine the two
reasons<00:00:18.750> number<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.349> is<00:00:19.649> because<00:00:20.489> as<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> can

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
reasons number one is because as you can

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.729 
reasons number one is because as you can
see<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.540> bite<00:00:21.779> valve<00:00:21.989> it's

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:22.739 
see here with this bite valve it's

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.010 
see here with this bite valve it's
really<00:00:23.220> hard<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.669> get<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.239> clean<00:00:24.599> I

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
really hard to get in there and clean I

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.749 
really hard to get in there and clean I
mean<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> can't<00:00:25.710> fit<00:00:25.890> my<00:00:26.009> hand<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.369> there<00:00:26.489> I

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
mean I can't fit my hand in there I

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.979 
mean I can't fit my hand in there I
don't<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.239> biggest<00:00:27.599> hands<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
don't have the biggest hands in the

world I can't fit my hands in there to
clean<00:00:29.579> it<00:00:29.610> it'd<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.149> very<00:00:30.419> difficult<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.869> get

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
clean it it'd be very difficult to get

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
clean it it'd be very difficult to get
brushes<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.680> there<00:00:31.829> to<00:00:32.009> clean<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.430> soap

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
brushes in there to clean it with soap

brushes in there to clean it with soap
and<00:00:32.880> water<00:00:33.200> once<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.350> did<00:00:34.559> get<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> clean<00:00:35.040> with

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and water once you did get it clean with

and water once you did get it clean with
the<00:00:35.280> soap<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.670> water<00:00:35.960> how<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.019> you<00:00:37.140> dry<00:00:37.350> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
the soap and water how do you dry it
I<00:00:37.739> mean<00:00:38.160> without<00:00:38.309> stuffing<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.449> rag<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.809> paper

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
towels in there by the time it's you're

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.579 
towels in there by the time it's you're
ready<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.749> your<00:00:42.839> next<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.260> they're<00:00:43.410> still

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
ready for your next use they're still

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:44.779 
ready for your next use they're still
gonna<00:00:43.679> be<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.859> little<00:00:44.070> bit<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.219> water<00:00:44.429> left<00:00:44.640> in

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
gonna be a little bit of water left in

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.430 
gonna be a little bit of water left in
there<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.059> gonna<00:00:45.179> turn<00:00:45.420> moldy<00:00:45.899> grow

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
there that's gonna turn moldy grow

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.739 
there that's gonna turn moldy grow
bacteria<00:00:46.679> I'm<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.909> just<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.420> gross

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
bacteria I'm it's just it's just gross

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.779 
bacteria I'm it's just it's just gross
they're<00:00:49.170> hard<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> clean<00:00:49.679> more<00:00:50.370> importantly

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
they're hard to clean more importantly

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.239 
they're hard to clean more importantly
hard<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.269> dry<00:00:51.570> which<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.289> why<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> people

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
hard to dry which is why a lot of people

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.649 
hard to dry which is why a lot of people
will<00:00:53.339> take<00:00:53.489> their<00:00:53.640> traditional<00:00:54.210> hydration

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
will take their traditional hydration

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.229 
will take their traditional hydration
packs<00:00:54.899> throw<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.280> freezer<00:00:56.519> full<00:00:57.179> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
packs throw it in the freezer full of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
packs throw it in the freezer full of
water<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> they'll<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
water and they'll do that because it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.579 
water and they'll do that because it
will<00:00:59.850> allow<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.780> cold<00:01:01.109> temperatures

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
will allow the the cold temperatures

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.310 
will allow the the cold temperatures
will<00:01:01.679> suppress<00:01:02.129> bacterial<00:01:02.789> growth<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> with

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
will suppress bacterial growth so with

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.899 
will suppress bacterial growth so with
the<00:01:04.409> geigerrig<00:01:04.559> hydration<00:01:04.800> engine<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.729> don't

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the geigerrig hydration engine you don't

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
the geigerrig hydration engine you don't
have<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.240> worry<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.200> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
have to worry about that because we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.900 
have to worry about that because we
already<00:01:07.950> solved<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> problem<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:08.760> we'll

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
already solved that problem which we'll

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.730 
already solved that problem which we'll
talk<00:01:09.030> about<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> second<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:10.230> second<00:01:10.620> main

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
talk about in a second the second main

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
talk about in a second the second main
reason<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.190> because<00:01:11.220> traditional<00:01:12.210> packs<00:01:12.390> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
reason is because traditional packs are

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.680 
reason is because traditional packs are
hard<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.080> load<00:01:13.320> ice<00:01:13.710> into<00:01:14.180> same<00:01:15.180> thing<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.540> mean

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
hard to load ice into same thing I mean

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.090 
hard to load ice into same thing I mean
look<00:01:15.840> how<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> bike<00:01:16.500> down<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
look how little the bike down or the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.130 
look how little the bike down or the
opening<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.790> you're<00:01:18.180> putting<00:01:18.480> in<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.870> two

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
opening is you're putting in one two

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
opening is you're putting in one two
maybe<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.860> ice<00:01:20.070> cubes<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.550> time<00:01:20.730> it's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
maybe three ice cubes at a time it's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.220 
maybe three ice cubes at a time it's
gonna<00:01:20.940> take<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.300> while<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.510> fill<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.050> out

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
gonna take you a while to fill that out

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.950 
gonna take you a while to fill that out
on<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.940> other<00:01:24.090> side<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.810> geigerrig

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
on the other side with the geigerrig

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.480 
on the other side with the geigerrig
hydration<00:01:25.260> engine<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.540> large

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
hydration engine we have a very large

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.400 
hydration engine we have a very large
wide<00:01:29.490> mouth<00:01:29.760> opening<00:01:30.300> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.870> see<00:01:31.050> how<00:01:31.170> easy

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
wide mouth opening you can see how easy

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.590 
wide mouth opening you can see how easy
it<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.620> to<00:01:31.770> open<00:01:31.800> that<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.090> prefer

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it is to open that up I can go I prefer

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.030 
it is to open that up I can go I prefer
to<00:01:33.690> go<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> gas<00:01:34.170> station<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.800> hold

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to go to the gas station and just hold

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.570 
to go to the gas station and just hold
it<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.160> under<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.550> ice<00:01:35.760> cube<00:01:36.090> dispenser

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
it right under the ice cube dispenser

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.860 
it right under the ice cube dispenser
really<00:01:38.580> easy<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.330> throw<00:01:39.690> them<00:01:39.810> in

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
really easy they can just throw them in

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.970 
really easy they can just throw them in
there<00:01:39.990> from<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.260> house<00:01:40.440> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.710> how

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
there from your house you can see how

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.280 
there from your house you can see how
much<00:01:41.100> easier<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:42.120> load<00:01:42.480> so<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.110> don't

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
much easier it is to load so you don't

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.750 
much easier it is to load so you don't
have<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.500> worry<00:01:43.680> about<00:01:43.740> freezing<00:01:44.190> it<00:01:44.490> because

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
have to worry about freezing it because

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.460 
have to worry about freezing it because
you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.970> very<00:01:45.180> easily<00:01:45.240> load<00:01:45.780> ice<00:01:45.960> cubes<00:01:46.320> in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
you can very easily load ice cubes in

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.170 
you can very easily load ice cubes in
there<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.370> cleaning<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.910> same

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
there and then with cleaning it same

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
thing you can open this up you can get

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
thing you can open this up you can get
your<00:01:50.160> hand<00:01:50.370> in<00:01:50.460> there<00:01:50.520> brush<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.300> with<00:01:51.720> soap

degrees<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.519> summer<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.030> he'll<00:02:20.420> want<00:02:20.630> to

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
degrees in the summer and he'll want to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.470 
degrees in the summer and he'll want to
freeze<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.260> all<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.519> way<00:02:22.640> frozen<00:02:23.150> before<00:02:23.300> he

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
freeze that all the way frozen before he

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.309 
freeze that all the way frozen before he
goes<00:02:23.569> out<00:02:23.720> there<00:02:23.840> because<00:02:23.959> he<00:02:24.140> knows<00:02:24.290> that

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
goes out there because he knows that

goes out there because he knows that

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
needs to last him all day that's so hot

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.370 
needs to last him all day that's so hot
out<00:02:26.360> there<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> beginning<00:02:26.780> it's<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.230> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
out there at the beginning it's going to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.830 
out there at the beginning it's going to
thought<00:02:27.739> quicker<00:02:28.099> so<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.790> absolutely<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.630> we

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
thought quicker so you absolutely can we

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.600 
thought quicker so you absolutely can we
do<00:02:30.019> recommend<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.739> if<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:31.220> do<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.489> to

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
do recommend that if you do want to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.130 
do recommend that if you do want to
freeze<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.940> for<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.269> purpose<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.720> fill<00:02:33.019> it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
freeze it for that purpose you fill it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.370 
freeze it for that purpose you fill it
up<00:02:33.200> about<00:02:33.349> 2/3<00:02:34.040> maybe<00:02:34.370> up<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.549> 60<00:02:35.420> 75<00:02:35.959> percent

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
up about 2/3 maybe up to 60 75 percent

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.470 
up about 2/3 maybe up to 60 75 percent
of<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> way<00:02:36.650> full<00:02:36.890> because<00:02:37.310> not<00:02:37.730> doubt<00:02:38.060> that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
of the way full because not doubt that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.870 
of the way full because not doubt that
water<00:02:39.230> will<00:02:39.500> expand<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.250> bit<00:02:40.430> when<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.700> freezes

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
water will expand a bit when it freezes

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.240 
water will expand a bit when it freezes
so<00:02:41.599> we<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.900> have<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.080> very<00:02:42.290> inelastic<00:02:42.530> material

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
so we do have a very inelastic material

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.320 
so we do have a very inelastic material
that<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.430> always<00:02:43.549> want<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.819> be<00:02:43.880> careful<00:02:44.120> with

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
that you always want to be careful with

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.490 
that you always want to be careful with
the<00:02:44.450> valve<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.900> don't<00:02:45.049> have<00:02:45.170> water<00:02:45.319> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
the valve so you don't have water and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.690 
the valve so you don't have water and
that's<00:02:45.650> going<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.860> expand<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.340> cause<00:02:46.459> damage

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
that's going to expand and cause damage

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.270 
that's going to expand and cause damage
so<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.690> want<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.080> go<00:02:48.500> ahead<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:49.010> fill<00:02:49.190> it

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
so if you want you go ahead just fill it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.900 
so if you want you go ahead just fill it
up<00:02:49.340> 75%<00:02:50.090> away<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.510> you're<00:02:50.630> good<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.810> go
