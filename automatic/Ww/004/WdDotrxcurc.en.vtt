00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.710
 let's calculate the limit when x tends to 3 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.769
 of square root of 12 x minus three 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.969
 match 3 - x note that we have a 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:17.089
 fraction down a polynomial up the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.519
 square root of a polynomial minus a 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:24.890
 number so we have a division 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:28.099
 polynomial down up square root of 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.079
 polynomials roots polynomials division 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.789
 less result number we 're going before a 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.190
 continuous function and then for 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.859
 calculate the limit you simply have to 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.820
 replace the x for what it has or is 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:45.440
 we substitute the x for 3 if this works 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.199
 well there is no problem I have 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.359
 a result that is the value of the limit 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:55.579
 substitute resorts to the square time of 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:57.019
 12 minus 3 this minus 3 match of 3 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.800
 less 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.109
 the x desserts and you get root 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.670
 square of 12 minus three square root 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:11.630
 of 9 which is 3 minus 3 down 0 and 3 less 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.020
 3 above is 0 0 match 0 there are problems 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.570
 because we have a 0 in the denominator 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.480
 as we know the fractions with 0 in the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.670
 denominator do not make sense without 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.400
 But we also have in the numerator 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 another 0 we have zero match of zero and 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.020
 we are calculating a limit 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.760
 in the case that we calculate a limit I 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.570
 let's have zero match of zero 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.000
 we are facing an indeterminacy that 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.920
 determination means that the fact of 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.750
 get zero zero match is not 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.260
 deducts what will be the result of the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.810
 limit and how 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.030
 we work when we have 0 match 0 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.150
 indeterminacy when the first thing is that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.760
 we have a square root inside it appears 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.140
 the X in that case what is done is 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.140
 copy the limit 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.229
 in the part that appears square root 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.410
 as we see is the numerator we copy it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.000
 up and down but with the sign of 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.160
 enmedio this less we put more 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 square 12 x plus 3 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.180
 and the same we copy down square root 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.180
 of 12 x + 3 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.980
 then we multiply numerator by 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.040
 numerator denominator by denominator and 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.330
 we get in the numerator 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.069
 and so we have sought to have 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.950
 a sum 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.689
 by a difference of the same then 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.909
 as we know sum for differences 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:54.939
 difference of squares squares 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.939
 first minus square second 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.330
 and down then this for this one is not 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.379
 develops because this first 3x is going to 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.700
 simplify with part of the above 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.010
 as we will see and that will always be 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.950
 when we have indeterminacy 0 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.810
 match in 0 with roots that involve 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.560
 the X or the X appears 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.569
 inside some root 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.819
 in this case high limit when x 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.280
 tends to three we do not know what down below what 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.849
 let's leave without developing up 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.600
 root and square is going we are left 12 xy 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:33.030
 now minus 3 or 4 less 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.030
 below we have desserts x 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.620
 12 x 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.549
 as I say 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.470
 this 3x will be simplified with what 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.560
 above or those above except one factor 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.200
 that we will have to operate so that we remain 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.989
 those below and simplify 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.020
 in our case above we have 12 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.950
 93 x 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.530
 under 3x as we see the same or 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.020
 is going to simplify directly I say 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.480
 because once we have operated the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.670
 part that is not the root in the part 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.950
 that now the root has not been left 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.959
 this factor that we have here is going to go 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.120
 because it appears above in this case it is 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.100
 well because the sign appears changed in 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.470
 whose case above we will draw a minus 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.820
 common factor or we will have to take out 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.860
 a number but it's always going to 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.140
 simplify in this case it goes 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.030
 directly then this would be the 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.030
 limit when x tends to 3 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.540
 up there has not been anyone we put one and 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.520
 down we have a square root 12 x + 3 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.550
 it is simply because we have to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.080
 replace the x by 3 above was 1 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.840
 eye square root 12 minus xx store 3 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.190
 we have the same as the beginning number 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.650
 match to polynomial plus numbers 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.450
 everything leads us to that source is not 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.300
 continue then to calculate the limit 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.400
 you have to replace 2012 the X by 33 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:16.409
 this is one square root game left 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:19.020
 2 - 3 931 record match 93 31 match 6 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.970
 there have been problems we get obtained 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.620
 a result and that would be the result 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.620
 of the proposed limit
