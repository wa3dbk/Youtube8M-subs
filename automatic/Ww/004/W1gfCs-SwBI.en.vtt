lad<00:04:05.989> in<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.769> season<00:04:07.189> is<00:04:07.400> quite<00:04:07.819> remarkable<00:04:08.389> he

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479 
lad in the season is quite remarkable he

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.360 
lad in the season is quite remarkable he
improves<00:04:08.900> every<00:04:09.379> match<00:04:09.590> every<00:04:09.979> tournament

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
improves every match every tournament

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.520 
improves every match every tournament
what<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.060> remarkable<00:04:11.449> to<00:04:11.750> about<00:04:12.139> him<00:04:12.259> is<00:04:12.379> the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
what is remarkable to about him is the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.379 
what is remarkable to about him is the
the<00:04:12.769> series<00:04:13.009> the<00:04:13.310> consistent<00:04:13.849> series<00:04:14.180> of

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
the series the consistent series of

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.509 
the series the consistent series of
breaks<00:04:14.689> that<00:04:14.840> we<00:04:15.049> see<00:04:15.229> from<00:04:15.439> him<00:04:15.590> yeah<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.310> think

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
breaks that we see from him yeah I think

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.800 
breaks that we see from him yeah I think
the<00:04:16.699> only<00:04:16.759> player<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.180> we've<00:04:17.389> ever<00:04:17.570> seen

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
the only player that we've ever seen

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.020 
the only player that we've ever seen
quite<00:04:18.229> as<00:04:18.470> consistent<00:04:19.009> this<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.489> recent<00:04:19.699> years

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
quite as consistent this in recent years

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.969 
quite as consistent this in recent years
is<00:04:20.150> of<00:04:20.239> course<00:04:20.419> Steve<00:04:20.659> Davis<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.889> know

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
is of course Steve Davis and you know

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.409
