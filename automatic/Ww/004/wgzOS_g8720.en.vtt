it<00:01:50.280> does<00:01:50.430> indeed<00:01:50.579> collect<00:01:51.060> went<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.600> does

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it does indeed collect went and it does

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
it does indeed collect went and it does
indeed<00:01:51.930> collect<00:01:52.560> us<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.039> don't<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
indeed collect us so don't think for a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.249 
indeed collect us so don't think for a
second<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.539> but

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
second that it's not going to but

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
second that it's not going to but
anyways<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.920> Snicket<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> silicon<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.060> not

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
anyways the Snicket the silicon is not

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.639 
anyways the Snicket the silicon is not
your<00:01:57.450> sticky<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.140> good<00:01:58.200> grip<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
your sticky this have a good grip to it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
your sticky this have a good grip to it
though<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.549> insert<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> has<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> terra<00:02:00.509> he

though and the insert it has a terra he
dhryn<00:02:01.130> what<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.369> slick<00:02:02.579> material<00:02:03.149> like

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
dhryn what is it slick material like

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.569 
dhryn what is it slick material like
this<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.930> call<00:02:04.079> tara<00:02:04.289> he'd<00:02:04.469> ring<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.009> so

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
this with the call tara he'd ring and so

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
this with the call tara he'd ring and so
this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.759> basically<00:02:05.939> took<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> lie<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
this is basically took a lie on the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.520 
this is basically took a lie on the
inside<00:02:07.439> offers<00:02:07.979> better<00:02:08.190> shock<00:02:08.520> absorption

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
inside offers better shock absorption

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.900 
inside offers better shock absorption
pretty<00:02:10.530> nice<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.979> difficult<00:02:11.430> scratch<00:02:11.760> will

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910

this<00:03:33.220> one<00:03:33.370> out<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.760> think<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.930> think<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.350> a

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
this one out I think I think it is a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.289 
this one out I think I think it is a
little<00:03:35.799> step<00:03:36.040> above<00:03:36.340> like<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.910> cheaper<00:03:37.269> I

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
little step above like the cheaper I

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.150 
little step above like the cheaper I
mean<00:03:37.540> there<00:03:38.109> are<00:03:38.260> silicone<00:03:38.680> cases<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:39.010> can<00:03:39.040> be

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
mean there are silicone cases you can be

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.770 
mean there are silicone cases you can be
like<00:03:39.340> on<00:03:39.519> ebay<00:03:39.850> for<00:03:39.910> five<00:03:40.209> dollars<00:03:40.570> which<00:03:40.750> is

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
like on ebay for five dollars which is

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.720 
like on ebay for five dollars which is
the<00:03:40.959> cheapest<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.739> know<00:03:41.859> cheap<00:03:42.489> silicone

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
the cheapest you know cheap silicone

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.789 
the cheapest you know cheap silicone
only<00:03:43.120> like<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.299> real<00:03:43.510> snug<00:03:43.690> fit<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.680> not

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
only like a real snug fit this is not

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.319 
only like a real snug fit this is not
gonna<00:03:44.950> be<00:03:45.040> one<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.280> those<00:03:45.370> types<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.850> cases<00:03:46.060> it

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
gonna be one of those types of cases it

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.000 
gonna be one of those types of cases it
has<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.450> real<00:03:46.660> good<00:03:46.780> fit<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.590> silicone

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
has a real good fit to it the silicone

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.160 
has a real good fit to it the silicone
doesn't<00:03:48.220> feel<00:03:48.519> cheap<00:03:48.790> or<00:03:49.420> gummy<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.989> type<00:03:50.140> of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
doesn't feel cheap or gummy that type of

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.170 
doesn't feel cheap or gummy that type of
thing<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.650> $23<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.700> think<00:03:51.880> that's<00:03:52.000> pretty

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
thing so $23 I think that's pretty

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.220 
thing so $23 I think that's pretty
reasonably<00:03:52.510> priced<00:03:52.750> for<00:03:52.930> what<00:03:53.079> you're

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
reasonably priced for what you're

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.780 
reasonably priced for what you're
getting<00:03:53.709> in<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:54.160> scrim<00:03:54.430> protectors

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
getting in to scrim protectors

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.370 
getting in to scrim protectors
which<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.030> nice<00:03:55.180> an<00:03:55.390> anti-glare<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.139> clear

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
which is nice an anti-glare and it clear

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.500 
which is nice an anti-glare and it clear
so<00:03:56.889> if<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.069> can't<00:03:57.250> go<00:03:57.280> wrong<00:03:57.519> with<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.819> like
