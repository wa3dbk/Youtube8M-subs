00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 the yoki 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.709
 the first loss in the league 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.269
 the drink 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.620
 well my friends today I 'm here to 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.170
 make a video about 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.790
 left hand with right hand 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.070
 the staff has been asking for a lot of 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.520
 albino are having a lot of difficulty in 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.309
 at the time of joining both hands because I'm going 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.710
 make a more basic video for who 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.410
 is starting and improving this 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.239
 part and in sequence also a little bit 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.720
 a video showing a bit of technique 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.870
 of accordion swing or many bagpipe 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.880
 speak there is the most initial personal part if 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.730
 drop more and get better 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.230
 results in their songs is then 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.300
 first technique here with the left hand 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 and in the right hand what we are going to do 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.620
 Let's vote on the intense scale of do 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.089
 to pass heavy scale of down much 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.160
 most of my followers have already 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:14.060
 each has and who has not can arrange the 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:18.710
 ball will be like ie notes 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:24.650
 first notes then common do with one there 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.440
 me with just one and with there ended up light and 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:35.030
 we start all over again in the sun with the sun 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:38.330
 if there, give me the notes on the scale 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.310
 intense fingering or fingering to a 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.740
 very important thing since you are 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.869
 At first I advise you to obey 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.060
 this dialogue will pass here that goes 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:54.860
 bring much comfort there in front of you 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:00.619
 would be 12 13 24 35 and start again 12 13 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 24 35 or stayed until the return to 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.410
 contrary 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.160
 everything ready this stuff here in hand 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.070
 right 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.780
 the higher technical scale in the low back 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.780
 my f 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:24.260
 there he the news there only online and harry do 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.430
 fingering if you want to make the day the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:43.130
 correct attack 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:52.550
 4 is not 4 5353 44 node 453 only the 53 are 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:55.090
 and 4 knot is decorated here hand decorated 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.090
 right 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.470
 What we're going to do is return this 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.840
 counter- fault technique the right hand 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.560
 plays first is basic but what 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.560
 fantastic result 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.080
 in the last exchange together then play 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:31.790
 first right hand 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:33.350
 soon after the plan of the ba here 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.290
 you can also do it using the scale 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.050
 open in octaves when it is said that it is the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.750
 the summit of the little finger repeats always hurts 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.300
 same training the hand is equal to O would 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.030
 same formation until they took the weapon 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.030
 usually in the songs comes this scale 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.010
 the fifa or low is the same and this is 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.040
 make all the tones here 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.769
 straight card decorates the hurts after goes 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.290
 transporting them to the other tones of the 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.030
 Just as you took the pity then one 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.680
 second very important step would be to 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:22.500
 down the side is already a little more 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:25.620
 complicated but super cute that would be the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.759
 scale there or down here on the hand 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.139
 right is the same however it will be 2 low 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:41.789
 see I played the ball and the keyboard and 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:46.970
 low boy hoodies is for me in the 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.970
 keyboard do not always have the most low 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:13.670
 the back up powder 102 under our 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:13.670
 in acronym hla sol it's good it's good it's good just 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:32.930
 so you can see how beautiful it looks 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.930
 done faster octaves 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.559
 so that's what I wanted to move on to. 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.869
 You guys this video to work a little 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.719
 the individuality to work the 

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:58.849
 cons and predominating the difficulties 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.159
 what do we have and in a while? 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.879
 I come back doing a degree a little more 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.979
 above 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.409
 before that immersed in the truth is infinite 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.809
 but a cycle that you pick up on 15 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.339
 different types will open you up a lot 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:13.009
 mentality and facilitate the 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:19.269
 enough in your stop there are not several 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.269
 tell me if it goes or does it crack 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:39.949
 It is very very used but this is 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:42.379
 step by step sequence will show the 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.050
 this material for you so what? 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:47.629
 I offer these two today 11 and 12 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.610
 It's then we go back doing 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.289
 other material to other materials 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.329
 a little better 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.329
 the most advanced for you taking there
