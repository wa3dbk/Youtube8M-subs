00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
still have 5 2 transpose to the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.290 
still have 5 2 transpose to the
Leningrad<00:00:20.490> Dutch<00:00:21.529> but<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.920> time<00:00:22.980> ok<00:00:23.970> we

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
Leningrad Dutch but not this time ok we

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.929 
Leningrad Dutch but not this time ok we
have<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.990> double<00:00:25.680> fianchetto<00:00:25.980> setup<00:00:28.670> which<00:00:29.670> now

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
have a double fianchetto setup which now

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.160 
have a double fianchetto setup which now
looks<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.539> lot<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.650> English<00:00:31.980> opening<00:00:33.170> yeah

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
looks a lot like in English opening yeah

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.940 
looks a lot like in English opening yeah
let's<00:00:34.860> try<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:36.380> use<00:00:37.380> them<00:00:39.649> pressure<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
let's try to use them pressure on the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.180 
let's try to use them pressure on the
long<00:00:41.250> diagonal<00:00:47.899> yeah<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.230> actually<00:00:49.410> am<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
long diagonal yeah this is actually am a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.590 
long diagonal yeah this is actually am a
known<00:00:50.730> theoretical<00:00:51.719> line<00:00:53.120> which<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.270> played

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
known theoretical line which I played

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.799 
known theoretical line which I played
down<00:00:54.840> myself<00:00:56.780> for<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:58.969> of<00:00:59.969> course<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.449> forgot

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
down myself for a bit of course I forgot

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:13.910 
down myself for a bit of course I forgot
it<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:03.439> think<00:01:04.439> it'd<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.769> care

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.740 

yeah<00:01:14.920> now<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.159> get<00:01:15.430> get<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.850> default<00:01:16.390> phone<00:01:16.570> I'm

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
yeah now I get get the default phone I'm

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.230 
yeah now I get get the default phone I'm
not<00:01:17.080> sure<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.320> think<00:01:17.590> yeah<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.130> one<00:01:19.119> idea

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
not sure I think yeah this is one idea

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.800 
not sure I think yeah this is one idea
but<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:19.690> always<00:01:19.900> thought<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:22.479> sum

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
but I always thought that this sum

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.530 
but I always thought that this sum
should<00:01:23.200> be<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:24.869> rather<00:01:25.869> than<00:01:26.020> blacks<00:01:26.440> favor

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
should be on rather than blacks favor

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.810 
should be on rather than blacks favor
because<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.990> bishop<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.440> not<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.740> great<00:01:30.100> great

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
because the bishop is not a great great

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.290 
because the bishop is not a great great
piece<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:35.130> those<00:01:36.130> parts<00:01:36.640> are<00:01:36.759> all<00:01:36.909> on<00:01:37.090> light

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
piece and those parts are all on light

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.630 
piece and those parts are all on light
squares<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.550> it<00:01:39.550> looks<00:01:39.850> like<00:01:39.970> him<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.720> might<00:01:41.640> get

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
squares so it looks like him I might get

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.230 
squares so it looks like him I might get
a<00:01:42.670> favorable<00:01:43.090> end<00:01:43.479> game<00:01:43.780> at<00:01:44.080> one<00:01:44.380> point<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
a favorable end game at one point of

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.100 
a favorable end game at one point of
course<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.320> thing<00:01:47.830> everything<00:01:48.429> works<00:01:48.700> out

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
course the thing everything works out

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.710 
course the thing everything works out
perfectly<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.380> mean<00:01:50.649> it's<00:01:50.950> not<00:01:51.039> like<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:52.630> a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
perfectly I mean it's not like there's a

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.790 
perfectly I mean it's not like there's a
great<00:01:53.050> end<00:01:53.289> game<00:01:53.530> arising<00:01:54.130> by<00:01:54.580> force<00:01:54.970> at<00:01:55.210> just

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
great end game arising by force at just

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.690 
great end game arising by force at just
the<00:01:56.800> general<00:01:57.070> idea<00:01:57.990> who<00:01:58.990> came<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.520> is

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
the general idea who came this is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:10.169 
the general idea who came this is
curious<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:09.190> think<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:10.149> can

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
curious I don't think that you can

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.580 
curious I don't think that you can
really<00:02:10.539> keep<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.440> spawn<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:13.120> if<00:02:13.330> not<00:02:13.600> then<00:02:13.870> it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
really keep the spawn and if not then it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:26.550 
really keep the spawn and if not then it
looks<00:02:14.860> really<00:02:15.130> weak<00:02:19.470> Queen<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.650> form<00:02:23.459> hmm

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.460 

no<00:02:27.560> maybe<00:02:28.250> maybe<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.180> maybe<00:02:29.810> he<00:02:30.050> can<00:02:30.260> play

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
no maybe maybe this is maybe he can play

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:42.520 
no maybe maybe this is maybe he can play
that<00:02:34.720> how<00:02:35.720> do<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.990> really<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:36.800> pawn<00:02:41.530> look

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
that how do I really get this pawn look

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.310 
that how do I really get this pawn look
B<00:02:42.860> forms<00:02:43.370> probably<00:02:44.240> probably<00:02:44.660> not<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.170> way<00:02:45.290> to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
B forms probably probably not the way to

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:58.800 
B forms probably probably not the way to
go<00:02:46.660> let's<00:02:47.660> see<00:02:48.290> if<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.560> can<00:02:49.900> use<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.200> some<00:02:52.540> snide

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.260 

look<00:02:59.810> before<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:04.220> is<00:03:04.400> why<00:03:04.580> I<00:03:04.610> wanted<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.970> play

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
look before this is why I wanted to play

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.700 
look before this is why I wanted to play
96<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.380> after<00:03:06.710> rook<00:03:06.920> before<00:03:07.430> seat<00:03:07.850> xb<00:03:08.360> I

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
96 so that after rook before seat xb I

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.960 
96 so that after rook before seat xb I
have<00:03:09.710> 95<00:03:10.490> and<00:03:11.560> now<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.620> have<00:03:12.860> isolated<00:03:13.310> this

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
have 95 and now I have isolated this

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.040 
have 95 and now I have isolated this
pawn<00:03:14.300> on<00:03:14.450> e5<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:15.640> hope<00:03:16.640> this<00:03:16.880> really<00:03:17.120> falls<00:03:17.690> now

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
pawn on e5 I hope this really falls now

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.080 
pawn on e5 I hope this really falls now
otherwise<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:20.150> can<00:03:20.420> get<00:03:20.690> ugly<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.940> really<00:03:22.940> need

think it's just a matter of some
accuracy<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.479> blackest<00:05:42.960> is<00:05:43.350> excellent<00:05:43.979> I

an excellent night here black is quite
substantially<00:07:00.720> better<00:07:00.870> it's<00:07:01.650> not<00:07:02.419> clear

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
substantially better it's not clear

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.719

vizinha<00:07:03.990> for<00:07:04.229> win<00:07:04.440> but<00:07:04.680> black<00:07:05.099> is

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
much better I just thought that after

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.399 
much better I just thought that after
this<00:07:10.680> move<00:07:10.979> I<00:07:11.279> didn't<00:07:12.210> see<00:07:12.360> Bishop<00:07:12.689> e7<00:07:12.870> meant

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.409 
this move I didn't see Bishop e7 meant

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.010 
this move I didn't see Bishop e7 meant
my<00:07:14.309> idea<00:07:14.550> was<00:07:14.729> I<00:07:14.939> gained<00:07:15.150> the<00:07:15.180> tempo<00:07:15.659> and<00:07:15.689> then

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
my idea was I gained the tempo and then

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.529 
my idea was I gained the tempo and then
I<00:07:16.050> then<00:07:16.319> I<00:07:16.469> grab<00:07:16.819> just<00:07:17.819> a<00:07:17.969> little<00:07:18.240> bit<00:07:18.360> more

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
I then I grab just a little bit more

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.070 
I then I grab just a little bit more
convenient<00:07:19.020> but<00:07:19.439> Bishop<00:07:19.650> e7<00:07:19.949> really<00:07:20.490> is<00:07:21.330> good

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
convenient but Bishop e7 really is good

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.239 
convenient but Bishop e7 really is good
I<00:07:22.349> cannot<00:07:22.680> do<00:07:22.949> that<00:07:23.129> I<00:07:23.430> thought<00:07:23.759> because<00:07:24.210> of

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:25.249 
I cannot do that I thought because of

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:30.499 
I cannot do that I thought because of
capturing<00:07:26.249> I<00:07:26.520> had<00:07:27.059> as<00:07:27.240> a<00:07:27.389> six<00:07:27.659> hanging<00:07:27.960> ooh<00:07:29.509> and

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:30.509 
capturing I had as a six hanging ooh and

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:33.469 
capturing I had as a six hanging ooh and
then<00:07:30.719> oh<00:07:30.749> where<00:07:31.469> oh<00:07:31.499> I<00:07:31.650> didn't<00:07:32.249> hit<00:07:32.460> it<00:07:32.490> I<00:07:32.969> did
