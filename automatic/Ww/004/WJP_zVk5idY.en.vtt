00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.740 
older model but but if they have to get
a<00:02:08.670> regulatory<00:02:09.030> approval<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> be

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
a regulatory approval it have to be

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.449 
a regulatory approval it have to be
substantively<00:02:10.440> different<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
substantively different right it

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.910 
substantively different right it
couldn't<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> 5s

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
couldn't be the 5s

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.170 
couldn't be the 5s
it<00:02:14.280> has<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.670> something<00:02:14.970> new<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.970> wonder

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it has to be something new I just wonder

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.309 
it has to be something new I just wonder
whether<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.510> conversation<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.020> Apple's

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
whether the conversation that Apple's

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.750 
whether the conversation that Apple's
having<00:02:19.560> now<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.340> want<00:02:20.520> us<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
having now is like if you want us to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000 
having now is like if you want us to
release<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> same<00:02:21.810> day<00:02:22.080> time<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.830> your

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
release at the same day time in your

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.059 
release at the same day time in your
country<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:24.300> let's<00:02:24.870> not<00:02:25.020> let's<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.709> do<00:02:25.920> this

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
country then let's not let's not do this

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.530 
country then let's not let's not do this
otherwise<00:02:26.430> we'll<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:26.849> wait<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.000> six<00:02:27.330> months

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
otherwise we'll just wait for six months

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.699 
otherwise we'll just wait for six months
and<00:02:27.630> go<00:02:27.720> through<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.989> regulatory<00:02:28.290> stuff

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
and go through the regulatory stuff

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.380 
and go through the regulatory stuff
after<00:02:29.160> we've<00:02:29.310> already<00:02:29.459> released<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
after we've already released it if you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660 
after we've already released it if you
can't<00:02:30.569> keep<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.810> secret<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.280> think<00:02:32.430> that's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
can't keep a secret so I think that's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.660 
can't keep a secret so I think that's
probably<00:02:32.850> noticed<00:02:33.300> he<00:02:33.510> said<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.110> is

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
probably noticed he said this is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.070 
probably noticed he said this is
completely<00:02:35.670> normal<00:02:36.000> when<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.480> approve<00:02:36.959> a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
completely normal when we approve a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080 
completely normal when we approve a
product<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:37.530> make<00:02:37.560> an<00:02:37.830> announcement<00:02:38.090> over

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
product we make an announcement over

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
product we make an announcement over
Twitter<00:02:39.300> well<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.440> did<00:02:40.680> Apple<00:02:41.040> did<00:02:41.160> point

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
Twitter well they did Apple did point

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.440 
Twitter well they did Apple did point
out<00:02:41.400> you've<00:02:41.550> never<00:02:41.730> done<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.030> over<00:02:42.120> Twitter

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
out you've never done it over Twitter

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.990 
out you've never done it over Twitter
before<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:44.340> he<00:02:44.400> didn't<00:02:44.580> release<00:02:44.819> any

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
before but he didn't release any

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.110 
before but he didn't release any
information<00:02:45.239> just<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.989> two<00:02:46.170> model<00:02:46.590> numbers

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.330 

so<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.690> think<00:02:51.810> Mike<00:02:52.470> I'll<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.160> is

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
so and I think Mike I'll and is that is

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.559 
so and I think Mike I'll and is that is
that<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.640> millions<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.060> dollars<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.450> revenue

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
that it's millions of dollars of revenue

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.840 
that it's millions of dollars of revenue
because<00:02:54.930> when<00:02:55.260> they<00:02:55.410> don't<00:02:56.340> release<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
because when they don't release it to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.070 
because when they don't release it to
the<00:02:56.880> country<00:02:57.269> comes<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.690> over<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> black

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
the country comes in over the black

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.390 
the country comes in over the black
market<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:58.590> everyone<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:58.860> brings<00:02:59.160> them<00:02:59.280> in

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
market but everyone just brings them in

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.340 
market but everyone just brings them in
tentative<00:02:59.760> tax<00:03:00.090> money<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.870> all<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.260> know

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
tentative tax money and so all you know

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.380

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that that huge push it could be you know

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.120 
that that huge push it could be you know
millions<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.900> dollars<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.319> tax<00:03:04.500> revenue<00:03:04.769> that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
millions of dollars of tax revenue that

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.280 
millions of dollars of tax revenue that
they<00:03:05.340> lose<00:03:05.640> by<00:03:05.940> not<00:03:05.970> having<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.630> go<00:03:07.049> through

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
they lose by not having it go through

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.590 
they lose by not having it go through
legal<00:03:07.760> he's<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.209> get<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.390> come<00:03:09.420> to

the birthday party next year so but but

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.059 
the birthday party next year so but but
my<00:03:13.250> main<00:03:14.250> point<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:16.019> sounds<00:03:16.950> like

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
my main point is that sounds like

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.349 
my main point is that sounds like
there's<00:03:17.250> two<00:03:17.280> models<00:03:17.640> what<00:03:17.790> does<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.090> lend

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
there's two models what does that lend

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.120 
there's two models what does that lend
some<00:03:18.600> credence<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.049> idea<00:03:19.109> there's<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> 4.7

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
some credence to the idea there's a 4.7

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.380 
some credence to the idea there's a 4.7
and<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.280> 5.5<00:03:21.709> I'll<00:03:22.709> read<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.100> lot<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.519> 5.5<00:03:24.090> yeah

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
and a 5.5 I'll read a lot of 5.5 yeah

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.229 
and a 5.5 I'll read a lot of 5.5 yeah
meet<00:03:24.810> me<00:03:25.079> too<00:03:25.440> i'm<00:03:25.890> holding<00:03:26.640> off<00:03:26.730> but<00:03:27.090> i'm

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
meet me too i'm holding off but i'm

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.569 
meet me too i'm holding off but i'm
trying<00:03:27.450> not<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.079> let<00:03:28.200> my<00:03:28.350> enthusiasm<00:03:28.859> poison

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
trying not to let my enthusiasm poison

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.460 
trying not to let my enthusiasm poison
my<00:03:29.850> idea<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.450> what<00:03:30.870> Apple<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.200> going<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.380> be

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
my idea of what Apple is going to be

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.729 
my idea of what Apple is going to be
doing<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:32.400> would<00:03:32.579> be<00:03:33.359> as<00:03:33.630> much<00:03:34.260> as<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.560> looks

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
doing it would be as much as it looks

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.660 
doing it would be as much as it looks
like<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.959> 5s<00:03:36.959> size<00:03:37.440> screen<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.549> going

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
like the 5s size screen is kind of going

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.840 
like the 5s size screen is kind of going
out<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.390> seems<00:03:40.170> odd<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.500> Apple<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> finally<00:03:41.640> be

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
out it seems odd for Apple to finally be

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.640 
out it seems odd for Apple to finally be
saying<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.299> no<00:03:42.450> we're<00:03:42.630> not<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> making

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
saying that no we're not going to making

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.680 
saying that no we're not going to making
a<00:03:43.739> phone<00:03:43.980> with<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.220> narrow<00:03:44.370> screen<00:03:44.790> anymore<00:03:45.000> so

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
a phone with a narrow screen anymore so

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.960 
a phone with a narrow screen anymore so
if<00:03:46.079> if<00:03:46.739> they're<00:03:46.920> doing<00:03:47.220> two<00:03:47.400> different<00:03:47.670> models

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
if if they're doing two different models

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.280 
if if they're doing two different models
I<00:03:48.239> think<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:48.510> certainly<00:03:48.630> possible<00:03:48.989> that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
I think it's certainly possible that

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.500 
I think it's certainly possible that
they<00:03:50.100> won't<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.430> doing<00:03:50.549> just<00:03:50.880> as<00:03:51.000> simple<00:03:51.180> we're

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
they won't be doing just as simple we're

they won't be doing just as simple we're
making<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.840> 5's<00:03:52.230> new<00:03:52.260> $99<00:03:53.070> phone<00:03:53.310> it's

making the 5's new $99 phone it's

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.530 
making the 5's new $99 phone it's
possible<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.000> they're<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.390> actually

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
possible that they're going to actually

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.319 
possible that they're going to actually
be<00:03:54.690> doing<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:55.109> version<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> iphone<00:03:56.790> 6<00:03:57.090> that

have to charge my phone all day you know

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.000 
have to charge my phone all day you know
look<00:07:05.880> we<00:07:06.060> know<00:07:06.300> that<00:07:06.690> there<00:07:07.050> somewhere<00:07:07.740> there

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010 
look we know that there somewhere there

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.620 
look we know that there somewhere there
is<00:07:08.130> a<00:07:08.160> five<00:07:08.400> and<00:07:08.520> a<00:07:08.580> half<00:07:08.610> inch<00:07:08.820> iphone<00:07:09.240> that's

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
is a five and a half inch iphone that's

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.600 
is a five and a half inch iphone that's
not<00:07:09.840> a<00:07:09.870> question<00:07:10.080> if<00:07:11.070> they're<00:07:11.190> going<00:07:11.280> releases

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
not a question if they're going releases

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.730 
not a question if they're going releases
so<00:07:11.760> this<00:07:11.910> could<00:07:12.090> very<00:07:12.150> well<00:07:12.419> be<00:07:12.720> a<00:07:12.900> battery<00:07:13.470> for

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
so this could very well be a battery for

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.620 
so this could very well be a battery for
a<00:07:13.800> 5-inch<00:07:14.220> a<00:07:14.340> half<00:07:14.730> an<00:07:14.880> eye<00:07:15.030> on<00:07:15.060> that<00:07:15.330> does<00:07:15.480> not

a 5-inch a half an eye on that does not

a 5-inch a half an eye on that does not
in<00:07:15.870> any<00:07:15.990> way<00:07:16.080> indicate<00:07:16.410> it'll<00:07:17.130> be<00:07:17.250> released<00:07:17.610> in

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230 
in any way indicate it'll be released in

in any way indicate it'll be released in
two<00:07:19.230> weeks
