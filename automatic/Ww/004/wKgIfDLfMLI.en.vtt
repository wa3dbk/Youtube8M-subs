and otherwise I just have three
different<00:00:19.470> kinds<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.699> green<00:00:21.029> scraps<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.660> i

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
different kinds of green scraps that i

had<00:00:21.990> laying<00:00:22.199> around<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.949> brown<00:00:23.189> we're

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
had laying around and some brown we're

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.330 
had laying around and some brown we're
going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> make<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> tree<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.500> each<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.189> these

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
going to make a tree so each of these

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.300 
going to make a tree so each of these
scraps<00:00:27.240> will<00:00:27.480> be<00:00:27.630> part<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> tree<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> then

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
scraps will be part of the tree and then

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.160 
scraps will be part of the tree and then
brown<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.630> trunk<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.019> your

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
brown if you want a little trunk on your

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.010 
brown if you want a little trunk on your
tree<00:00:31.610> otherwise<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.210> decorate<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.870> tree

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
tree otherwise you can decorate the tree

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.870 
tree otherwise you can decorate the tree
with<00:00:34.350> some<00:00:34.680> buttons<00:00:35.010> from<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.430> button<00:00:35.700> jar

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
with some buttons from your button jar

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
with some buttons from your button jar
or<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.690> also<00:00:36.870> grabbed<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.469> stickers<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.100> in

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
or I also grabbed some stickers just in

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.090 
or I also grabbed some stickers just in
case<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.149> could<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.540> some<00:00:39.809> stars<00:00:40.739> or

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
case if I could use some stars or

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
case if I could use some stars or
snowflakes<00:00:41.610> or<00:00:41.879> whatever<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.300> want<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.809> my<00:00:42.870> tree

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
snowflakes or whatever I want on my tree

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.970 
snowflakes or whatever I want on my tree
and<00:00:44.059> you'll<00:00:45.059> need<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.629> shots<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.379> attach<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and you'll need some shots to attach the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.639 
and you'll need some shots to attach the
parts<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:47.550> tree<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.200> some<00:00:49.200> glue<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
parts of your tree and some glue and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.459 
parts of your tree and some glue and
scissors<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.640> think<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.030> about<00:00:51.210> it

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
scissors and I think that's about it

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.490 
scissors and I think that's about it
let's<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.680> ahead<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.129> started<00:00:54.230> all<00:00:55.230> we

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
let's go ahead and get started all we

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
let's go ahead and get started all we
have<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.100> our<00:00:56.280> green<00:00:56.550> scraps<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
have to do with our green scraps is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410 
have to do with our green scraps is
simply<00:00:58.260> make<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.800> few<00:00:59.100> triangles<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.030> our<00:01:00.120> tree

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
simply make a few triangles for our tree

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.049 
simply make a few triangles for our tree
and<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.469> easiest<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> think<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.789> grab

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and the easiest way I think is just grab

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.270 
and the easiest way I think is just grab
a<00:01:03.090> corner<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.769> snap<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
a corner like this and just snap it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.370 
a corner like this and just snap it
doesn't<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.119> perfect<00:01:06.720> there's<00:01:07.710> one

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
doesn't have to be perfect there's one

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
doesn't have to be perfect there's one
there's<00:01:10.380> maybe<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> second<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.390> my

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
there's maybe the second and my

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
there's maybe the second and my
triangles<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.159> perfect<00:01:14.369> at

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
triangles are not going to be perfect at

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.530 
triangles are not going to be perfect at
all<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.420> usually<00:01:15.780> cut<00:01:16.229> straight

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
all because I don't usually cut straight

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.789 
all because I don't usually cut straight
but<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.409> big<00:01:19.710> deal<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.530> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
but it's not a big deal so you can see I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.710 
but it's not a big deal so you can see I
have<00:01:22.979> my<00:01:23.130> scraps<00:01:23.610> all<00:01:23.880> we're<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
have my scraps all we're going to do is

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.010 
have my scraps all we're going to do is
stack<00:01:25.110> them<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:26.009> tree<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.299> so

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
stack them like a tree just like that so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830 
stack them like a tree just like that so
I<00:01:28.049> need<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:28.950> stem<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:30.390> trunk<00:01:30.600> for

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
I need a little stem a little trunk for

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.789 
I need a little stem a little trunk for
my<00:01:30.990> tree<00:01:32.180> simple<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
my tree simple just going to be a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.840 
my tree simple just going to be a
rectangle<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.759> cut<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:37.579> that's<00:01:38.579> going

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
rectangle to cut that out that's going

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.950 
rectangle to cut that out that's going
to<00:01:39.000> go<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.540> bottom<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.810> grab

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to go on the bottom first so just grab

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.039 
to go on the bottom first so just grab
our<00:01:43.259> glue<00:01:44.090> just<00:01:45.090> put<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> little<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> back

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
our glue just put a little in the back

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.149 
our glue just put a little in the back
there<00:01:47.810> let's<00:01:48.810> attach<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
there let's attach that right to the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.240 
there let's attach that right to the
front<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.460> our<00:01:50.610> card<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> middle<00:01:52.250> okay

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
front of our card in the middle okay

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.499 
front of our card in the middle okay
simple<00:01:54.470> now<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> other<00:01:56.820> parts<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.360> my
