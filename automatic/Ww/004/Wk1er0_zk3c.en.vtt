00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello everyone i'm joel your coach 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.040
 flat stomach I accompany you in the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.639
 videos on so the part the strap 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 abdominal 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.759
 we will first explain to you 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.299
 how to work the belt the strap 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.930
 abdominal 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.359
 so we'll start from the bottom where you have 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 here in the pelvic floor the floor 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.519
 pelvic who intervenes in we have 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.590
 the uterus for women the the bladder and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 of the rectum and so you have a must that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.059
 is called the perineum a muscle that you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.920
 will be able to work only in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.969
 contractor like for example you have 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.420
 an urgent desire to go to 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.340
 bathroom 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 you have contracted your muscles it's 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 what we will call the perineum 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.520
 after you have here the transverse the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.059
 transverse and the deepest muscle 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.410
 which fits on the back the vertebrae and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.199
 which goes down to the part 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.449
 pubic the transverse you go you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.440
 report when you and everyone 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.030
 have immediately a muscle 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 contract is this one 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 then the transverse we forget too much 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.460
 often in the in the work of the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.010
 abdominals while there is that he he 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.200
 have to work for keeping a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.750
 flat belly after the transfer I had 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
 the external and internal obliques which 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.070
 actually allow you to refine the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.330
 size and finally you have the big right 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.159
 so called layer 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.420
 superficial are the tablets of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.040
 chocolate that you see on some 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.200
 people these great rights 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 they actually allow the inflection of the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.659
 bust from top to bottom in our 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.329
 exercises we are going to work on 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 really focused from the bottom to the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.810
 high that is to say that in all 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 exercises you will have to contract 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.229
 the lower part and the perineum 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.000
 then the transverse then the cladding of the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.310
 sale as a whole and the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 contraction of the transverse will be done 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.149
 that by the expiration 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.310
 that is, you will have expired and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.290
 by expiring contracting the different 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.149
 muscles we just saw this is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.610
 important and that's the only thing to 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.509
 which will have to think about contracting and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.509
 tight the transverse
