00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
revenues it just doesn't make sense to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.380 
revenues it just doesn't make sense to
me<00:02:31.770> because<00:02:31.920> you're<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.580> really<00:02:32.880> gonna<00:02:33.180> be

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
me because you're not really gonna be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.060 
me because you're not really gonna be
making<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.900> much<00:02:34.080> money<00:02:34.290> off<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.710> this

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
making that much money off of this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.250 
making that much money off of this
you're<00:02:35.760> probably<00:02:36.140> sacrificing<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
you're probably sacrificing the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.170 
you're probably sacrificing the
potential<00:02:37.770> popularity<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:38.580> your<00:02:38.700> mod<00:02:38.880> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
potential popularity of your mod for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.750 
potential popularity of your mod for
like<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.570> slice<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.080> pizza<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.830> mean<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.550> think

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
like a slice of pizza I mean I I think

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.580 
like a slice of pizza I mean I I think
you'd<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.300> better<00:02:42.480> off<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.720> uploading<00:02:43.470> to

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you'd be better off just uploading to

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.320 
you'd be better off just uploading to
the<00:02:43.620> Nexus<00:02:44.100> for<00:02:44.280> free<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.180> know

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the Nexus for free and then you know

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.450 
the Nexus for free and then you know
asking<00:02:45.810> people<00:02:46.110> kindly<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.370> know

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
asking people kindly that's you know

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.300 
asking people kindly that's you know
donations<00:02:48.180> are<00:02:48.540> very<00:02:49.260> helpful<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
donations are very helpful to you and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.880 
donations are very helpful to you and
then<00:02:50.970> you'd<00:02:51.450> probably<00:02:51.780> make<00:02:52.230> more<00:02:52.470> money<00:02:52.650> off

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
then you'd probably make more money off

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.250 
then you'd probably make more money off
of<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.070> because<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.700> actually<00:02:54.060> gets<00:02:54.600> 100

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
of that because it actually gets 100

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.830 
of that because it actually gets 100
percent<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.340> cash<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.570> don't<00:02:57.750> really

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
percent of that cash so I don't really

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
percent of that cash so I don't really
know<00:02:58.110> why<00:02:58.380> I'm<00:02:58.650> coming<00:02:58.980> at<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.190> mod<00:02:59.340> authors

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
know why I'm coming at the mod authors

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.970 
know why I'm coming at the mod authors
right<00:02:59.910> now<00:03:00.090> really<00:03:01.050> I'm<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.230> furious<00:03:01.620> at

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
right now really I'm just furious at

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.670 
right now really I'm just furious at
valve<00:03:02.280> valve<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> business<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
valve valve is a business but this is a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.800 
valve valve is a business but this is a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
business and as far as a business

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.080 
business and as far as a business
standpoint<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.800> was<00:03:07.980> probably<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.700> correct

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
standpoint this was probably a correct

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.330 
standpoint this was probably a correct
decision<00:03:09.390> for<00:03:09.720> them<00:03:09.840> because<00:03:10.590> they<00:03:10.980> will<00:03:11.160> be

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
decision for them because they will be

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.430 
decision for them because they will be
making<00:03:11.490> lots<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.910> money<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.630> not<00:03:13.020> really

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
making lots of money for not really

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.650 
making lots of money for not really
having<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.160> much<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.670> businesses

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
having to do much at all businesses

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.990 
having to do much at all businesses
gonna<00:03:15.930> business<00:03:16.470> nom<00:03:16.770> sane<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.370> we<00:03:17.820> can't

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
really do anything about it

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.949 
really do anything about it
I<00:03:19.230> actually<00:03:19.709> thought<00:03:20.160> maybe<00:03:20.430> Robin<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.720> Dark

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
