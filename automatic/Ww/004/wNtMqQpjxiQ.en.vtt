00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.330
 when we talk about biometric systems 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.270
 we should always talk about the different 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.600
 processes that are required when 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.730
 we deal with the doctors I want 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.040
 let's make clear in all that brite three 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.350
 types of processes the process of 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.580
 enrollment the verification process 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.520
 and the identification process maybe of 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.440
 those differences depends on the cost of 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.500
 some of the readers that we're going to 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.020
 be able to use in our projects 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.330
 let's see it in the following graph 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.850
 at the top we see the process of 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.580
 enrolling this process of 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.700
 enrollment has to see simply 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:58.060
 with when the finger for example if it's a 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.309
 fingerprint reader will be recorded 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.650
 in the system then there is a reader 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.979
 that takes the mark and carries it 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.070
 directly to a database and the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.290
 database stores it from different 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.300
 forms can be the graphic part of the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.270
 footprint or it can be what we call a 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.820
 template or some specific elements 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.340
 Fingerprint 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.050
 this happens for equipment that can be 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 of identification or verification 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.660
 what does an element or a reader mean 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 that work under a control system 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.200
 verification access means that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.770
 I must place the footprint but also 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 I must put some other data to locate 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.560
 Where is my mark so that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 another data is almost always a key 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.220
 alphanumeric or numerical or sometimes a 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.290
 proximity reader with which I 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.240
 I have an assigned number and with that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.990
 assigned number or the key that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.020
 we mentioned I'm going to the database as 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.860
 the fingerprint associated with that number 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.670
 and I bring it to my reader and it's the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.100
 reader that compares the footprint that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.040
 is at that moment on my finger with the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.540
 that we brought from the database by 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.790
 So everything that the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.000
 reading is simply a process of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.910
 Verification comparison between two 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.239
 fingerprints and if with the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.319
 comparison is real because the person says 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.200
 what is 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.569
 with your finger in the reader where it says 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.409
 be and surely you are guaranteed 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.200
 will guarantee access if by 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.989
 otherwise the comparison is negative 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.989
 it is simply rejected here the subject is 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.269
 of time it takes very little time in 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.049
 go and look for a fingerprint and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.739
 compare one now that it's a process 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.319
 of identification when I'm in a 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.180
 ID reader then what 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.870
 What I do is that he placed his finger on the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.930
 reader 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.959
 the reader itself and all the hardware 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.709
 inside the reader they go and look in the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.470
 one-to-one database and compare my 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.989
 fingerprint with all fingerprints 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.180
 digitals that are in the database and 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.780
 normally that process obviously 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.480
 it takes much longer when the base of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.329
 data of all users is small 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.970
 an identification process is quite 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.730
 viable when the database is 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.489
 quite large for example more than a thousand 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.910
 1500 people and I know places that 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.920
 have 50 60 thousand users surely a 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.160
 identification process will take 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.129
 quite then in that case we make a 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.680
 verification process for 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.510
 readers of verification processes that 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.849
 are the most used in the subject 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.579
 of electronic security there are standards 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.250
 and for the readers who do the process 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.530
 of identification that is used most to 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.140
 legal level of registration 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.410
 judicial elements there is another standard 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.830
 physics is the difference between the two 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.959
 types of readers so you have in 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.600
 tell what kind of process you want 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.930
 implement in your control system 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.240
 biometric access I speak German 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.400
