00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.330
 well that the jeans is ok for a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.110
 new live like that yes 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.570
 and this time for a tutorial for 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 join my minecraft server because 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
 that there are still people who 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.620
 ask how to book so I 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.909
 am told why not a little video 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 a little train not very fast for 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.949
 you show it useful so it's like 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 already said that is very fast it is very 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.460
 easy so fishing already first it takes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.530
 that you download to machine 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.920
 I will not explain how does this 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:10.820
 simple you type on google you 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.680
 type hamachi but anyway that's it 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.720
 and then there you have different site 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.610
 to download hamas hamachi it's 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:23.000
 free so that's after you go a 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.880
 good jelly upstream because I'm 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.290
 German is where 1 but at home it's 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.509
 in French but that gives does not have the 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:35.320
 same thing you go in love 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:39.080
 resources and then after joining a 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.100
 already existing jump it must be something 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.320
 like that in French and after you 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.720
 type life gaming so the server name 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.890
 in these cases it is life itself 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.490
 server with the lg and the s in uppercase 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.500
 and the password is exactly the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.360
 same thing that you copy that you the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.200
 put here and then you do it 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.200
 after you joined that 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.530
 good for now it's just going 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.020
 have a 3 2 places 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.630
 well there just in what a because I do not 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.360
 rejoin this is still beast which 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.850
 I'm going myself I was one of the stuff 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.990
 but I will do after so there is 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.940
 not much room for now 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.650
 but I think I had to do 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.680
 some changes for lovers all 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.650
 that's not wait, we're going right now 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.290

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.660
 it was done there is still a little trick 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.480
 on the game to do and then here we go 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.550

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.550
 a real time after you go in the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.230
 multiplayer you go from a new 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:03.800
 server after you type the name of the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:10.250

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.270

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.640

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:02.890
 we must not forget that the server and 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:05.740
 one in the minecraft version 1.3.2 and if 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.530
 you are already in another version 1 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:21.070
 you go into a leu minecraft version 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:23.890
 clean john and finally good I do not know 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.730
 until where did you follow in what but there 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.820
 had a big bug 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.380
 good brief then 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.360
 I do not know where to where 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:36.000
 have followed but in any case it is necessary 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.690
 minecraft have it work 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.790

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.150
 just went on google and type 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:50.370
 minecraft version ginger so changed and 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.350
 then after you can exchange the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.990
 versions as you want by clicking 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.940
 on a button and like that if you want 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.760
 for example join the server that is 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.820
 at 1.3 for 1.2 but against 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.360
 normally you play in 1.4 or I know 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.340
 not you can simply click 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.860
 on a button to change so does that 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.900
