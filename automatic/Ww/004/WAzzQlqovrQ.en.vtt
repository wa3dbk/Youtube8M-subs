00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
what the difference is between these two

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.079 
what the difference is between these two
devices<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:12.559> exterior<00:00:13.820> there<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> not

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
devices so on the exterior there is not

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.490 
devices so on the exterior there is not
much<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.509> difference<00:00:18.109> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
much of a difference you can see that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.589 
much of a difference you can see that
the<00:00:20.130> left<00:00:20.580> hand<00:00:20.820> side<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.779> bottom<00:00:26.359> the<00:00:27.359> right

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
the left hand side the bottom the right

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.339 
the left hand side the bottom the right
side<00:00:28.340> they're<00:00:29.340> all<00:00:29.460> practically<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> same<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
side they're all practically the same so

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.179 
side they're all practically the same so
you're<00:00:31.470> trying<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.769> much<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you're trying to have much of a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.030 
you're trying to have much of a
difference<00:00:33.350> when<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.410> comes<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
difference when it comes to the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.350 
difference when it comes to the
exteriors<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.180> let<00:00:36.390> me<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:37.500> inside<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.360> show

you what the real difference is so first
of<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> double<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> RAM<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
of all that is a double the RAM in a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.779 
of all that is a double the RAM in a
6,000<00:00:45.300> plus<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.379> let<00:00:47.010> me<00:00:47.160> show<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> device

there is not much difference between

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.740 
there is not much difference between
both<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:36.780> devices<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:38.270> let<00:01:39.270> me<00:01:39.299> go<00:01:39.720> ahead

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
both these devices so let me go ahead

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.330 
both these devices so let me go ahead
and<00:01:40.290> click<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> picture<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and click a picture so I'm going to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.630 
and click a picture so I'm going to
click<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.759> picture<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:46.649> remote<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
click a picture of this remote here so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.359 
click a picture of this remote here so
it's<00:01:47.790> got<00:01:48.000> four<00:01:48.450> different<00:01:48.840> colors<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.920> it's

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it's got four different colors so it's

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.350 
it's got four different colors so it's
kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:50.970> easy<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.860> show<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.299> how<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
kind of very easy to show you how the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.039 
kind of very easy to show you how the
device<00:01:54.869> treats<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.500> colors<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:57.049> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
device treats the colors there so you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539 
device treats the colors there so you
can<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.710> am<00:01:58.920> clicking<00:01:59.100> both<00:01:59.430> these

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
can see that I am clicking both these

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.050 
can see that I am clicking both these
pictures<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.299> same<00:02:00.570> light<00:02:01.560> conditions

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.750 

let<00:02:08.060> me<00:02:08.270> open<00:02:08.479> up<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.950> terms<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.460> color

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
let me open up so in terms of color

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.570 
let me open up so in terms of color
reproduction<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:15.580> find<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:17.060> slight<00:02:18.580> improvement

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
reproduction I find a slight improvement

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.990 
reproduction I find a slight improvement
with<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> a6000<00:02:21.400> maybe<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.640> screen<00:02:22.880> is

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
with the a6000 maybe the screen is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.470 
with the a6000 maybe the screen is
warmer<00:02:23.630> here<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.800> screen<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.190> cold<00:02:25.820> you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
warmer here and the screen is cold you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.020 
warmer here and the screen is cold you
can<00:02:26.630> see<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.840> slightly<00:02:27.560> bluish<00:02:28.490> share<00:02:28.880> it

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
can see that slightly bluish share it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.240 
can see that slightly bluish share it
means<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.420> screen<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.780> cold<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:31.100> white

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
means the screen is cold and the white

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.730 
means the screen is cold and the white
is<00:02:31.280> slightly<00:02:31.700> warmer<00:02:32.240> there<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.110> maybe<00:02:33.560> the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
is slightly warmer there so maybe the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.310 
is slightly warmer there so maybe the
reason<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.100> but<00:02:34.670> otherwise<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:36.020> color

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
reason is that but otherwise the color

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.910 
reason is that but otherwise the color
reproduction<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:38.080> marginally<00:02:39.080> better<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.770> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
reproduction is marginally better in the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.730 
reproduction is marginally better in the
a6000<00:02:40.580> plus<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.770> can<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.520> details

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
a6000 plus and you can see the details

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.370 
a6000 plus and you can see the details
which<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:46.280> camera<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.820> able<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.330> show<00:02:47.959> here<00:02:48.200> so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
which the camera is able to show here so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.230 
which the camera is able to show here so
I<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.620> have<00:02:49.100> zoomed<00:02:49.400> in<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> maximum<00:02:50.090> level

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
I I have zoomed in to the maximum level

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.180 
I I have zoomed in to the maximum level
here<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.930> can<00:02:51.110> still<00:02:51.290> see<00:02:51.590> very<00:02:51.860> clearly

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
here and I can still see very clearly

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.270 
here and I can still see very clearly
the<00:02:53.090> dust<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.570> also<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.260> edges<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
the dust and also the edges of the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.030 
the dust and also the edges of the
images<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.970> very<00:02:56.660> clear<00:02:56.990> here<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.950> pretty

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
images is very clear here so it's pretty

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.590 
images is very clear here so it's pretty
impressive<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.770> yeah<00:03:00.770> let<00:03:01.070> me<00:03:01.360> let<00:03:02.360> me<00:03:02.450> take<00:03:02.570> a

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
impressive and yeah let me let me take a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.500 
impressive and yeah let me let me take a
selfie<00:03:02.840> now<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:06.140> was<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:07.390> picture<00:03:08.390> from

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
selfie now so that was the picture from

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.860 
selfie now so that was the picture from
the<00:03:08.630> front<00:03:08.870> facing<00:03:09.200> camera<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.120> swim<00:03:14.690> in

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
the front facing camera so I can swim in

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.410 
the front facing camera so I can swim in
really<00:03:15.739> well<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:17.620> again<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:19.130> see<00:03:19.550> a<00:03:19.820> better

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
really well and again I see a better

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.890 
really well and again I see a better
performance<00:03:20.959> with<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.640> a6000<00:03:22.640> plus<00:03:22.940> so<00:03:23.840> you

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
performance with the a6000 plus so you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.370 
performance with the a6000 plus so you
can<00:03:24.110> see<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.440> edges<00:03:24.620> are<00:03:24.860> really<00:03:25.190> sharper<00:03:27.100> and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
can see the edges are really sharper and

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.120 
can see the edges are really sharper and
the<00:03:30.380> skinless<00:03:32.290> details<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.470> skin<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:33.920> much

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
the skinless details of the skin is much

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.050 
the skinless details of the skin is much
better<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:36.350> a6000<00:03:37.220> compared<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.850> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
better in the a6000 compared to the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.990 
better in the a6000 compared to the
a6000<00:03:38.900> plus<00:03:39.280> okay<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:42.530> was<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.670> normal

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
a6000 plus okay so that was the normal

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.740 
a6000 plus okay so that was the normal
mode<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.480> let<00:03:44.630> me<00:03:44.780> try<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.080> in<00:03:45.230> HDR<00:03:45.590> mode<00:03:45.680> now<00:03:52.750> so

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
mode so let me try it in HDR mode now so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.640 
mode so let me try it in HDR mode now so
this<00:03:54.110> one<00:03:54.320> is<00:03:54.470> he<00:03:54.590> gay<00:03:54.680> 6,000<00:03:55.280> plus<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:56.650> this

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
this one is he gay 6,000 plus and this

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.800 
this one is he gay 6,000 plus and this
is<00:03:57.860> how<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.100> HDR<00:03:58.519> image<00:03:58.940> looks<00:03:59.450> like<00:04:00.370> spit

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
is how the HDR image looks like spit

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.180 
is how the HDR image looks like spit
dark<00:04:02.810> at<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:04.239> background<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.739> bit

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
dark at the background and it's a bit

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.240 
dark at the background and it's a bit
unnatural<00:04:07.549> so<00:04:08.239> let<00:04:08.480> me<00:04:08.510> see<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:08.959> how<00:04:09.250> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
unnatural so let me see you how the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.030 
unnatural so let me see you how the
a6000<00:04:11.180> has<00:04:11.360> done

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
a6000 has done

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.330 
a6000 has done
the<00:04:14.040> HDR<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:15.360> really<00:04:15.600> bad<00:04:15.950> at<00:04:16.950> least<00:04:17.190> I

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the HDR so it's really bad at least I

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.040 
the HDR so it's really bad at least I
can<00:04:17.400> accept<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.959> quality<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.590> a6000<00:04:20.190> plus

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
can accept the quality in the a6000 plus

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.450 
can accept the quality in the a6000 plus
but<00:04:22.050> here<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:22.560> really<00:04:22.860> about<00:04:22.920> it<00:04:23.160> looking

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
but here it's really about it looking

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.420 
but here it's really about it looking
very<00:04:23.670> unnatural<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.420> me<00:04:25.010> okay<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.190> being

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
very unnatural to me okay that being

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.720 
very unnatural to me okay that being
said<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.030> we<00:04:27.660> can<00:04:27.810> see<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.550> marginally<00:04:29.550> there

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
said so we can see that marginally there

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.580 
said so we can see that marginally there
is<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.850> better<00:04:30.060> performance<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.900> camera<00:04:31.290> of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
is a better performance in the camera of

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.730 
is a better performance in the camera of
the<00:04:32.150> a6000<00:04:33.150> plus<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.170> really<00:04:34.620> don't

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
the a6000 plus so I really don't

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.930 
the a6000 plus so I really don't
understand<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.250> reason<00:04:35.520> for<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.820> because

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
understand the reason for it because

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.940 
understand the reason for it because
they<00:04:36.750> will<00:04:36.900> have<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:38.010> same<00:04:38.250> sensor<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:39.030> same

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
they will have the same sensor the same

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.720 
they will have the same sensor the same
processor<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.190> everything<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.700> same

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
processor and everything is the same

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.600 
processor and everything is the same
except<00:04:42.690> for<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.110> ramming<00:04:43.590> RAM<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
except for the ramming RAM and the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.060 
except for the ramming RAM and the
internal<00:04:45.000> storage<00:04:45.360> but<00:04:45.930> does<00:04:46.230> Ram<00:04:46.560> give<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.040> a

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
internal storage but does Ram give you a

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.860 
internal storage but does Ram give you a
better<00:04:47.340> camera<00:04:47.670> performance<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.420> am<00:04:48.510> Not<00:04:48.840> sure

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
better camera performance I am Not sure

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.230 
better camera performance I am Not sure
so<00:04:49.380> there<00:04:49.590> could<00:04:49.740> be<00:04:49.770> something<00:04:50.550> which<00:04:51.060> has

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
so there could be something which has

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.620 
so there could be something which has
changed<00:04:51.690> with<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.500> a6000<00:04:53.280> in<00:04:53.520> na<00:04:53.970> 6,000<00:04:54.480> plus

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
changed with this a6000 in na 6,000 plus

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.620 
changed with this a6000 in na 6,000 plus
internally<00:04:55.380> but<00:04:55.980> which<00:04:56.790> is<00:04:56.910> not<00:04:57.090> clear<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.600> us

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
internally but which is not clear to us

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.900 
internally but which is not clear to us
at<00:04:57.990> this<00:04:58.140> moment<00:04:58.350> but<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.710> think<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.430> believe

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
at this moment but I think I believe

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.240 
at this moment but I think I believe
that<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.450> a6000<00:05:01.140> is<00:05:01.290> a<00:05:01.350> much<00:05:01.650> better<00:05:01.680> device

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
that the a6000 is a much better device

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.140 
that the a6000 is a much better device
to<00:05:03.000> buy<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.480> own<00:05:03.840> at<00:05:04.400> 7500<00:05:05.400> rupee<00:05:05.670> so<00:05:05.910> the

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
to buy and own at 7500 rupee so the

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.570 
to buy and own at 7500 rupee so the
a6000<00:05:06.930> will<00:05:07.080> still<00:05:07.380> be<00:05:07.560> sold<00:05:07.890> in<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.190> market

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
a6000 will still be sold in the market
