been nearly as ineffective and I call it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.520 
been nearly as ineffective and I call it
steam<00:02:17.000> because<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:17.510> not<00:02:17.660> late<00:02:17.930> shop<00:02:18.290> money

there seems to be a lot of confusion as

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.660 
there seems to be a lot of confusion as

chasing<00:02:25.700> going<00:02:25.910> on<00:02:26.030> out<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.870> really

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
chasing going on out there you really

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.230 
chasing going on out there you really
want<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.380> sharp<00:02:27.680> moves<00:02:27.970> mostly<00:02:28.970> girls<00:02:29.030> get

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
want the sharp moves mostly girls get

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.240 
want the sharp moves mostly girls get
made<00:02:29.420> early<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> week<00:02:30.080> that's<00:02:31.010> where<00:02:31.160> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
made early in the week that's where the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.520 
made early in the week that's where the
value<00:02:31.460> seems<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.240> be<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.420> strongest<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.410> lot

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
value seems to be the strongest in a lot

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.720 
value seems to be the strongest in a lot
of<00:02:33.620> cases<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.130> think<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.370> was<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.520> case

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
of cases and I think that was the case

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.130 
of cases and I think that was the case
here<00:02:35.030> because<00:02:35.210> there<00:02:35.360> was<00:02:35.510> some<00:02:35.720> seven<00:02:36.050> out

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
here because there was some seven out

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.840 
here because there was some seven out
there<00:02:36.320> with<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.500> Bears<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:36.980> don't<00:02:37.640> think<00:02:37.670> it's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
there with the Bears I don't think it's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.090 
there with the Bears I don't think it's
going<00:02:38.030> back<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.050> six<00:02:39.620> six<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.070> half

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
going back to that so six six and a half

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.760 
going back to that so six six and a half
good<00:02:40.850> enough<00:02:40.970> it'll<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.690> be<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.410> think

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
good enough it'll have to be I think

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.650 
good enough it'll have to be I think
this<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.190> game<00:02:43.430> where<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.240> match<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
this is a game where if you match the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.530 
this is a game where if you match the
team's<00:02:44.900> up<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:46.010> Bears<00:02:46.250> should<00:02:46.850> be<00:02:47.090> able<00:02:47.270> to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
team's up the Bears should be able to

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.870 
team's up the Bears should be able to
give<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.780> Patriots<00:02:47.960> some<00:02:48.800> problems<00:02:49.220> and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
give the Patriots some problems and

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.790 
give the Patriots some problems and
while<00:02:50.570> New<00:02:50.750> England's<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.140> better<00:02:51.380> football

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
while New England's the better football

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.340 
while New England's the better football
team<00:02:51.830> it's<00:02:52.220> not<00:02:52.430> by<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:53.030> large<00:02:53.690> amount<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.140> think

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
team it's not by a large amount I think

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.570 
team it's not by a large amount I think
you're<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:54.650> getting<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.130> little<00:02:55.310> value

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
you're actually getting a little value

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.010 
you're actually getting a little value
in<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.850> number<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.270> because<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.600> how<00:02:56.690> bad

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
in the number just because of how bad

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.750 
in the number just because of how bad
the<00:02:57.230> Bears<00:02:57.440> were<00:02:57.680> last<00:02:58.340> week<00:02:58.460> and<00:02:58.700> the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
the Bears were last week and the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.310 
the Bears were last week and the
Patriots<00:02:59.180> seem<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.780> put<00:03:00.020> all<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.260> stuff

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
Patriots seem to put all that stuff

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.380 
Patriots seem to put all that stuff
about<00:03:00.620> them<00:03:00.980> being<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.850> at<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.060> end<00:03:02.090> of

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
about them being you know at the end of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.800 
about them being you know at the end of
the<00:03:02.510> era<00:03:03.020> that<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:04.040> seems<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.810> washed

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
the era that that seems to be washed

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.450 
the era that that seems to be washed
away<00:03:05.960> at<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.320> point<00:03:06.590> they're<00:03:06.980> on<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.130> winning

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
away at this point they're on a winning

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.850 
away at this point they're on a winning
streak<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:09.410> know<00:03:09.530> they're<00:03:09.680> probably

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
streak and you know they're probably

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.020 
streak and you know they're probably
going<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.130> win<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.310> division<00:03:10.430> by<00:03:10.760> two<00:03:10.820> or

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
going to win the division by two or

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.220 
going to win the division by two or
three<00:03:11.240> games<00:03:11.480> that's<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.960> way<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.170> goes

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
three games that's just the way it goes

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.870 
three games that's just the way it goes
anyway<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:13.130> don't<00:03:13.310> think<00:03:13.520> they<00:03:13.580> don't<00:03:13.640> win<00:03:13.790> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
anyway I don't think they don't win the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.180 
anyway I don't think they don't win the
Super<00:03:14.060> Bowl<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:14.480> there's<00:03:15.320> still<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.770> good<00:03:15.890> team

it's probably going to be real close at

it's probably going to be real close at
