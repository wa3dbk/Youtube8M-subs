00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
don't know if you can see the little

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
don't know if you can see the little
site<00:00:29.490> down<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> end<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:32.300> just<00:00:33.300> put<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.750> on

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
site down at the end I just put that on

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
site down at the end I just put that on
there<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:35.100> nice<00:00:35.250> water<00:00:35.670> gun<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
there it's a really nice water gun I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.130 
there it's a really nice water gun I
like<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> lot<00:00:37.290> shoots<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.739> 25<00:00:38.280> feet<00:00:38.579> and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
like it a lot shoots up 25 feet and

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.750 
like it a lot shoots up 25 feet and
because<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.620> nice<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:40.980> firing<00:00:41.550> hole<00:00:41.730> I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
because it's a nice little firing hole I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.130 
because it's a nice little firing hole I
mean<00:00:41.940> maybe<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> could<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.960> bigger

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
mean maybe it could be a little bigger

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.590 
mean maybe it could be a little bigger
but<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.649> might<00:00:43.850> reduce<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.210> feet<00:00:45.420> it's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
but then that might reduce on feet it's

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
but then that might reduce on feet it's
got<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> nice<00:00:46.079> pump<00:00:46.440> feature<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:47.160> here

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
got it a nice pump feature right here

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.020 
got it a nice pump feature right here
boom<00:00:48.360> shoots<00:00:49.260> nicely<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.670> actually<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
boom shoots nicely it's just actually a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.340 
boom shoots nicely it's just actually a
pretty<00:00:51.210> big<00:00:51.300> stream<00:00:51.780> which<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.140> probably

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
pretty big stream which you can probably

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
pretty big stream which you can probably
get<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.860> somebody<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:54.030> here

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
get like somebody all the way right here

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.290 
get like somebody all the way right here
and<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> adjust

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and so on and then it's got the adjust

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900 
and so on and then it's got the adjust
the<00:00:57.870> adjustable<00:00:58.410> stock<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.670> make<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the adjustable stock so you can make it

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.270 
the adjustable stock so you can make it
as<00:00:59.969> long<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.420> want

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.370 

there<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.570> then<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.810> look<00:01:07.020> down<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.070 
there you go then I just look down this
site<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.020> guess

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
site and it's got this little I guess

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.330 
site and it's got this little I guess
like<00:01:11.450> thing<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.200> end<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.650> makes<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.189> look

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
like thing on the end that makes it look

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.730 
like thing on the end that makes it look
like<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.720> actual<00:01:15.979> site<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.990> only<00:01:19.530> thing<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
like a actual site the only thing I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
like a actual site the only thing I
don't<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.100> said<00:01:20.430> mine<00:01:20.670> came<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.450> some

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
don't like I said mine came with some

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.800 
don't like I said mine came with some
scratches<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.500> site<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.479> really<00:01:24.479> doesn't

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
scratches on my site but really doesn't

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.060 
scratches on my site but really doesn't
matter<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:28.470> even<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
matter you know I mean even if the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.520 
matter you know I mean even if the
plastic<00:01:29.880> lens<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> end<00:01:31.049> came<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
plastic lens on the end came down I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.310 
plastic lens on the end came down I
could<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.540> narrow<00:01:33.540> down<00:01:33.840> site

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
could just use it as a narrow down site

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.679 
could just use it as a narrow down site
so<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.670> doesn't<00:01:35.880> matter<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.270> scope<00:01:36.540> I

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so it really doesn't matter the scope I

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.300 
so it really doesn't matter the scope I
like<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.009> adds<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
like a lot because it just adds that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
like a lot because it just adds that
extra<00:01:38.549> gun<00:01:39.000> feel<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.540> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
extra gun feel to it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
extra gun feel to it
and<00:01:40.430> then<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:42.090> makes<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.540> nice<00:01:42.689> um<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and then it makes a nice um it's a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.660 
and then it makes a nice um it's a
really<00:01:44.759> nice<00:01:44.939> gun<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.140> 420<00:01:46.799> 99<00:01:47.369> off

to<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.879> old<00:03:01.530> Super<00:03:02.530> Soaker<00:03:02.739> string<00:03:04.530> caps<00:03:05.530> with

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
to the old Super Soaker string caps with

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.280 
to the old Super Soaker string caps with
the<00:03:05.950> little<00:03:06.280> thing<00:03:06.519> on<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.670> end

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
the little thing on the end

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.680 
the little thing on the end
personally<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.319> like<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.150> even<00:03:10.150> though<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.299> did

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
personally I like that even though I did

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.000 
personally I like that even though I did
like<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.079> ones<00:03:11.290> where<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.530> could<00:03:11.680> just<00:03:11.709> push

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
like the ones where you could just push

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.110 
like the ones where you could just push
down<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.819> still<00:03:13.329> this<00:03:13.629> one<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.019> great<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
down but still this one is great and I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.430 
down but still this one is great and I
guess<00:03:16.299> there's<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.599> little<00:03:16.840> hole<00:03:17.140> right<00:03:17.170> here

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
guess there's a little hole right here

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.280 
guess there's a little hole right here
to<00:03:17.889> put<00:03:18.069> in<00:03:18.160> maybe<00:03:18.700> hose<00:03:19.000> water<00:03:19.299> from<00:03:19.569> there<00:03:19.750> so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
to put in maybe hose water from there so

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.509 
to put in maybe hose water from there so
you<00:03:20.349> don't<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.650> unscrew<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:20.980> cap<00:03:21.220> and

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
you don't have to unscrew the cap and

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.240 
you don't have to unscrew the cap and
the<00:03:22.150> stock<00:03:22.450> comes<00:03:22.780> off<00:03:22.989> if<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.590> slide

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
the stock comes off if you just slide

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.830 
the stock comes off if you just slide
down<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.609> little<00:03:24.880> thing<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.450> Recon

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
down this little thing like on the Recon

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.240

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
stock the stock pulls off and you could

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.509 
stock the stock pulls off and you could
just<00:03:30.400> put<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.549> back<00:03:30.730> on<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.150> just<00:03:34.500> and
