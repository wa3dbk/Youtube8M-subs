the video to be performed but typically
the<00:01:09.570> room<00:01:09.780> lights<00:01:10.049> should<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:11.150> similarly

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the room lights should be down similarly

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.649 
the room lights should be down similarly
the<00:01:12.900> slit<00:01:13.290> beam<00:01:13.560> should<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.189> short<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the slit beam should be short so that it

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.560 
the slit beam should be short so that it
does<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:16.020> shine<00:01:16.470> into<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.390> constrict<00:01:18.390> the
