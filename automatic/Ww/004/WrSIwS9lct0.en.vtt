was<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> bar<00:01:56.070> brawl<00:01:56.310> which<00:01:56.760> that<00:01:57.690> sounds<00:01:58.049> like

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
was a bar brawl which that sounds like

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.590 
was a bar brawl which that sounds like
combat<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.650> me<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:58.979> whatever<00:01:59.420> second<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.510> was

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
