 before posts she this sprint that is going to be 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.320
 extremely tense teams and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.880

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.230
 will be complicated to go up 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.830
 peter sagan who is well here in the fourth 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.480
 position 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.700
 twice second in both 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 last steps he has not yet lifted 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.979
 astana training 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.369
 the moment we do not see alexander 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.050
 kristoff where located 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.940
 alexander kristoff that's surprising 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.680
 not to have for the moment the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.690
 Norwegian runner at the outposts of the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.890

 go go there from all sides 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.450
 placed in the second position even 10 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.930
 sprint is thrown guardi in first 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.180

 adobe the gordini she will be beaten 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.150
 nooks of the team argues a brain 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.850
 is that goes back to third position 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.100
 maybe fornin Serbian olic is still 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.409
 once a surprise victory a 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.630
 runner that was not necessarily expected 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.060
 sprinter of the bora argon formation 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.459
 we will stay patient before you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.930
 give the identity of this runner what 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.910
 is safe cédric is we have not seen 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.700
 alexander kristoff in this final 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.580

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.470
 especially her bennett tits this is her 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 melee that is needed in so that's true 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.370
 that it is surprising not to have seen 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.570
 alexander kristoff not only do 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.190
 the sprint elite and not place then 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.820
 did he have a small incident 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.430
 mechanical 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.950
 always is it that this situation has 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.810
 makes the happiness of this training 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.489
 bora 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.680
 and win 1 confirmation watch from 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.450
 sam bennett net and without burr and we 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.220
 got too early too fast 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.870
 wins for sagan we started his sprint 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.730
 Too much favorable wind 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.010
 did this thought just now 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.180
 and it's true that when you have a wind 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.440
 unfavorable on the aspect that it takes 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.400
 often wait until the last moment for 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.319
 uncork 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.900
 so it seems easy in practice 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.030
 watch the joy of sam bennett guardi 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.310
 league 2 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.350
 too far too and all in power 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.730
 and bouali that goes back well in cedrika 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.319
 who will seek a place of honor the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.319
 third - 11th 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.700
 it's guarini who throws a little early peter 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.720
 sagan who lacked power 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.110
 and then sam bennett comes out in front of everything 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.180
 the world 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.160
 madam start no longer have any in 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.940
