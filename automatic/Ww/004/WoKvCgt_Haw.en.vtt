00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.850
 now I will be uploaded in your letter 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.799
 a new negative I'm in to replace and 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.570
 there are no planes nor the goalie is 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:16.480
 exactly here there are people who kill themselves 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.840
 no more life and there are not even credits 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.840
 for 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.110
 in the caballito hunt 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.110
 they do not kill much 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.820
 in the hunt about a mortal enemy 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.420
 but they do not kill you but they do not kill this either 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.420
 many more planes nothing more 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:52.420
 depends is that there are days that I play with 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.420
 monitor turned off and with one hand 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.620
 good 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.430
 with one hand we recommend doing nothing 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.310
 things do not go well 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.070
 the disc of someone who 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.070
 it is better to try ironic 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.110
 it's the quiet Chilean that I give you 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.680
 I offer coverage 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.670
 where I am here and right in front of you 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.880

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.630
 Relief think you have discovered ten 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.630
 watch out 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.040

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.530
 shoot the wheel of the heights 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.310
 fired 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 It does not work , it's useless 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.670

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.940
 here thank you I have to look for a 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:16.990
 position for the sniper 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:16.990
 damn the rules of the back 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.560
 the notes are putting us shit 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.739
 in front and could not see anything 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.810
 so you can buy yourself now I have to 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.810
 get up and they'll kill me damn 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.459

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.130
 I'm going to see if he kills a few 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.610
 here we have a tank and in front 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.050

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.980

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.980
 in a city ​​it does not come out 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.360
 d 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.770
 I have discovered 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.500
 answer 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.360
 I am what is technically called a 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.600
 human mushroom 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.640
 damn be blood caught a tanker 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.270
 I'm calm, I'm in charge of driving 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.270
 the gunner 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.160
 but when you have to go to the bar the end 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:27.520
 whenever I sniper campaign 2 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.260
 care ahead there are people 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.720
 they are shooting us we had written 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.950
 give in immediately shit crashing 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.280
 with some 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.280
 get out of there 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.270
 do not 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.980
 what 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.670
 I have to get used to playing with 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.560
 gas 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.570
 fraps since there is a fall of fram 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.280
 it's important maybe you have to 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:00.060
 modify the resolution not 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.160
 wait you have also dug with fraps 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.160
 I think he looks at this guy 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.860
 received I will take care of that clear guy 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.390
 I am a doctor 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.390
 since the son of little is thrown 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.980

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.260

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.350
 finished 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.310
 you will not die in my land 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.830
 I will not do it 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.200
 It's worth all up shooting those kids 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.030
 I've saved a whole squad 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.490
 here you have a boat came 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.100
 it may well be that we have lost the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.540
 departure 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.540
 but the most peptides 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.810
 because we have lost the most 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.949
 lost dignity 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.949
 do not say those things 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.590
 I have been raped until dawn 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.590
 the dead end 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 but you no longer feel it as a horse 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:34.330
 my body is used to all those 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.240
 tortures for violin actions 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.289
 violin action that's that they sell you a 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.289
 violin in the ass 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.400
 a violoncello would say chau in June a 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.400
 cello 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.980
 just something like shit 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.760

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.760
 your ass and it comes out of your mouth 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.430
 careful let's go to the lady pancho peak and 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.199
 there are good killers I think I'm going to 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.590
 stop recording this is being 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.100
 going from dark brown 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.100
