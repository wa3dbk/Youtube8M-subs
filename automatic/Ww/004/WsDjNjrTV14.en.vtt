00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.259 
okay so here's Game two against allies
and<00:00:04.580> the<00:00:05.580> opening<00:00:05.940> hand<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.960> draw<00:00:07.230> isn't

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
and the opening hand on the draw isn't

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.080 
and the opening hand on the draw isn't
phenomenal<00:00:09.950> but<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.099> gives<00:00:11.250> us<00:00:11.429> access<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.849> all

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
phenomenal but it gives us access to all

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.089 
phenomenal but it gives us access to all
our<00:00:12.240> colors<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.840> death<00:00:13.019> mark<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.500> Jace<00:00:13.920> is

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
our colors to death mark and Jace is

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.700 
our colors to death mark and Jace is
actually<00:00:14.490> better<00:00:14.670> than<00:00:14.969> you'd<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:15.809> against

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
actually better than you'd think against

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.769 
actually better than you'd think against
allies<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.310> you're<00:00:17.460> able<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.270> keep<00:00:18.510> them<00:00:18.750> from

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
allies if you're able to keep them from

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.500 
allies if you're able to keep them from
getting<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.460> blazingly<00:00:20.460> quick<00:00:20.850> starting<00:00:21.359> can

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
getting a blazingly quick starting can

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.759 
getting a blazingly quick starting can
find<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.900> good<00:00:22.109> time<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:24.119> begin<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.720> fight<00:00:25.590> back

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
find a good time to begin to fight back

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.099 
find a good time to begin to fight back
against<00:00:26.070> their<00:00:26.279> tempo<00:00:26.670> now<00:00:27.119> drawing<00:00:27.480> double

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
against their tempo now drawing double

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.589 
against their tempo now drawing double
lightning<00:00:28.769> bolt<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.359> draws

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
lightning bolt for my first two draws

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.290 
lightning bolt for my first two draws
was<00:00:30.990> quite<00:00:31.560> ridiculous<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.880> ponder

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
was quite ridiculous and the ponder

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
was quite ridiculous and the ponder
gives<00:00:33.510> us<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:34.309> mountain<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.730> third

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
gives us a mountain and a third

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.580 
gives us a mountain and a third
lightning<00:00:36.510> bolt<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.840> certainly<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
lightning bolt or certainly not going to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.090 
lightning bolt or certainly not going to
shuffle<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.040> away<00:00:39.469> and<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.800> able<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
shuffle that away and so we're able to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
shuffle that away and so we're able to
dispatch<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.149> blade<00:00:42.360> master<00:00:42.540> it's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
dispatch of the blade master it's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.170 
dispatch of the blade master it's
important<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.950> want<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> use<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.579> lightning

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
important you want to use the lightning

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.639 
important you want to use the lightning
bolt<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.899> not<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> death<00:00:46.410> mark

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
bolt there and not the death mark

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.040 
bolt there and not the death mark
because<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.940> game<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.180> most<00:00:48.570> likely<00:00:48.780> going

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
because this game is most likely going

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.529 
because this game is most likely going
to<00:00:49.110> go<00:00:49.260> long<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.489> want<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.879> removal

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to go long and you want to have removal

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.910 
to go long and you want to have removal
Fort<00:00:52.440> Alice<00:00:52.920> paladin<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.410> other<00:00:55.410> creatures

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
Fort Alice paladin and other creatures

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
Fort Alice paladin and other creatures
with<00:00:56.460> greater<00:00:57.120> than<00:00:57.360> three<00:00:57.690> toughness<00:00:58.230> once

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
with greater than three toughness once

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.319 
with greater than three toughness once
again<00:00:59.309> we're<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.850> pass<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.210> back

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
again we're just going to pass it back

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.910 
again we're just going to pass it back
to<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> looks<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.260> perhaps<00:01:01.680> he's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to them as it looks like perhaps he's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.529 
to them as it looks like perhaps he's
having<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> little<00:01:02.250> man<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> trouble<00:01:03.329> all

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
having a little man of trouble all

something you normally see from the

something you normally see from the
allies<00:01:10.530> deck<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.130> know<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.369> he<00:01:11.520> boarded

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
allies deck I don't know if he boarded
an<00:01:12.240> N<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.780> he's<00:01:12.990> decided<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:15.930> he's<00:01:16.110> just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
an N or if he's decided that he's just

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980 
an N or if he's decided that he's just
going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.830> green<00:01:17.159> white<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.820> no<00:01:18.450> red<00:01:18.659> for

going to be green white with no red for

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.850 
going to be green white with no red for
blood<00:01:19.200> right<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.530> which<00:01:19.799> seems<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.490> poor

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
blood right off which seems pretty poor

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.880 
blood right off which seems pretty poor
but<00:01:22.860> maybe<00:01:23.159> he<00:01:23.400> thought<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.810> had<00:01:24.810> more<00:01:25.110> burn<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
but maybe he thought I had more burn and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.749 
but maybe he thought I had more burn and
I<00:01:26.360> honestly<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.600> no<00:01:27.810> clue<00:01:28.460> what<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> thought

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
I honestly have no clue what the thought

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.859 
I honestly have no clue what the thought
process<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.079> cleric<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:32.780> but<00:01:33.780> we're

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
process is on the cleric here but we're

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 
process is on the cleric here but we're
not<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> complain<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.729> thought

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
not going to complain and the thought

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.999 
not going to complain and the thought
process<00:01:36.329> at<00:01:37.049> end<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.290> turn<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.710> whether<00:01:37.920> we

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
process at end of turn is whether we

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.969 
process at end of turn is whether we
want<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> kill<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.600> cleric<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.350> and

my<00:01:43.979> decision<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.149> better<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> go

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
my decision was it was better to go

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.090 
my decision was it was better to go
ahead<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> try<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> keep<00:01:46.950> him

planeswalker activations but often this

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.940 
planeswalker activations but often this
is<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.170> case<00:03:24.379> you<00:03:24.650> end<00:03:25.310> up<00:03:25.790> time<00:03:26.090> warping<00:03:26.959> to

is the case you end up time warping to

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.190 
is the case you end up time warping to
buy<00:03:28.069> yourself<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.609> turn<00:03:28.879> an<00:03:29.239> extra<00:03:29.689> land<00:03:29.840> drop

buy yourself a turn an extra land drop

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.750 
buy yourself a turn an extra land drop
and<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.500> enables<00:03:31.159> you<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.310> cruel<00:03:31.609> ultimatum

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
and that enables you to cruel ultimatum

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
tar pit racing and so I don't want to

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.940 
tar pit racing and so I don't want to
cut<00:03:49.069> tar<00:03:49.970> pit<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:51.170> at<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.349> same<00:03:51.560> time<00:03:51.680> i<00:03:51.739> wish

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
cut tar pit but at the same time i wish

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.559 
cut tar pit but at the same time i wish
i<00:03:52.069> had<00:03:52.220> more<00:03:52.430> lands<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.970> came<00:03:53.150> into<00:03:53.359> play

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
i had more lands that came into play

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.220 
i had more lands that came into play
untapped<00:03:54.159> and<00:03:55.159> so<00:03:55.310> i<00:03:55.340> cut<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.060> from<00:03:56.299> three<00:03:56.750> are

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
untapped and so i cut it from three are

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.670 
untapped and so i cut it from three are
from<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:58.099> rather<00:03:58.430> down<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:59.030> three<00:03:59.389> and<00:03:59.680> i'm

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
from for rather down to three and i'm

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.890 
from for rather down to three and i'm
still<00:04:01.430> considering<00:04:02.030> perhaps<00:04:02.599> it<00:04:02.750> would<00:04:02.870> be

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
still considering perhaps it would be

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.530 
still considering perhaps it would be
better<00:04:03.139> to<00:04:03.260> just<00:04:03.439> run<00:04:03.980> us<00:04:04.189> an<00:04:04.370> even<00:04:04.970> split<00:04:05.209> two

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
better to just run us an even split two

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.099 
better to just run us an even split two
and<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:09.489> ponder<00:04:10.489> here<00:04:10.970> as<00:04:11.120> he<00:04:11.569> has<00:04:11.690> an<00:04:11.840> empty

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109

this point we're gonna start fate
sealing<00:04:18.349> him<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.949> he<00:04:21.949> can<00:04:22.159> keep<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.729> cleric

the<00:04:24.199> plan<00:04:24.470> here<00:04:24.949> is<00:04:25.810> instead<00:04:26.810> of<00:04:26.960> winning<00:04:27.620> with

the plan here is instead of winning with
damage<00:04:28.880> at<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:29.330> point<00:04:29.599> we're<00:04:29.900> just<00:04:30.139> going<00:04:30.440> to

damage at this point we're just going to

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.969 
damage at this point we're just going to

is all in good fun it's nice to win that
way<00:04:38.360> sometimes<00:04:38.780> typically<00:04:39.289> they'll<00:04:39.440> just
