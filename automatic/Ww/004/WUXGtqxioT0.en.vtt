Today I'll show you this! Rhythmical Anpanman Musical Instruments!

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.520
There are four instruments; a trumpet, a drum, a tambourine and a bell!

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.680
This time we will open the second one; a drum!

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.260
We played the trumpet in the last video, how is it gonna be today?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.980
Let's open!

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.920
A drum, two sticks,

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.969
