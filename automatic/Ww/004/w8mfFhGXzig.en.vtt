awesome wolf hounds are great now let's
look<00:02:29.670> at<00:02:29.760> some<00:02:29.909> of<00:02:30.030> these<00:02:30.090> costumes<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.810> little

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
look at some of these costumes a little

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.009 
look at some of these costumes a little
more<00:02:31.110> closely<00:02:31.319> seven<00:02:32.159> hundred<00:02:32.700> crowns<00:02:33.019> I

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
more closely seven hundred crowns I

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.259 
more closely seven hundred crowns I
think<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:34.890> roughly<00:02:35.400> translates<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.060> like

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
think that roughly translates to like

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.550 
think that roughly translates to like
five<00:02:36.569> bucks<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.379> not<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:38.010> much<00:02:38.040> money

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
five bucks it's not that much money

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.869 
five bucks it's not that much money
really<00:02:40.560> they're<00:02:40.709> pretty<00:02:40.890> fair<00:02:41.129> prices<00:02:41.609> and<00:02:41.640> as

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
really they're pretty fair prices and as

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.030 
really they're pretty fair prices and as
you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.120> tell<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.480> far<00:02:42.510> even<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.409> consumables

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
you can tell so far even the consumables

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.789 
you can tell so far even the consumables
like<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> soul<00:02:44.549> gems<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:46.230> repair<00:02:46.560> kits

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
like the soul gems and the repair kits

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.649 
like the soul gems and the repair kits
there<00:02:47.040> nothing<00:02:47.400> astronomically<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.629> the

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
there nothing astronomically to the

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.729 
there nothing astronomically to the
point<00:02:48.959> where<00:02:49.109> it's<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.349> give<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.620> an

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
point where it's going to give you an

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.259 
point where it's going to give you an
advantage<00:02:50.040> over<00:02:50.250> others<00:02:50.639> if<00:02:50.790> anything<00:02:51.150> it's

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
advantage over others if anything it's

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.970 
advantage over others if anything it's
convenience<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.989> soul<00:02:52.200> gems<00:02:52.470> allow<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.799> to

tempted to buy one of these especially

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.580 
tempted to buy one of these especially
just<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:16.889> um<00:03:17.730> not<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.480> shamans<00:03:18.900> pack<00:03:19.109> but

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
just because um not the shamans pack but

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.170 
just because um not the shamans pack but
the<00:03:19.709> stealthy<00:03:20.069> rogues<00:03:20.340> pack<00:03:20.609> has<00:03:20.879> a<00:03:20.910> lot<00:03:21.150> of

cool looking stuff in it but ultimately

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.970 
cool looking stuff in it but ultimately
I<00:03:23.310> don't<00:03:23.669> think<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.449> outfits<00:03:25.019> are<00:03:25.230> quite

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
I don't think that the outfits are quite

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.710 
I don't think that the outfits are quite
to<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.340> point<00:03:26.370> where<00:03:26.790> I'd<00:03:26.910> want<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.389> buy<00:03:27.540> them

flaming<00:03:42.870> hubs<00:03:43.139> I<00:03:43.349> don't<00:03:43.530> think<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:43.829> very

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
flaming hubs I don't think that's very

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.199

necessarily<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:46.230> we<00:03:46.319> see<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.650> ESO<00:03:47.099> lore<00:03:47.849> but

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
necessarily what we see in ESO lore but

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.750 
necessarily what we see in ESO lore but
who<00:03:48.510> cares<00:03:48.810> right<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.470> looks<00:03:49.709> cool<00:03:49.949> that's

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
who cares right it looks cool that's

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.619 
who cares right it looks cool that's
kind<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:50.970> what<00:03:51.090> I'm<00:03:51.180> hoping<00:03:51.329> they<00:03:51.569> do

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
kind of what I'm hoping they do

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.170 
kind of what I'm hoping they do
eventually<00:03:52.430> with<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:54.109> with<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.139> the<00:03:55.980> other

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
eventually with the with the the other

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.009

feels good to run around on that thing
by<00:04:52.129> the<00:04:52.159> way<00:04:52.310> me<00:04:52.580> it's<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.819> same<00:04:53.029> as<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.180> horse

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
by the way me it's the same as a horse

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.450 
by the way me it's the same as a horse
right<00:04:53.750> but<00:04:54.169> for<00:04:54.349> some<00:04:54.500> reason<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.889> animation

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
right but for some reason the animation

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.339 
right but for some reason the animation
just<00:04:55.759> seems<00:04:55.939> better<00:04:56.180> everything<00:04:56.719> about<00:04:57.139> the

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
just seems better everything about the

just seems better everything about the
mount<00:04:57.529> seems<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.830> little<00:04:58.159> bit<00:04:58.400> better<00:04:58.520> than

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
mount seems a little bit better than

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.730 
mount seems a little bit better than
your<00:04:58.969> typical<00:04:59.169> imperial<00:05:00.169> horse<00:05:00.409> which<00:05:00.620> is

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
what I had before and that's it just

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.279 
what I had before and that's it just
