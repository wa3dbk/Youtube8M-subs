that's<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.349> answer<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.859> New<00:03:40.950> Testament

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
that's the answer of the New Testament

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.879 
that's the answer of the New Testament
you<00:03:41.760> may<00:03:41.910> reject<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.569> but<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.650> what<00:03:43.799> the

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
you may reject it but this is what the

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.440 
you may reject it but this is what the
Bible<00:03:44.220> teaches<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.819> what<00:03:44.970> Jesus<00:03:45.299> teaches

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
Bible teaches this is what Jesus teaches

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.629 
Bible teaches this is what Jesus teaches
therefore<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.560> could<00:03:46.739> never<00:03:46.889> become<00:03:47.130> Muslim

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
therefore we could never become Muslim

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.169 
therefore we could never become Muslim
because<00:03:48.060> Jesus<00:03:48.510> was<00:03:48.690> no<00:03:48.810> Muslim
