00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.700
 Install a solid state drive on a new Dell laptop or ultrabook 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.300
 Compared with traditional hard drives, it has many advantages. 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.840
 Such as faster startup time and longer battery life. 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.420
 And it is very simple to install, the following is the operating instructions. 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.700
 There are some things to keep in mind before you start the installation. 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.700
 First of all, if you install a solid state drive in a new computer, it will be easy to install. 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.300
 Just make sure you have the installation disk that came with your computer. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.040
 Otherwise, you will need to back up or clone the hard drive you are using. 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.020
 Before upgrading any part of your computer, 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 First, it's a good idea to make sure your system BIOS is up to date. 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.500
 Please check the Dell website before you start. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.440
 Next, keep the work surface clean and let yourself touch 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.260
 An unpainted metal surface grounds itself to prevent static damage to any parts. 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.900
 Finally, in most cases, you simply need to prepare a Phillips head screwdriver. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.040
 In order to replace the hard disk in the laptop. 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 After the computer is turned off, remove the power adapter and battery. 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.360
 And make sure the computer releases all remaining power 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.140
 After removing the battery, press the power button. 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.680
 Next, find the location of the hard drive. The hard drive is usually located at the bottom of the computer. 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 If you can't find it, check out Dell's website first. 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.520
 Now remove the screw and remove the cover, and you should be able to see the old hard drive in your computer clearly. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.880
 Each module will be slightly different, but please carefully remove the screws. 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 In order to disconnect the SATA and power connectors, 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.040
 The hard drive can usually be removed from the connector for removal from the computer. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.560
 If you have a stand, as we see it now, take it out and set it aside. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.140
 When installing a new SSD, 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.800
 Please reconnect the brackets used on the old hard drive to the new solid state drive. 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 And ensure that SATA and SSDs are inserted into the hard drive bay. 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.740
 It is very important that the power connector is securely connected. 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.420
 The connection should be tight and firm, but not too hard. 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.860
 And screw it in place, 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.380
 Put the cover and battery back in place, now turn the computer back to the original location and turn on the computer. 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.020
 You will hear an alarm indicating that there is no operating system. 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.560
 Simply plug in the original installation disk that came with your computer and reboot again to boot from the CD-ROM. 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.860
 Follow the prompts to install the operating system and recover from backup. 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.360
 This is done. If you have any other questions or need additional help with the process of installing a solid state drive in your computer,
