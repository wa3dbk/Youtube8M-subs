district before black I got the ODI soft
grips<00:00:08.719> they're<00:00:09.719> really<00:00:09.960> soft<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.650> they

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
grips they're really soft and they

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.089 
grips they're really soft and they
didn't<00:00:11.610> come<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> scooter<00:00:13.099> district

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
didn't come with the scooter district

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.620 
didn't come with the scooter district
rubber<00:00:14.280> grips<00:00:14.490> did<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:14.969> they<00:00:15.269> were<00:00:15.330> really

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
rubber grips did but they were really

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.720 
rubber grips did but they were really
slippery<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.980> didn't<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.279> them<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.550> all

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
slippery and I didn't like them at all

slippery and I didn't like them at all
but<00:00:19.070> I<00:00:20.070> guess<00:00:20.640> they're<00:00:20.820> good<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.180> can't

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
design right here as you can see doesn't

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
design right here as you can see doesn't
really<00:00:35.070> interfere<00:00:35.340> extra<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.510> you're

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
really interfere extra so if you're

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
really interfere extra so if you're
throwing<00:00:36.809> bar<00:00:37.050> spins<00:00:37.380> unless<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
hold it in here that's when it gets

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.979 
hold it in here that's when it gets
really<00:00:40.590> annoying<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.030> can't<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:42.840> else

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
district one piece forks um the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.240 
district one piece forks um the
difference<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.770> wider<00:01:08.100> than

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
difference is there a little wider than

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.219 
difference is there a little wider than
usual<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.799> then<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.979> got<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.520> eagle<00:01:12.360> hundred

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
millimeter wheels with I don't not sure

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.240 
millimeter wheels with I don't not sure
which<00:01:16.500> bearings<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.369> they're<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.360> nice

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
which bearings but they're really nice

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.109 
which bearings but they're really nice
same<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> back<00:01:21.140> there<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.439> ah<00:01:23.119> the

major<00:01:24.330> change<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.259> scooter<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
major change with this scooter is the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280 
major change with this scooter is the
deck<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:27.990> it's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
deck and that's because it's not it's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.660 
deck and that's because it's not it's
closed<00:01:29.009> now<00:01:30.320> usually<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.159> districts

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
closed now usually as you know districts

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
closed now usually as you know districts
have<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.259> opening<00:01:34.259> um<00:01:35.220> which<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.360> liked<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> lot

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
have the opening um which I liked a lot

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440 
have the opening um which I liked a lot
i'm<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.860> sure<00:01:38.070> why<00:01:38.189> they<00:01:38.310> changed<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.119> i

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
i'm not sure why they changed it but i

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.770 
i'm not sure why they changed it but i
like<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.229> new<00:01:40.290> design<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> comes<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
like this new design to that it comes to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.940 
like this new design to that it comes to
the<00:01:42.899> district<00:01:43.259> grip<00:01:43.409> tape<00:01:43.590> um<00:01:44.329> pretty<00:01:45.329> grippy

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
the district grip tape um pretty grippy

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.469 
the district grip tape um pretty grippy
probably<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> change<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> soon<00:01:47.640> then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
probably to change that soon then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.270 
probably to change that soon then
another<00:01:48.720> new<00:01:48.930> thing<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.860> flex<00:01:50.670> brake<00:01:50.820> um

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
another new thing is the flex brake um

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.389 
another new thing is the flex brake um
solid<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.939> has<00:01:54.390> two<00:01:55.170> bolts<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
solid it has two bolts right here you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.760 
solid it has two bolts right here you
could<00:01:56.610> remove<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.030> fast<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:58.560> take

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
could remove it fast and you don't take

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.359 
could remove it fast and you don't take
off<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> back<00:01:59.130> wheel<00:01:59.310> which<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> lot<00:02:00.509> um

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
off the back wheel which I like a lot um

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.620 
off the back wheel which I like a lot um
always<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> good<00:02:02.729> feature

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
always a good feature

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.940 
always a good feature
the<00:02:04.780> compression<00:02:05.200> system<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:06.399> ICS<00:02:07.679> which<00:02:08.679> is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
the compression system it's ICS which is

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.150 
the compression system it's ICS which is
a<00:02:09.099> pain<00:02:09.630> sometimes<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.069> to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
a pain sometimes because you have to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.580 
a pain sometimes because you have to
take<00:02:12.310> off<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.700> front<00:02:12.880> wheel<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.560> know<00:02:14.709> um

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
take off the front wheel and you know um

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.270 
take off the front wheel and you know um
