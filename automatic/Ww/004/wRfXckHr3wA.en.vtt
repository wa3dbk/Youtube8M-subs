00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.689
 I do not know how the information from the business was well done here the customer complained 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.660
 first thing we have to measure the battery until there the negative in the tenth 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.060
 battery 3 other than 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.269
 and when thereza did not hold fault there always and restore exist 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.130
 it works as 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 noble said 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 when the plate 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 battery is off holding bios information 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.570
 recalled the plate is denied the source to feed the circus 8 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.250
 disabling 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.060
 the abattoir 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.990
 making the battery only work with the pact the delegate and is exactly 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.760
 So what the hell is bbc information that we deal with this component 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 and measure up on the day at the beach 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.820
 the battery dinner 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.970
 on the line by the battery he has to give three too and go back 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 battery and top of Iran at OPEC 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 yes, jonathan does not have voltage 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.080
 It's because the traffic is in trouble. 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.300
 between 5 volts 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.680
 and when the feed part 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.070
 it plays back when the board is powered up but when you turn it off 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.610
 scoreboard 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780
 do not happen switching from bringing this 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.890
 melina he does not play the battery voltage for the bios to feed himself adopt 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 to ensure all information such as date 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.230
 now 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.320
 customer of the nightclub all the modifications you see in belgium return to 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.490
 default state 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.619
 and I am every time you have to call 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 the motherboard you have to do 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 bildt make or setup settings 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.660
 and this becomes uncomfortable 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.389
 the repair costs approximately 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.849
 sixty reais 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.849
 Soup to exchange this transit 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.479
 lecture tranches tranches 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.259
 you have to do the shakhtar modifying the time modify the date 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.219
 save in setup 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.759
 after this if the tap off 10 few minutes 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.999
 and life again 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.579
 connected to the computer mpt 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.279
 Henrique 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:45.579
 enter directly without asking that the alcohol f2 the technician gave to enter this step 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.579
 He has to go straight into the windows. 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.949
 this card has been fixed 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
 only traffic 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.429
 you can adapt from other boards to do the test measures that no problem 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.819
 it is also possible 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.879
 make a cut if you can not solve it 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.069
 You pick up a transit point. 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 and makes a pec today for another hand 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:32.919
 this causes the source not to supply the circuit only the battery is switched on 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.689
 off 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.069
 it happens that 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.609
 will decrease 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.659
 a little the battery life 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.870
 grandson of 3 years steps- to be two and a half years 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.369
 win another technical resource 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.949
 but we are passing on to you
