00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.880
 I'm posting a little video 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.740
 it was asked me it was required 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.100
 so it's going to be the video on how 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.260
 differentiate the end of the year viii then 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.140
 for sabo I took some notes because 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.949
 that I tend to escape 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.240
 when I'm making videos so here I have 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.029
 taken 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.250
 I took small notes so in fact 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.969
 already what you need to know 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.149
 is that when we're really hungry it's 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.850
 I mean there is a whole bunch 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.660
 emotions and sensations that come in 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.450
 at stake then already becomes unpleasant 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.910
 we become a bit like saying excite 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.870
 a little 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.870
 to bias and one becomes impatient 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.580
 we have in this sense at the same time very 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.890
 very tired as if there really is the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.800
 gravity pulling us to the ground 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.900
 we sometimes have garments 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.420
 you have stomach belly 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.270
 gargoyle 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.340
 feels tired and hot sometimes 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.070
 excuse me we have hot flashes 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.560
 that's all we can 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.030
 feel other low voices pretty much 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.550
 learn everything different each one our 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.960
 is different but when we are hungry and we 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.580
 has very nice sensations in all 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.550
 very unpleasant throughout the body 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.940
 that's it and then when we really 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.070
 hungry we are able to eat anything 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.070
 what is it true we say well 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 how to say when we are hungry in Creole 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.950
 we say we would be able to Swiss 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.180
 equaled what finally I mean it's 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.130
 that we are so close that we could 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.930
 eat anything in it will eat 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.880
 the world in more is what the expression 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 Besides, I too have a hunger for 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.450
 mud no it was not that I wanted 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.440
 to say I know more it's con finally short 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.200
 so when we are hungry we could 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.820
 really eat anything and that's 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.220
 so that we differentiate the end of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.550
 the year viii is that if for example a 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.360
 moment when you say I'm hungry I 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.120
 want to eat I do not know I want 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.850
 to make me mcdo then there to find out if 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.800
 the end or the envi think and say 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.370
 you are what I want a mcdo or 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.080
 do I want a kebab from a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.770
 mcdo of a soft french fries pizza 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.660
 green beans 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.160
 in fact if you are really hungry you 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.000
 could eat anything that's at 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.230
 to say that if you did you can 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.090
 even eat something that you like 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400
 not particularly usually by 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.730
 example green steamed green beans 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.470
 what 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.220
 or I do not know for example 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.930
 french fries soft and warm fries or 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.400
 finally I do not know I have no other 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.110
 example it really depends on the tastes of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.340
 everyone but imagine you is what 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.030
 you are capable that you are 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.950
 really hungry for finally when you have 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.980
 this envy ask yourself if you have 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.140
 just want something specific or 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.420
 so if you could want to 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.520
 of anything to eat 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.470
 if you want anything from 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.140
 everything and anything is that you 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.910
 are hungry really hungry in this case to 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.110
 eat them and of course try to you 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.980
 turn to the most choices 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.720
 impossible if you just want 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.540
 an ice cream or if you really 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.300
 just want a pastry it's 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.970
 envied if for example I tell you I 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.820
 do not know 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.640
 I wanted to wad a slipper 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.720
 apples and like me I tell you yes bah 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.920
 I give you an apple 6 otherwise I have 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.720
 want a slipper with apples past you 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.300
 do not be hungry you just want a 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.740
 song what's that going to happen and you 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.440
 are obliged to pass it or so 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.900
 take fruit to fill this 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.550
 want but it's not the end it's 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.310
 want it's greed 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.280
 so here really is to differentiate the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.680
 end of the appetite ask or the question 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.730
 asked you really the question to know 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.400
 if you want something 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.620
 accurate or or if you would be able to 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.990
 to eat any dish because 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.920
 in this case you are hungry so could 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:18.220
 then eat maurane my request and 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.220
 so one of my subscribers cuts morale 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.340
 how to recognize satiety is to 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.200
 tell how to recognize when is it 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.540
 we are hungry so it's easy 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.220
 when you start eating is in 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.720
 now laugh because I had my 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.850
 notes but in fact I do not look at them 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.470
 so as to video where it goes in all 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.230
 the senses so listen I'm going to close my 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.970
 trick it's byron and so how 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.680
 recognize satiety ie that 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.190
 when you start eating your 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.110
 plate 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.690
 admit that know I do not know me good 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.630
 I take my case it's a banana worry 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.190
 date I eat my worry it's great 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.680
 sweet it's nice at the level of 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:01.280
 taste buds at one point the 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.979
 taste will fade as and when 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.950
 it will be more sweet in fact it will be 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:12.500
 more as good it means that I did not 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:14.720
 more hungry so I stop it's rare that 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.419
 I stop because having a smoothie 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.770
 banana and that I get to that sensation 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.570
 but I have more thing left because 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.630
 that I know but I know my 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.540
 how to tell my needs and it is not 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.810
 need again so it's pretty rare 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.100
 that I force myself to finish what but in 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.530
 your case that's really when you 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.340
 eat a plate of little importance 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.750
 you eat the mans focus on 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.849
 your feelings and tell you that the 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.000
 moment it's more tasteful and 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.500
 then as good as you like it as much 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.870
 it is necessary to stop you have 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.460
 more end here as long as you can not get 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.140
 not to this feeling of telling you I 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.550
 meaning the more the tastes is that you have 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.349
 yet you eat in this case 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.169
 you can eat again but really 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.410
 as soon as it's lost that its pearl the 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.880
 flavor and you like it more 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.490
 you stop eating it's over 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.010
 your body has reached satiety and has not 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.539
 no need to eat 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.930
 here and then after some recruiters 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.910
 you will feel this state of fatigue 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.849
 annoyance annoyance and then with that 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.450
 you will have the feeling of hunger that will 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.890
 appear 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.330
 and you're going to have doubt is what 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.340
 it's hunger what is it 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.440
 the envy so here again ask yourself the 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.820
 question is what do you want to 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.760
 something or is that you have 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.450
 want to feel like everything said angel 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.490
 and that's it so here and then yes a 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.440
 little trick you know her 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.820
 certainly already but I tell you 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.680
 still for those who do not know it 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.539
 not if you realize so that 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.190
 it's a desire actually it's 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.690
 thing that makes you 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.860
 life and because you can do too 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.830
 it's just going to drink a big 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.900
 glass of water and then that will pass all 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.360
 only go to do an activity 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.630
 I hope you're home taking 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.520
 a book to celebrate a book where I know 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.050
 nothing will prepare the meal 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.660
 because maybe you'll end 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.060
 in a few minutes 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.490
 so that was my little advice 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.620
 for the day I hope it was you 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.820
 useful and do not forget how to say 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.710
 really applied to those maximum 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.260
 little rules all stupid but chivu 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.970
 France will serve a lot in life and 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.950
 then do not hesitate to let me 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.690
 comments if you want to react by 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.000
 report to this video or so if you 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.440
 have special video desires and 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.760
 I make you big kisses and I 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.690
 tell you very quickly in a life of 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.690
 Alps
