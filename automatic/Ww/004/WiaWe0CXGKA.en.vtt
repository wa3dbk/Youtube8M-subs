00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
freedom that dreams the numeral to

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.770 
freedom that dreams the numeral to
freedom<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.210> video<00:04:23.450> we're<00:04:23.780> doing<00:04:24.050> a

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
freedom and in this video we're doing a

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.160 
freedom and in this video we're doing a
a<00:04:25.160> demo<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.700> type<00:04:26.880> of<00:04:26.910> quality<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:28.139> can

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
a demo of the type of quality you can

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.370 
a demo of the type of quality you can
expect<00:04:29.100> from<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.820> dazzle<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.600> in<00:04:31.020> my<00:04:31.260> opinion

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
expect from the dazzle and in my opinion

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.680 
expect from the dazzle and in my opinion
it<00:04:31.860> absolutely<00:04:32.340> stinks<00:04:32.850> if<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.330> noticed

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
it absolutely stinks if you just noticed

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.600 
it absolutely stinks if you just noticed
in<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:33.990> clip<00:04:34.290> reading<00:04:34.710> was<00:04:35.190> almost

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
in that clip reading was almost

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.760 
in that clip reading was almost
impossible<00:04:35.850> if<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.780> look<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.169> here<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.680> a

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
impossible if you look in here this is a

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.070 
impossible if you look in here this is a
split<00:04:38.160> screen<00:04:38.310> between<00:04:38.669> me<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.210> my<00:04:39.330> partner

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
split screen between me and my partner

hertz LCD flat screen and the quality
just<00:04:59.970> isn't<00:05:00.360> really<00:05:00.840> good<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.350> is<00:05:01.380> what<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
just isn't really good this is what the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.140 
just isn't really good this is what the
dazzle<00:05:02.419> connected<00:05:03.419> along<00:05:03.720> with<00:05:04.020> the

dazzle connected along with the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.310 
dazzle connected along with the
component<00:05:06.150> cables<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.780> three<00:05:07.080> wires

whatever that is the the red yellow and
white<00:05:10.290> wires<00:05:10.890> I<00:05:12.440> didn't<00:05:13.440> have<00:05:13.800> an<00:05:14.010> s-video

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
white wires I didn't have an s-video

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.550 
white wires I didn't have an s-video
cable<00:05:15.360> or<00:05:15.540> adapt<00:05:15.870> or<00:05:16.080> anything<00:05:16.350> like<00:05:16.380> that

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
cable or adapt or anything like that

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.190 
cable or adapt or anything like that
it's<00:05:16.830> almost<00:05:16.950> impossible<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.910> find<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:19.020> if<00:05:19.110> you

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
it's almost impossible to find so if you

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.960 
it's almost impossible to find so if you
don't<00:05:19.410> have<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.770> already<00:05:19.919> it<00:05:20.370> kind<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:20.790> takes

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
don't have it already it kind of takes

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.270 
don't have it already it kind of takes
s-video<00:05:21.510> option<00:05:22.140> out<00:05:22.290> so<00:05:22.470> you're<00:05:22.800> stuck<00:05:23.100> with

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
s-video option out so you're stuck with

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.070 
s-video option out so you're stuck with
using<00:05:23.639> this<00:05:23.820> option<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.630> as<00:05:24.750> you<00:05:24.900> can<00:05:25.050> see

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
using this option and as you can see

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.530 
using this option and as you can see
that<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.740> screams<00:05:26.070> really<00:05:26.490> dark<00:05:26.729> more<00:05:27.300> kind

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
that the screams really dark more kind

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.200 
that the screams really dark more kind
of<00:05:27.660> just<00:05:27.870> screwing<00:05:28.169> around<00:05:28.290> checking<00:05:28.740> out<00:05:29.210> the

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
of just screwing around checking out the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.870 
of just screwing around checking out the
quality<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:30.990> it<00:05:31.530> as<00:05:31.680> we<00:05:32.010> go<00:05:32.040> through<00:05:32.490> here<00:05:32.669> but

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
quality of it as we go through here but

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.650 
quality of it as we go through here but
we<00:05:33.419> found<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.140> it's<00:05:34.320> really<00:05:34.680> dark<00:05:35.390> hard<00:05:36.390> to

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
we found that it's really dark hard to

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.730 
we found that it's really dark hard to
really<00:05:37.050> get<00:05:37.979> in<00:05:38.220> on<00:05:38.460> everything<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.840> the

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
really get in on everything and the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.050 
really get in on everything and the
quality<00:05:41.160> is<00:05:41.400> just<00:05:41.990> just<00:05:42.990> not<00:05:43.229> there<00:05:43.729> so<00:05:44.729> if

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
quality is just just not there so if

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.969 
quality is just just not there so if
you're<00:05:45.270> planning<00:05:45.300> on<00:05:45.840> recording<00:05:46.229> your<00:05:46.530> games

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
you're planning on recording your games

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.460 
you're planning on recording your games
I<00:05:47.310> would<00:05:47.430> definitely<00:05:47.640> not<00:05:48.330> go<00:05:49.110> with<00:05:49.320> the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
I would definitely not go with the

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.250 
I would definitely not go with the
dazzle<00:05:49.950> because<00:05:50.280> as<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.550> can<00:05:50.580> see<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:51.360> the

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
dazzle because as you can see the the

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.800 
dazzle because as you can see the the
quality<00:05:53.010> of<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.520> you<00:05:53.610> can't<00:05:53.880> read<00:05:54.240> any<00:05:54.479> of<00:05:54.600> the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
quality of it you can't read any of the

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.440 
quality of it you can't read any of the
words<00:05:55.110> um<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.250> pitchers<00:05:56.850> really<00:05:57.090> dark

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
words um the the pitchers really dark

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.750 
words um the the pitchers really dark
plus<00:05:57.840> it<00:05:58.289> really<00:05:58.650> messes<00:05:58.890> up<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.310> gaming

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
plus it really messes up the gaming

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.550 
plus it really messes up the gaming
experience<00:06:00.390> because<00:06:00.660> it's<00:06:00.840> hard<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.320> see

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
experience because it's hard to see

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.880 
experience because it's hard to see
what's<00:06:01.860> going<00:06:02.220> on<00:06:02.370> because<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.260> graphics

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
what's going on because the the graphics

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.880 
what's going on because the the graphics
are<00:06:05.039> diminished<00:06:05.789> so<00:06:06.120> badly<00:06:06.539> um<00:06:06.930> now<00:06:07.500> i'm<00:06:07.860> sure

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
are diminished so badly um now i'm sure

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.909 
are diminished so badly um now i'm sure
you<00:06:08.310> can<00:06:08.490> see<00:06:08.880> how<00:06:09.000> bad<00:06:09.210> this<00:06:09.390> looks<00:06:09.890> right<00:06:10.890> now

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
you can see how bad this looks right now

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.580 
you can see how bad this looks right now
imagine<00:06:11.850> going<00:06:12.180> from<00:06:12.210> you<00:06:12.419> know

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590
