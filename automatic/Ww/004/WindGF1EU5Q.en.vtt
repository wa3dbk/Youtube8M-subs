the<00:02:05.750> thumb<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.770> pinkie<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.190> little<00:02:07.640> bit

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
the thumb and the pinkie a little bit

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.850 
the thumb and the pinkie a little bit
didn't<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.050> work<00:02:09.229> too<00:02:09.440> well

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860

inch bigger but that one inch makes a

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.090 
inch bigger but that one inch makes a
