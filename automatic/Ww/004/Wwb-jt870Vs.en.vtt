dip it into the gel liner and apply it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.880 
dip it into the gel liner and apply it
all<00:01:01.920> over<00:01:02.010> our<00:01:02.760> lid<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.809> base<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> we

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
all over our lid as a base so that we

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
all over our lid as a base so that we
can<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> really<00:01:05.909> dark<00:01:06.150> color<00:01:06.570> and

can have a really dark color and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.350 
can have a really dark color and
sometimes<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.650> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> hard<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.360> apply

sometimes it's kind of hard to apply

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.350 
sometimes it's kind of hard to apply
with<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.020> brush<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.909> you<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> be

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
with this brush but you don't have to be

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.750 
with this brush but you don't have to be
precise<00:01:12.810> either<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.680> make<00:01:14.280> sure<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
cover the entire part of the lid so the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.300 
cover the entire part of the lid so the
part<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.930> moves<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> be

like<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.319> also<00:02:16.440> take<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.860> out

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
see that hopefully it's not too fuzzy

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.300

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
and that we're going to apply it right

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.420 
and that we're going to apply it right
there<00:02:53.790> basically<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> semi-circle<00:02:55.620> shape

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430

part of the crease upwards like that and

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.699 
part of the crease upwards like that and
again<00:03:59.639> you<00:03:59.670> just<00:03:59.819> want<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.510> blend<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:01.530> don't

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
again you just want to blend you don't

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.530 
again you just want to blend you don't
want<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.889> have<00:04:02.010> any<00:04:02.160> harsh<00:04:02.459> lines<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:03.389> you

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
want to have any harsh lines but you

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.259 
want to have any harsh lines but you
don't<00:04:03.690> want<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.989> lose<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.470> color<00:04:04.760> like<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.970> I

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
feel like I have probably need a little

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.509 
feel like I have probably need a little
bit<00:04:09.180> more<00:04:09.359> of<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.569> black<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.049> corner<00:04:10.519> you

bit more of the black on the corner you

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.129 
bit more of the black on the corner you
just<00:04:11.730> want<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.090> make<00:04:12.299> sure<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:12.840> just<00:04:13.019> a

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
just want to make sure that it's just a

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.340 
just want to make sure that it's just a
very<00:04:13.850> basically<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.209> just<00:04:15.420> pack<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
very basically that you just pack the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.469 
very basically that you just pack the
eyeshadow<00:04:16.979> there<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:18.000> eye<00:04:18.030> and

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
eyeshadow there on your eye and

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
sometimes with the drugstore products

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.700 
sometimes with the drugstore products
you<00:04:20.789> have<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.120> do<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.599> little<00:04:21.959> bit<00:04:22.109> more<00:04:22.470> like

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
you have to do it a little bit more like

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.890 
you have to do it a little bit more like
you<00:04:22.830> have<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.070> apply<00:04:23.280> more<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.849> because<00:04:23.970> you

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
you have to apply more just because you

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.790 
you have to apply more just because you
know<00:04:25.020> it's<00:04:25.200> not<00:04:25.440> as

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
know it's not as

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.950 
know it's not as
tensive<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.310> pigmentation<00:04:26.909> as<00:04:27.330> something

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
tensive of pigmentation as something

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.540 
tensive of pigmentation as something
like<00:04:28.110> an<00:04:28.259> urban<00:04:28.560> decay<00:04:28.860> eyeshadow<00:04:29.069> or

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
like an urban decay eyeshadow or

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.659 
like an urban decay eyeshadow or
something<00:04:29.789> like<00:04:29.849> that<00:04:29.909> so<00:04:30.800> that's<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
something like that so that's it for the

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.610 
something like that so that's it for the
eyeshadow<00:04:33.120> as<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:33.449> can<00:04:33.629> see<00:04:33.870> pretty<00:04:34.110> simple

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
eyeshadow as you can see pretty simple

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.100 
eyeshadow as you can see pretty simple

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
water line and for this I'm going to be

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.040 
water line and for this I'm going to be

the<00:04:57.780> inner<00:04:57.960> corner<00:04:58.289> essentially<00:04:59.039> like<00:04:59.250> that

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
the inner corner essentially like that

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.689 
the inner corner essentially like that
and<00:05:01.020> it's<00:05:01.229> kind<00:05:01.409> of<00:05:01.469> creepy<00:05:02.099> and<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:02.430> have<00:05:02.580> to

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
and it's kind of creepy and you have to

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.850 
and it's kind of creepy and you have to
get<00:05:02.819> used<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.210> it<00:05:03.240> but<00:05:03.509> once<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.199> practice<00:05:04.440> the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
get used to it but once you practice the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.080 
get used to it but once you practice the
more<00:05:04.889> you<00:05:05.069> practice<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.520> better<00:05:05.639> you<00:05:05.909> get<00:05:06.030> at

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
more you practice the better you get at

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.499 
more you practice the better you get at
it<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.419> then<00:05:06.930> we<00:05:07.050> also<00:05:07.199> one<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.469> line<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:08.639> I

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
it and then we also one in line that I

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.559 
it and then we also one in line that I
guess<00:05:10.199> we<00:05:10.349> want<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.590> tight<00:05:10.860> line<00:05:11.099> so<00:05:11.909> do<00:05:12.449> the

guess we want a tight line so do the
same<00:05:12.750> thing<00:05:13.050> lining<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:14.639> top<00:05:14.879> part<00:05:15.199> like<00:05:16.199> that

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
same thing lining the top part like that

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.070 
same thing lining the top part like that

and you have to go all the way in we
just<00:05:19.259> want<00:05:19.409> to<00:05:19.500> make<00:05:19.530> sure<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:19.889> we<00:05:20.009> kind<00:05:20.159> of

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
just want to make sure that we kind of

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.890 
just want to make sure that we kind of
have<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.580> effect<00:05:20.879> of<00:05:20.969> the<00:05:21.120> thick<00:05:21.300> eyelashes

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900
