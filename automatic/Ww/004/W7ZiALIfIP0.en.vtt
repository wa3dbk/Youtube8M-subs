00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.570
 I thought that maybe it's worth it 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.599
 worse 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.019
 So there is this morning the price is over a tenth on button 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.839
 it's all over 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.839
 Suntech may but that is the first 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.829
 the guys from the press almost locked 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.190
 The first year has escalated again 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.440
 All of them on the same page are a bit more complicated 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.840
 this should put a year on probation 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.100
 that interests everything 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.830
 Everything is free 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.260
 the group management 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.390
 that was important 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.060
 already as me 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.960
 there is a million dollars for this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740
 So what do we have to do so fast? 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.480
 we do not know that, yet 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.440
 it is very good 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.440
 Keep your eyes out - everything is watching 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 the minister 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 I know what you did 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 What should I do if you bought two red cards? 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 Unfortunately, no 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 because that's how it is I see a little bit of concern 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.330
 they have no idea of ​​up to 2 after 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.250
