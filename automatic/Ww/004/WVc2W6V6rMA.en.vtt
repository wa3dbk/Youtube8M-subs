well<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:39.420> more<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:39.900> issue<00:01:40.079> where<00:01:40.439> they

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
well I have more of an issue where they

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
well I have more of an issue where they
don't<00:01:41.280> need<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:42.000> destroyed<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.200> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
don't need to be destroyed it's just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.420 
don't need to be destroyed it's just
like<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.710> inconvenience<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.340> would

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
like a little inconvenience it would

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.249 
like a little inconvenience it would
make<00:01:44.579> no<00:01:44.610> sense<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> hit<00:01:45.240> bear<00:01:45.420> yeah<00:01:46.049> no

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
make no sense to hit bear yeah no

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
make no sense to hit bear yeah no
because<00:01:46.409> bear<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> hollow<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.090> he's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
because bear is like a hollow and he's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
because bear is like a hollow and he's
our<00:01:48.420> common<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:49.979> make<00:01:50.100> sense<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
our common so it would make sense that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
our common so it would make sense that
they<00:01:50.700> were<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.689> limit

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
they were just like all just limit

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020 
they were just like all just limit
because<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.439> limiting<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.130> would<00:01:53.490> make<00:01:53.670> sense

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because it limiting it would make sense

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.789 
because it limiting it would make sense
yeah<00:01:54.630> cuz<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.409> would<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.649> more

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
yeah cuz I think it would be more

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.530 
yeah cuz I think it would be more
healthier<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> game<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.969> could<00:01:57.329> live<00:01:57.509> with

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
healthier for the game I could live with

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.920 
healthier for the game I could live with
tank<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> many<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.450> subs

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
tank and I think that many of my subs

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.300 
tank and I think that many of my subs
and<00:02:04.140> many<00:02:04.290> people<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.710> watch<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.100> can

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and many people that watch this can

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.670 
and many people that watch this can
agree<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> tanky<00:02:06.420> should<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:06.990> 110<00:02:07.500> yeah

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
agree that tanky should be at 110 yeah

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.300 
agree that tanky should be at 110 yeah
the<00:02:07.860> kind<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.129> card<00:02:08.399> where<00:02:09.000> most<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.989> most

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the kind of card where most with most

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.800 
the kind of card where most with most
slight<00:02:11.310> searchable<00:02:11.910> cards<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.629> they

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
slight searchable cards like that they

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.730 
slight searchable cards like that they
give<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> deck<00:02:13.349> too<00:02:13.530> much

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
give the deck too much

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.390 
give the deck too much
consistency<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.600> little<00:02:15.900> yeah<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
consistency it's a little yeah and the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.010 
consistency it's a little yeah and the
thing<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.480> one-time<00:02:18.960> thing

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
thing is it's not like a one-time thing

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.900 
thing is it's not like a one-time thing
either<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.740> people<00:02:20.130> also<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.640> consider

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
either we people also have to consider

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.210 
either we people also have to consider

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
tanki doesn't leave taking these stays

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.480 
tanki doesn't leave taking these stays
on<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.460> field<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.090> even<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:26.160> stays

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
on the field and even if it just stays

on the field and it's used its main

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.990 
on the field and it's used its main
thing<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.010> though<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.490> car<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.820> could<00:02:29.940> be

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
thing it's though a car that could be

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.210 
thing it's though a car that could be
bounced<00:02:30.570> it's<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.410> car<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.680> could<00:02:32.010> be

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
bounced it's a car that could be

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.820 
bounced it's a car that could be
recycled<00:02:33.380> because<00:02:34.670> yeah<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:35.970> how<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.830> I

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
recycled because yeah like how I do it I

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.350 
recycled because yeah like how I do it I
don't<00:02:37.890> think<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.400> tank<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.880> should<00:02:39.060> get<00:02:39.180> hit

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
don't think that tank you should get hit

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.790 
don't think that tank you should get hit
because<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.810> sell<00:02:40.050> was<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.380> because<00:02:40.590> of

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
because it can sell was all because of

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.710 
because it can sell was all because of
climate<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.220> piece<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.520> mainly<00:02:42.000> say<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.450> because

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
climate a piece I mainly say it because

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.050 
climate a piece I mainly say it because
of<00:02:42.840> fire<00:02:43.050> fist<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.130> think<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.850> just

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
of fire fist but I think that it just

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.390 
of fire fist but I think that it just
needs<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.330> be<00:02:45.510> put<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.020> one<00:02:46.200> yeah<00:02:46.710> that's<00:02:47.160> my

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
needs to be put to one yeah that's my

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.490 
needs to be put to one yeah that's my

issue putting it to why you should ban

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.630 
issue putting it to why you should ban
the<00:02:49.680> car<00:02:49.860> because<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.490> little

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.280 
the car because you know it's a little
too<00:02:50.820> much<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.300> not<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.630> big<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.050> threat
