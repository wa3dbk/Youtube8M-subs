00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
a little bit everyone's worried about

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.930 
a little bit everyone's worried about
Tom<00:06:42.860> Brady's<00:06:43.220> ankle<00:06:43.490> which<00:06:43.610> is<00:06:43.729> going<00:06:43.819> to<00:06:43.880> be

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
Tom Brady's ankle which is going to be

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.210 
Tom Brady's ankle which is going to be
fine<00:06:44.270> I<00:06:44.539> don't<00:06:45.199> know<00:06:45.349> what<00:06:45.560> you<00:06:45.590> know<00:06:45.800> the

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
fine I don't know what you know the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.290 
fine I don't know what you know the
point<00:06:46.460> spread<00:06:46.580> but<00:06:46.819> I<00:06:46.880> think<00:06:47.090> there's<00:06:47.210> going

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
point spread but I think there's going

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.960 
point spread but I think there's going
to<00:06:47.389> be<00:06:47.419> three<00:06:48.199> maximum<00:06:48.830> seven-point<00:06:49.460> game<00:06:49.669> and

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
to be three maximum seven-point game and

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.309 
to be three maximum seven-point game and
I<00:06:50.000> think<00:06:50.300> go<00:06:50.419> either<00:06:50.569> way<00:06:50.690> so<00:06:51.050> you<00:06:51.139> take<00:06:51.289> the

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 
I think go either way so you take the

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.830 
I think go either way so you take the
Giants<00:06:52.000> and<00:06:53.000> without<00:06:53.240> saying<00:06:53.569> is<00:06:53.660> we're<00:06:53.750> gonna

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
Giants and without saying is we're gonna
