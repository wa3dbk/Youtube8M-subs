00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.030

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.929
 watch an episode of exactly 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.650

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.850
 an apple juice 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.990
 Well of course we had the moment 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.899

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.340
 soapstone and we have we 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.960
 I thought you had samples 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.270
 very sweet for the rest I just have 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.580

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.979

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.700
 cool bag and I'm very happy 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.229
 now they have one of mine in a hurry 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.540
 favorites clothing stores and if me 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.650
 had picked out some nice items at 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.720
 to fit 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.490
 and this is a nice joke anyway 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.259
 him not too short so I thought well then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.810
 maybe he can 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.610
 and this I also bought there was one 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.290
 not another very nice shirt I have 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.590
 actually not that much in the plush 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.330
 mini 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.520
 no without it nice that you come on 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.080
 I also bought buttons 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.030
 This appeals to you the fact that I have one 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.280
 little about i found him a little too 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.020
 profi are still at the top 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.060
 in there so I have 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.180
 in the end not taken but the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.350
 I thought shoes were very beautiful 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.890
 I know your movie though I film myself 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.890

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.980
 really nice price here is just 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.730
 real things always around 30 euros and 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.620
 so 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.709
 and it really depends on beautiful fashion 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.090
 Clothing style art is the kids 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.030

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.340

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.980
 nice bleser care pass that i'm going to take 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.530
 and in that that now doubt about the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.810
 playsuit in wondering if it is or not 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.660

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.580

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.280
 to do 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.180
 and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.660

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.150

 I haven't returned to the station yet 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.470
 I then go back to Houten and what 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.540

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.500

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.940

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.200
 walk nicely in the train and then 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 enjoy the rest of the know now 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.460
 now you can go home where you still are 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.490
 briefly do not leave my lift on this 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.440
 see which tags we 've bought it's one 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.209
 bit of a hi fendt model 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.630
 he is longer he comes to 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.760
 halfway through my thigh and sitting here 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.320
 another gold button and another one here 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.000
 golden guide 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.460
 i just like nice model like me 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 rolling up my sleeves are white on the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.820
 inside I look nice 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.050
 and that is why I can do it very easily 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.420
 combine with a white shirt 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.970
 for example have to works and yes i do 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.530
 had not thought but this color 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.870
 that saw the grille that actually suits me 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.030
 pretty good guess it for each 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.280
 skin type is put away but maybe if 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.920
 you have a bit of a touch or just the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.750
 correct undertone if you are white or something 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.250
 so that we would know would be nice is here 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.000
 so if you see something like that you would be in the 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.590
 store 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.420
 yes I definitely recommend this for a while 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.250
 just adjust the color or check it out 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.840
 fits you and maybe it surprises you too 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.240
 sometimes like that it surprises me 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.920
 and furthermore I have the little things that I like 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.090
 purchased at lush I already have a one 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.160
 indicated 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.290
 and like I said, I myself have so 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.300
 bought your happy joy joy but small 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.490
 bottle because it is quite pricey 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.470
 I own the largest bottle at 500 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.290
 milliliter is really serious is about 60 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.250
 euro and this is something I believe about one 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.780
 ten 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.340
 and what I do is I use quite 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.510
 little bit in my hair really like hair 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.110
 partum 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.180
 and so we have one 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.130
 had a sibble from a bar of soap and 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.570
 that is based on beautiful what for 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.639
 cyan they get married and on the beach 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.400
 namely scrubbing itself with the sand 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.870
 so that's in this piece of soap 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.080
 you really delicious to lemon fruit 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.520
 they also have sand processed so that if yes 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.050

 the striped ones cost 995 and the with 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.620
