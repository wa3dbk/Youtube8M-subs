this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> reflection<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:13.079> my<00:01:13.320> camera<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this is not a reflection of my camera I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
this is not a reflection of my camera I
can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:14.790> eyes<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> look<00:01:15.390> up

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
can see it with my eyes if I look up

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
can see it with my eyes if I look up
it's<00:01:16.350> clearly<00:01:16.619> there

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

almost another some another light source

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:59.140 
almost another some another light source
it<00:01:37.630> seems<00:01:37.870> to<00:01:37.960> be<00:01:38.080> slowly<00:01:38.350> moving

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.070 

sort<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.410> clearly<00:02:27.740> see<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.950> spectrum<00:02:28.490> there

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.140 
the other clip I haven't done it yet but
enough<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.580> caught<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:43.850> earlier<00:02:45.430> but<00:02:46.430> while<00:02:47.000> I'm

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
enough I caught it earlier but while I'm

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.550 
enough I caught it earlier but while I'm
video<00:02:47.420> taping<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.990> can<00:02:48.140> still<00:02:48.410> see<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
video taping this you can still see the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.960 
video taping this you can still see the
progress<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:49.010> these<00:02:49.130> chem<00:02:49.340> trails<00:02:49.610> slowly

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
progress of these chem trails slowly

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.390 
progress of these chem trails slowly
spreading<00:02:50.570> out<00:02:50.810> it's<00:02:51.770> really<00:02:51.890> hard<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.220> notice

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
spreading out it's really hard to notice

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.490 
spreading out it's really hard to notice
when<00:02:52.760> you're<00:02:52.910> only<00:02:53.720> watching<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.440> a

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
when you're only watching it for a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.700 
when you're only watching it for a
little<00:02:54.590> bit<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.930> Sun<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.170> clearly<00:02:57.590> over

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
little bit so the Sun is clearly over

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.280 
little bit so the Sun is clearly over
here<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.720> clearly<00:03:00.140> enough<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:02.290> giant

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
here and that is clearly enough a giant

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.610 
here and that is clearly enough a giant
ball<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.560> light<00:03:07.810> some<00:03:08.810> people<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.140> straight

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
ball of light some people just straight

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.410 
ball of light some people just straight
in<00:03:09.890> there<00:03:10.100> do<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.400> looks<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.000> course<00:03:11.240> it's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
in there do it looks and of course it's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.910 
in there do it looks and of course it's
a<00:03:11.780> reflection<00:03:12.290> but<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.620> rare<00:03:12.890> and

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
a reflection but it's rare and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.230 
a reflection but it's rare and
it's<00:03:13.190> crazy<00:03:13.720> yeah<00:03:14.720> just<00:03:15.500> watching<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.160> see<00:03:17.120> if

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
it's crazy yeah just watching it see if

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.240 
it's crazy yeah just watching it see if
anything<00:03:17.510> cool<00:03:17.720> happens<00:03:18.140> cause<00:03:19.070> it's

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
anything cool happens cause it's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.650 
anything cool happens cause it's
starting<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:19.580> look<00:03:19.610> cooler<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.180> cooler<00:03:20.330> man

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
starting to look cooler and cooler man

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.140 
starting to look cooler and cooler man
look<00:03:20.930> at<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.140> spread<00:03:21.440> out<00:03:24.820> cific<00:03:25.820> an<00:03:25.940> time

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
look at it spread out cific an time

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.880 
look at it spread out cific an time
lapses<00:03:26.630> as<00:03:26.840> well
