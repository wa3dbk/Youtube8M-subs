hi<00:00:09.460> guys<00:00:09.639> down<00:00:10.030> here<00:00:10.059> and<00:00:10.510> welcome<00:00:10.750> to<00:00:11.019> BC<00:00:11.860> 404

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
hi guys down here and welcome to BC 404

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.999 
hi guys down here and welcome to BC 404
how<00:00:12.910> to<00:00:12.969> put<00:00:13.240> more<00:00:13.450> expression<00:00:14.349> into<00:00:14.860> your

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
how to put more expression into your

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.220 
how to put more expression into your
playing<00:00:15.400> so<00:00:16.209> we<00:00:16.270> ain't<00:00:16.450> quite<00:00:16.630> far<00:00:16.870> into<00:00:17.050> this

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
playing so we ain't quite far into this

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.870 
playing so we ain't quite far into this
course<00:00:17.590> now<00:00:17.860> if<00:00:18.100> you<00:00:18.220> don't<00:00:18.400> come<00:00:18.580> and<00:00:18.700> check

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
course now if you don't come and check

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.330 
course now if you don't come and check
out<00:00:19.210> my<00:00:19.390> website<00:00:19.420> and<00:00:20.020> Dan<00:00:20.230> Christian<00:00:20.710> dotnet

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
out my website and Dan Christian dotnet

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.610 
out my website and Dan Christian dotnet
definitely<00:00:21.760> do<00:00:21.940> so<00:00:22.210> it's<00:00:22.720> getting<00:00:23.050> quite<00:00:23.350> big

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
definitely do so it's getting quite big

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.940 
definitely do so it's getting quite big
these<00:00:23.860> days<00:00:23.890> and<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.630> putting<00:00:26.410> expression

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
these days and so putting expression

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.730 
these days and so putting expression
into<00:00:27.190> your<00:00:27.310> plane<00:00:27.630> probably<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:29.140> most

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
into your plane probably the most

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.040 
into your plane probably the most
effective<00:00:30.370> way<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.880> going<00:00:31.120> expression<00:00:31.780> into

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
effective way of going expression into

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.840 
effective way of going expression into
your<00:00:32.200> playing<00:00:32.410> is<00:00:32.619> I'm<00:00:32.800> an<00:00:32.890> experiment<00:00:33.610> with

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
your playing is I'm an experiment with

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.540 
your playing is I'm an experiment with
what<00:00:34.000> we<00:00:34.090> call<00:00:34.270> dynamics<00:00:34.989> now<00:00:35.739> dynamics<00:00:36.309> in<00:00:36.489> a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
what we call dynamics now dynamics in a

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.540 
what we call dynamics now dynamics in a
musical<00:00:36.999> sense<00:00:37.269> is<00:00:37.539> to<00:00:37.719> do<00:00:37.899> with<00:00:38.170> volume<00:00:38.550> so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
musical sense is to do with volume so

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.989 
musical sense is to do with volume so
how<00:00:39.999> loud<00:00:40.300> or<00:00:40.660> have<00:00:40.960> soft<00:00:41.320> we<00:00:41.589> play<00:00:41.859> now<00:00:42.760> on<00:00:42.879> the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
how loud or have soft we play now on the

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.700 
how loud or have soft we play now on the
saxophone<00:00:43.449> how<00:00:43.870> we<00:00:43.929> do<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.379> is<00:00:44.559> by

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
saxophone how we do that is by

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.160 
saxophone how we do that is by
controlling<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.550> amount<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.969> air<00:00:46.210> that<00:00:46.989> we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
controlling the amount of air that we

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.649 
controlling the amount of air that we
actually<00:00:47.559> blow<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.219> how<00:00:48.609> hard<00:00:48.999> we<00:00:49.239> actually

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
actually blow and how hard we actually

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.410 
actually blow and how hard we actually
blow<00:00:49.929> down<00:00:50.260> attack<00:00:50.620> spoons<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:51.999> what<00:00:52.179> we<00:00:52.300> want

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
blow down attack spoons so what we want

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.160 
blow down attack spoons so what we want
to<00:00:52.539> be<00:00:52.659> able<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:52.870> do<00:00:53.199> is<00:00:53.670> control<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
to be able to do is control and the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.930 
to be able to do is control and the
different<00:00:56.710> types<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.039> dynamics<00:00:57.550> but<00:00:57.729> also

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
different types of dynamics but also

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.229 
different types of dynamics but also
think<00:00:58.539> about<00:00:58.690> layering<00:00:59.679> your<00:01:00.010> dynamics<00:01:00.670> now

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
think about layering your dynamics now

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.660 
think about layering your dynamics now
by<00:01:01.389> layering<00:01:01.719> dynamics<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.559> mean<00:01:02.739> starting<00:01:03.489> off

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
by layering dynamics I mean starting off

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.440 
by layering dynamics I mean starting off
at<00:01:03.940> about<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:04.900> know<00:01:05.050> really<00:01:05.650> soft<00:01:06.120> then<00:01:07.120> a

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
at about you know really soft then a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.719 
at about you know really soft then a
little<00:01:07.840> bit<00:01:08.020> louder<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:08.740> maybe<00:01:09.100> moderately

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
little bit louder so maybe moderately

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.959 
little bit louder so maybe moderately
soft<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:11.140> up<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.590> step<00:01:11.829> again<00:01:12.189> to<00:01:12.430> model<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
soft then up a step again to model the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.690 
soft then up a step again to model the
loud<00:01:13.149> or<00:01:13.360> quite<00:01:13.600> loud<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.200> then<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.950> loud<00:01:15.159> and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
loud or quite loud and then to loud and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.280 
loud or quite loud and then to loud and
then<00:01:15.909> having<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.420> little<00:01:16.689> bit<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.020> tank

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
then having a little bit in the tank

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.609 
then having a little bit in the tank
left<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.829> be<00:01:17.979> very<00:01:18.549> loud<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.210> very<00:01:19.930> very<00:01:20.259> quiet

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
left to be very loud and very very quiet

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.670 
left to be very loud and very very quiet
and<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:22.090> best<00:01:22.390> players<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:23.200> you'll<00:01:23.350> hear

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
and the best players that you'll hear

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.770 
and the best players that you'll hear
are<00:01:23.920> those<00:01:24.430> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> most<00:01:24.909> expressive<00:01:25.240> players

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
are those in the most expressive players

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.859 
are those in the most expressive players
of<00:01:25.990> those<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.469> can<00:01:26.740> switch<00:01:27.610> between<00:01:28.299> these

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
of those that can switch between these

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.959 
of those that can switch between these
different<00:01:29.170> types<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.890> dynamics<00:01:30.430> but<00:01:30.880> you

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
different types of dynamics but you

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.819 
different types of dynamics but you
think<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.270> mean<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.659> was<00:01:31.780> playing<00:01:32.049> piano<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.680> now

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
think I mean I was playing piano and now

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.920 
think I mean I was playing piano and now
he's<00:01:32.950> playing<00:01:33.219> meta<00:01:33.609> beyond<00:01:33.939> it<00:01:34.149> nice<00:01:34.689> playing

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
he's playing meta beyond it nice playing

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.590 
he's playing meta beyond it nice playing
loud<00:01:35.170> oh<00:01:35.439> yeah<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.770> know<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:37.270> listen<00:01:37.509> to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
loud oh yeah you know and just listen to

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.450 
loud oh yeah you know and just listen to
Gerald<00:01:37.869> Albright<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:38.530> how<00:01:38.710> loud<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.310> house

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
Gerald Albright and how loud and house

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.069 
Gerald Albright and how loud and house
after<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:39.939> can<00:01:40.090> play<00:01:40.270> there's<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.570> great<00:01:40.780> truck

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
after you can play there's a great truck

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.840 
after you can play there's a great truck
he's<00:01:41.320> done<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.680> this<00:01:41.979> on<00:01:42.189> YouTube<00:01:42.579> called

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
he's done on this on YouTube called

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.700 
he's done on this on YouTube called
Georgia<00:01:43.240> on<00:01:43.390> my<00:01:43.420> mind<00:01:43.570> if<00:01:44.409> you<00:01:44.590> have<00:01:44.619> a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
Georgia on my mind if you have a

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.859 
Georgia on my mind if you have a
listened<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.789> has<00:01:46.060> pretty<00:01:46.509> much<00:01:46.689> the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
listened to that it has pretty much the

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.649 
listened to that it has pretty much the
whole<00:01:47.350> range<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:48.280> different<00:01:48.969> dynamic

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
whole range of different dynamic

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.510 
whole range of different dynamic
contrast<00:01:50.049> that<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.619> want<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:50.890> really<00:01:51.219> tune

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
contrast that we want to really tune

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.539 
contrast that we want to really tune
into<00:01:52.079> them<00:01:53.079> so<00:01:53.320> I'm<00:01:53.799> going<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.039> do<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.250> go<00:01:54.429> into

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
into them so I'm going to do is go into

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.340 
into them so I'm going to do is go into
that<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.179> ain't<00:01:55.600> no<00:01:55.719> sunshine<00:01:55.929> when<00:01:56.200> she's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
that and ain't no sunshine when she's

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.139 
that and ain't no sunshine when she's
gone<00:01:56.560> again<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.219> hope<00:01:57.369> you've<00:01:57.549> all<00:01:57.700> check<00:01:57.969> that

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
gone again I hope you've all check that

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.389

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
parts the first part is going to

parts the first part is going to
actually<00:02:24.970> play<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.270> main<00:02:26.020> tune<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.650> play<00:02:26.860> it

sort of a.m. and accompaniment or

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.589 
sort of a.m. and accompaniment or
another<00:02:35.650> player<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.160> background<00:02:36.610> do<00:02:36.940> you

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
another player in the background do you

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:55.190 
another player in the background do you
do<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.440> listen<00:02:38.680> what<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:38.830> mean<00:02:39.040> here

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.559 

and<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:57.159> really<00:02:57.489> effective<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.330> almost

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
and it's really effective it almost

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.600 
and it's really effective it almost
sounds<00:02:58.930> like<00:02:58.989> elders<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.680> me<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:00.280> but<00:03:00.459> it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
sounds like elders just me here but it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.039 
sounds like elders just me here but it
sounds<00:03:00.849> like<00:03:00.970> there's<00:03:01.150> two<00:03:01.330> people<00:03:01.569> sort<00:03:01.989> of

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
sounds like there's two people sort of

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.390 
sounds like there's two people sort of
playing<00:03:02.379> between<00:03:02.830> each<00:03:02.980> other

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
playing between each other

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.699 
playing between each other
now<00:03:03.610> that's<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:04.000> very<00:03:04.330> expressive<00:03:04.840> thing<00:03:05.349> to<00:03:05.560> do

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
now that's a very expressive thing to do

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.190 
now that's a very expressive thing to do
so<00:03:06.519> what<00:03:06.819> I'd<00:03:06.940> like<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.360> do<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.780> all<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
so what I'd like you to do is all the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.360 
so what I'd like you to do is all the
tunes<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.560> you've<00:03:08.739> learned<00:03:08.980> through<00:03:09.190> this

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
tunes that you've learned through this

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.699 
tunes that you've learned through this
course<00:03:09.670> or<00:03:09.879> any<00:03:10.030> tunes<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:10.690> know<00:03:10.930> start

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
course or any tunes that you know start

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.339 
course or any tunes that you know start
experimenting<00:03:12.220> with<00:03:12.610> some<00:03:12.910> dynamics<00:03:13.480> now<00:03:13.720> so

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
experimenting with some dynamics now so

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.490 
experimenting with some dynamics now so
some<00:03:14.620> options<00:03:15.099> for<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.430> do<00:03:15.730> are<00:03:16.349> say<00:03:17.349> we

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
some options for you to do are say we

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.080 
some options for you to do are say we
start<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.340> node<00:03:18.549> turn<00:03:18.849> B<00:03:20.700> see<00:03:21.700> if<00:03:21.760> we<00:03:21.909> can

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
start on the node turn B see if we can

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.160 
start on the node turn B see if we can
bring<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.510> note<00:03:22.690> B<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.079> as<00:03:23.260> quietly<00:03:23.829> as<00:03:24.010> we<00:03:24.069> can

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.979 

and<00:03:29.170> then<00:03:29.379> grow<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.160> get<00:03:30.579> like<00:03:31.150> gradually

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
and then grow and get like gradually

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:50.440 
and then grow and get like gradually
louder

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.149 

so<00:03:51.450> I'm<00:03:51.569> getting<00:03:51.750> used<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.079> those<00:03:52.290> controlling

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
so I'm getting used to those controlling

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.349 
so I'm getting used to those controlling
how<00:03:53.340> much<00:03:53.400> air<00:03:53.700> I'm<00:03:53.849> putting<00:03:54.120> down<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
how much air I'm putting down the

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.839 
how much air I'm putting down the
saxophone<00:03:54.900> starting<00:03:55.739> really<00:03:56.189> really<00:03:56.459> softly

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
saxophone starting really really softly

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.899 
saxophone starting really really softly
getting<00:03:57.659> much<00:03:57.959> louder<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:59.280> as<00:03:59.340> loud<00:03:59.579> as<00:03:59.819> I

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
getting much louder so as loud as I

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.030 
getting much louder so as loud as I
possibly<00:04:00.359> can<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.900> then<00:04:01.200> coming<00:04:01.590> back<00:04:01.620> down

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
possibly can and then coming back down

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.069 
possibly can and then coming back down
again<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.670> good<00:04:03.060> way<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.299> do<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.840> if<00:04:03.930> you've

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
again a good way to do this is if you've

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.780 
again a good way to do this is if you've
got<00:04:04.109> one<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.709> do<00:04:04.859> it<00:04:04.920> with<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> tuner<00:04:05.370> as<00:04:05.579> well

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
got one is to do it with a tuner as well

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.699 
got one is to do it with a tuner as well
because<00:04:06.090> you'll<00:04:06.239> find<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.720> as<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.470> when

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
because you'll find that as you when

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.589 
because you'll find that as you when
tightening<00:04:08.400> up<00:04:08.489> your<00:04:08.519> embouchure<00:04:08.879> because<00:04:09.420> of

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
tightening up your embouchure because of

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.300 
tightening up your embouchure because of
the<00:04:09.689> amount<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.019> pressure<00:04:10.290> you'll<00:04:10.889> often<00:04:11.040> end

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the amount of pressure you'll often end

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.490 
the amount of pressure you'll often end
up<00:04:11.430> by<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.609> grain<00:04:11.849> sharp<00:04:12.239> or<00:04:12.480> flat<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:13.109> of

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
up by the grain sharp or flat and of

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.110 
up by the grain sharp or flat and of
course<00:04:13.739> that's<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.069> bad<00:04:14.219> thing<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.639> want<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:14.909> be

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
course that's a bad thing we want to be

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.599 
course that's a bad thing we want to be
keeping<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.109> in<00:04:16.350> tune<00:04:16.859> as<00:04:17.009> possible<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:17.549> if

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
keeping is in tune as possible so if

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.370 
keeping is in tune as possible so if
you've<00:04:17.729> got<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.880> tuner<00:04:18.299> definitely<00:04:18.959> use<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.229> for

up<00:06:14.389> to<00:06:14.689> forte<00:06:15.199> and<00:06:15.469> then<00:06:15.560> come<00:06:15.800> back<00:06:15.830> down<00:06:16.189> to

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
up to forte and then come back down to

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:17.230 
up to forte and then come back down to
piano<00:06:16.699> again

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
piano again

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.769 
piano again
this<00:06:17.599> way<00:06:17.930> I'll<00:06:18.169> get<00:06:18.409> a<00:06:18.439> really<00:06:19.159> nice<00:06:19.789> M<00:06:20.180> way<00:06:20.629> of

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
this way I'll get a really nice M way of

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.200 
this way I'll get a really nice M way of
expressing<00:06:21.560> and<00:06:21.889> putting<00:06:22.159> dynamics<00:06:22.669> into<00:06:23.090> my

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
expressing and putting dynamics into my

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.760 
expressing and putting dynamics into my
phrases<00:06:23.659> and<00:06:23.840> then<00:06:23.960> we<00:06:24.080> can<00:06:24.229> implement<00:06:24.319> this

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
phrases and then we can implement this

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.290 
phrases and then we can implement this
into<00:06:25.069> pieces<00:06:25.249> and<00:06:25.580> you'll<00:06:25.669> find<00:06:25.939> your<00:06:26.120> site

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
into pieces and you'll find your site

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.129 
into pieces and you'll find your site
playing<00:06:26.599> they'll<00:06:26.719> get<00:06:26.840> a<00:06:26.870> lot<00:06:27.110> more

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
playing they'll get a lot more

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.950 
playing they'll get a lot more
expressive<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:28.340> sound<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.639> lot<00:06:28.729> better<00:06:28.789> so<00:06:29.389> I'm

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
expressive and sound a lot better so I'm

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.339 
expressive and sound a lot better so I'm
going<00:06:30.169> to<00:06:30.199> start<00:06:30.500> my<00:06:30.650> scale<00:06:31.189> at<00:06:31.340> piano<00:06:31.669> or

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
going to start my scale at piano or

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.670 
going to start my scale at piano or
amsoft<00:06:33.639> grow<00:06:34.639> to<00:06:35.090> do<00:06:35.509> Shindo<00:06:35.960> right<00:06:36.349> up<00:06:36.500> to

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
amsoft grow to do Shindo right up to

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.350 
amsoft grow to do Shindo right up to
full<00:06:36.919> at<00:06:37.039> a<00:06:37.189> when<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.400> reach<00:06:37.639> the<00:06:37.669> top<00:06:37.879> of<00:06:38.270> my

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
full at a when I reach the top of my

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.209 
full at a when I reach the top of my
scales<00:06:38.659> for<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:38.990> peak<00:06:39.229> of<00:06:39.409> my<00:06:39.560> phrase<00:06:39.830> if<00:06:40.099> you

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
scales for the peak of my phrase if you

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:41.619 
scales for the peak of my phrase if you
like<00:06:40.430> and<00:06:40.849> I'm<00:06:40.909> going<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.090> come<00:06:41.210> right<00:06:41.360> down<00:06:41.479> on

like and I'm going to come right down on

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:55.809 
like and I'm going to come right down on
yourself<00:06:41.930> again<00:06:42.080> just<00:06:42.469> like<00:06:42.590> this<00:06:54.699> so<00:06:55.699> it's

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819 
yourself again just like this so it's

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.489 
yourself again just like this so it's
nice<00:06:56.029> we're<00:06:56.270> practicing<00:06:56.659> a<00:06:56.839> scale<00:06:57.080> so<00:06:57.259> all<00:06:57.379> the

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:57.499 
nice we're practicing a scale so all the

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.050 
nice we're practicing a scale so all the
scales<00:06:57.710> that<00:06:57.860> you<00:06:57.919> know<00:06:58.099> so<00:06:58.339> far<00:06:58.639> you<00:06:58.849> mean<00:06:58.969> the

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
scales that you know so far you mean the

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.029 
scales that you know so far you mean the
D<00:06:59.210> blues<00:06:59.449> and<00:06:59.689> things<00:06:59.900> have<00:07:00.349> an<00:07:00.439> experiment

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 
D blues and things have an experiment

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.490 
D blues and things have an experiment
maybe<00:07:01.189> start<00:07:01.639> it<00:07:01.849> loud<00:07:02.060> row<00:07:02.629> four<00:07:02.870> soft<00:07:03.110> and

grow back down to light again started

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.260 
grow back down to light again started
mud<00:07:05.870> really<00:07:06.139> soft<00:07:06.409> Grove<00:07:07.009> to<00:07:07.219> model<00:07:07.879> it<00:07:07.969> aloud

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
mud really soft Grove to model it aloud

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.269 
mud really soft Grove to model it aloud
and<00:07:08.300> then<00:07:08.750> come<00:07:08.900> right<00:07:09.020> down<00:07:09.139> to<00:07:09.289> Anna<00:07:09.439> MP<00:07:10.009> and

and then come right down to Anna MP and

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.279 
and then come right down to Anna MP and
model<00:07:10.939> this<00:07:11.029> off<00:07:11.240> so<00:07:11.689> have<00:07:11.779> a<00:07:11.839> little<00:07:12.050> bit<00:07:12.169> of

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
model this off so have a little bit of

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.200 
model this off so have a little bit of
an<00:07:12.379> experiment<00:07:12.919> with<00:07:13.069> dynamics<00:07:13.550> and<00:07:13.759> this

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
an experiment with dynamics and this

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.760 
an experiment with dynamics and this
will<00:07:14.330> put<00:07:14.479> a<00:07:14.509> lot<00:07:14.689> more<00:07:14.719> expression<00:07:15.439> into<00:07:15.680> your

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
will put a lot more expression into your

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.700 
will put a lot more expression into your
