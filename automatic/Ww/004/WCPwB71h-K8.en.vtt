this demonstration is a Toshiba c6 60
this<00:00:32.150> is<00:00:32.300> my<00:00:32.419> work<00:00:32.660> laptop<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.350> Intel<00:00:33.620> Core<00:00:33.770> i5

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
this is my work laptop the Intel Core i5

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.040 
this is my work laptop the Intel Core i5
in<00:00:34.430> that<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:34.940> I'm<00:00:35.120> upgrading<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:35.630> from<00:00:35.840> a<00:00:35.900> two

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
in that and I'm upgrading it from a two

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.840 
in that and I'm upgrading it from a two
and<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.200> half<00:00:36.320> inch<00:00:36.530> mechanical<00:00:37.040> drive<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.700> the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
and a half inch mechanical drive to the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.700 
and a half inch mechanical drive to the
Sun<00:00:38.300> disk<00:00:38.480> ultra<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.140> then<00:00:39.290> 20<00:00:39.560> GB

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
Sun disk ultra and then 20 GB

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
Sun disk ultra and then 20 GB
solid-state<00:00:40.040> drive

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
solid-state drive

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.130 
solid-state drive
now<00:00:41.149> I'm<00:00:41.270> not<00:00:41.329> grading<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.720> for<00:00:41.899> many<00:00:42.050> reasons

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
now I'm not grading it for many reasons

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.990 
now I'm not grading it for many reasons
one<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.890> primary<00:00:43.190> ones<00:00:43.520> being<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:43.820> do

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
one of the primary ones being I do

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400 
one of the primary ones being I do
actually<00:00:44.300> travel<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.660> lot<00:00:44.780> with<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.050> laptop

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
actually travel a lot with the laptop

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.500 
actually travel a lot with the laptop
and<00:00:45.620> obviously<00:00:46.280> solid<00:00:46.700> state<00:00:46.880> drives<00:00:47.120> travel

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
and obviously solid state drives travel

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.000 
and obviously solid state drives travel
a<00:00:47.570> lot<00:00:47.780> better<00:00:48.020> than<00:00:48.140> mechanical<00:00:48.560> drives<00:00:48.770> do

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
a lot better than mechanical drives do

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.720 
a lot better than mechanical drives do
so<00:00:49.610> yeah<00:00:49.850> we<00:00:50.000> don't<00:00:50.060> be<00:00:50.180> upgrading<00:00:50.510> that<00:00:50.540> so<00:00:51.730> um

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
so yeah we don't be upgrading that so um

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.640 
so yeah we don't be upgrading that so um
the<00:00:53.330> first<00:00:53.540> thing<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:53.780> want<00:00:53.990> to<00:00:54.020> do<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.380> flip

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
the first thing we want to do is flip

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.410 
the first thing we want to do is flip
the<00:00:54.800> laptop<00:00:54.920> upside<00:00:55.430> down<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.120> actually

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
the laptop upside down and actually

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.150 
the laptop upside down and actually
remove<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.870> battery<00:00:57.230> just<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.860> make<00:00:57.980> sure

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
remove the battery just to make sure

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.380 
remove the battery just to make sure
that<00:00:58.280> there's<00:00:58.460> no<00:00:58.580> power<00:00:58.790> going<00:00:59.030> through<00:00:59.180> any

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
that there's no power going through any

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.610 
that there's no power going through any
other<00:00:59.450> components<00:01:00.050> when<00:01:00.200> we<00:01:00.320> reach<00:01:00.470> down

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
other components when we reach down

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.160 
other components when we reach down
removing<00:01:01.010> stuff<00:01:01.250> now<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.540> general<00:01:02.840> rule<00:01:02.870> of

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
removing stuff now the general rule of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.960 
removing stuff now the general rule of
thumb<00:01:03.380> is<00:01:03.650> you<00:01:03.710> will<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:03.950> removable<00:01:04.610> panels

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
thumb is you will have removable panels

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.149 
thumb is you will have removable panels
that<00:01:05.420> cover<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:06.170> components<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:06.950> were

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
that cover the components that were

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.920 
that cover the components that were
wanting<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.520> get<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.450> on<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.720> laptop

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
wanting to get to now on this laptop

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.050 
wanting to get to now on this laptop
it's<00:01:09.259> a<00:01:09.439> single<00:01:09.860> panel<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.340> screw<00:01:10.880> that

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's a single panel and screw that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.940 
it's a single panel and screw that
covers<00:01:11.420> everything<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.560> memory<00:01:12.799> of<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
covers everything the memory of the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.219 
covers everything the memory of the
network<00:01:13.220> out<00:01:13.430> etc<00:01:13.579> now<00:01:14.540> on<00:01:14.630> your<00:01:14.810> laptop<00:01:15.110> it

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
network out etc now on your laptop it

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.690 
network out etc now on your laptop it
may<00:01:15.350> be<00:01:15.409> a<00:01:15.530> little<00:01:15.740> bit<00:01:15.950> different<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.490> may

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
may be a little bit different you may

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.609 
may be a little bit different you may
have<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.939> panel<00:01:17.420> for<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.630> memory<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.140> then<00:01:18.530> a

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
have a panel for the memory and then a

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.739 
have a panel for the memory and then a
separate<00:01:19.009> panel<00:01:19.250> for<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.460> hard<00:01:19.609> drive<00:01:19.850> but<00:01:20.659> in

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
separate panel for the hard drive but in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.330 
separate panel for the hard drive but in
this<00:01:20.810> one<00:01:20.960> we've<00:01:21.109> just<00:01:21.289> got<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.409> one<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.280> I'm

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
this one we've just got a one so I'm

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.520 
this one we've just got a one so I'm
going<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.520> remove<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:22.999> screw<00:01:23.319> like<00:01:24.319> I<00:01:24.380> say

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to remove this screw like I say

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.200 
going to remove this screw like I say
you<00:01:24.590> may<00:01:24.829> also<00:01:25.009> have<00:01:25.280> more<00:01:25.520> than<00:01:25.609> one<00:01:25.759> screw<00:01:26.060> as

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
you may also have more than one screw as

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.800 
you may also have more than one screw as
well<00:01:26.479> but<00:01:27.079> principles<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.219> same<00:01:28.630> since<00:01:29.630> we

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
well but principles the same since we

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.209 
well but principles the same since we
remove<00:01:30.079> this<00:01:31.450> pop<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.719> one<00:01:32.749> side<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.380> you

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
remove this pop that to one side and you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.590 
remove this pop that to one side and you
can<00:01:34.369> see<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.700> two<00:01:35.149> and<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.299> half<00:01:35.420> inch

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
can see the two and a half inch

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.749 
can see the two and a half inch
mechanical<00:01:36.079> drive<00:01:36.289> there<00:01:36.590> now<00:01:37.159> sometimes<00:01:37.639> you

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
mechanical drive there now sometimes you

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.520 
mechanical drive there now sometimes you
have<00:01:37.909> retaining<00:01:38.389> screws<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:38.869> hold<00:01:39.079> these<00:01:39.289> in

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
have retaining screws that hold these in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.349 
have retaining screws that hold these in
so<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.889> best<00:01:40.009> thing<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:40.219> do<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.759> try<00:01:41.240> and

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
so the best thing to do is just try and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.230 
so the best thing to do is just try and
remove<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.840> drive<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:42.439> if<00:01:42.590> for<00:01:42.679> any<00:01:42.740> reason

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
remove the drive and if for any reason

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.090
