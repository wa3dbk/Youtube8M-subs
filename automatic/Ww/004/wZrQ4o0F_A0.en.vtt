this<00:01:12.909> prison<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:15.500> chains<00:01:15.890> hold<00:01:16.250> heavy<00:01:16.520> on<00:01:16.700> my

soul now and I can only imagine the pain

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.179 
soul now and I can only imagine the pain
that<00:01:20.270> this<00:01:20.840> bondage<00:01:21.319> has<00:01:21.499> in<00:01:21.710> store<00:01:22.009> for<00:01:22.069> me<00:01:22.310> I

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
that this bondage has in store for me I

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.039 
that this bondage has in store for me I
had<00:01:25.189> a<00:01:25.219> good<00:01:25.460> run<00:01:25.700> keeping<00:01:26.210> away<00:01:26.450> from<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:26.810> a

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
had a good run keeping away from it a

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.480 
had a good run keeping away from it a
lot<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:28.069> us<00:01:28.189> did<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:30.530> seems<00:01:30.889> in<00:01:31.100> recent

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
lot of us did but it seems in recent

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.879 
lot of us did but it seems in recent
years<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.659> power<00:01:32.960> of<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.319> enemy<00:01:33.530> has

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
years that the power of the enemy has

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:39.639 
years that the power of the enemy has
grown<00:01:34.280> beyond<00:01:34.700> all<00:01:35.030> fathomable<00:01:35.990> levels<00:01:38.649> we

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
grown beyond all fathomable levels we

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.390 
grown beyond all fathomable levels we
have<00:01:40.310> lost

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
have lost

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.360 
have lost
and<00:01:43.120> it<00:01:43.270> seems<00:01:43.660> that<00:01:43.840> our<00:01:43.990> only<00:01:44.260> destiny<00:01:45.010> is<00:01:45.160> to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
and it seems that our only destiny is to

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.200 
and it seems that our only destiny is to
be<00:01:45.520> captured<00:01:46.420> by<00:01:46.570> these<00:01:46.890> tyrants<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.220> forced

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
be captured by these tyrants and forced

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.780 
be captured by these tyrants and forced
to<00:01:49.330> fire<00:01:49.750> our<00:01:49.930> own<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.470> dogs<00:01:50.980> for<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.580> rest

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
to fire our own like dogs for the rest

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.890 
to fire our own like dogs for the rest
of<00:01:51.910> eternity<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.700> hard<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.030> imagine<00:01:55.330> for<00:01:55.600> me

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
of eternity it's hard to imagine for me

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.650 
of eternity it's hard to imagine for me
really<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.760> thought<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:57.790> sooner<00:01:58.510> or<00:01:58.540> later

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
really the thought that sooner or later

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.740 
really the thought that sooner or later
I'll<00:01:59.140> be<00:01:59.290> out<00:01:59.440> there<00:01:59.740> attacking<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.880> harming

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
I'll be out there attacking and harming

I'll be out there attacking and harming
my<00:02:01.870> own<00:02:02.020> people<00:02:02.350> against<00:02:02.980> my<00:02:03.160> will<00:02:03.720> if<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.870> can

it's<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.540> funny<00:02:10.780> thing<00:02:10.899> how<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.740> process

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.730 
it's a funny thing how this process
works

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
works

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.980
