00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.220
 surely you know the story 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.770
 the old man and the sea there describes 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.750
 a hemingway the fight of an angler 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.570
 with the biggest beginning of his life 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.950
 fish that almost kills him like that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.450
 it is dramatic with big fischer 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.220
 peter merkl not but they will 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.259
 Immediately make eyes for brunner 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 He has brought land to the world 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.849
 aside or walla as he also called 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.340
 It can be over two meters long 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 be and almost 100 kilo ours 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 fish is not that easy 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.270
 beaten 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.489
 rolf fritz was with the world hunter 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.660
 the neckar on the way 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.440
 now I have the same 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.559
 dinghy 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.570
 I have to be careful about the hage 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.570
 because they can take ice on a fishing train 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.480
 I extra with the fish I have about 35 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.539
 fought for minutes that was in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.719
 southern france on the small rhone 1 2 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.719
 meter 35 was 90 kilos heavy 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.520
 if we are lucky we meet 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.920
 today also such a monstrosity peter 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.380
 merkl the world hunter has heard him 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.630
 last eight the huge splash as 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.470
 The ball after his prey jumped there 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 he wants to go 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.840
 in two hours the twilight begins 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.939
 hunter's time neckar somewhere 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.460
 between eberbach and here already the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.590
 lining of a big whale den 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.590
 merkel has been following for three nights 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.299
 it is always the case , for example 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.460
 no people come here is not 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.590
 away or so here he chooses his rest 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.479
 he can hide here and that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.509
 are actually also encountered hotspots 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.789
 There is no fish species in the fresh water 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.590
 in germany where so big 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.740
 can and that is fascinating 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.640
 size the strength the hidden and it 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.100
 is the king of the fisherman 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.130
 who wants to catch him has to outsmart 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.549
 Merkel has a lot of experience with it 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.200
 I now let the bait fish more 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.170
 smell in the water develops a bit 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.390
 blood runs out waller have one 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.910
 excellent sense of smell injured 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.450
 Fish waterfowl and carcass smell 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:30.799
 you over long distances 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.080
 that's my secret weapon that is 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.090
 normal kapisa probably can not resist 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.340
 can 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.100
 trick number two the bait needs to go far 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.500
 away from the boat because the forest is everything 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.440
 the throw of the anchor and the steps of the anchor 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.690
 will ban anglers in the boat near 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.609
 Never is usually so 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.829
 I have inflatable boat around the 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.910
 montage and my bait as far as 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.819
 possible to draw 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.069
 Peter Merkel is one for the big ones 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.799
 fish the eberbacher writes for 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.200
 angler magazine and works as an author 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:08.510
 guide throughout europe his best friend 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.120
 terrier anton hunting always with that one 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.260
 beautiful girls is at 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:18.819
 We have done our best thing 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.819
 to have and rest 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.540
 And so you wait an hour and a half 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:57.950
 hours just under two hours then it does 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.950
 suddenly what now 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.590
 it was the trout with garlic 20 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.580
 minutes then merkel and the world will fight 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.580
 it is time 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.490
 1 meter 70 tall 40 kilo heavy 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.229
 for the mega was really great 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:08.490
 Fish as in a normal frying pan 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.810
 However, he does not fit the most 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.310
 The dog is happy about it there she has 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.310
 but also really diligent with suitable
