00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
zero point system basically what happens

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.169 
zero point system basically what happens
is<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.259> guitar<00:01:36.590> stays<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.550> tune<00:01:37.789> no<00:01:38.000> matter

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179
