 and he had friends from youtube 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.950
 here the white the match once more 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.740
 here I come to bring you 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.190
 a little tutorial on what is the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.190
 new app 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.830
 j 25 34 toolbox 3 this 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.930
 we are not going to talk a bit about computer 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.270
 with other points that I will not be 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.270
 preparing for that but today I want 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.590
 the announcement of the new application for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 the reprogramming of computers 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.580
 the cars this applies to all 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.200
 those people who have the equipment 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.200
 to program under law j 25 34 that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.050
 is called 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.360
 534 and for all those who have those 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.750
 teams whether the cards 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.390
 snap-on pro 2 is diagnosed two good 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.580
 the amounts good everyone who knows what 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.230
 I'm talking, they know what I'm 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.780
 nt talking about the new structure 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.780
 fee 25 34 toolbox 3 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 and you will find it on the page 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.900
 by drew tech 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.700
 you will find it on the page 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.159
 drew tech and this 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.320
 you will be able to download this image 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.759
 new then you have to register here 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.679
 with the cars that were cut of m post 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.560
 true connected cars and connected to 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.990
 your computer or mongoose so that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.970
 update once and register them 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.520
 that's where we are 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.070
 for all those, really, 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.530
 that have the routers or the caldas as 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.910
 they know each other 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.170
 you are going to go to the page of jotas 25-34 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.560
 dot com 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.770
 on the drew tech page 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.480
 that everyone who has andrew t with the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.240
 he rode anyone by any of the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.010
 teams 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.610
 you already know this page is this 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.310
 tutorial is for those people who 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.680
 they have this that the one who can not instruct 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.510
 I know that there was an automotive technician who 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.510
 it was here in the down low area 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.080
 but here although you are going to take the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.760
 areas that you are going to lower 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.630
 In my case, what I have is letter 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.930
 explore and change to version 1.9 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.120
 points 34 if you have it installed already 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.750
 only that you are going to lower the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.300
 new driver and so it is for 32 or for 64 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.980
 bits if you do not have it installed what 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.370
 will install for the first time in a 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.510
 new computer but you give it here 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 and low the full city 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.540
 the same with the caldas m that from the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.540
 another modified version 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:20.220
 and the jota 25-34 toolbox 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:25.260
 3 - here that is the first one that I change to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.040
 version 3.2 points 0.6 which 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.810
 version was 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.110
 1.3 point 15 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.490
 so 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.490
 here to think it came out here 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.300
 of a fairly large jump so the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.800
 fifth the work why a new 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.090
 film 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.010
 that we did not bring 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.280
 deser 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.550
 the central axis to show you 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.310
 in what that enters already entered right away 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.850
 but as you want let me enter in signal 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.850
 balance 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.330
 of the team that I fought I'm talking 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.019
 of those who have this or the astride snap 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.239
 two 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.609
 but it is preferable to use it with the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.590
 with technology or equipment 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.750
 tribute 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.810
 so it's very good to recommend only 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.300
 a number one so he invests in his 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.169
 team 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.020
 so you can see it 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.300
 the program of your things has more or 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.800
 less the same appearance of al 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 beginning 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.490
 what 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.830
 the diagnostic part with the brand 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.039
 not every one since then there may have been 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.039
 used 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.730
 diagnostic area has to verify 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.390
 the code the vehicle information and 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:03.100
 the dvd monitoring system 26 and last 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.100
 if it happened or did not pass now test 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.779
 in your pool here you verify the 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.909
 installation 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:13.969
 check the installation was installed well 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.219
 here always before programming in 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.289
 vehicle check you from there with this one and 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.449
 you give connection check and it will appear 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:25.249
 here if you are communicating at least 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:27.409
 with the engine computer that here in 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.710
 device ex always do this before 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.150
 start some programming 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.920
 before reprogramming any 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.300
 computer always do this first 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:41.080
 for you to confirm that your computer 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.930
 his cake is communicating with the 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.509
 carriage communication with the truth bus 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.889
 and pee and there are voices fields or ellis or 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.620
 any of the communications that 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.490
 have is communicating before 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.180
 you start 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.680
 to program and have an error in 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:05.940
 device and here is where you are going to 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:08.990
 check if your star in this case 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.730
 drew text only 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.980
 what I'm teaching is for Andrew 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:17.830
 text only to the company andrew t 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.830
 the cardiac or the amounts 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.450
 here you select your team and 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.450
 you check if you have of day 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.030
 and you are going to give him here to see follows the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.940
 autohotel instructions and he's going to 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.340
 verify if your framework your soft your 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.990
 team inside your programming has 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.210
 key update 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.450
 here, it has the highest sales 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:46.890
 plus the amounts but they changed 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:49.610
 Now he improved caldas m came out 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.690
 the new one just for him the same 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.960
 change a structure of this more 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.120
 small but does the same thing the same 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.680
 letter exploded is not going to be removed until 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.509
 the moment 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.509
 ok so 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.330
 I recommend you see it in 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.979
 verify and test 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.590
 we have here a new area that says 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.590
 rich 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:27.670
 that here you select the car in 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.670
 bake the prof there is up here 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.710
 the brand and model will be selected 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.539
 everything and will tell you to continue recall without 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.639
 need to enter the page 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:42.280
 of good manufacturers will tell you the 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:45.340
 number b and at least what it is about 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.650
 so it's a very good option for you 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.930
 to verify see it 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.210
 if your car that is diagnosing then 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.159
 have a problem and the forum 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.569
 here you write candles since you know 

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:58.830
 what is a report that can not 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:01.050
 comment and share ideas ok 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.240
 so that's all I hope you have 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.740
 liked as his friends say goodbye here 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.740
 match so until next time
