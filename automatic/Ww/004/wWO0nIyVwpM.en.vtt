00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.920 
and most of all we could have been sold
closer<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.489> home<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.360> didn't<00:03:37.660> have<00:03:37.690> to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
closer to home so we didn't have to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.400
