00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
bit smaller than my own lips but I can

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
make it bigger I don't want to have qpp
lips<00:01:30.760> unless<00:01:31.060> that's<00:01:31.240> what<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.570> do

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
lips unless that's what you do

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.460 
lips unless that's what you do
but<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.310> mime<00:01:33.580> has<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.120> look<00:01:34.270> pretty<00:01:34.930> much<00:01:35.170> as

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
but the mime has to look pretty much as

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.950 
but the mime has to look pretty much as
you<00:01:36.190> normally<00:01:36.640> look<00:01:36.880> except<00:01:37.600> you've<00:01:37.780> got

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960

you normally look except you've got
makeup<00:01:38.830> on<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.310> it's<00:01:39.640> amplified<00:01:40.450> once<00:01:41.140> again

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
makeup on and it's amplified once again

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.230 
makeup on and it's amplified once again
that's<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.830> whole<00:01:42.070> trick<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.670> makeup<00:01:43.060> is

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
to have it so it's amplified so now this

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.460 
to have it so it's amplified so now this
is<00:01:48.460> how<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.390> how<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.540> standard<00:01:49.930> makeup

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470
