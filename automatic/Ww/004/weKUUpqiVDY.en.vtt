00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
charges ridiculously fast seriously I

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.720 
charges ridiculously fast seriously I
had<00:00:37.329> it<00:00:37.449> charged<00:00:37.780> for<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.430> stuck<00:00:39.430> it<00:00:39.519> in<00:00:39.640> there

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
had it charged for a stuck it in there

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.610 
had it charged for a stuck it in there
for<00:00:39.910> about<00:00:39.940> 15<00:00:40.449> minutes<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:40.840> I<00:00:40.930> could<00:00:41.170> start

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
for about 15 minutes and I could start

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.770 
for about 15 minutes and I could start
the<00:00:41.710> thing<00:00:41.829> up<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.760> did<00:00:43.059> let<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.269> charge<00:00:43.570> for

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
the thing up I did let it charge for

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.930 
the thing up I did let it charge for
about<00:00:43.929> an<00:00:44.170> hour<00:00:44.429> so<00:00:45.429> here<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:45.760> have<00:00:45.789> your

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
about an hour so here you have your

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.479 
about an hour so here you have your
on/off<00:00:46.210> switch<00:00:46.859> I'm<00:00:47.859> going<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.190> see<00:00:48.309> if<00:00:48.339> I

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
on/off switch I'm going to see if I

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.770 
on/off switch I'm going to see if I
can't<00:00:48.760> get<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.120> focus<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.510> little<00:00:49.629> bit

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
can't get that to focus a little bit

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.369 
can't get that to focus a little bit
better<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:55.420> some<00:00:55.570> reason<00:00:55.809> my<00:00:55.899> camera<00:00:56.199> does

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
better for some reason my camera does

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.110 
better for some reason my camera does
not<00:00:56.589> want<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:56.890> flip<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.129> right<00:00:57.370> now<00:00:57.519> anyways

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
not want to flip this right now anyways

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.750 
not want to flip this right now anyways
so<00:00:58.660> here's<00:00:58.870> your<00:00:58.989> on/off<00:00:59.170> switch<00:00:59.679> it<00:01:00.280> runs<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
so here's your on/off switch it runs to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.540 
so here's your on/off switch it runs to
the<00:01:03.879> left<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.110> right<00:01:06.150> okay<00:01:07.150> and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
to be doing right now and just to make

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.640 
to be doing right now and just to make
this<00:02:45.640> simple<00:02:46.060> I'm<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.019> say<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.380> these

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
this simple I'm going to say that these

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.520 
this simple I'm going to say that these
are<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.069> modes<00:02:48.370> up<00:02:49.000> here<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.660> these<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
are the modes up here and these are the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.430 
are the modes up here and these are the
settings<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:52.150> you've<00:02:52.330> got<00:02:52.360> six<00:02:53.200> different

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
settings so you've got six different

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.520 
settings so you've got six different
modes<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.370> can<00:02:54.580> choose<00:02:54.790> from<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.530> all

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
of these settings under those modes so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.059 
of these settings under those modes so
to<00:03:02.500> get<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:03.569> each<00:03:04.569> separate<00:03:05.080> mode<00:03:05.410> you're
