your hair you're going to want to create

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.150 
your hair you're going to want to create
it<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.350> by<00:00:22.380> using<00:00:22.890> a

thermal protecting spray and a clipless

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.339 
thermal protecting spray and a clipless
iron<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:26.970> wrapping<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> hair<00:00:28.080> around

iron and just wrapping the hair around
the<00:00:28.830> iron<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.460> create<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> texture<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.689> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
the iron to create the texture for you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.920 
the iron to create the texture for you
her<00:00:31.619> texture<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.189> already<00:00:32.550> built<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.300> we're

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
her texture is already built in so we're

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.610 
her texture is already built in so we're
going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> come<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> back<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:38.059> use<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
going to come in to the back and use a

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.639 
going to come in to the back and use a
clear<00:00:40.620> elastic<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.790> tie<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.989> elastic

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
clear elastic and just tie the elastic

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.440 
clear elastic and just tie the elastic
right<00:00:43.890> about<00:00:44.190> where<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
right about where you want to see the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.000 
right about where you want to see the
length<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.350> bob<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:48.110> wrap<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.289> around<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
length of the bob and wrap it around and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.750 
length of the bob and wrap it around and
keep<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:52.079> bit<00:00:52.230> loose<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:53.219> breaking

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
keep it a little bit loose by breaking

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.470 
keep it a little bit loose by breaking
it<00:00:53.910> apart<00:00:56.480> then<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.840> take<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> end<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
it apart then you can take the end and

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.460 
it apart then you can take the end and
roll<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.520> under<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:04.640> pin<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> we're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
roll it up and under and pin so we're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.100 
roll it up and under and pin so we're
going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.799> pins<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.460> match<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.900> hair

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
going to use pins that match the hair

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.929 
going to use pins that match the hair
color<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:12.840> placing<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.860> pins<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
color and just placing the pins into the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.460 
color and just placing the pins into the
hair<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:16.380> direction<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.479> then<00:01:18.479> working

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
hair in one direction and then working

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
hair in one direction and then working
them<00:01:19.740> into<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> other<00:01:20.340> direction<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.299> make

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
them into the other direction and make

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.740 
them into the other direction and make
sure<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> even<00:01:25.130> from<00:01:26.130> side<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.520> side<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
sure it's even from side to side and you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
sure it's even from side to side and you
want<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.350> loose<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.159> even<00:01:29.310> pull

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
want it to be loose you can even pull

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.240 
want it to be loose you can even pull
out<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.630> tendrils<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
out some of the little tendrils so it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
out some of the little tendrils so it
has<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.729> natural<00:01:33.390> look<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:36.409> but<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
has a more natural look to it but it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
has a more natural look to it but it
really<00:01:37.650> isn't<00:01:38.119> necessarily<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.299> perfect<00:01:39.659> look

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
really isn't necessarily a perfect look

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.590 
really isn't necessarily a perfect look
just<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:41.040> looser<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.329> turn

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
just a little bit looser when you turn

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.350 
just a little bit looser when you turn
around<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.430> come<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.149> your

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
around you can then come in with your

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.690 
around you can then come in with your
finishing<00:01:45.960> spray<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:48.740> detail<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.770> hair

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.170 

giving<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> last<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:55.110> bits<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> polish

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
giving it the last little bits of polish

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:13.839

that<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.210> need<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.939> define<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> look

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.630 

and<00:02:14.569> then<00:02:14.959> use<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> little<00:02:15.590> spray<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.040> smooth

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
and then use a little spray to smooth

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.759 
and then use a little spray to smooth
down<00:02:16.670> any<00:02:16.909> little<00:02:17.540> flyaways<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:18.139> you<00:02:18.530> have

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:21.499 
always spraying from a distance so it's

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.699 
always spraying from a distance so it's
a<00:02:21.739> lightness<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:22.609> opposed<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.629> strong<00:02:24.379> miss

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
a lightness as opposed to a strong miss

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.949 
a lightness as opposed to a strong miss
