00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.540
 times nail is prepared and that is 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:22.930
 This time with stencil made there is 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:25.300
 desired and I show you for small 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.110
 nail art it is quite right he 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.290
 quite easy 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.090
 he looks you simply your choice is off 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:37.719
 it does not matter that I have now that 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:39.429
 babbel of pharaoh that is a pink and 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:45.760
 Just do it now with yours 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:48.570
 friends sum a bit 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.570
 your friends 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.360
 worry her after it hardens 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 is something synonymous yes google 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.390
 reconciliation go whatever and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:20.900
 Carries a thin layer here laterally 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:24.550
 then you take something silver 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.010
 glitter that is now multiplayer of 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.160
 nail expert I think you take it 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:38.360
 a clip island made something with gel 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:41.200
 wet and then does a glitter here 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.200
 line along 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.509
 and the animal then hangs out so if that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.229
 on or off she has is modeled her 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.229
 your composition 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:26.470
 Listen carefully to make sure you have everything 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:35.320
 covered that here next to units 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:37.330
 she has no blisters too 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.070
 pay attention that the glitter 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.370
 is sufficiently covered and if you 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:47.170
 you again the way tells her the needle 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.560
 inform klinger dinner and then enemy 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.560
 in shape 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.250
 this should be fine-tuned 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.400
 I had something ready and that 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.439
 is the white acrylic paint with some water 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.599
 and then you take a straight one 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:24.180
 brush or a sloping with water 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:29.859
 gets along better and makes the brush 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.430
 First of all that's nice, then you take 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:38.560
 a dry toilet and dab it 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:44.769
 twice from then you take minimal color 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:57.459
 so much stroking a bit into the 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:04:02.139
 brush and then you just see one 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:05.650
 straight line to the end of the finger 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:08.410
 and that looks a bit like 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.230
 airbus you take you again 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.560
 paint slightly paint now turned 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.959
 the color inside so the brush with 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.820
 the color inside and on the other 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.260
 The page made exactly should be painted then 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.590
 It looks a bit like airbrushing 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.650
 and not so boring 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.880
 will make the stamp and have it 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:38.050
 I have this little butterfly here 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.760
 you choose the clean one 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.789
 stencil the stamp with with 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.789
 oil-free nail polish remover may 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.229
 no oil residue leftovers dust what 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.289
 still be on it 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.320
 then you take a document with it 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.930
 your table is not something or something 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.050
 and then I just take that as there has 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.909
 a little something colorful it is 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.780
 camping lakic from expert give up data 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.780
 the butterfly 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:21.289
 The goal is to pick up the stamp and 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.810
 just put it over here then have it 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:39.009
 you such a little bit of color for 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:40.159
 record the second week and 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.990
 stamp 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:46.849
 This is how it looks and beautiful moments 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:53.270
 nose it looks like that then you can 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:56.840
 all still sealed I have now 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.460
 here's the flex finish of taylor james 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.449
 past 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:06.289
 I have something new from his 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:09.259
 only used very well because then can 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:14.409
 they seal the whole thing so show here 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.409
 I you again the end result the 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.520
 heart for beginners 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:22.460
 I do not know it's no trouble that 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.800
 is not painted in the sense 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:29.710
 sprayed is exactly the same 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.479
 effect and if you liked it then 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.279
 I'm glad that 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.729
 Have fun with the country and see you 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.729
 next time
