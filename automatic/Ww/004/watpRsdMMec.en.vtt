 with the achievement of economic stability, Brazil can invest in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.990
 various public policies that have brought many advances to our

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.900

 have evolved over the years. 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.859
 In this process, the contribution of JosÃ© de Castro was invaluable. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.270
 bertin duplicities 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.640
 with their efforts they have helped bring health and citizenship nutrition to 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.830
 poorer areas, making room for the emergence of other initiatives 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.220
 such as the establishment of food safety councils and the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.300
 traditional country

 nutritional and nutritional security in Brazil, however, many advances in 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.500
 last years 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.650
 as a result of the mobilization of the public policy 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.859
 the reduction of hunger in the country the creation of popular restaurants and kitchens 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.289
 community programs the family grant program the food acquisition program 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.669
 the expansion of school feeding to secondary education and the entry of 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.939
 agriculture in school meals we can advance much more 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.469
 regularized indigenous and quilombola lands and to implement policies to 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.459
 traditional cuban peoples from all walks of the country the council is a space between 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.529
 these cities were hurt by their differences and the actions and movements 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.830
 social 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.189
 meets with the different sectors of government 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.829
 the food and nutritional security situation of the 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.179
 our population 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:54.769
 think of the big problems of the big priorities and more than this bissau the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.599
 ways of solving these problems and this will be the process of 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.429
 participation and social attire both at the national level and through the 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:08.549
 national council but also and especially with the councils 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.250
 state and municipal 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.579
 this specific look of the problem is that region that group 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.870
 foot population happens there is little risk in the state and municipal council 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.150
 and all this network of the national state and municipal have great objectives 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.690
 guarantee the food and nutritional security of our population 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.189
 the 4th national conference being held this year is the first 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.209
 after the promulgation of constitutional amendment 64 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:43.309
 which included among the social rights provided in the constitutions right 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:44.709
 to food 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.249
 for this reason 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.159
 we decide to place the human right to adequate and healthy food as 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.339
 motto of our conference 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:57.819
 wanting that all that the debates and come back to analyze 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.829
 the progress achieved, but above all the challenges I pose to them 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.919
 so that every Brazilian and every Brazilian has food 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.719
 adequate and healthy safety 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.669
 we want the conference to be the moment of celebration of a great covenant 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.659
 by promotion 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.479
 of sovereignty and rational food security and 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.799
 to adequate and healthy food 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.900
 the pact involving the federal government 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.569
 governments of municipal governments, as well as a 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.139
 strong participation 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.199
 civil society 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.139
 and with an expression of this commitment we will also be normalizing the 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.889
 foreground national 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.129
 food safety or food safety 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.640
 net of resources to achieve 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.150
 this goal are being spared 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.840
 building the food safety system to impress them cruise the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.640
 states and municipalities 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.800
 is key to securing advances in sic 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.039
 this quinta 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.689
 and nutritional 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:01.819
 no doubt 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.819
 there were many achievements of our country 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.400
 and despite important strides to ensure Brazilians 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.009
 healthy and adequate food 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.580
 There is still much to be done 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.669
 we must continue to debate ideas discussing alternatives 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:22.379
 seeking solutions 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.569
 and outlining strategies for the future 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.629
 This is everyone's fight. 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:34.469
 and therefore it is up to each one of us to work for these advances to be 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.360
 consolidate in the life of each citizen 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.840
 and contribute to the construction of a more just and equal Brazil to 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.000
