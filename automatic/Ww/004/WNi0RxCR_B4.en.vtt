 let's prepare a delicious stew of 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:11.700
 with super-fast cauliflower and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:13.139
 nutritious for the whole family hello my 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.549
 name is Laura and I teach you how to eat 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.380
 healthy so subscribe to my channel 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.210
 of youtube because every week I have 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.350
 new recipes for you and remember that in 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.390
 youtube you find me like the recipes 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 of the hour and what do you think if we start 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.370
 with this recipe to have fast food 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 and prompt list let's start with 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.700
 our beef what do you think if the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.680
 let's cook not to take here the 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.449
 salt and pepper and I will tell you something 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.910
 quickly the beef is very 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.769
 important that you always look for the 90 10 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.289
 because it is the one that contains less fat to 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.879
 times in the super we make the trap and 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.739
 it turns out that they sell it to you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.809
 because according to these nothing 9010 and brings 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.879
 pretty fat to me is what I just 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.550
 to happen so what I'm going to do is 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.319
 I put some water in my pan and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.239
 I'll let you start cooking and 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.100
 I'm going to get rid of that water because it's 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.559
 there where a lot of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.429
 the fat so that it grabs flavor 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.890
 we are adding pepper and I will add 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.369
 also a little salt the amount of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.409
 pepper about 36 pinches of pepper and a 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.179
 quarter teaspoon of salt 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.100
 over here I have three raw tomatoes 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.800
 normal cut the tail and I'm going to 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.840
 place in a container to liquefy 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.180
 I'm going to add a clove of garlic 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.860
 small but half of one and over here 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.750
 I have a chilito bullfighting or it can be a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
 roasted chile to give it this recipe 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.710
 friends from outside of Mexico who do not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.130
 like the spicy do not worry, do not 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.130
 they have to put 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.420
 well on my card is around like this 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.100
 let's say like three quarts of cooked and 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.080
 if they are fixed to have the return released the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.750
 fat so I'm going to get rid of this 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.040
 water and I will place clean water if 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.570
 our diet if we lose 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.010
 cholesterol me problem can you use 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.380
 this same water but I do 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.820
 avoiding all the ready grease look 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.760
 remove all the fat now let's 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.620
 add a cup of water and let's 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.000
 add the sauce we prepare with the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 tomatoes, chili and garlic 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.660
 this is going to help us to get more 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.220
 that's why my recipes taste good 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.260
 rich because we remove the fat but 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.600
 we are going to put alternative things that 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.429
 give more flavor I have here I think that 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.270

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
