00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello guys for this tutorial of the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 mini mouse ears 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.660
 we are going to need the following with the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.869
 bun we need red cloth for the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.970
 ears we need black cloth too 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:27.220
 We are going to need thread and needle scissors 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.020
 we're going to need a gun also 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.990
 silicon a headband 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.480
 cheese and if you want a rule 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.670
 and finally some kind of basis 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.740
 round you can use to make 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.220
 the mold of your ears so let's 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.220
 start 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.090
 let's start making the ears 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.040
 for it to make this stay 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.010
 more mini mouse style for this 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.570
 I need fabric I chose this shirt 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 my old brother 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.920
 Thank you to make the mold of the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 ears that we can some kind 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.120
 of fabric that have school or can you 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 paste also glitter and so on the joke 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.470
 is that they have to blow up their 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.600
 good imagination let's start 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.600
 making the mark of the circles 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.060
 of our little ears after that already 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.880
 are marked correctly having already 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.909
 cut our first pair of little ears 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.640
 Now let's start sewing from the side 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.679
 where the hit is, it does not matter what 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.880
 has been a bit crooked is going to 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:41.479
 flip after sewing now you have to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.450
 stay a space of three fingers to 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.719
 free to put the eraser when 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.640
 have flipped you can take a bit of 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.069
 erases pads not your mom 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.799
 matter what I did do not forget to mention 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.770
 that in the at the beginning of the tutorial well 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.119
 that we're going to start sewing right now 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.880
 we finished sewing 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.860
 Now let's flip remember that 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.229
 we said we had to leave three 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.140
 Separation fingers to put the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.630
 filling does not matter that it was a bit 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.299
 chueco important thing is that the orejita 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.700
 it looks a bit bulky and not so big 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.910
 now let's see a cap that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.769
 you stole your mom from her cushions we're going to 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.550
 begin filling you do not have to have 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.960
 much 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.420
 a lot of money because if you're not going to stay 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.850
 the ear very rough but if you have the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.050
 enough so you can stay 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.180
 raised 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.609
 in the headband 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.750
 already as we finished filling the 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.030
 ear 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.640
 now let's start measuring you do not go 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.950
 to sew immediately but you have to 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.200
 see if it is at the correct height of your 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.049
 of your headband and the same procedure 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.090
 let's do with the other little ear you have 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.219
 what to measure there and then we're going to 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.550
 hit but right now let's continue with 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.830
 monkey 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.170
 we already have the fabric to make our 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.450
 bow now what we are going to do is that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.540
 with the his we are going to mark a rectangle 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.420
 on the web you can use the rule or not 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.120
 use it I do not use it 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.060
 let's mark half of our 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.830
 rectangle because there is a part of the bow 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.640
 where there will be no sewing to be 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.130
 see more beautiful 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.830
 and on the other side yes 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.070
 remember what we have to mark a 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.030
 corner of the rectangle because out there 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.810
 we are going to sew to put the eraser 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.810
 now let's cut 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.500
 we already have our rectangle trimmed 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.360
 it does not matter that you have been made is 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.930
 weak and does not know how to trim difficult 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.450
 well remember that part of the heat 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.520
 it has to go outside because at 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.920
 we are going to turn it over after 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.900
 take it and that shore I have it the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.580
 we have marked it we will leave it without 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.180
 sew because we're going to put the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.940
 ball so let's sew good already 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.100
 we finished sewing our rectangle 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.000
 remember that we had to leave a 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.660
 part without sewing to be able to turn it over 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.660
 now we are going to flip it 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.180
 and now we are going to fill it with erasure 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.180
 way that there is a space in the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 part of between 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.410
 because there we are going to put 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.430
 the central part of the bun 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.560
 we have already filled the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.620
 the one 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.460
 we already fill our bow and leave the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.970
 half without a cap to be able 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.830
 make the crease of the bow and pass the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.600
 thread out there so that it stays fixed 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.759
 Now let's sew the part where 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.580
 we put our good bag and we finished 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.050
 of sewing the corner that we had left 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.070
 5 cm 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.500
 now we are going to 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.010
 make the fold of the center of the bow 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.700
 let's pass a thread through 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.960
 so that it remains fixed 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.960
 dedicate us as the thread and 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:15.310
 Sidibe could do what he does not know 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:18.090
 do you will do it much better 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.420
 we roll it so that it is fixed and 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.510
 there it's good now that we have sewn 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.900
 that part of the bun we are going to put this 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.900
 strip 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.720
 to cover the whole roll and what 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.950
 we put 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.950
 let's leave these two strips and let's 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.950
 sew 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.530
 and those two strips are going to cut them for 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.470
 that are not so long but leaving a 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.780
 space to help us in those strips 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.120
 here they fix it's time to connect 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.550
 our silicone gun and we're going to 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.370
 continue with the next steps now 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.040
 we take our headband to put the 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.120
 ears of the part that we did not know 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.670
 let's put our headband on and let's go 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.900
 to roll in one of the 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:12.100
 parts that we did not know and the other one over 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.100
 to start sewing 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.480
 ready we finished sewing our 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.440
 ear now from the side where the 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:24.280
 sewing we are going to stick our bow the 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.760
 part where we did this at the end of 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.260
 bun and the corner we are going to bend 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.270
 into 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:36.640
 and the strips that were left behind 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.500
 our center of the bow we are going to 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.580
 Stick to the headband so that it fits well 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.289
 de iu remember that 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.289
 next to what 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.860
 so this side is folded the rectangle 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.240
 to make the bow we take sewing that 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.720
 is the one that is going to be in the part of 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.420
 above 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.529
 and we do the same thing on the other side with the 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.989
 another ear 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:02.649
 and now we have our little ears 

00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:02.649
 of mini mouse
