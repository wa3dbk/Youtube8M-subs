about<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.890> cake<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.640> bakes<00:02:34.910> up<00:02:35.210> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
about this cake is that it bakes up is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.960 
about this cake is that it bakes up is
done<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.500> doesn't<00:02:36.860> get<00:02:36.980> really<00:02:37.160> Brown<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
done and doesn't get really Brown so the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.820 
done and doesn't get really Brown so the
colors<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.660> donuts<00:02:38.990> stay<00:02:39.290> very<00:02:39.530> very

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
colors of the donuts stay very very

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.400 
colors of the donuts stay very very
vibrant<00:02:40.070> as<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.330> see<00:02:41.510> once<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:42.050> glaze

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
vibrant as you can see once that glaze

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.400 
vibrant as you can see once that glaze
dries<00:02:42.710> it<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.640> dries<00:02:44.180> very<00:02:44.330> translucent<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.320> it

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
dries it it dries very translucent so it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.900 
dries it it dries very translucent so it
doesn't<00:02:45.620> really<00:02:45.710> take<00:02:46.010> away<00:02:46.130> from<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.610> lovely

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
doesn't really take away from the lovely

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.420 
doesn't really take away from the lovely
color<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.540> donuts<00:02:48.100> now<00:02:49.100> these<00:02:49.280> are

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
color of the donuts now these are

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.400 
color of the donuts now these are
probably<00:02:49.850> better<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.540> than<00:02:50.750> fried

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
probably better for you than fried

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.310 
probably better for you than fried
donuts<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.610> flavor-wise<00:02:52.880> they're<00:02:53.540> not<00:02:53.780> quite

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
donuts but flavor-wise they're not quite

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.770 
donuts but flavor-wise they're not quite
as<00:02:54.500> good<00:02:55.130> as<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.580> deep-fried<00:02:55.940> ones<00:02:56.180> are<00:02:56.480> I

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
as good as the deep-fried ones are I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.900 
as good as the deep-fried ones are I
would<00:02:57.620> make<00:02:57.800> sure<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.100> put<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> glaze<00:02:58.640> on

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
would make sure you put the glaze on

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.580 
would make sure you put the glaze on
because<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.480> really<00:02:59.690> adds<00:02:59.840> a<00:03:00.080> lot<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
because it really adds a lot to the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.070 
because it really adds a lot to the
flavor<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.850> on<00:03:02.000> their<00:03:02.210> own<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.690> cake<00:03:02.900> is

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
flavor just on their own the cake is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.290 
flavor just on their own the cake is
kind<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.530> bland<00:03:03.770> if<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.790> were<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.000> make<00:03:05.120> this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
kind of bland if I were to make this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.390 
kind of bland if I were to make this
again<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.690> would<00:03:05.840> probably<00:03:06.140> bump<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.100> flavor

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
again I would probably bump the flavor

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.670 
again I would probably bump the flavor
up<00:03:07.610> by<00:03:07.790> adding<00:03:08.030> maybe<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.570> cherry<00:03:08.900> extract<00:03:09.470> or

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
up by adding maybe a cherry extract or

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.040 
up by adding maybe a cherry extract or
an<00:03:10.190> almond<00:03:10.550> extract<00:03:11.030> or<00:03:11.209> something<00:03:11.630> just<00:03:11.870> to

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
an almond extract or something just to

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.449 
an almond extract or something just to
make<00:03:12.200> them<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.380> little<00:03:12.590> bit<00:03:12.830> more<00:03:12.860> flavorful

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
make them a little bit more flavorful

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.880 
make them a little bit more flavorful
than<00:03:13.640> they<00:03:13.970> are<00:03:14.320> overall<00:03:15.320> though<00:03:15.500> they<00:03:15.650> turned

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
than they are overall though they turned

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.740 
than they are overall though they turned
out<00:03:16.040> great<00:03:16.190> it's<00:03:16.880> something<00:03:17.240> you<00:03:17.360> want<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.600> eat

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
out great it's something you want to eat

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.570 
out great it's something you want to eat
the<00:03:17.900> same<00:03:18.140> day<00:03:18.350> because<00:03:18.709> they<00:03:18.830> do<00:03:18.890> get<00:03:19.310> stale

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
the same day because they do get stale
