00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 if you think that super heroes are 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.950
 just those weird guys who 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.389
 constantly fly shoot lasers from 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.449
 eye 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:24.210
 fighting crime and assholes 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.249
 supervillain the accuracy and rights because 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.960
 that in injustice gods among us 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.960
 everything is shown 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.360
 the word game did not anyhow who are those 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.910
 guys that made mortal kombat 2011 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.610
 years or you can just call them 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.620
 nazar ilm studios absolutely everyone who 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.260
 expected to see mortal from this game 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.630
 kombat comic heroes in principle 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.030
 met their expectations because everyone 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.190
 so it is but the only thing that is very 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.190
 the very mechanics of the game has changed 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.340
 First zadrachivat fatalities do not need 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.020
 because you can not yet disappointed and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.090
 kids wipe their lungs because 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.010
 there is no fatality I will talk about another 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.180
 wonderful features that are here 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.180
 it 's something like 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.830
 x-ray and it depends on the stagger and here it is 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.150
 typed here deleted here from 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.880
 depending on where you are 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.160
 play for 1 or 2 players and when to scale 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.270
 something is happening 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.280
 such a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.530
 so let's say x-ray which is here 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.930
 called hurried does n't look much 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.270
 worse fatalities are also impressive 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.310
 besides this added something like 2 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.650
 racks which helps some hero 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.780
 use the second set of weapons then 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.259
 there is for example a miracle woman we have 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.660
 salmon of fate or else sword shield or shield with 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.700
 a sword as you like and a flash for example 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.729
 there is a time dilation but still a lot 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.220
 all different guys and besides all this 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.220
 there is also such a thing 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.910
 to be frank then ride 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 fun and fun heap praise on 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.690
 especially cool if you play with 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.850
 friends say it well, in addition to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.590
 that you can actually drag the words 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.960
 Comrade or there I do not know the enemy 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.740
 classmate classmate 1 employee 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.710
 I do not know there is a neighbor from the pension fund 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.480
 or fellow ward do not care then 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.240
 there is still one option when you can 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.980
 say show won puppy distinctive 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.660
 trait from many other records that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.180
 It was in the mortal kombat of course 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.270
 the story line here she is also present 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.600
 just until everything is done cool but here it is 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.490
 the plot briefly looks something like this 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.470
 it turned out that we have a parallel 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.480
 dimension where everything is basically the same way 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.550
 same as we even have the same hero current 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.740
 they have a suit and many other tones 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.560
 It is at best and a little dagaya 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.070
 the snag is that superman is in this 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.930
 world turned out to be a rare shit and 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.730
 guys who say so play for 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.650
 our team arrive there and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.170
 Naturally not all 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.550
 randomness and understand how there 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.030
 bad and such 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.980
 and let us save this world and what for us 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.320
 power superhero well im surely 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.739
 stand up to the same superhero that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.350
 they 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.900
 who were stupefied by superman or 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.030
 just been in let's say set 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.040
 awkward position because they sort of 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.560
 trust them and he says this killing 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.180
 they kill those and nothing of whom 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.630
 by the way almost nobody 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.250
 not dead except joker lex luthor 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.380
 but in the end we of course give in the ass 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.590
 superman he finds himself in a cage hide 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.239
 eyes here 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.370
 end credits drove the game very much 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.049
 trying to seem serious because 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.560
 We're all so gloomy that we 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.030
 serious talk about life and stuff but 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.030
 when you see when 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.120
 from the lake of the river or the sea come huge 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.310
 crayfish attack the military and aquamen with 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.400
 kill with such a staff 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.889
 dominate too funny fly around 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.859
 these weird flowers guys this 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.259
 really wild and if I look at it 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.320
 in the cinema I would laugh here is just serious 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.330
 frankly would have laughed at this lana wight 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.949
 plots let's about other modes because 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.449
 what are they here 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.370
 the smallest of them came out very quickly to tell 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.740
 but firstly it is 11 but actually in 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.930
 one room in one console and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.639
 of course multiplayer multiplayer you 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.820
 will tear just like markal 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.620
 room so cook your zhopki there 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.270
 still the battle mode which is essentially the same 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.620
 that is the leader and no mortal kombat 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.360
 only under different conditions 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.310
 not divided into several types 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.500
 there is a first for example it is absolutely 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.449
 random 2 is a super hero vs 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.849
 supervillains other this super heroes 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.990
 superheroes super villain supervillains 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.970
 and everything is mixed up with a blow 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.250
 shuffled shuffled and played 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.080
 How do you see it there and there is still a mode 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.880
 stars club is actually the 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.120
 same mockery of players 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.680
 developers this is a different test 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.900
 and 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.789
 bodily just stupidly zadrotskie in Aries 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.889
 strike the same combination or 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.139
 anything else principle is not the main thing 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.880
 how much fun is it like it is played on 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.680
 fact mechanic mortal kombat she 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.259
 the whole here is only but a little more 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.880
 casual because you don't need to learn 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.340
 a huge number of bundles here all 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.560
 more or less available yes there they are in 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.630
 all sorts of combinations, but here NATO is already in them 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.820
 delve into and I don't know why this is necessary if 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.650
 you just want to have fun with 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.289
 friends wanted your friends exactly the same 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.210
 are being pounded here more or less 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.430
 justified in the whole game of course very 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.620
 cool but to the game of dreams to her of course 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.570
 Far away the game of the year, too, I think not 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.759
 shines but none the less fighting with us 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.160
 do not go out so often and this fighter is very 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.199
 cool game super heroes we also 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.199
 not very much so why again 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.330
 don't play it just enough 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.310
 not bad fun forming factor for 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.139
 any party to play superheroes 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.080
 huge brutal men or there 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.820
 skinny like flash guys like and 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.259
 thrash their own friends 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.970
 so if you liked what 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.979
 happening on the screen be sure to take 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.750
 this toy, I think you will not regret and 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.280
 for those who are not very but in principle 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.620
 do not forget the main thing 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.260
 subscribe to channel game chambers on my 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.130
 channel it was bass it was injustice 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.729
 gods among us 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.729
 of course to new meetings and bye bye
