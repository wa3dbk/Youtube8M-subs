doing when the first time I'm starving
they<00:03:11.510> might<00:03:11.719> just<00:03:11.959> do<00:03:12.170> some<00:03:12.500> totally<00:03:13.129> random

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
they might just do some totally random

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:20.440 
they might just do some totally random
trick<00:03:18.640> we<00:03:19.640> might<00:03:19.819> like<00:03:20.000> doing<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.209> trick<00:03:20.420> like

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
trick we might like doing a trick like

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.160 
trick we might like doing a trick like
that<00:03:21.040> they<00:03:22.040> might<00:03:22.219> like<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.639> see<00:03:22.819> my<00:03:23.170> they

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
that they might like to see my they

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:42.369 
that they might like to see my they
might<00:03:24.349> do<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.799> if<00:03:40.389> your<00:03:41.389> voice<00:03:41.629> just<00:03:41.959> flying

around<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:43.040> random<00:03:43.250> directions<00:03:52.269> back<00:03:53.500> crack's

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
around in random directions back crack's

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.300 
around in random directions back crack's
doing<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.389> because<00:03:56.389> then<00:03:57.290> you'll<00:03:57.439> get<00:03:57.530> then

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
doing that because then you'll get then

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.789 
doing that because then you'll get then
you'll<00:03:58.459> get<00:03:58.579> used<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.909> scoop<00:04:04.780> okay<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:05.840> sub<00:04:06.620> is

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
you'll get used to scoop okay so sub is

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.990 
you'll get used to scoop okay so sub is
are<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.459> good<00:04:07.730> trip<00:04:08.680> gaelic<00:04:09.680> can<00:04:10.129> combine<00:04:10.790> to

are a good trip gaelic can combine to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.939 
are a good trip gaelic can combine to
form<00:04:11.030> bunch<00:04:11.569> up<00:04:11.750> once<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.199> little<00:04:12.500> bit<00:04:12.590> critic

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
form bunch up once a little bit critic
