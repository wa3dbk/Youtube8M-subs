the field and if there's a guy on the
opposite<00:01:13.890> side<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> map<00:01:14.460> who<00:01:14.880> just

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
opposite side of the map who just

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.460 
opposite side of the map who just
happens<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> kill<00:01:15.930> at<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.080> same<00:01:16.229> time

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
happens to get a kill at the same time

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
happens to get a kill at the same time
as<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.580> you're<00:01:17.700> getting<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.030> four

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
as you when you're getting like four

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
as you when you're getting like four
kills<00:01:18.479> row<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> as

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
kills row I don't really see that as

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130 
kills row I don't really see that as
being<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.939> big<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.240> an<00:01:21.330> issue<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.900> guess

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
being that big of an issue but I guess

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
being that big of an issue but I guess
with<00:01:22.710> feeds<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> whole<00:01:23.490> thing<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.060> being

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
with feeds the whole thing of it being

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.070 
with feeds the whole thing of it being
split<00:01:24.659> or<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:24.990> split<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.220> how

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
split or not split is like just like how

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.630 
split or not split is like just like how
consistently<00:01:28.080> how<00:01:28.380> many<00:01:28.710> clips<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.310> get

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
consistently how many clips you can get

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.950 
consistently how many clips you can get
in<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.560> anyways<00:01:32.960> right

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
in just like I don't know anyways right

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
in just like I don't know anyways right
here<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> believe<00:01:34.950> yeah<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> start<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
here I believe yeah this is the start of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
here I believe yeah this is the start of
the<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:36.930> triple<00:01:37.290> kill<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the the little triple kill here and I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
the the little triple kill here and I
each<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> killfeed<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.780> killed<00:01:40.020> face

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
each see in the killfeed I killed face

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.530 
each see in the killfeed I killed face
apex<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:40.860> he<00:01:40.979> left<00:01:41.159> right<00:01:41.340> away<00:01:41.540> so

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
apex and then he left right away so

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.240 
apex and then he left right away so
technically<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.229> did<00:01:43.500> make<00:01:43.680> him<00:01:43.829> rich<00:01:44.009> quit<00:01:44.220> i

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
technically I did make him rich quit i

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.999 
technically I did make him rich quit i
guess<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.270> he<00:01:45.390> probably<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.560> doing<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
guess but he probably was not doing so

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.980 
guess but he probably was not doing so
well<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.369> leading<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:48.000> until<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.540> death<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
well up leading up until that death and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
well up leading up until that death and
then<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> last<00:01:49.920> draw<00:01:50.220> they

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
then I was kind of the last draw they

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.190 
then I was kind of the last draw they
usually<00:01:50.880> kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.299> happens<00:01:51.570> when<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
usually kind of happens when I when I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
usually kind of happens when I when I
rage<00:01:52.470> quit<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:52.920> oh<00:01:53.040> my<00:01:53.399> god<00:01:53.579> spawn

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

what<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.070> happening<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.520> didn't<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> know<00:01:56.939> see

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
what was happening I didn't you know see

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.609 
what was happening I didn't you know see
what<00:01:57.600> his<00:01:57.719> score<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:57.960> there<00:01:58.229> anything<00:01:58.380> when

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
what his score was there anything when

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.990 
what his score was there anything when
he<00:01:58.680> left<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> only<00:01:59.280> killed<00:01:59.520> him<00:01:59.610> once<00:01:59.790> i

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
he left but I only killed him once i

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
he left but I only killed him once i
guess<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.750> he<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.920> real<00:02:02.070> faze

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
guess like he was actually the real faze

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.590 
guess like he was actually the real faze

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
but anyways I have been using justice a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.790 
but anyways I have been using justice a
common<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.660> kind<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.810> stacking<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.320> Psalms

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
common just kind of stacking the Psalms

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.470 
common just kind of stacking the Psalms
because<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.370> don't<00:03:11.520> really<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.910> using

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
because I don't really like using

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.900 
because I don't really like using
Oracle's<00:03:13.080> or<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.710> know<00:03:13.860> any<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.730> other

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
Oracle's or you know any of the other

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.180 
Oracle's or you know any of the other
support<00:03:15.480> killstreaks<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.470> put<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> air

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
support killstreaks but I put on the air

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.720 
support killstreaks but I put on the air
superiority<00:03:18.350> because<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:20.130> enemy<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.520> kept

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
superiority because the enemy is kept

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.940 
superiority because the enemy is kept
getting<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.480> attack<00:03:21.900> helicopters<00:03:22.530> or<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
getting like attack helicopters or the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.920 
getting like attack helicopters or the
battle<00:03:23.610> hines<00:03:23.790> whatever<00:03:24.090> they're<00:03:24.209> called<00:03:24.420> so

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
battle hines whatever they're called so

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.410 
battle hines whatever they're called so
I<00:03:24.959> kind<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.320> wanted<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.709> put<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.120> just

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
I kind of wanted to put that on to just

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.420 
I kind of wanted to put that on to just
kind<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.690> deal<00:03:27.870> with<00:03:28.020> that<00:03:28.140> there's<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.100> 28th

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
kind of deal with that there's the 28th

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.190 
kind of deal with that there's the 28th
kill<00:03:29.640> about<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.910> get<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> 29th<00:03:30.450> kill<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.930> then

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
kill about to get the 29th kill and then

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.810 
kill about to get the 29th kill and then
I<00:03:31.290> also<00:03:31.320> figured<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.190> might<00:03:32.340> as<00:03:32.400> well<00:03:32.550> throw<00:03:32.670> on

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
I also figured I might as well throw on

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.160 
I also figured I might as well throw on
the<00:03:32.940> Oracle<00:03:33.300> but<00:03:33.540> that's<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.959> end<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
the Oracle but that's the end of the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.040 
the Oracle but that's the end of the
gameplay<00:03:34.440> 33<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.310> maid<00:03:35.730> face<00:03:36.060> apex<00:03:36.330> rage<00:03:36.840> quit
