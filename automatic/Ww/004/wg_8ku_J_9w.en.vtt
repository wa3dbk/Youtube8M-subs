 following this news from well 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.680
 early castalia very good afternoon what 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.140
 is now the next step that will take 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.290
 the Panamanian government 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 that's how good it is right now 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.360
 we are heading towards the port of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.220
 Manzanillo in the province of Colon in 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.440
 the Atlantic coast where it should be 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.739
 proceed at this time of the morning to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.280
 make a new inspection of this 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.350
 boat as stated 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.110
 After the start of this operation there was a 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 mutiny and resistance from 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.880
 the ship's crew could be 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.000
 taken to the port of manzanillo 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.789
 that a private terminal builds a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.729
 old naval base the united states 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.940
 there is rovio right now on the part of 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.820
 the entire security body in panama 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.649
 it has not been known of an offer of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.869
 press also early we had been told 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.410
 that they would see that it offers regret 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 But Panamanian authorities not 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.020
 they waited so much to ask questions 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.240
 International mainly with cola 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 or not a fool to know the steps that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.720
 they are going to give 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.590
 we had a great part resistance 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.659
 from captain 45 crew to capital 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.600
 initially it gave as an attack to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.580
 heart after tried to commit suicide and to 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.229
 be able to drive this attack to the ship 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.020
 until the port of manzanillo we have given 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.930
 account that when emptying with wings one of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.250
 the five floodgates that he had had in 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.229
 this case the mobile all containers 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.670
 we presume that there are more containers than 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.350
 has the material that you just 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 sign seems to be a war material 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.020
 ballistic I do not know if it can be me 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.120
 from that I do not know but I think that 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.280
 you filmed it and it would be good if 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.980
 this kind of thing should not go through 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.370
 panama panama is a country that loves peace 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.650
 not war a country that welcomes all 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.720
 resolutions of the united nations and 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.940
 simply one can not pass this 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.989
 type of war material by a country 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.989
 declaring it as something else 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.130
 and it is a flagrant violation 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.130
 international has said 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.780
 ricardo martinelli who reiterated that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.380
 Panama is a peaceful country and it is not going to 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.110
 allow the use of the panama channel to 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.930
 the transfer of war material that has 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.490
 above all international repercussions 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.770
 there is no pronouncement of the requested 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.930
 by estates also to the chancellery 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.130
