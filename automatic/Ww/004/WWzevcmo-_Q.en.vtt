next-generation consoles that we are to

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.810 
next-generation consoles that we are to
have<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> next<00:00:21.359> eight<00:00:21.510> years<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:23.070> the

have for the next eight years so the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.960 
have for the next eight years so the
first<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.420> realize<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.760> first<00:00:26.760> saw

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
first thing we realize when we first saw

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.339 
first thing we realize when we first saw
the<00:00:27.029> PlayStation<00:00:27.599> board<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> new

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the PlayStation board was the new

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.290 
the PlayStation board was the new
controller<00:00:28.859> something<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.000> really

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
controller something that was really

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.659 
controller something that was really
really<00:00:30.480> cool<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.619> pretty<00:00:32.070> nice<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.489> see

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
really cool and it's pretty nice to see

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.600 
really cool and it's pretty nice to see
because<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:34.170> controller<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.950> something<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
because the controller is something that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.180 
because the controller is something that
has<00:00:36.390> eville<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> did<00:00:37.050> since<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> first

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
has eville you did since the first

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.130 
has eville you did since the first
console<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.510> newest<00:00:39.870> ones

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
console all the way to the newest ones

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.209 
console all the way to the newest ones
and<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.460> playstation<00:00:42.000> 3<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:43.040> had<00:00:44.040> this

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and the playstation 3 had this had this

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090 
and the playstation 3 had this had this
sort<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.870> reputation<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.710> controller

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
sort of reputation that the controller

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.270 
sort of reputation that the controller
who's<00:00:47.430> very<00:00:47.690> sensitive<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.590> breaks

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
who's very sensitive and it breaks

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
who's very sensitive and it breaks
easily<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.149> personally<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.050> my

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
easily and personally with my

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.010 
easily and personally with my
playstation<00:00:52.620> 3<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.629> controller

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
playstation 3 that I have my controller

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.049 
playstation 3 that I have my controller
never<00:00:55.320> broke<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.219> does<00:00:56.430> squeak<00:00:56.789> now

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
never broke but I it does squeak now

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.779 
never broke but I it does squeak now

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
because it's been over five years that i

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.319 
because it's been over five years that i
had<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.000> same<00:01:00.239> PlayStation<00:01:01.109> 3<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.329> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
had the same PlayStation 3 and the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
had the same PlayStation 3 and the
controller's<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:04.019> old<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.619> week<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
controller's got old and this week but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.250 
controller's got old and this week but
it's<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.700> nice<00:01:05.850> how<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> new<00:01:06.750> controller

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it's really nice how the new controller

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.340 
it's really nice how the new controller
looks<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.950> slim<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.450> looks<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.320> be

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
looks really slim and it looks to be

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.050 
looks really slim and it looks to be
like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> better<00:01:11.159> controller<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> then

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
like a better controller and then

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.320 
like a better controller and then
they've<00:01:12.330> adjusted<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.020> things<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.500> were

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
they've adjusted the things that were

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.289 
they've adjusted the things that were
negative<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.840> controller<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
negative on the first controller and

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
negative on the first controller and
something<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.590> really<00:01:19.590> caught<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
something that really caught the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
something that really caught the
attention<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.729> eye<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
attention of my eye has to be the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.340 
attention of my eye has to be the
touchscreen<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:23.310> opinion<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.790> find

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
touchscreen which in my opinion I find

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
touchscreen which in my opinion I find
not<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> best<00:01:26.070> thing<00:01:26.280> because<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.670> don't

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
not to be the best thing because I don't

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
not to be the best thing because I don't
really<00:01:27.090> care<00:01:27.630> about<00:01:27.750> touch<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.650> do

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
really care about touch I I do

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
really care about touch I I do
everything<00:01:29.220> manually<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.540> controller

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
everything manually with the controller

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.039 
everything manually with the controller
and<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.950> don't<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:32.970> helping<00:01:33.479> me<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and I don't see it helping me in the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.340 
and I don't see it helping me in the
game<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.409> um<00:01:35.030> maybe<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> future<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:37.020> in

scenarios but some something that really
was<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.020> course<00:01:58.380> obvious<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.310> fact

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
was of course obvious is the the fact

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.130 
was of course obvious is the the fact
that<00:01:59.640> they<00:02:00.060> had<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.420> enhance<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> new

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that they had to enhance the new

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.130 
that they had to enhance the new
hardware<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.479> everything<00:02:03.479> running<00:02:03.689> inside

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
hardware and everything running inside

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.429 
hardware and everything running inside
the<00:02:04.380> console<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.040> course<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.869> ps3<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the console of course that the ps3 is

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.979 
the console of course that the ps3 is
something<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:09.239> six<00:02:09.509> years<00:02:09.599> old

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
something which is on what six years old

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.830 
something which is on what six years old
now<00:02:10.140> so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
now so

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.509 
now so
of<00:02:12.050> course<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.620> need<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.800> compete<00:02:13.190> with<00:02:13.370> the

don't want to read the specs because the

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.319 
don't want to read the specs because the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.520 
tech terms but some something I do know
is<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:12.230> ps4<00:03:13.040> will<00:03:13.610> have<00:03:13.879> 8<00:03:14.629> gigabytes<00:03:15.319> of

have half a gigabyte of RAM so that's

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.370 
have half a gigabyte of RAM so that's
that's<00:03:30.530> x<00:03:31.250> 16<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.690> place<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.930> ship<00:03:33.200> for
