walk<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.030> circle<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.080> one<00:01:57.289> movement<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
walk the circle and one movement is the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.820 
walk the circle and one movement is the
dragon<00:01:58.909> turns<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.720> body<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.439> don't<00:02:00.530> look<00:02:00.649> out

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
dragon turns the body you don't look out

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.770 
dragon turns the body you don't look out
with<00:02:01.039> this<00:02:01.189> hand<00:02:01.460> come<00:02:02.060> across<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.600> this

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
with this hand come across with this

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.120 
with this hand come across with this
hand<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:03.560> spin<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.880> we<00:02:05.000> breathe<00:02:05.470> deflect

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.600 

we<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.180> add<00:02:13.330> some<00:02:13.360> moves<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.320> your

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
we can add some moves to this if your

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.760 
we can add some moves to this if your
attackers<00:02:15.610> gonna<00:02:15.790> throw<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> punch<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:17.590> can

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
attackers gonna throw a punch we can

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.910 
attackers gonna throw a punch we can
show<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:19.180> foot<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> back<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.770> wrist

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
show the foot to the back of the wrist

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.920 
show the foot to the back of the wrist
that's<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> first<00:02:21.940> part<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.300> deflected<00:02:22.840> in

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
that's the first part the deflected in

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.840 
that's the first part the deflected in
the<00:02:23.050> spin<00:02:24.570> deflect<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.890> spin<00:02:26.890> coming<00:02:27.580> across

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
the spin deflect and spin coming across

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.780 
the spin deflect and spin coming across
the<00:02:28.270> face<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.260> when<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.440> spin<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.340> can<00:02:30.670> always

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
the face and when I spin I can always

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.090 
the face and when I spin I can always
throw<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.090> kick<00:02:31.390> right<00:02:31.510> into<00:02:31.810> their<00:02:31.960> play<00:02:32.080> okay

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
throw a kick right into their play okay

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.770 
throw a kick right into their play okay
so<00:02:33.460> might<00:02:33.670> add<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> few<00:02:33.970> moves<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.570> make<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
so might add a few moves to make it a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.370 
so might add a few moves to make it a
little<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:35.050> more<00:02:36.600> impactful<00:02:37.600> or<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.200> little

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
little bit more impactful or a little

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.450 
little bit more impactful or a little
more<00:02:38.440> colorful<00:02:38.800> for<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.220> sake<00:02:39.430> of

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
more colorful for the sake of

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.130 
more colorful for the sake of
application<00:02:40.090> good<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:42.030> went<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.380> said<00:02:46.140> if

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
application good I went and I said if

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.360 
application good I went and I said if
it's<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.440> other<00:02:47.500> hand<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:47.950> works<00:02:48.130> just<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
it's the other hand it works just the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.000 
it's the other hand it works just the
same<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.790> same<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> ribs<00:02:53.650> or<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
same the same and then to the ribs or to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.950 
same the same and then to the ribs or to
the<00:02:54.100> keys<00:02:54.280> now<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.210> start<00:02:55.540> each<00:02:55.690> fighting

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
the keys now we start each fighting

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.410 
the keys now we start each fighting
application<00:02:56.590> from<00:02:56.710> a<00:02:56.800> strong<00:02:57.100> stance<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:58.300> they

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
application from a strong stance so they

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.300 
application from a strong stance so they
were<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.570> boxer<00:02:59.080> punching<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.920> had<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
were a boxer punching in I had the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.950 
were a boxer punching in I had the
ability<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.760> kind<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.030> give<00:03:01.210> myself<00:03:01.360> some<00:03:01.780> time

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
ability to kind of give myself some time

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.640 
ability to kind of give myself some time
again<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.270> move<00:03:04.510> shifting<00:03:05.200> my<00:03:05.320> stance

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
again so in this move shifting my stance

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.980 
again so in this move shifting my stance
give<00:03:05.860> myself<00:03:06.010> some<00:03:06.280> time<00:03:06.400> again<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:07.030> can

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
give myself some time again I can

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.390 
give myself some time again I can
deflect<00:03:08.370> come<00:03:09.370> across<00:03:10.320> spin<00:03:11.320> through<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.920> hit

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400
