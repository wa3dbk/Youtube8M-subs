about how I got this video onto my ipad

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.900 
about how I got this video onto my ipad
what<00:03:58.140> are<00:03:58.260> used<00:03:58.410> for<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:59.580> here<00:03:59.760> we<00:03:59.850> are

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
what are used for that so here we are

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.060 
what are used for that so here we are
we've<00:04:00.030> opened<00:04:00.330> up<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.600> some<00:04:00.930> file<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.800> edit

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
we've opened up this some file to edit

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.550 
we've opened up this some file to edit
it<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.360> see<00:04:03.510> me<00:04:03.660> tapping<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.350> there

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
it and you can see me tapping on there

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.430 
it and you can see me tapping on there
to<00:04:04.800> this<00:04:05.400> some<00:04:06.019> screen<00:04:07.019> job<00:04:07.200> from<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
to this some screen job from the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.920 
to this some screen job from the
Australian<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:09.030> want<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.239> do<00:04:09.390> some<00:04:09.570> panning

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
Australian so want to do some panning

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.449 
Australian so want to do some panning
and<00:04:09.989> zooming<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.100> can<00:04:11.250> set<00:04:11.430> it

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
and zooming on that and you can set it

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.009 
and zooming on that and you can set it
so<00:04:11.640> it's<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> bit<00:04:11.940> like<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.120> Ken<00:04:12.570> Burns<00:04:12.600> effect

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
so it's a bit like a Ken Burns effect

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.160 
so it's a bit like a Ken Burns effect
works<00:04:14.010> quite<00:04:14.340> nicely

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
works quite nicely

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.710 
works quite nicely
and<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.040> can<00:04:17.160> set<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.970> seconds<00:04:18.480> down<00:04:18.600> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
and you can set the seconds down the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.940 
and you can set the seconds down the
bottom<00:04:18.930> there<00:04:18.960> how<00:04:19.200> long<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.470> want<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.800> go

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
bottom there how long you want it to go

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.800 
bottom there how long you want it to go
for<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.490> particular<00:04:21.020> effect<00:04:22.020> etc<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:24.750> course

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
for that particular effect etc of course

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.360 
for that particular effect etc of course
there's<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.200> transitions<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:25.980> here<00:04:26.160> we<00:04:26.250> are

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
there's the transitions and here we are

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.600 
there's the transitions and here we are
we<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.780> just<00:04:27.780> flick<00:04:28.050> through<00:04:28.260> them<00:04:28.610> iphone

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
we can just flick through them iphone

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.130 
we can just flick through them iphone
style<00:04:29.970> until<00:04:30.300> we've<00:04:30.480> them<00:04:30.660> found<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.020> one

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
style until we've them found the one

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.300 
style until we've them found the one
that<00:04:31.230> we<00:04:31.320> want<00:04:31.530> gives<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:31.950> nice<00:04:32.100> little

live<00:04:32.640> preview<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.860> transition<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:36.150> by

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
live preview of the transition just by

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.780 
live preview of the transition just by

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
want some sort of shading behind etc so

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.590 
want some sort of shading behind etc so
a<00:05:08.610> lot<00:05:08.730> of<00:05:08.760> flexibility<00:05:09.270> there<00:05:09.450> you'll

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
a lot of flexibility there you'll

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.720 
a lot of flexibility there you'll
recognize<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.050> bit<00:05:10.470> similar<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:11.220> maybe<00:05:13.730> yeah

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
recognize a bit similar to I maybe yeah

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.720 
recognize a bit similar to I maybe yeah
so<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.030> can<00:05:15.300> add<00:05:15.710> recorded<00:05:16.710> sounds<00:05:17.160> this<00:05:17.580> is

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
so you can add recorded sounds this is

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.570 
so you can add recorded sounds this is
what<00:05:17.880> we<00:05:17.970> were<00:05:18.090> talking<00:05:18.330> about<00:05:18.390> before<00:05:19.460> set<00:05:20.460> it

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
what we were talking about before set it

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.310 
what we were talking about before set it
up<00:05:20.700> tap<00:05:21.360> what<00:05:21.540> you<00:05:21.600> want<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:21.870> start<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.230> off<00:05:22.290> it

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
up tap what you want to start and off it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.800 
up tap what you want to start and off it
goes<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.950> then<00:05:23.880> ice<00:05:24.030> blue<00:05:24.300> they<00:05:24.510> had<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.690> give

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
goes and then ice blue they had to give

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.430 
goes and then ice blue they had to give
us<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.110> salvage<00:05:25.590> all<00:05:26.930> have<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.050> stop<00:05:28.260> and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
us that salvage all have to stop and

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.080 
us that salvage all have to stop and
then<00:05:28.470> you<00:05:28.680> can<00:05:28.980> move<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.640> around<00:05:29.700> etc

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
then you can move that around etc

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.200 
then you can move that around etc
wherever<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:30.750> want<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.640> other<00:05:32.640> options<00:05:32.790> are
