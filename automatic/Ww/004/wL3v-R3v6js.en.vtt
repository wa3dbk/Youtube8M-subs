 Formula 1 World Championship 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.859
 as was the environment of Formula 1 in the 1950s 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.339
 in the 50's 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.339
 everything very different in the leg there was practically no money 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.559
 and was of Tamil the golden decade of the river 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.340

 there was no security that exists today there was no security 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.939
 the league must achieve something quite different 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.279

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.889
