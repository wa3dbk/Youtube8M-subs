charger for the battery now I can tell
right<00:01:23.820> away<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.150> battery<00:01:24.509> does<00:01:24.840> look

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
right away the battery does look

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
right away the battery does look
different<00:01:25.380> than<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.040> gh4<00:01:26.340> battery<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.150> that's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
different than my gh4 battery so that's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
different than my gh4 battery so that's
a<00:01:27.420> shame<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> bunch<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> batteries<00:01:28.680> for

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
a shame I have a bunch of batteries for

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.690 
a shame I have a bunch of batteries for
my<00:01:28.979> gh4

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
my gh4

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.569 
my gh4
so<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.630> guessing<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.170> won't<00:01:31.500> work<00:01:31.829> with

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
so I'm guessing they won't work with

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
so I'm guessing they won't work with
this<00:01:32.759> camera<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.380> has<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.829> wall

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
plug which is a little nicer than the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
plug which is a little nicer than the
actual<00:01:37.409> extra<00:01:37.860> cord<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.820> more

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.059 
gh4 and box so I'll actually never mind
not<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.769> gh4<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.549> very<00:02:24.790> similar<00:02:25.120> gh4<00:02:25.629> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
not the gh4 it's very similar gh4 the

mention my last video 240 frames per
second<00:02:39.819> at<00:02:39.909> 720p<00:02:40.299> so<00:02:40.870> that's<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.109> very

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
second at 720p so that's a very

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.110 
second at 720p so that's a very
impressive<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.400> first<00:02:42.790> quick<00:02:43.450> impressions

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
impressive so first quick impressions

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.699 
impressive so first quick impressions
the<00:02:46.120> plastic<00:02:46.540> does<00:02:46.780> feel<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.109> little<00:02:47.349> bit

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
the plastic does feel a little bit

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.449 
the plastic does feel a little bit
cheaper<00:02:48.609> up<00:02:49.269> top<00:02:50.019> than<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.439> gh4<00:02:50.709> I'm<00:02:51.040> guessing

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
cheaper up top than the gh4 I'm guessing

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.270 
cheaper up top than the gh4 I'm guessing
because<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.700> gh4<00:02:51.970> actually<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.569> metal<00:02:52.989> but

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
because the gh4 actually is metal but

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.280 
because the gh4 actually is metal but
still<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.489> same<00:02:54.730> exact<00:02:55.060> grip<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.840> feels

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
still the same exact grip it feels

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.250 
still the same exact grip it feels
fantastic<00:02:56.859> in<00:02:57.489> my<00:02:57.669> hand<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.870> plastic

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
fantastic in my hand and the plastic

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.960 
fantastic in my hand and the plastic
doesn't<00:02:59.650> feel<00:02:59.799> cheap<00:03:00.069> likes<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.430> some<00:03:00.790> other

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
doesn't feel cheap likes on some other

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.569 
doesn't feel cheap likes on some other

and up top the button laying it was a

up top here but I'll get into more
outside<00:03:36.519> I'll<00:03:36.669> do<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.849> side-by-side<00:03:37.139> video<00:03:38.139> for

outside I'll do a side-by-side video for

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.920 
outside I'll do a side-by-side video for
you<00:03:38.590> guys<00:03:38.769> but<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.159> lens<00:03:39.400> looks<00:03:40.060> very<00:03:40.510> very

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
you guys but the lens looks very very

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.069 
you guys but the lens looks very very
huge<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:42.430> guys<00:03:42.489> are<00:03:42.790> seeing<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.239> it's<00:03:43.629> very

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
huge you guys are seeing this it's very

huge you guys are seeing this it's very
very<00:03:44.409> fat<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:44.859> I'm<00:03:45.819> guessing<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.239> needs<00:03:46.449> that

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
very fat and I'm guessing it needs that

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.170 
very fat and I'm guessing it needs that
because<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.139> really<00:03:47.379> large<00:03:47.739> 25<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.639> 400

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
because of the really large 25 to 400

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.899 
because of the really large 25 to 400
zoom<00:03:49.650> amount<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:51.129> you<00:03:51.250> have<00:03:51.370> your<00:03:51.489> optical

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
zoom amount and you have your optical

image<00:03:52.150> stabilization<00:03:52.569> switches<00:03:53.560> let's<00:03:54.310> go

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
image stabilization switches let's go

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.119 
image stabilization switches let's go
ahead<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.609> pop<00:03:54.729> the<00:03:54.879> screen<00:03:55.090> open<00:03:55.829> now<00:03:56.829> I'm

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
ahead and pop the screen open now I'm

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.670 
ahead and pop the screen open now I'm
not<00:03:57.370> sure<00:03:57.609> but<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.909> may<00:03:58.419> seem<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.409> screen

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
not sure but it may seem that the screen

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.159 
not sure but it may seem that the screen
smaller<00:04:00.129> I<00:04:00.579> can't<00:04:01.090> say<00:04:01.239> for<00:04:01.299> sure<00:04:01.479> guys<00:04:01.780> but
