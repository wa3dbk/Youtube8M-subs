 kalanchoe the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.500
 is the base of earth and moss that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 It will replace the plant pot 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.730
 make this base as the size of the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.950
 palm of my hand you're going to need 500 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.290
 grams of soil 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.060
 we add a teaspoon of clay 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.190
 you get it in any money 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.280
 as garden mud we complete with 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.670
 water and we mix the two substrates up 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.460
 achieve a homogeneous mass look how it goes 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.910
 being like a pizza or bread bun 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.250
 Once the next step is to extend the mass 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.560
 on a flat surface where you can 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.840
 transplant the plant to wrap it and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.150
 make it the new environment of the plant 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.820
 choose the seedling that you like the most 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.130
 you remove from the flowerpot fixing the part 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.800
 lower root discovered and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.170
 removing some dirt from the end 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.600
 top we wrap the seedling with the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.299
 mass that we prepare 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.090
 missing now only cover the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.580
 ball with the moss we deserve it a little and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.409
 we are covering the entire ball little by little 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.250
 the function of the world will be to maintain 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.530
 the humidity of the coke lady of slope that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.479
 adhere the moss do not forget 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.229
 add water uses the amount that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.119
 you need 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.220
 once we cover the ball with the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.500
 moss we use a green thread of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.610
 polyester to hold it we give the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.909
 number of turns needed and once 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.210
 finished we hold the thread in the part 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.850
 lower and in this way it looks good 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.679
 subject everyone to the ball the only thing 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.030
