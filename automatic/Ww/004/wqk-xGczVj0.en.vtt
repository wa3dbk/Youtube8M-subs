been coming out a lot of products it's

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.900 
been coming out a lot of products it's
very<00:04:13.540> hot<00:04:13.810> right<00:04:13.990> now<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> stimulant<00:04:15.430> can

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
should notice ablution energy from it

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.010 
should notice ablution energy from it
there<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.190> some<00:04:21.430> it's<00:04:22.210> used<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.630> lot<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.900> weight

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
there is some it's used a lot of weight

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.020 
there is some it's used a lot of weight
loss<00:04:23.170> products<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.650> things<00:04:23.710> like<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.730> I

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
loss products and things like that but I

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.970 
loss products and things like that but I
think<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.450> has<00:04:25.630> more<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.230> use<00:04:26.770> as<00:04:26.950> a

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
think it has more of a use as a

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.860 
think it has more of a use as a
stimulant<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.700> less<00:04:27.910> than<00:04:28.120> less<00:04:28.540> as<00:04:28.690> weight

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
stimulant and less than less as weight

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.830 
stimulant and less than less as weight
loss<00:04:29.040> centers<00:04:30.040> around<00:04:30.190> him<00:04:30.610> around<00:04:31.210> TM<00:04:31.600> and

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
loss centers around him around TM and

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.460 
loss centers around him around TM and
then<00:04:32.230> caffeine<00:04:33.030> there's<00:04:34.030> 250<00:04:34.960> milligrams<00:04:35.200> of

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
then caffeine there's 250 milligrams of

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.700 
then caffeine there's 250 milligrams of
caffeine<00:04:35.680> per<00:04:36.220> serving<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:38.050> other<00:04:38.200> one

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
caffeine per serving of the other one

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.100 
caffeine per serving of the other one
two<00:04:39.010> three<00:04:39.670> four<00:04:39.910> ingredients<00:04:40.150> there's

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
two three four ingredients there's

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.610 
two three four ingredients there's
around<00:04:41.950> 400<00:04:42.670> milligrams<00:04:42.970> total<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.140> that<00:04:44.380> so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
around 400 milligrams total in that so

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.640 
around 400 milligrams total in that so
it<00:04:44.740> is<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.860> proprietary<00:04:45.190> blend<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:47.080> then<00:04:47.530> the

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
it is a proprietary blend and then the

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.350 
it is a proprietary blend and then the
capping<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.040> theme<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.340> 250<00:04:48.820> milligrams<00:04:49.030> so

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
capping a theme is 250 milligrams so

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.100 
capping a theme is 250 milligrams so
it's<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.870> good<00:04:49.990> list<00:04:50.170> of<00:04:50.290> caffeine<00:04:50.650> per<00:04:50.890> scoop

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
it's a good list of caffeine per scoop

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.070 
it's a good list of caffeine per scoop
so<00:04:53.110> it's<00:04:53.560> about<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:54.070> large<00:04:54.400> coffee<00:04:55.080> so

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
so it's about a large coffee so

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.930 
so it's about a large coffee so
depending<00:04:56.410> on<00:04:56.410> house<00:04:56.650> Tyler<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.550> are<00:04:57.700> to

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
depending on house Tyler you are to

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.180 
depending on house Tyler you are to
caffeine<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:59.230> should<00:04:59.470> be<00:04:59.560> something<00:04:59.770> you'll

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
caffeine it should be something you'll

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.970 
caffeine it should be something you'll
feel<00:05:00.520> right<00:05:00.940> away<00:05:01.210> with<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.170> 25th<00:05:02.590> milligrams

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
feel right away with the 25th milligrams

of caffeine they are recommending let's

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.690 
of caffeine they are recommending let's
see<00:05:07.500> start<00:05:08.500> with<00:05:08.620> one<00:05:08.800> scoop<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.340> assess<00:05:09.610> your

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
see start with one scoop to assess your

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.580 
see start with one scoop to assess your
tolerance<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.570> then<00:05:10.660> you<00:05:10.780> may<00:05:10.930> go<00:05:11.140> up<00:05:11.200> to<00:05:11.410> two

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
tolerance and then you may go up to two

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.850 
tolerance and then you may go up to two
scoops<00:05:12.030> I<00:05:13.030> have<00:05:13.990> seen<00:05:14.320> some<00:05:14.500> people<00:05:14.740> talking

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
scoops I have seen some people talking

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.590 
scoops I have seen some people talking
that<00:05:15.220> if<00:05:15.370> they've<00:05:15.490> taken<00:05:15.700> one<00:05:16.000> skip<00:05:16.270> one<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.570> a

that if they've taken one skip one and a

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.399 
that if they've taken one skip one and a
half

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
half

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.019 
half
gone<00:05:17.679> to<00:05:17.769> the<00:05:17.860> two<00:05:18.009> because<00:05:18.309> that's<00:05:18.489> 500

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:19.029 
gone to the two because that's 500

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.909 
gone to the two because that's 500
milligrams<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.509> caffeine<00:05:19.659> it's<00:05:20.379> a<00:05:20.499> pretty

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
milligrams of caffeine it's a pretty

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.609 
milligrams of caffeine it's a pretty
good<00:05:21.129> dose<00:05:21.369> of<00:05:21.519> caffeine<00:05:21.759> in<00:05:22.029> one<00:05:22.179> shot<00:05:22.619> again

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:23.619 
good dose of caffeine in one shot again

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.339 
good dose of caffeine in one shot again
it<00:05:23.739> depends<00:05:24.309> how<00:05:24.539> tolerant<00:05:25.539> you<00:05:25.929> are<00:05:26.080> to

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
it depends how tolerant you are to

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.929 
it depends how tolerant you are to
stimulate<00:05:26.800> them<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.099> caffeine<00:05:27.459> in<00:05:27.610> general

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:29.709 
priority milligram that one could cause

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:32.279

that<00:05:32.379> jitters<00:05:33.039> I<00:05:33.189> guess<00:05:33.249> is<00:05:33.580> another<00:05:33.819> report

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:34.499 
that jitters I guess is another report

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.570 
that jitters I guess is another report
there's<00:05:35.499> I<00:05:35.860> think<00:05:36.610> three<00:05:36.939> three<00:05:37.539> flavors<00:05:38.580> this

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
there's I think three three flavors this

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.100 
there's I think three three flavors this
is<00:05:39.759> the<00:05:39.879> fruit<00:05:40.119> punch<00:05:40.149> I<00:05:40.689> think<00:05:40.899> there's<00:05:41.050> a

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
is the fruit punch I think there's a

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.290 
is the fruit punch I think there's a
strawberry<00:05:41.619> kiwi<00:05:42.129> and<00:05:42.399> one<00:05:42.759> other<00:05:42.879> one<00:05:43.149> it's

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
strawberry kiwi and one other one it's

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.049 
strawberry kiwi and one other one it's
escaping<00:05:43.659> me<00:05:43.899> but<00:05:44.080> as<00:05:45.069> far<00:05:45.219> as<00:05:45.279> taste<00:05:45.639> wives<00:05:45.909> of
