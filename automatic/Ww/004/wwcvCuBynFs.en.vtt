but well before I even plugged it in I
started<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.080> have<00:00:07.230> some<00:00:07.470> doubts<00:00:07.849> the<00:00:08.849> 5/8

mechanism for the guard is what first
concerned<00:00:20.220> me<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.640> cranked<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> screwed<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:21.990> as

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
concerned me I cranked the screwed on as

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.970 
concerned me I cranked the screwed on as
tight<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.650> would<00:00:22.769> go

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
tight as it would go

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.640 
tight as it would go
and<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.820> fully<00:00:24.060> closed<00:00:24.619> but<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and you can see it's fully closed but I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.620 
and you can see it's fully closed but I
can<00:00:25.859> still<00:00:26.130> reposition<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.910> guard<00:00:27.150> fairly

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
can still reposition a guard fairly

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.080 
can still reposition a guard fairly
easily<00:00:27.810> by<00:00:28.230> hand<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.519> concerns<00:00:29.939> me

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
easily by hand and that concerns me

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.730 
easily by hand and that concerns me
because<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.599> force<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.050> present<00:00:31.230> during<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
because the force is present during a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.380 
because the force is present during a
kickback<00:00:32.219> or<00:00:32.430> some<00:00:32.610> other<00:00:32.759> acts<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.329> are

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
kickback or some other acts and are

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.569 
kickback or some other acts and are
going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.750> far<00:00:34.020> greater<00:00:34.100> other<00:00:35.100> angle

going to be far greater other angle
grinders<00:00:35.969> I've<00:00:36.149> looked<00:00:36.420> at<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> much

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
grinders I've looked at have a much

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
grinders I've looked at have a much
tighter<00:00:37.320> clamp<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.980> locks<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> guard<00:00:38.670> down

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
tighter clamp that locks the guard down

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.479 
tighter clamp that locks the guard down
or<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> profile<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.770> inside<00:00:41.219> edge

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
or have a profile or on this inside edge

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.060 
or have a profile or on this inside edge
that<00:00:41.879> keeps<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> place<00:00:42.660> those<00:00:43.530> profiles

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that keeps it in place those profiles

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
that keeps it in place those profiles
repeat<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.149> move<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> guard<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
repeat so you can move the guard to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.479 
repeat so you can move the guard to
different<00:00:46.289> locations<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.250> still

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
different locations but it's still

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.080 
different locations but it's still
secure

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
secure

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
secure
another<00:00:48.690> point<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> concern<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.620> finding

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
another point of concern is finding

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
another point of concern is finding
exterior<00:00:50.460> brush<00:00:50.700> holders<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> extra<00:00:51.750> brushes

exterior brush holders and extra brushes

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
exterior brush holders and extra brushes
packed<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> tool<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.610> made<00:00:53.789> in

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
packed in with the tool I was made in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.180 
packed in with the tool I was made in
this<00:00:54.149> decade<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.440> brush<00:00:55.649> assemblies

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this decade one of the brush assemblies

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
this decade one of the brush assemblies
wasn't<00:00:56.550> even<00:00:56.699> assembled<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.390> that's<00:00:57.539> okay

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
wasn't even assembled but that's okay

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.060 
wasn't even assembled but that's okay
because<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.170> doubt<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.590> tool<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
because I doubt this tool is going to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.619 
because I doubt this tool is going to
last<00:00:59.219> long<00:00:59.489> enough<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.789> need<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.239> anyway

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
last long enough to need it anyway

last long enough to need it anyway
another<00:01:01.500> problem<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> brush<00:01:02.309> holders

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
another problem with the brush holders

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.369 
another problem with the brush holders
is<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.180> they're<00:01:03.390> raised<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> right

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
is that they're raised and the right

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
is that they're raised and the right
where<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> need<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> put<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.280> hand<00:01:05.549> have

where you need to put your hand have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
where you need to put your hand have
