the only difference compared to the
regular<00:00:24.150> blu-ray<00:00:24.810> edition<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.380> it

regular blu-ray edition is that it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
includes a DVD along with it so it's a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.740 
includes a DVD along with it so it's a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
like the white cover just a little bit

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.510 
like the white cover just a little bit
better<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.710> sucker<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:49.920> when<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
better but I'm a sucker for when it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.119 
better but I'm a sucker for when it
comes<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.530> exclusive<00:00:52.530> slipcovers<00:00:53.100> and

somebody as a cheap gift and everything
taking<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.370> back<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
taking a look at the back the back is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.810 
taking a look at the back the back is
the<00:01:02.850> exact<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> white<00:01:03.960> cover<00:01:10.820> slip

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the exact same as the white cover slip

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
the exact same as the white cover slip
also<00:01:12.180> has<00:01:12.360> some<00:01:12.659> sort<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> holographic

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
also has some sort of a holographic

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
also has some sort of a holographic
effect<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.760> which<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.030> pretty

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
effect going right here which is pretty

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.870 
effect going right here which is pretty
cool<00:01:18.740> let's<00:01:19.740> open<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.119> have

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
cool let's open this up see what we have

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
cool let's open this up see what we have
another<00:01:23.880> reason<00:01:24.090> why<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.080> unique<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
another reason why this is so unique is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.670 
another reason why this is so unique is
that<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.880> includes<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.600> clear<00:01:27.930> blu-ray<00:01:28.409> case

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that it includes a clear blu-ray case

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
that it includes a clear blu-ray case
much<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> 3d<00:01:30.000> blu-ray<00:01:30.299> releases<00:01:30.840> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
much like the 3d blu-ray releases that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.980 
much like the 3d blu-ray releases that
Sony<00:01:31.710> usually<00:01:32.189> does<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.659> dig<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
Sony usually does I kind of dig it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.770 
Sony usually does I kind of dig it
actually<00:01:34.670> makes<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> film<00:01:35.970> stand<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
actually makes the film stand out so it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.060 
actually makes the film stand out so it
looks<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> same<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.480 

open<00:01:44.070> up

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
open up

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.719 
open up
there's<00:01:45.060> inside<00:01:45.600> cover<00:01:45.990> art<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.189> really

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
there's inside cover art which I really

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:57.319 
there's inside cover art which I really
really<00:01:47.759> enjoy<00:01:52.880> blu-ray

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:08.729 

DVD<00:02:01.680> digital<00:02:02.680> copy<00:02:06.750> each<00:02:07.750> disc<00:02:08.080> also<00:02:08.380> gets<00:02:08.590> its

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
DVD digital copy each disc also gets its

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.199 
DVD digital copy each disc also gets its
own<00:02:08.860> cover<00:02:09.160> art<00:02:09.340> which<00:02:09.519> i<00:02:09.640> think<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.940> pretty

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
own cover art which i think is pretty

cool put that back there my digital copy

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.320 
cool put that back there my digital copy
code<00:02:15.819> which<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.209> probably<00:02:16.450> won't<00:02:16.660> use<00:02:18.090> put<00:02:19.090> this

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
code which I probably won't use put this

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.050 
code which I probably won't use put this
back<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:22.410> overall<00:02:23.410> though<00:02:23.800> when<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.580> said<00:02:24.880> that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
back but overall though when I said that

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.199 
back but overall though when I said that
this<00:02:25.150> disc<00:02:25.420> was<00:02:25.510> near<00:02:25.810> perfection<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:27.209> pretty

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
this disc was near perfection I pretty

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.080 
this disc was near perfection I pretty
much<00:02:28.330> do<00:02:28.690> believe<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:30.549> video<00:02:30.819> and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
much do believe that and the video and

quality to me personally had it not been
for<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.569> somewhat<00:02:38.110> lacking<00:02:38.459> set<00:02:39.459> of

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
for the for the somewhat lacking set of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.490 
for the for the somewhat lacking set of
features<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.239> probably<00:02:40.959> would<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.319> given

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
features I probably would have given

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.920 
features I probably would have given
this<00:02:41.709> disc<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.069> perfect<00:02:42.430> 5<00:02:42.549> out<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.760> 5<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this disc a perfect 5 out of 5 but the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.170 
this disc a perfect 5 out of 5 but the
reason<00:02:44.290> why<00:02:44.440> it's<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.040> great<00:02:45.280> well<00:02:45.730> first<00:02:46.030> I'll

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
reason why it's so great well first I'll

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.699 
reason why it's so great well first I'll
start<00:02:46.269> out<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.630> picture<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.349> then<00:02:47.500> I

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
start out with a picture and then I

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.640 
start out with a picture and then I
first<00:02:48.069> want<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.459> explain<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.079> avatar

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
first want to explain this is not avatar

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.690 
first want to explain this is not avatar
this<00:02:51.069> well<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:52.299> was<00:02:52.599> shot<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.519> very

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
this well it was shot on in a very

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.160 
this well it was shot on in a very
different<00:02:55.000> style<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.299> think<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.540> was<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> 16

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
different style I think it was on a 16

millimeter and with several other

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.940 
millimeter and with several other
cameras<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.660> image<00:02:58.930> isn't<00:02:59.410> quite

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
cameras so the image isn't quite

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.580 
cameras so the image isn't quite
necessarily<00:03:00.910> how<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.900> see<00:03:02.319> it

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
necessarily how I see it

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.099 
necessarily how I see it
it's<00:03:03.190> not<00:03:03.430> necessarily<00:03:04.120> sharp<00:03:04.750> or<00:03:04.900> anything

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
it's not necessarily sharp or anything

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.460 
it's not necessarily sharp or anything
the<00:03:05.650> sixteen<00:03:06.040> millimeter<00:03:06.720> cameras<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.959> are

the sixteen millimeter cameras that are

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.860 
the sixteen millimeter cameras that are
an<00:03:09.010> auskey<00:03:09.370> shot<00:03:09.609> with<00:03:09.880> kind<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.540> gives<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
an auskey shot with kind of gives the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.800 
an auskey shot with kind of gives the
image<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.319> grainy<00:03:11.769> soft<00:03:12.450> picture<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.780> way

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
image a grainy soft picture in a way

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.430 
image a grainy soft picture in a way
detail<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.920> still<00:03:15.130> great<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.959> doesn't

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
detail is still great but it doesn't

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.990 
detail is still great but it doesn't
look<00:03:17.650> like<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:18.310> isn't<00:03:18.489> something<00:03:18.790> you'd

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
look like this isn't something you'd

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.789 
look like this isn't something you'd
want<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.239> show<00:03:19.389> off<00:03:19.510> your<00:03:19.660> high-def<00:03:20.230> TV<00:03:20.410> for

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
want to show off your high-def TV for

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.890 
want to show off your high-def TV for
but<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.370> reason<00:03:21.700> why<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:21.910> works<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.299> well<00:03:22.660> is

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
but the reason why it works so well is

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.229 
but the reason why it works so well is
because<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.410> was<00:03:23.590> how<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.859> film<00:03:24.310> was<00:03:24.730> shot

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
because that was how the film was shot

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.180 
because that was how the film was shot
in<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.569> way<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:25.959> was<00:03:26.109> intended<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.709> look

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
in the way that it was intended to look

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.699 
in the way that it was intended to look
much<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.269> 28<00:03:28.810> days<00:03:29.019> later<00:03:29.049> blu-ray

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
much like the 28 days later blu-ray

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.190 
much like the 28 days later blu-ray
which<00:03:29.920> admittingly<00:03:30.459> does<00:03:30.790> not<00:03:30.970> look<00:03:31.239> good<00:03:31.480> but

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
which admittingly does not look good but

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.349 
which admittingly does not look good but
and<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.920> was<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.160> way<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.310> was<00:03:33.430> shot<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.090> it

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
and it was the way it was shot so it

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.910 
and it was the way it was shot so it
kind<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.630> keeps<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.959> integrity<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.680> field

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
kind of keeps the integrity of the field

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.160 
kind of keeps the integrity of the field
of<00:03:36.100> film<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.430> what<00:03:36.670> Aronofsky<00:03:37.090> wanted<00:03:37.930> or<00:03:38.079> at

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
of film in what Aronofsky wanted or at

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.690 
of film in what Aronofsky wanted or at
least<00:03:38.290> what<00:03:38.410> boyle<00:03:38.680> wanted<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.190> 28<00:03:39.670> days

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
least what boyle wanted for 28 days

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.509 
least what boyle wanted for 28 days
later<00:03:40.000> but<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:41.170> picture<00:03:41.560> quality<00:03:41.799> yeah<00:03:42.310> is

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
later but the picture quality yeah is

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.710 
later but the picture quality yeah is
not<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.910> best<00:03:43.090> when<00:03:43.269> compared<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.600> other

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
not the best when compared to other

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.390 
not the best when compared to other
blues<00:03:43.959> but<00:03:44.200> for<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.470> style<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.920> film<00:03:45.100> and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
blues but for the style of the film and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.009 
blues but for the style of the film and
for<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.579> way<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.120> integrity<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.660> this

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
for the way and the integrity that this

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.069 
for the way and the integrity that this
film<00:03:47.260> was<00:03:47.470> shot<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:47.769> it's<00:03:48.280> very<00:03:49.090> very<00:03:49.780> good

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
film was shot in it's very very good

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.500 
film was shot in it's very very good
I<00:03:50.200> mean<00:03:50.440> colors<00:03:50.769> are<00:03:50.950> still<00:03:51.190> great<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
I mean colors are still great the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.530 
I mean colors are still great the
probably<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:52.989> best<00:03:53.670> seen<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.880> my<00:03:55.000> opinion<00:03:55.389> is

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
probably the best seen in my opinion is

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.870 
probably the best seen in my opinion is
the<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.440> entire<00:03:56.650> black<00:03:56.889> swan<00:03:57.190> metamorphosis
