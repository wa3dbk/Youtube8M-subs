 that the 22 very good states and today 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.340
 It will be very difficult to define who is going 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.230

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.169
 accommodated the song much better than in 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.299
 me and there I felt it a little bit 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.799
 fought with the song but it has 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.750
 been good is a good assembly is going 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.130
