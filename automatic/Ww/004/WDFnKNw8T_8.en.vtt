00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.790
 when the day breaks and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.420
 a makeup that we can serve 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.460
 our prom party for our 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.400
 Quinceanera or party of 15 years or some 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.800
 event where we want to see ourselves very fresh 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 for our makeup inspires tenderness 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.300
 and a bit like sensuality 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.370
 so if you want to see how I got this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.370
 makeup still watching this video 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.510
 ah 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.920
 in this makeup I focus more on the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.020
 part of the eyes then after 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.720
 Apply our correction base of dark circles 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.450
 and all I do is define our 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.450
 them so that they mark our look 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.410
 also apply first test in the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 eyelids and you arrive with a powder 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.340
 applying quite in the area of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.160
 cheeks with that in case of every shadow 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.110
 do not stain the makeup apply this 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.060
 shadow in cream that I love and what 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.060
 Apply on the part of the animal 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.610
 now little by little and blurring with the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.189
 silver color and the other shade what 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.380
 I like it is the shade of cactus is that 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.240
 that in cream and this make it last a lot 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.790
 more time and we can last all night 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.500
 a whole party without oscar arias 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.259
 makeup and now applied without the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.220
 gra shadow makes diffuse and 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.220
 have more durability 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 and in the basin a little bit of coffee and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.600
 it was also blurring with color 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:56.400
 gold so that go by 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:00.210
 like a little bit of grace with pencil 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.970
 inem white and bottom water line 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:11.340
 so that we do not get left bigger in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:13.440
 ruiz in my eyelashes I put a lot of 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.630
 essence and many layers of mask 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000
 tabs but if you want too 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.959
 you can add to this makeup some 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.959
 false eyelashes 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.420
 then apply word on the cheek is use 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 one that had a little bit of bright 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.860
 and coss to give you a little more 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.470
 color to the skin and that suddenly in the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.260
 light of night or when we are in the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.420
 party has as an appearance more 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.090
 healthy in our skin this that they 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.910
 is showing is a glitter I chose a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.980
 pink tone because the nuggets that give 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.829
 like a litmus appearance is like 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.829
 between pink purple blue I do not know is a 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.470
 They are a mixture of very beautiful colors and 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.840
 at night it makes the skin look like 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.630
 some of the brightest ones were applied 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.610
 little in the outer cake the logo does not 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.739
 to apply everything on top because it came 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.870
 we would do with super bright eyes and 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.549
 in the photo it would not look so nice anymore 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.829
 how do I accept all the makeup 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.079
 in the eyes I will apply a tone a 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.580
 pink very soft as the color of my 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.220
 natural lips 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.560
 Also because I'm using braces 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.420
 I do not want the look to focus on the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.100
 part of the lips but rather that it 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.100
 Fix in the eyes and in the hairstyle 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.620
 and finally I start to apply a 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.629
 little bit of posts in the part of the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.540
 skin where the dress will not cover me 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.030
 with the neck and chest 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.939
 and that's how this makeup looks 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.669
 when I put the hairstyle like this is the 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.739
 result if you would like to see how it is 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.359

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.940
