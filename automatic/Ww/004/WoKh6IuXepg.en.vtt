00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.099
 yet the starry sky are white dwarfs that are in some 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.209
 sort of stellar corpses 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.599
 about 95% of the stars in the sun 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.060
 secondly the same day white alexandre cÃ©line s doctoral student at 

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.229
 physics department of the university of montreal and who says this 

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.999
 phenomenon 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.869
 my God 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 once you clean up exhausted his fuel 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.260
 on arrival the Alex chain plus is that every service and that is enough 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.920
 long and in the sense of contracting this year more 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 as long as the same markets if it had started the last step in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.960
 the city of stars all night of October 5, 2004 at the Observatory of the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.940
 Mont-MÃ©gantic 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.019
 alexandre gÃ©linas will be involved in the discovery of a white dwarf star 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.300
 variable she was professor stone shepherd it takes maybe it was a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.040
 first television series 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.240
 access using clear photos 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.170
 this white dwarf and perriers because these lines it comes to 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.840
 summer nothing to benefit from higher temperatures while 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.850
 the star is very simple 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.400
 held 50 years and over is with lg hundreds of animals waiting at each 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.490
 fifteen minutes charentais 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 with the roads of thirty american strikes in kandahar remains the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 poune 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.510
 and M 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.890
 indeed to the telescope in fact she put her talents her mannequins 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.220
 appear a few low shots this one 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.250
 per 100 ml 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.829
 as the year progresses and let its carvings 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.610
 to separate the toilet and not very bright 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.960
 these experts believe that by then find his own 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.250
 the year once this effect 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.700
 we left for 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.960
 by this acquisition had given 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.390
 there is actually this is what is done at the village hall of sarbazan was 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.690
 flew 10 to 20 cm in real time 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.480
 and so after that it's better 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 we'll see what's going on 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.920
 this discovery is undoubtedly the first in a long series for 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.410
 young researchers who all his life happened to work behind a 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.590
 telescope I've always been fascinated by science 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.810
 and the world around me but more specifically with her the star is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.409
 an act that are yours 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.120
 value makes my journey 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.750
 from primary school to now it was for their 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.220
 future is here
