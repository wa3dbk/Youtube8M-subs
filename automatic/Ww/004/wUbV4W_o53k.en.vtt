00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.070 
map and I am so freaking excited has to
do<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> bus<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.420> end<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> world

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
do with a bus and the end of the world

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.890 
do with a bus and the end of the world
and<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.370> freaking<00:00:14.910> amazing<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.509> see

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and it's so freaking amazing so you see

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.180 
and it's so freaking amazing so you see
the<00:00:15.990> bus<00:00:16.109> right<00:00:16.260> here<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.560> get<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> bus

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the bus right here you get on the bus

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.790 
the bus right here you get on the bus
I'm<00:00:17.400> guessing<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.359> then<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.140> defend<00:00:19.619> this

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
I'm guessing and then you defend this

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.689 
I'm guessing and then you defend this
bus<00:00:20.180> from<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.720> zombies<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.439> periodically<00:00:23.340> it

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
bus from the zombies and periodically it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.070 
bus from the zombies and periodically it
would<00:00:23.820> make<00:00:24.029> stop<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.779> could<00:00:24.930> pick

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
would make stop so that you could pick

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.519 
would make stop so that you could pick
up<00:00:25.109> perks<00:00:25.529> maybe<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.660> get<00:00:27.660> weapons<00:00:27.930> hit<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
up perks maybe and get weapons hit the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.689 
up perks maybe and get weapons hit the
box<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> stuff<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.519> don't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
box and stuff like that because I don't

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.569 
box and stuff like that because I don't
think<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:31.050> box<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
think be the box is going to be on the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.819 
think be the box is going to be on the
bus<00:00:32.730> who<00:00:33.000> knows<00:00:33.270> who<00:00:33.600> knows<00:00:33.660> what's<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.710> on

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
bus who knows who knows what's going on

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.000 
bus who knows who knows what's going on
here<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.969> amazing<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.320> called<00:00:37.890> my

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
here but how amazing is this I called my

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.830 
here but how amazing is this I called my
cousin's<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.910> love<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> too<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
cousin's about this they love it too and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470 
cousin's about this they love it too and
you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.250> says<00:00:41.399> bus<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:42.180> it's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
you can see that it says bus but it's

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860 
you can see that it says bus but it's
got<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.700> cut<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.420> lit

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
got the you I cut out it's not like lit

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869 
got the you I cut out it's not like lit
up<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.350> i'm<00:00:46.410> guessing<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.980> BS<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
up so i'm guessing the BS is going to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.959 
up so i'm guessing the BS is going to
stand<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.149> bus<00:00:48.570> stop<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:49.140> maybe<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.399> maps<00:00:50.820> can

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
stand for bus stop or maybe the maps can

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.680 
stand for bus stop or maybe the maps can
be<00:00:51.000> called<00:00:51.300> dead<00:00:51.660> end<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.309> last<00:00:53.309> stop<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.510> much

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
be called dead end or last stop so much

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
be called dead end or last stop so much
stuff<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.170> said<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.219> can't

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
stuff can be said about this I can't

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.599 
stuff can be said about this I can't
believe<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.829> no<00:00:59.039> idea<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.460> else

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609

they're going to do I mean this bus

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
they're going to do I mean this bus
can't<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.079> big<00:01:01.260> enough<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.590> hold<00:01:01.739> eight<00:01:02.010> people

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.060 
can't be big enough to hold eight people
can<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> um<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> zombies<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
stuff like that so that's kind of cool

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
stuff like that so that's kind of cool
maybe<00:01:08.400> somewhere<00:01:09.090> along<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> lines<00:01:09.659> during

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
maybe somewhere along the lines during

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
maybe somewhere along the lines during
the<00:01:10.080> map<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.680> bus<00:01:11.100> crashes<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> got<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> get

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the map the bus crashes and got to get

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.310 
the map the bus crashes and got to get
off<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.520> amazing<00:01:15.320> another

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
off like but it's so amazing another

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.780 
off like but it's so amazing another
thing<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.710> thinking<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
thing I was thinking about was that you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.310 
thing I was thinking about was that you
got<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.000> defend<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.450> bus<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.020> certain

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
got to defend this bus for a certain

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.740 
got to defend this bus for a certain
amount<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.560> time<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> certain

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
amount of time so you get to a certain

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.560 
amount of time so you get to a certain
area<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> play<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
area and then like you get to play a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.120 
area and then like you get to play a
bigger<00:01:24.869> map<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.680> something<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
bigger map or something like that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.039 
bigger map or something like that
because<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.700> did<00:01:26.909> say<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.420> these<00:01:27.570> zombie

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
because they did say that these zombie

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
because they did say that these zombie
maps<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.670> gigantic<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> from

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
maps are going to be gigantic and from

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
maps are going to be gigantic and from
what<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:30.900> seeing<00:01:30.930> right<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.610> amazing<00:01:32.610> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
what I'm seeing right now amazing I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510 
what I'm seeing right now amazing I
don't<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.780> gonna<00:01:33.930> take<00:01:34.020> place<00:01:34.439> um<00:01:34.829> in

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
don't think it's gonna take place um in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
don't think it's gonna take place um in
a<00:01:35.670> campaign<00:01:36.180> mode<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.659> don't<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.049> do

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
a campaign mode I don't think they do
