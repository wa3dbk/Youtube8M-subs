 and there you were talking about real of we are in 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.210
 a new video and this time we are in 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.009
 minecraft and well nothing I am the doctor and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.779
 this time I bring you a super glitch for 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.789
 be able to duplicate what has been the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.939
 emerald that was added to the game 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.740
 the diamond the iron and also the gold and 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.450
 Well, this time we're not in grand theft 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.370
 auto 'now we are in minecraft and then 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.900
 well there are how can you see these 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.270
 are the materials for which you can 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.310
 use this glitch there as you can see 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.260
 and I already mentioned this what we are going to 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.450
 need is going to be a craft table eo 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.190
 or creation and an anvil and how are they 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.110
 observing and then we are going to put 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.090
 our anvil and our table 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.640
 creation of preference that are close 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.160
 Now what we have to do is this 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.200
 select our blocks this me in 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.940
 this case I grabbed the emerald and the 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.800
 we separate from necessarily have to be 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.710
 two later we are going to put the anvil 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.880
 one by one and we're going to have to take them out 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.299
 of the anvil and come back 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.759
 our menu of the little arrow and how 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.009
 can see now what we have to 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.509
 to do is go to the menu this normal kraft 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.009
 eo and we're going to have to convert 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.710
 our blocks emeralds 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.600
 emeralds baby so is it in emeralds 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.670
 baby now what we have to do is 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.470
 go to the table that the craft eo and 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.140
 turn our baby emeralds into 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.600
 blocks ok and how can you see two that 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.939
 I already had four and this proves that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.470
 the gray works here I repeat the process 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.560
 separated blocks and I tucking 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.929
 one by one to the anvil now I go back to 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.179
 take out the blocks as they are observing 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.450
 and now what we have to do is what 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.189
 same enter this from the kraft of the menu 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.659
 than normal kraft and we're going to have 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.700
 than to become our 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.289
 blocks in baby emeralds after 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.810
 we go back to the creation table and 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.709
 we turn our emeralds into this 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.569
 blocks 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.670
 Now I have 10 fingers that I had with 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.770
 those that I started now I already have 10 and then 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.439
 this gray is pretty good the truth 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.640
 it's the best I've been able to see and all 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.140
 this wave 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.729
 Now I 'm doing it with what's coming 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.580
 being the diamond how can you see the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.319
 process is the same does not change at all and 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.930
 Well, this clichÃ© is pretty fast 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.300
 very very easy to get many many 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.250
 blocks because as you can see I did it 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.780
 with two first then it says with four 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.510
 and then we can fill all our 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.760
 bar and being able to do the gray a lot 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.580
 much faster and get much much more 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.770
 emerald diamond of iron whatever 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.840
 gold also and well as you can see 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.880
 the gray is already quite easy is very 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.100
 very fast and for those who do not dry 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.410
 dry for those who do not know how to get 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.480
 the anvil just get iron and 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.250
 On the craft table there will be the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.400
 anvil out there is there there what can 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.019
 this remove the anvil this then nothing here 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.430
 as you could see I did it with the iron 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.650
 and all this wave and so can 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.570
 do with gold and here a cow that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.370
 he wanted to go out on the video and then that 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.110
 it would be everything and so good to 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.820

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.070

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.850
