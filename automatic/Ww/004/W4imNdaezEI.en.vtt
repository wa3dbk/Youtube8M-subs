00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 so long before the video starts 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.120
 I still ask a question to you and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.130
 Although the last video that I am 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.660
 saturday or sunday does not remember 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.190
 it has not uploaded so high 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 I got a lot of hughes and I wanted that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.179
 Just let me know if that's it now 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.800
 was that or there is no cod that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.470
 is just comparatively late 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 uploaded or yes because it was easy 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 Bad is I need a bit 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.019
 feedback and yes so the rating was 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 okay but that's okay the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.910
 I've been legendary since he's the best 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.609
 subscribers 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.929
 but I mean mine, yes, if it is you 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.460
 then not interested completely 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.829
 legitimate that is not looking at if you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.440
 just want to see cod I watch me too 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.160
 no movies no videos to me 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.850
 do not care 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.789
 yes but yes the commission writes yes 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.879
 Have fun servus people and welcome to 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.920
 a new black ops 2 video in zombies 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.730
 as he can already see we are 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 place 153 so top 200 of I have 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 looked at 8 million and there 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.670
 I also thought the tactics come 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.379
 It seems to be okay 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.270
 me at least so when we come so high 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.589
 and I thought so I'm sorry 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.090
 just for my subscribers here 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.729
 a bit the tactics that we have 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 used we have have seen 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.000
 we made that four and yes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.020
 Actually , I'm pretty simple 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.150
 Just explain it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 So in this case I was the raider 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.659
 Coach and my task was easy 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.580
 around this truck in the middle 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.330
 just to circle back and forth and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 The zombies are nicely lined up in a row 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.729
 to pick up so many nice 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.409
 points makes you purely balotelli 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.710
 also below right at the number of points 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.630
 so now you will forth like the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.400
 i saw legendary xbox live 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 always do not know why you are xbox 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 already three years old 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.920
 and she likes to do it five times 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.899
 because you do not have two hours playing time 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.579
 yes we have three hours playing time 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.509
 I think needed for this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.159
 breaking a record 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.020
 You should also just casually one man 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.490
 his teammates should be fine 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 Select because there are too 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.079
 Specialists then yes in the middle of a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.530
 they have to smoke because they have to 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.079
 shit i'm hungry 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.780
 you would need a disciplined team 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.850
 camera because you do not disappear 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.970
 like four hours of his life around then 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.649
 because of a bun from / to one of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.230
 to collapse teammates 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.040
 you do not like that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.409
 looking for such good colleagues then 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.239
 back to the day so I circle around 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.319
 the squats back there maybe you have 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.959
 you may have seen them 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.599
 right there in the back left of this 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.069
 barn or something that is easy and 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.200
 tied in with 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.150
 with them come from time to time like that 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 unable to get out but that's nothing 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.750
 bad the tournament then with the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.239
 build the blow ring once and then 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.370
 So you see, you get this one 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.230
 many points you can then yes and then 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.090
 when you go down, it's whole 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.129
 just after the top left of this box 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.660
 is and manet as well as get points 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.489
 Let's just make everyone open like that 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.079
 monkey goes and then as soon as I go 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.239
 just tossed to sleep 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.459
 I was pretty fast so the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.349
 zombies then run to the monkey when 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.180
 you did not know that then just then 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.660
 to store up quickly though I am 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.400
 again 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.720
 I call them juggernauts times do not know 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.970
 not why I said enough now 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.980
 have anyway the and counting 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.650
 the beautiful device trainer but we already 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.629
 Unfortunately, nothing has been seen of it have 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.250
 not with the world record of level wise 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.680
 40 was the highest I do not remember 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.269
 and that unfortunately all go here the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.840
 Problem was we have no maximo 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.940
 get and on the map there are only mps 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.680
 mp5 and some such a shotgun and then 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.419
 we had to run one again without 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.730
 this system we had 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.959
 and then I had no monkeys 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.430
 There was nothing left to save her 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.290
 and had to let her die 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.989
 I did my best at ten 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.569
 minutes further separately but alone 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.280
 just stop and could only the mp 5 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.620
 use and the nga makes fifth 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.480
 known little harm 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.299
 I think somehow hatch 10 has 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.519
 one cashed without dying therefore 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.900
 yes it gets annoying then I am unfortunately 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.860
 you will see soon 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.500
 like that 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.000
 then what else can I tell you 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.470
 that the tactics are reasonably in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.940
 Order 1 because maybe I still 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.300
 make and indeed my opinion on black 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.610
 I have changed ops 2 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.320
 At the beginning my comments are said by 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.420
 this opinion my first impression too 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.790
 black ops 2 I mentioned that 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.680
 I was lying on two not shit though 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.140
 I did not think it was boring 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.489
 and i was bad and maybe that 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.290
 the reason was that I was not like that 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.640
 liked and it actually did 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.320
 issued that was the reason of that 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.530
 reason was that I was just bad 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.180
 as was now I have had a 12 kg 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.380
 I already have one almost with me 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.419
 two kdg I'm sorry about it now almost 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.120
 only 2 kg and I have to say it really 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.620
 really makes a lot more fun 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.720
 So who did not come for me 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.480
 which I doubt because my opinion 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.890
 anyway worth nothing anyway yes who is because of me 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.370
 did not pick you up but it makes you 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.200
 fun too 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.700
 yes I would say thank you for that 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.720
 watch and try the score too 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.720
 beat and see you next time
