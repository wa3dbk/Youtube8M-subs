00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this image stabilization Peter doesn't

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
this image stabilization Peter doesn't
work<00:01:59.399> buy<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.729> camera<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.270> no<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:01.079> it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
work buy this camera like no but it's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.179 
work buy this camera like no but it's
fair<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> most<00:02:02.100> part

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
fair but you know for the most part

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.859 
fair but you know for the most part
these<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.640> work<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.119> mean<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> super<00:02:03.689> range

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
these all work I mean the super range

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
these all work I mean the super range
optical<00:02:04.350> image<00:02:04.799> stabilization<00:02:05.070> makes<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> huge

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
optical image stabilization makes a huge

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.789 
optical image stabilization makes a huge
difference<00:02:05.909> especially<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:07.020> zoomed<00:02:07.619> in

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
difference especially when zoomed in

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
difference especially when zoomed in
movement<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.280> much<00:02:08.550> smoother<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
movement is much smoother but here it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.999 
movement is much smoother but here it
does<00:02:09.899> exaggerate<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.530> movement<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> little

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
does exaggerate that movement a little

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.600 
does exaggerate that movement a little
more<00:02:11.220> than<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.330> let's

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
more than we like so here let's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.760 
more than we like so here let's
I<00:02:12.670> will<00:02:12.880> stand<00:02:13.060> very<00:02:13.210> still<00:02:13.530> there<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.620> are

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
I will stand very still there you are

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.530 
I will stand very still there you are
I'll<00:02:15.010> zoom<00:02:15.190> out<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.370> little<00:02:15.460> bit<00:02:15.670> there<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.360> are

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
I'll zoom out a little bit there you are

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.810 
I'll zoom out a little bit there you are
okay<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.110> when<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.680> see<00:02:17.860> when<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.070> move<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.490> you

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
okay so when you see when I move it you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.250 
okay so when you see when I move it you
see<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.210> there's<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.540> there's<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.170> little

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
see like there's a there's a little

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.000 
see like there's a there's a little
extra<00:02:20.650> movement<00:02:21.070> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.250> end<00:02:21.370> there<00:02:23.010> there's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
extra movement on the end there there's

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.040 
extra movement on the end there there's
she's<00:02:24.850> not<00:02:25.030> standing<00:02:25.450> there<00:02:25.570> in<00:02:25.660> real<00:02:25.840> life

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
she's not standing there in real life

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.390 
she's not standing there in real life
she's<00:02:26.320> in<00:02:26.470> prison<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:28.500> seven<00:02:29.500> days<00:02:29.770> why<00:02:30.280> did

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
she's in prison or so seven days why did

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.190 
she's in prison or so seven days why did
this<00:02:30.490> just<00:02:30.670> come<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> ring<00:02:31.240> its<00:02:31.900> inserting

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
this just come to the ring its inserting

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.540 
this just come to the ring its inserting
so<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.680> can<00:02:32.800> see<00:02:32.920> right<00:02:33.070> there<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.280> image

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
so you can see right there the image

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.060 
so you can see right there the image
like<00:02:33.940> wit<00:02:34.210> like<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.960> compensating<00:02:35.530> it's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
like wit like in a compensating it's

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.290 
like wit like in a compensating it's
sort<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.340> like<00:02:36.490> you're<00:02:36.970> doing<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.180> a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
sort of like you're doing like a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.230 
sort of like you're doing like a
smoother<00:02:37.840> move<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.260> there's<00:02:39.190> everywhere<00:02:39.760> it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
smoother move and there's everywhere it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.760 
smoother move and there's everywhere it
looks<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.690> looks<00:02:40.810> really<00:02:41.140> good<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.350> mean<00:02:41.590> like

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
looks it looks really good I mean like

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.860 
looks it looks really good I mean like
you<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.459> you're<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.970> you're<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.450> shaky

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
you you can you're not you're not shaky

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.449 
you you can you're not you're not shaky
at<00:02:44.080> all<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.830> see<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.010> little<00:02:45.130> bit<00:02:45.310> extra

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
at all but you do see a little bit extra

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.010 
at all but you do see a little bit extra
movement<00:02:45.790> there<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.060> sort<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.300> like<00:02:46.480> you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
movement there it's sort of like you

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.480 
movement there it's sort of like you
know<00:02:47.050> if<00:02:47.260> you're<00:02:47.380> making<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.709> hard<00:02:47.950> turn<00:02:48.220> on<00:02:48.459> a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
know if you're making a hard turn on a

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.130 
know if you're making a hard turn on a
slick<00:02:48.820> road<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.300> your<00:02:49.390> car<00:02:49.600> kind<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.020> like

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
slick road and your car kind of like

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.570 
slick road and your car kind of like
skids<00:02:50.530> out<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.739> little<00:02:50.920> bit<00:02:51.130> that's<00:02:51.340> what<00:02:51.489> it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
skids out a little bit that's what it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.130 
skids out a little bit that's what it
kind<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.760> does<00:02:51.940> touka-tachi<00:02:52.300> say<00:02:52.600> but<00:02:52.870> it's

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
kind of does touka-tachi say but it's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.020 
kind of does touka-tachi say but it's
and<00:02:53.560> also<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.130> also<00:02:54.250> has<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.550> ability<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.850> take

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
and also it also has the ability to take

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.640 
and also it also has the ability to take
photos<00:02:55.360> which<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.660> pretty<00:02:55.870> nice<00:02:55.989> but<00:02:56.290> like

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
photos which is pretty nice but like

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.500 
photos which is pretty nice but like
most<00:02:56.830> camcorders<00:02:57.520> it's<00:02:57.940> not<00:02:58.090> really<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.390> best

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
most camcorders it's not really the best

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.540 
most camcorders it's not really the best
function<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.050> camcorder<00:02:59.530> but<00:02:59.620> let's<00:02:59.800> let's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
function of a camcorder but let's let's

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.640 
function of a camcorder but let's let's

with your fame you know autofocus is

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.060 
with your fame you know autofocus is
super<00:03:25.840> fast<00:03:26.019> much<00:03:26.440> faster<00:03:26.470> than<00:03:26.860> a<00:03:26.920> lot<00:03:27.040> of

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
super fast much faster than a lot of
