00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.190 

okay<00:00:30.700> so<00:00:30.760> in<00:00:31.090> order<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.390> make<00:00:31.570> your<00:00:31.690> pushpin

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
okay so in order to make your pushpin

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.230 
okay so in order to make your pushpin
pop<00:00:32.470> art<00:00:32.740> you're<00:00:32.950> going<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.400> need<00:00:33.610> push<00:00:33.970> pins

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
pop art you're going to need push pins

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.480 
pop art you're going to need push pins
or<00:00:34.540> thumbtacks<00:00:35.170> or<00:00:35.380> whatever<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.130> call<00:00:36.340> them

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
or thumbtacks or whatever you call them

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.430 
or thumbtacks or whatever you call them
I<00:00:36.730> think<00:00:37.120> technically<00:00:37.510> thumbtacks<00:00:38.140> have<00:00:38.410> a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
I think technically thumbtacks have a

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.560 
I think technically thumbtacks have a
wider<00:00:38.740> flatter<00:00:39.160> base<00:00:39.460> whereas<00:00:39.910> pushpins<00:00:40.390> or

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
wider flatter base whereas pushpins or

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.570 
wider flatter base whereas pushpins or
skinnier<00:00:41.020> and<00:00:41.170> jut<00:00:41.410> out<00:00:41.560> more<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:42.040> could<00:00:42.430> use

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
skinnier and jut out more you could use

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.250 
skinnier and jut out more you could use
either<00:00:42.760> but<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.330> would<00:00:43.540> recommend<00:00:43.960> going<00:00:44.110> with

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
either but I would recommend going with

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.630 
either but I would recommend going with
thumbtacks<00:00:44.890> if<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:45.220> want<00:00:45.400> a<00:00:45.460> more

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
thumbtacks if you want a more

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.400 
thumbtacks if you want a more
professional<00:00:46.030> look<00:00:46.450> oh<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:46.720> you're<00:00:47.170> going<00:00:47.380> to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
be going through these things pretty

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.479 
be going through these things pretty
quickly<00:00:49.150> so<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:49.570> recommend<00:00:50.170> nabbing<00:00:50.530> about<00:00:50.739> 300

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
quickly so I recommend nabbing about 300
