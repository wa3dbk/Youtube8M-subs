you how it works so for some of you who
are<00:00:43.800> considering<00:00:44.190> getting<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.730> yoke<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
are considering getting a yoke I know a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.000 
are considering getting a yoke I know a
lot<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.660> don't<00:00:45.870> fly<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.110> yokes<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
lot of you don't fly with yokes and a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
lot of you don't fly with yokes and a
few<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.640> asked<00:00:47.910> me<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.149> about<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
few of you have asked me what about the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.940 
few of you have asked me what about the
cyclic<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.289> gonna<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.649> about<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
cyclic one you're gonna see all about it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.080 
cyclic one you're gonna see all about it
and<00:00:50.129> steel<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> modularity<00:00:51.059> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and steel all about the modularity of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.150 
and steel all about the modularity of
the<00:00:51.539> whole<00:00:51.719> thing<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:52.980> okay

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the whole thing here so here we go okay

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
the whole thing here so here we go okay
so<00:00:53.730> let's<00:00:53.940> start<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> yoke<00:00:54.719> Scitex

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so let's start off with the yoke Scitex

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.900 
so let's start off with the yoke Scitex
flight<00:00:55.530> system<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.980> actually<00:00:56.129> modular<00:00:56.760> in

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
flight system is actually modular in

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
flight system is actually modular in
that<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> buy<00:00:57.690> bits<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.289> bolt<00:00:58.500> onto<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that you can buy bits to bolt onto it so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.459 
that you can buy bits to bolt onto it so
the<00:00:59.190> base<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> yoke<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the base of all that is the yoke here it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.139 
the base of all that is the yoke here it

addition to that though if you look

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.789 
addition to that though if you look
really<00:03:20.060> closely<00:03:20.389> here<00:03:20.750> there's<00:03:20.930> an<00:03:20.989> LCD<00:03:21.319> panel

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
really closely here there's an LCD panel

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.099 
really closely here there's an LCD panel
on<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:21.979> front<00:03:22.129> so<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.150> LCD<00:03:23.479> panel<00:03:23.840> doesn't

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
on the front so this LCD panel doesn't

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.689 
on the front so this LCD panel doesn't
come<00:03:24.229> out<00:03:24.260> very<00:03:24.379> well<00:03:24.620> on<00:03:24.799> camera<00:03:25.069> but<00:03:25.370> what<00:03:25.549> it

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
come out very well on camera but what it

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.460 
come out very well on camera but what it
has<00:03:25.729> is<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.209> shows<00:03:26.479> you<00:03:26.510> up<00:03:26.780> here<00:03:27.019> on<00:03:27.139> this<00:03:27.229> top

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
has is it shows you up here on this top

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.020 
has is it shows you up here on this top
line<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.919> mode<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.459> you're<00:03:28.609> in<00:03:28.760> and

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
line the mode that you're in and

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.219 
line the mode that you're in and
underneath<00:03:29.510> here<00:03:29.569> there<00:03:29.930> are<00:03:29.989> different

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:30.229 
underneath here there are different

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.809 
underneath here there are different
functions<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.769> Connelly<00:03:31.129> is<00:03:31.190> showing<00:03:31.430> time<00:03:31.669> of

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
functions so Connelly is showing time of

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.879 
functions so Connelly is showing time of
day<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.629> can<00:03:32.780> change<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.260> function<00:03:33.680> over

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
day and I can change that function over

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.289 
day and I can change that function over
here<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.159> a<00:03:34.190> stopwatch<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:34.879> if<00:03:34.970> I'm<00:03:35.060> doing

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
here to a stopwatch so if I'm doing

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.149 
here to a stopwatch so if I'm doing
standard<00:03:35.659> rate<00:03:35.810> turns<00:03:36.049> I<00:03:36.349> can<00:03:36.859> start<00:03:37.069> a

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
standard rate turns I can start a

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.009 
standard rate turns I can start a
stopwatch<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.699> start<00:03:37.909> timing<00:03:38.389> my<00:03:38.510> distance

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
stopwatch and start timing my distance

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.420 
stopwatch and start timing my distance
on<00:03:39.109> each<00:03:39.229> leg<00:03:39.530> before<00:03:39.709> doing<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.099> turn<00:03:40.280> which

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
on each leg before doing the turn which

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.699 
on each leg before doing the turn which
is<00:03:40.459> great<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:41.419> modes<00:03:41.750> are<00:03:42.049> actually<00:03:42.440> rolled

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
is great the modes are actually rolled

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.920 
is great the modes are actually rolled
with<00:03:42.919> a<00:03:42.949> wheel<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:44.060> front<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.659> right

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930

with a wheel on the front of the right
handle<00:03:45.379> of<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.560> yoke<00:03:45.769> here<00:03:45.799> you<00:03:46.579> can't<00:03:46.819> see<00:03:47.030> it

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
handle of the yoke here you can't see it

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.360 
handle of the yoke here you can't see it
on<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.269> panel<00:03:47.599> again<00:03:47.659> because<00:03:48.139> of<00:03:48.169> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
on the panel again because of the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.740 
on the panel again because of the
limitations<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.459> cameras<00:03:49.909> I'm<00:03:50.030> afraid<00:03:50.329> but<00:03:50.510> I

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
limitations of cameras I'm afraid but I

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.629 
limitations of cameras I'm afraid but I
can<00:03:51.139> switch<00:03:51.409> the<00:03:51.620> mode<00:03:51.859> here<00:03:52.189> and<00:03:52.370> there<00:03:52.519> is

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
can switch the mode here and there is

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.240 
can switch the mode here and there is
custom<00:03:53.209> software<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.829> run<00:03:55.010> on<00:03:55.129> your

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
custom software that you run on your

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.460 
custom software that you run on your
desktop<00:03:55.699> which<00:03:56.299> lets<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.689> program<00:03:56.930> what<00:03:57.349> all

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
desktop which lets you program what all

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.439 
desktop which lets you program what all
these<00:03:57.650> buttons<00:03:57.889> do<00:03:58.129> outside<00:03:58.579> of<00:03:58.639> the<00:03:58.849> sim<00:03:59.090> each

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
these buttons do outside of the sim each

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.839 
these buttons do outside of the sim each
mode<00:03:59.989> switches<00:04:00.979> the<00:04:01.099> configuration<00:04:01.699> of<00:04:01.790> all

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
mode switches the configuration of all

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.509 
mode switches the configuration of all
these<00:04:02.060> buttons<00:04:02.329> so<00:04:02.540> there<00:04:02.900> are<00:04:03.049> in<00:04:03.229> total<00:04:03.409> 8<00:04:03.799> 9

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
these buttons so there are in total 8 9

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.240 
these buttons so there are in total 8 9
10<00:04:05.060> 11<00:04:05.329> 12<00:04:05.900> 13<00:04:06.049> 14<00:04:06.470> 15<00:04:07.159> 16<00:04:08.150> buttons<00:04:08.840> times<00:04:09.709> 3

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 buttons times 3

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.099 
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 buttons times 3
because<00:04:10.939> you<00:04:11.239> have<00:04:11.359> those<00:04:11.509> different<00:04:11.659> modes

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
because you have those different modes

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.649 
because you have those different modes
so<00:04:12.409> tons<00:04:12.919> of<00:04:13.189> buttons<00:04:13.519> on<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:13.759> yoke<00:04:13.970> let's<00:04:14.569> go

devices<00:04:24.020> which<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.740> how<00:04:24.860> i've<00:04:25.010> got<00:04:25.220> my<00:04:25.340> second

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
devices which is how i've got my second

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.480 
devices which is how i've got my second
throttle<00:04:26.120> quadrant<00:04:26.300> connected<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.250> first

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
throttle quadrant connected so the first

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.160 
throttle quadrant connected so the first
one<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:29.060> one<00:04:29.120> just<00:04:29.540> plugs<00:04:29.750> straight<00:04:29.870> in

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
one this one just plugs straight in

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.200 
one this one just plugs straight in
there<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.500> you've<00:04:30.590> got<00:04:30.710> three<00:04:31.010> levers<00:04:31.280> which

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
there and you've got three levers which

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.670 
there and you've got three levers which
you<00:04:32.330> would<00:04:32.450> typically<00:04:32.780> use<00:04:32.870> say<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.440> Cessna

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
you would typically use say in a Cessna

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.880 
you would typically use say in a Cessna
for<00:04:34.130> throttle<00:04:34.670> prop<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.510> mixture<00:04:36.260> now<00:04:36.650> each

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
for throttle prop and mixture now each

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.020 
for throttle prop and mixture now each
of<00:04:36.920> these<00:04:37.130> knobs<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.550> can<00:04:37.610> see<00:04:37.850> there<00:04:37.970> are

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
of these knobs you can see there are

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.190 
of these knobs you can see there are
different<00:04:38.240> colored<00:04:38.480> knobs<00:04:38.720> they're

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
different colored knobs they're

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.260 
different colored knobs they're
interchangeable<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.700> can<00:04:40.820> just<00:04:41.000> pull<00:04:41.180> the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
interchangeable so you can just pull the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.880 
interchangeable so you can just pull the
knob<00:04:41.420> off<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:41.870> put<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> different<00:04:42.170> one<00:04:42.440> on<00:04:42.470> so

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
knob off and put a different one on so

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.230 
knob off and put a different one on so

depending on what aircraft you're flying

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.030 
depending on what aircraft you're flying
you<00:04:44.480> can<00:04:44.570> change<00:04:44.990> how<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.260> knobs<00:04:45.620> look<00:04:45.860> and

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
you can change how the knobs look and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.480 
you can change how the knobs look and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
mixture here and everything is the right

there's<00:04:57.260> quite<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.680> lot<00:04:57.890> of<00:04:58.010> tension<00:04:58.580> on<00:04:58.760> these

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
there's quite a lot of tension on these

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.940 
there's quite a lot of tension on these
they're<00:04:59.300> not<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.750> flimsy<00:05:00.260> they<00:05:00.440> don't

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
they're not that flimsy they don't

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.710 
they're not that flimsy they don't
require<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.280> ton<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:01.670> force<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.210> move<00:05:02.240> them<00:05:02.600> but

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
require a ton of force to move them but

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.360 
require a ton of force to move them but
they<00:05:02.840> do<00:05:02.900> require<00:05:03.170> some<00:05:03.380> four<00:05:04.010> so<00:05:04.220> you're<00:05:04.280> not

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
they do require some four so you're not

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.550 
they do require some four so you're not
going<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> accidentally<00:05:05.150> nudge<00:05:05.450> these<00:05:05.750> unlike

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
going to accidentally nudge these unlike

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.780 
going to accidentally nudge these unlike
a<00:05:06.590> some<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:06.980> cheaper<00:05:07.280> throttle<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:07.730> you

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
a some of the cheaper throttle so you

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.460 
a some of the cheaper throttle so you
can<00:05:07.970> get<00:05:08.150> out<00:05:08.270> there<00:05:08.390> on<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.540> market<00:05:08.960> so

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
can get out there on the market so

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.830 
can get out there on the market so
that's<00:05:09.770> pretty<00:05:09.980> cool<00:05:10.250> at<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:11.120> bottom<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.690> each

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
that's pretty cool at the bottom of each

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.510 
that's pretty cool at the bottom of each
of<00:05:11.870> these<00:05:12.050> see<00:05:12.290> this<00:05:12.440> red<00:05:12.650> area<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:13.430> is

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
of these see this red area that is

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.430 
of these see this red area that is
actually<00:05:13.790> a<00:05:13.850> button<00:05:14.240> so<00:05:14.630> what<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.840> can<00:05:14.930> do<00:05:15.200> is<00:05:15.320> if

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
actually a button so what I can do is if

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.260 
actually a button so what I can do is if
I<00:05:15.530> bring<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.980> any<00:05:16.220> of<00:05:16.370> these<00:05:16.490> levers<00:05:16.820> down

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
I bring it any of these levers down

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.010 
I bring it any of these levers down
there's<00:05:17.900> actually<00:05:18.170> a<00:05:18.200> click<00:05:18.530> right<00:05:18.800> here<00:05:19.040> I

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
there's actually a click right here I

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.900 
there's actually a click right here I
think<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:21.230> can<00:05:21.290> hear<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.770> but<00:05:21.830> there's<00:05:22.820> a

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
think you can hear that but there's a

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.250 
think you can hear that but there's a
click<00:05:23.180> right<00:05:23.390> there<00:05:23.420> a<00:05:23.570> very<00:05:23.780> substantial

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
click right there a very substantial

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.740 
click right there a very substantial
click<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:25.160> is<00:05:25.340> a<00:05:25.370> programmable<00:05:26.030> button<00:05:26.330> so

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
click that is a programmable button so

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.150 
click that is a programmable button so
again<00:05:27.050> it's<00:05:27.200> programmable<00:05:27.770> through<00:05:27.890> tight

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
again it's programmable through tight

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.400 
again it's programmable through tight

sort<00:05:35.960> of<00:05:35.990> my<00:05:36.080> throttles<00:05:36.470> when<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.650> get<00:05:36.830> down

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
sort of my throttles when I get down

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.280 
sort of my throttles when I get down
here<00:05:37.010> and<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.400> hit<00:05:37.640> that<00:05:37.670> button<00:05:38.090> I<00:05:38.390> set<00:05:39.110> it<00:05:39.230> up

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
here and I hit that button I set it up

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.920 
here and I hit that button I set it up
in<00:05:39.440> FSU<00:05:39.800> I<00:05:39.860> pcs<00:05:40.340> reverser<00:05:40.940> so<00:05:41.390> that<00:05:41.690> would<00:05:41.840> be

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
in FSU I pcs reverser so that would be

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.480 
in FSU I pcs reverser so that would be
reverse<00:05:42.200> a<00:05:42.350> left<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.800> would<00:05:42.920> be<00:05:43.010> reversal

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
reverse a left that would be reversal

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.370 
reverse a left that would be reversal
right<00:05:43.670> so<00:05:44.000> as<00:05:44.180> soon<00:05:44.300> as<00:05:44.390> I<00:05:44.510> land<00:05:44.750> I<00:05:44.900> can<00:05:45.020> pull<00:05:45.260> my

and in addition the one that is
connected<00:06:07.460> to<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.670> yoke<00:06:07.910> so<00:06:07.940> this<00:06:08.420> one<00:06:08.630> is

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
connected to the yoke so this one is

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.870 
connected to the yoke so this one is
actually<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.770> yokes<00:06:10.070> built-in<00:06:10.580> one<00:06:10.760> if

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
actually the the yokes built-in one if

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.610 
actually the the yokes built-in one if
you<00:06:10.970> like<00:06:11.120> this<00:06:11.240> is<00:06:11.390> a<00:06:11.420> separate<00:06:11.840> USB<00:06:12.050> one

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
you like this is a separate USB one

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.320 
you like this is a separate USB one
connected<00:06:13.130> to<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:13.370> yoke<00:06:13.580> but<00:06:13.880> separate

device<00:06:14.570> each<00:06:15.260> of<00:06:15.530> these<00:06:15.680> responds<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.370> that

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
device each of these responds to that

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.250 
device each of these responds to that
mode<00:06:16.790> switch<00:06:17.060> on<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.360> yoke<00:06:17.540> so<00:06:17.780> switching<00:06:18.050> to

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
mode switch on the yoke so switching to

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.110 
mode switch on the yoke so switching to
mode<00:06:18.410> 2<00:06:18.680> gives<00:06:19.370> me<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.520> different<00:06:19.670> functional

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
mode 2 gives me a different functional

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.300 
mode 2 gives me a different functional
Neel<00:06:20.330> all<00:06:20.510> of<00:06:20.600> these<00:06:20.720> buttons<00:06:20.960> mode<00:06:21.500> 3<00:06:21.800> also
