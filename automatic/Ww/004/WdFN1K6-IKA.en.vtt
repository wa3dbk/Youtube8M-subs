 Windows Phone 7 and the upcoming version Windows 8 and standards are not all 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.169
 Victims do not have much in common at the time 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.400
 after all, knows what really happened 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.779
 quite important, of course, we had five stories with Windows 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:20.060

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.310
 Browser supported 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.539
 Of course it also falls 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.380
 play a very strong role 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.569
 in the future 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.229
 and of course it is so we too 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.400
 the police had to, for example 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.790
 Fürth has strolled devices under Windows XP

 but now 8 threatened 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.079
 for example 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.990
 likewise it is so 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.280
 honors 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.570
 decrypts 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.130
 that is already announced 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.350
 bring you 2 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.280
 the study shows 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.800
 persevere first and put under arm-based chips run water 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.930

 makes it possible to use us on the us 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.590
 second, it is also optimized for finger operation, which is the first 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590

 March comes for listening pleasure Phone 7 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.390
 which, of course 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.210
 three main areas 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 One is the topic of communication 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.440
 Pothier bring many new functionalities to the gulf, for example, that he has the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.260
 central as a switching point quasi word takes place something to do with the people 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.420
 the correction was 5 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.960
 there is, for example, possible keep 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.300

 gains new networks like Twitter and LinkedIn 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.799
 Oer there are new ways of communication that means ours 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.520
 news 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.280
 Nerb is bored out of SMS and MMS just like to Facebook chat or 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.930
 Windows Live Messengers as I have 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.140
 different messaging can 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.770
 between those who can change seamlessly 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.159
 we already have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.050
 new stories and together 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.760
 in the communication of 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.909
 so far car cockpit that has been improved 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.059
 offers more possibilities 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.859
 faster a procedure will work for sure 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.449
 «These are ideas around the topic of communication 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.949
 second important point he concerns teamwork 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.029
 there are finally 2 off focal points of the one is the browser 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.029
 as the browser and updated on this idea 9 for Windows Phone is that 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.079
 the one the route is the top team forward 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.319
 also the phone 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.509
 Entertainment Dr 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.509
 under support of html5 of course 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.760
 the operator of the power plants 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.469
 that means everything that creeps and flees 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.479
 Be related to September 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.049
 it was the BAK to go teamwork operation search 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.699

 Applications in Windows Phone 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.719
 it will be extended 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.269
 Especially since I help life around this piece as the phone has Porsche 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.069
 Way I can search the built-in microphone in the name of audio to make music 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.099
 Recognize title 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.650
 ran on the bing search in the background and then right in the Windows Phone 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.650
 Marketplace to buy the titles still if I like them 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.989

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.159
 Microsoft Recker identifier barcode recognition 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.879
 Hochtief wants her body as before the squad planning but the topic 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.649
 Text recognition as a hot candidate 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:20.039

 That we have a zest for life 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.939
 Of course, the third focus is AIDS because we do a lot around it 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.299
 the topic of multitasking 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.989
 there a possibility faster between 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.059
 Switching the application always so completely grasp the churches switching 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.839

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.069
 News concerning publishing

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.909
 a network communication local database 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.279
 Possibility Live Tiles to embarrass us 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.959
 and another topic 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.089
 quite a big package for everyone 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.870

 Windows Phone Mango Reus on a commercially available today 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.629
 Phone to test

 we have these invitations 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.930
 started sending out about three weeks 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.749
 that means thousands of developers are already out and about 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:41.789
 Boxes on their current devices 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.039

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.009

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.689
 the needles and Bob Bradley 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.800
 But that 's why we are very happy for the first time after the launch in the 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.080
 last year 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.340
 he's on board the dedicated as Portugal in front of Windows Phone deployment 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:07.990
 nothing else his life 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.779
 but of course, too 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.669
 There are opportunities and risks for Nokia means 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.729
 here we work both sides Nokia and Microsoft very intensively around him 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:17.490
 together 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.030
 beyond that, to plan the market launch for the next few months 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.499
 get a good grip 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:25.710
 and of course the developer community 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.930
 Of course there is a large community of developers leading the current 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.099
 Single platform 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.070
 of course, too 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.169
 for Windows Phone 7 and Instruments 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.899
 At the moment our beautiful Gaal is taking its first steps 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:39.969
 to do it right 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.889
 to take the community with you 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:42.990
 Brazil's Maicon 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.379
 Markus Bilke systems 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.389
 Now SID is dreaming we are very happy about the cooperation also with the 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.040
 German colleagues at Nokia 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.219
 which we have retracted the last few weeks 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.869
 Do not worry about being curious 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.580
 and when they give first devices 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.510
 Nokia has more or less overlooked that, we think 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.080
 can expect that we also this year 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.080
 at least one device will be on the market 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.869
 maybe more to announce profit soul 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:14.319
 you have to wait until there are gaps in the windows 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.800
 dpa I assume that the 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.069
 slowly over 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.389
 can be picked up speedily 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.920
 really big this year
