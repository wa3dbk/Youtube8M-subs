00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.160 

this<00:04:12.960> is<00:04:13.170> really<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.160> wonderful<00:04:14.520> way<00:04:15.170> of

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.760 

accessible<00:04:32.760> and<00:04:33.500> creative<00:04:34.500> way<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:36.770> working

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
with it so I'm just going to make a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.820 
with it so I'm just going to make a
round<00:04:40.919> bead<00:04:41.130> now<00:04:41.520> from<00:04:42.270> my<00:04:42.450> black<00:04:42.750> as<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.410> base

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
round bead now from my black as a base

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.200 
round bead now from my black as a base
you<00:04:44.160> can<00:04:44.370> use<00:04:44.810> cobalt<00:04:45.810> blue<00:04:46.230> or<00:04:46.710> any<00:04:47.250> other

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
you can use cobalt blue or any other

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.630 
you can use cobalt blue or any other
color<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:48.870> can<00:04:49.200> even<00:04:49.500> use<00:04:49.680> some<00:04:49.710> transparent

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
color you can even use some transparent

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.510 
color you can even use some transparent
colors<00:04:51.030> like<00:04:51.210> transparent<00:04:51.930> ruby<00:04:52.410> would<00:04:53.310> be

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
colors like transparent ruby would be

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:06.930 
colors like transparent ruby would be
nice<00:04:53.790> just<00:04:57.919> round<00:04:58.919> that<00:04:59.280> up<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.730> little<00:04:59.880> bit

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
okay so when I have my bead the way I

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.000 
okay so when I have my bead the way I
want<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:09.970> I'm<00:05:10.780> gonna<00:05:10.990> just<00:05:11.260> sort<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.590> make<00:05:11.830> this

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
want it I'm gonna just sort of make this

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.670 
want it I'm gonna just sort of make this
into<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.340> bit<00:05:12.580> of<00:05:12.700> a<00:05:12.790> cylinder<00:05:16.170> but<00:05:17.170> to<00:05:17.290> give<00:05:17.500> me

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
into a bit of a cylinder but to give me

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.700 
into a bit of a cylinder but to give me
a<00:05:17.710> little<00:05:18.010> more<00:05:18.280> width<00:05:18.700> and<00:05:19.080> at<00:05:20.080> this<00:05:20.320> point

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
a little more width and at this point

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.200 
a little more width and at this point
I'm<00:05:21.190> going<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.760> take<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.920> shards<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.760> just

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
I'm going to take the shards that I just

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.990 
I'm going to take the shards that I just
made<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:25.960> apply<00:05:26.470> them<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:26.980> you<00:05:27.160> ply<00:05:27.520> them<00:05:27.730> any

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
made and apply them and you ply them any

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.650 
made and apply them and you ply them any
way<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.240> like

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
you see that let me try that again

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.460 
you see that let me try that again
hopefully<00:05:33.220> we<00:05:34.030> can<00:05:34.240> zero<00:05:34.540> in<00:05:34.660> on<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:34.990> you<00:05:35.140> see<00:05:35.440> I

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
hopefully we can zero in on it you see I

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.580 
hopefully we can zero in on it you see I

it will leave a little bit of intense
black<00:07:06.800> right<00:07:07.160> here<00:07:07.669> on<00:07:07.910> the<00:07:09.280> mandrel<00:07:10.280> and<00:07:10.550> I
