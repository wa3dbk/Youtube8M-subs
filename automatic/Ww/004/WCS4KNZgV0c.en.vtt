 Euro we come today to the Regio the Toshiba tg01 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.569
 this tg01 already has the official and tutor slider 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.989
 Windows Mobile 6 point 5 advised against 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.730
 it's a floor room that's called Percent Orina who made the radio call 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.929
 no Modica modifications have been made so far 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.949
 the only thing is that Wieland was set up by me to do something 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.960
 demonstrate 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.089
 switches the device off in standby mode 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.149
 it once welcomes us here the welcome bonus screen 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.530
 so we intrigued 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 so now we are in the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.270
 Mo Ball Lock that's one percent of Toshiba or O2 here 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.240
 Percent added it percent program Nobre surfaces 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.110
 from the Finma SPD 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.000
 Timo Boll fast is an alternative to 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.310
 normal windows morel surfaces and offers some options 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.960
 The Venus Mogul can not do it 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.510
 We see different homescreens that you can prove differently 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.430
 No, I can do these home screens 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 this one as I would like to add iTunes Â»program add 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.550
 take away orders change 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.790
 For example, they percent the battery lifetime which is only one point 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.610
 Gramkow I have as the time is 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.190
 I have her direct access 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.540
 the mail account concert by here 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.070
 Change percent of EKD to Pocket Outlook I do not have a mail account 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.930
 set up 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.450
 but I could look at it now 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.050
 I have direct access to the contacts 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.030
 can you assign favorites to percent 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.000
 recently 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.620
 You can also look into the normal contact and search by name 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.600
 This is very easy for very fast fingers friendly 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 because he recognizes about the first letters that should be even once 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.430
 try out 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.560
 such a nice thing Doz 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.150
 let's go back 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 the surface 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.230
 but saying "Mou" at Chelsea is quite easy to individualize 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.650
 Can you knead her dancing dough I can do that 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.169
 push on another shocker 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.169
 can move it within the war 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.449
 the big opera change the appearance 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.699
 So it's much smaller 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.769
 I can do something% to 8% 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.349
 may be different 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.699
 add other icons 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.559
 in addition, can be seen in my application 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.200
 Oh I would like to have tips 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.149
 Program Portner here 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.949
 linked can go here directly into the programs 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.710
 Norbert to Venus 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.049
 in Windows Mobile for the thick program 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.299
 said "This is still all standards not yet modified 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.870
 we find here among the programs very beautiful things 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.459
 Coop Player, too, is an actual paid program here 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.259
 I do not think that's a paid program 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:03:00.549
 that their goal is scared Schipper or o2 with supplies point a Media 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.519
 Player 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.689
 Dr percent yes very nice videos can play in high 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:06.969
 resolution 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.059
 Can play videos 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:13.119
 Percent that is also the pics video streaming of waste resolution 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.119
 can be played smoothly here 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.900
 Euro here you can see a place demo-video the quad is on the device 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.009
 a very nice powerful mediaplayer church is included for free 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:38.179
 Sound otherwise behind Timo Boll shell surface much better to use 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.379
 and with a contract between mixed like this one 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.889
 that I have different percentages here 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.079
 Screens in the carousel are not bothered when down 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.259
 that can otherwise be racing 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.569
 As I said a nice thing that I own my own homescreen goals 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.809
 can define what wants to lie down there and so on 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.809
 which, for example, a media player direct access to the 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.499
 different sports facilities profiles the brightness of the display 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.669
 Percent in direct access all this I can here 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.639
 Percent lying on this surface 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.189
 can here 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.790
 for example also the Wieland configuration options they construction 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.810
 lie down can turn Plutos on with a single click 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.779
 from the flight mode 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.449
 also a nice thing 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.740
 I do not have to go to hell any more - Mo Ball 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.770
 attitude 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.389
 I can do many things directly from her 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.080
 Of course, this can also be individualized 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.400
 a nicer one 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.259
 Background suitable during Ingrid from the preselection 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.819
 Define photos 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.720
 Rome in addition to adjust that proportion accordingly 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.559
 click that some videos 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.620
 how can I continue to adapt that way 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.870
 use - Mobber 6 point 5 as usual comes in this role surface here the 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.189
 programs 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:55.849
 lie here 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.689
 Breaking that with Mogul Scheer 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.430
 Fourth of four points does not need so often 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.650
 and had access to everything you need about the Mucher 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:09.929
 Toshiba also has the option of still being provided around percent 

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.400
 Here is the standard Windows Mobile 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.259
 Surfaces to use that means I can also from the MOL Shell 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.499
 going out 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:25.439
 Percent can go in the plastic Titanium - Mo at the screen Torsten 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.669
 So create that is their goal - Mobotix point five o'clock area just like them 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.729
 Microsoft delivers 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.749
 I can also percent these 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:37.499
 use if I want can put out of the thigh and can with 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.759
 This surface works with it like that 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.759
 or I will return and users 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.339
 the SBB surface 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.809
 a short government 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:52.899
