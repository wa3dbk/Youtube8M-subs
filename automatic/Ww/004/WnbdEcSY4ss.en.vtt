water about 110 degrees this helps

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.880 
water about 110 degrees this helps
activate<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.640> yeast<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:18.229> don't<00:01:18.410> want<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.680> too

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
activate the yeast you don't want it too

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.160 
activate the yeast you don't want it too
hot<00:01:19.100> it'll<00:01:19.369> kill<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.820> yeast<00:01:19.970> too<00:01:20.420> cold<00:01:20.720> won't

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
hot it'll kill the yeast too cold won't

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.290 
hot it'll kill the yeast too cold won't
activate<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.509> 1/2<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.690> cup<00:01:24.550> looks<00:01:25.550> good<00:01:25.820> that

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
activate it so 1/2 a cup looks good that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.020 
activate it so 1/2 a cup looks good that
looks<00:01:26.450> good<00:01:26.720> great<00:01:27.440> so<00:01:28.310> now<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:28.520> have<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
looks good great so now we have the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.660 
looks good great so now we have the
yeast<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.630> our<00:01:29.840> hot<00:01:30.080> water<00:01:30.190> as<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.340> can<00:01:31.369> see

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
yeast and our hot water as you can see

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.790 
yeast and our hot water as you can see
it's<00:01:31.819> almost<00:01:31.970> coming<00:01:32.780> together<00:01:32.929> right<00:01:33.380> here

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
it's almost coming together right here

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.400 
it's almost coming together right here
might<00:01:34.759> bubble<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.209> little<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:35.780> since<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.289> is

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
might bubble a little but since it is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.249 
might bubble a little but since it is
like<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:36.890> said<00:01:37.099> quick<00:01:37.369> active<00:01:37.849> yeast<00:01:38.149> we<00:01:39.080> can

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
like I said quick active yeast we can

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.199 
like I said quick active yeast we can
continue<00:01:39.709> right<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.099> with<00:01:40.429> our<00:01:40.940> flour

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
continue right on with our flour

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.330 
continue right on with our flour
actually<00:01:42.020> let's<00:01:42.380> do<00:01:42.560> our<00:01:42.709> salt<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.039> sugar

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
actually let's do our salt and sugar

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.270 
actually let's do our salt and sugar
first<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.300> use<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.289> little<00:01:45.590> cup<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:45.800> use<00:01:46.039> kosher

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
first so I use a little cup I use kosher

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.570 
first so I use a little cup I use kosher
salt<00:01:46.459> and<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:48.080> use<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.289> tablespoon<00:01:48.830> of<00:01:49.310> kosher

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580

salt and I use a tablespoon of kosher
salt<00:01:49.789> for<00:01:50.360> one<00:01:50.539> recipe<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:51.289> again<00:01:51.619> what<00:01:52.459> would

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
salt for one recipe so again what would

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.279 
salt for one recipe so again what would
that<00:01:52.610> be<00:01:54.489> yeah<00:01:57.310> now<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.369> sugar<00:01:58.869> it's<00:01:59.869> only<00:02:00.020> 1

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289

teaspoon<00:02:00.770> 1<00:02:01.220> teaspoon<00:02:01.250> per<00:02:01.789> recipe<00:02:02.239> so<00:02:02.660> you

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
teaspoon 1 teaspoon per recipe so you

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.760 
teaspoon 1 teaspoon per recipe so you
can<00:02:05.119> go<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.840> little<00:02:05.869> bit<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.319> sugar<00:02:06.470> you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
I knew it doesn't have to be perfect

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.910 
I knew it doesn't have to be perfect
measurement<00:02:31.840> sometimes<00:02:32.320> you're<00:02:32.590> gonna<00:02:32.680> see

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
same thing over and over again so now

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.100 
same thing over and over again so now
what<00:03:18.130> happens<00:03:18.520> with<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> pizza<00:03:19.090> dough<00:03:19.240> is<00:03:19.570> we

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
what happens with the pizza dough is we

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.660 
what happens with the pizza dough is we
let<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.980> rest<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.970> rise<00:03:22.959> for<00:03:23.950> about<00:03:24.130> 45

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
let it rest and rise for about 45

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.180 
let it rest and rise for about 45
minutes<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.450> almost<00:03:25.810> want<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.500> double<00:03:26.980> in

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
minutes you almost want it to double in

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.910 
minutes you almost want it to double in
size<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.810> what<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.050> want<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.320> do<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.650> leave

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
size and what you want to do is leave

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.570 
size and what you want to do is leave
this<00:03:30.100> in<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.750> warm<00:03:31.750> spot<00:03:32.020> let<00:03:32.590> them<00:03:32.800> rise<00:03:33.250> and

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
this in a warm spot let them rise and

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.170 
this in a warm spot let them rise and
then<00:03:33.700> we'll<00:03:33.850> come<00:03:34.060> back<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.890> make<00:03:36.070> our<00:03:36.220> pizzas

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.380 

so<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.330> dough<00:03:40.570> has<00:03:40.959> risen<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.790> time<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.270> make

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
so the dough has risen it's time to make

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.600 
so the dough has risen it's time to make
the<00:03:43.540> pizza<00:03:43.740> so<00:03:44.740> we're<00:03:44.830> just<00:03:44.860> gonna<00:03:45.010> flour<00:03:45.340> our

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
the pizza so we're just gonna flour our

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.030 
the pizza so we're just gonna flour our
board<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.750> can<00:03:46.930> get<00:03:47.050> it<00:03:47.170> started<00:03:47.680> if<00:03:47.890> you'd

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
board and I can get it started if you'd

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.970 
board and I can get it started if you'd
like<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.510> work<00:03:49.660> from<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.990> middle<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
like so you work from the middle to the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.830 
like so you work from the middle to the
outside<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.880> that's<00:03:52.120> what<00:03:52.360> actually<00:03:52.690> creates

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
outside and that's what actually creates

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.890 
outside and that's what actually creates
that<00:03:53.230> little<00:03:53.290> crust<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.910> we<00:03:54.970> all<00:03:55.209> love<00:03:55.480> I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
that little crust that we all love I

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.280 
that little crust that we all love I
also<00:03:56.500> tend<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.190> create<00:03:57.760> thinner<00:03:58.420> crust

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
also tend to create thinner crust

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.850 
also tend to create thinner crust
we're<00:03:59.530> thin<00:03:59.830> crust<00:04:00.900> family<00:04:01.900> but<00:04:02.200> again<00:04:02.500> it's

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
we're thin crust family but again it's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.620 
we're thin crust family but again it's
