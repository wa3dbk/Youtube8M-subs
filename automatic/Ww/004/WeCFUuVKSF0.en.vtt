00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.220
 tapping board presents 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:39.210
 and endodontics the tooth is not a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.579
 homogeneous structure on the contrary 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.430
 It consists of several types of tissues 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.500
 the enamel in the crown of the tooth is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.929
 white and very hard and forms its part 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.510
 visible is the first barrier 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.059
 the streets the color dentine 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 yellowish is placed under the enamel and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.589
 continues along the root its hardness is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 minor so it's more sensitive to the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.839
 caries the pulp where the nerves are 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.060
 and blood vessels are in the 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.490
 crown and travel the root until 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.920
 surpassing is the one that brings life to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.550
 tooth and is very vulnerable to attack 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550
 the microorganisms 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 as the tooth is exposed to the medium 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.920
 outside is surrounded by 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.360
 germs 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.710
 some of these germs are the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.710
 responsible for dental caries 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.520
 caries is a destructive process that 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.830
 usually starts in the enamel if the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.960
 Hygiene is incorrect and the tooth is not 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.390
 treated in time the decay will end 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.900
 going through the enamel layer and it will arrive 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.900
 to dentin 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.440
 as dentin is not very durable the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.690
 caries will increase its volume quickly 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.659
 under the enamel and will eventually infect the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.850
 pulp 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.850
 which will cause intense pain 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.610
 If the situation continues along the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.800
 time the infection will reach the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.280
 end of the root increasing the pain 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.230
 and causing serious alterations a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.330
 infected pulp should be removed 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.750
 completely when the tooth is 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.270
 empty 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.460
 clean and free of germs will be filled 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.560
 with a special material that will guarantee 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.600
 the permanent seal to this 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.360
 cleaning and removal procedure 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.670
 sealed is called endodontics the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.800
 endodontics will eliminate infection and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.350
 pain and it's the last chance the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.350
 tooth before its definitive extraction 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.880
 Endodontics will also be necessary if 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.730
 the tooth would have suffered a traumatism 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.720
 or due to other non-infectious causes and 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.720
 that do not cause pain 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.810
 in general a tooth with endodontics 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.880
 You will also need other treatments 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.340
 later because it will be more fragile 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.319
 that before a crown can be a good 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.569
 option to avoid fractures and give 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.020
 greater resistance and if it were convenient 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.430
 a pin that holds 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.590
 if you have had a 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.600
 endodontics although I do not feel pain anymore 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.600
 never ignore the planned treatment 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.250
 back is your tooth may fracture 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.250
 if you do not receive subsequent care 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.470
 We recommend you visit with 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.630
 regularity to your dentist so that in 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.180
 case of caries, this is treated in a 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.010
 early stage avoiding if the dreaded 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.550
 toothache and the consequent 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.760
 endodontics prevention is the best 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.760
 strategy
