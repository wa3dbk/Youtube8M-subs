kino<00:00:45.030> der<00:00:45.059> toten<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.899> map<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> little

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
kino der toten this map is a little

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.830 
kino der toten this map is a little
tricky<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.910> challenge<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.719> because

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
tricky with this challenge just because

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690 
tricky with this challenge just because
of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> fact<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.800> you've<00:00:50.160> got<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> theater

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
of the fact that you've got the theater

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
of the fact that you've got the theater
area<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.780> blocked<00:00:52.170> off<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
area there and it's blocked off when the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670 
area there and it's blocked off when the
power<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.670> off<00:00:53.969> you've<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.170> current<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
power is off you've got that current and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.220 
power is off you've got that current and
blocking<00:00:56.160> off<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.309> theater<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
blocking off the theater and then you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
blocking off the theater and then you
got<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.410> door<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> lobby<00:00:59.340> blocking<00:00:59.879> off

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
got that door and the lobby blocking off

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
got that door and the lobby blocking off
the<00:01:00.059> theater<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> take<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the theater so you take it into the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.200 
the theater so you take it into the
theater<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> basically<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.730> sucks<00:01:03.030> about

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
theater and basically what sucks about

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.929 
theater and basically what sucks about
this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> box<00:01:04.769> ends<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.369> inside<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
this is if the box ends up inside the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
this is if the box ends up inside the
theater<00:01:06.330> then<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.860> no<00:01:07.979> longer<00:01:08.280> hit<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
theater then you can no longer hit the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
theater then you can no longer hit the
box<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> means<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.540> cannot<00:01:09.900> trade<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
box so that means you cannot trade the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
box so that means you cannot trade the
Thunder<00:01:10.710> guns<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> are

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
Thunder guns and you know you are

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.320 
Thunder guns and you know you are
basically<00:01:12.570> limited<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> boxes<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.240> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
basically limited to boxes so now I just

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
basically limited to boxes so now I just
want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> talk<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.020> guys<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.350> bit

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.800 
about this game and explain to you guys
my<00:01:19.159> strategy<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:21.060> gonna<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.360> honest<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
my strategy I'm gonna be honest with you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200 
my strategy I'm gonna be honest with you
guys<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> map<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.369> challenging<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
guys this map was kind of challenging I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.100 
guys this map was kind of challenging I
I<00:01:25.970> couldn't<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.090> find<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.570> place<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I couldn't really find a place where I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.679 
I couldn't really find a place where I
could<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.710> horde<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> zombies

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
could but you know horde of zombies

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.149 
could but you know horde of zombies
consistently<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.869> safely<00:01:31.320> without<00:01:31.770> having

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
consistently and safely without having

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
consistently and safely without having
jugg<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.180> basically<00:01:33.570> what<00:01:33.810> made<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.049> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
jugg so that's basically what made it so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.789 
jugg so that's basically what made it so
challenging<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:36.000> did<00:01:36.840> try<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> couple<00:01:37.560> other

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
challenging I did try a couple other

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
challenging I did try a couple other
things<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.520> basically<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> used<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
things but basically what I used for a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.880 
things but basically what I used for a
strategy<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> majority<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> game<00:01:41.850> was

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
strategy for a majority of the game was

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
strategy for a majority of the game was
was<00:01:43.890> basically<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
was basically what you can see here I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
was basically what you can see here I
start<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> stage<00:01:47.430> area<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
start here on the stage area when the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.460 
start here on the stage area when the
mat<00:01:48.420> or<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> out<00:01:49.020> when<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> round

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
mat or when the out when the round

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
mat or when the out when the round
starts<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> worked<00:01:51.000> my<00:01:51.180> way<00:01:51.360> around

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
starts and then I worked my way around

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.710 
starts and then I worked my way around
the<00:01:51.810> map<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.340> do<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.490> full<00:01:53.790> loop<00:01:54.060> around<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.540> map

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the map I do a full loop around the map

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.740 
the map I do a full loop around the map
when<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> stage<00:01:56.579> area<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.299> have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
when I get back to the stage area I have

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.899 
when I get back to the stage area I have
all<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> zombies<00:01:58.500> behind<00:01:58.649> me<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.670> is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
all the zombies behind me so all I do is

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.760 
all the zombies behind me so all I do is
tighten<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.990> round<00:02:01.439> them<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.740> up

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
tighten them all up I round them all up

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
tighten them all up I round them all up
right<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.520> stage<00:02:02.670> area<00:02:03.149> blast<00:02:03.899> them

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
right there on stage area blast them

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.510 
right there on stage area blast them
with<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.409> son<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> gun<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:05.070> kill<00:02:05.250> him<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.490> my

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
with my son a gun will kill him with my

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.479 
with my son a gun will kill him with my
ray<00:02:05.850> gun<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.290> know<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.369> all

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
ray gun and then you know I I do it all

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.199 
ray gun and then you know I I do it all
over<00:02:08.520> again<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.270> that's<00:02:10.489> that<00:02:11.489> was<00:02:11.670> basically

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
over again and that's that was basically

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.820 
over again and that's that was basically
the<00:02:12.330> strategy<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.840> used<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.470> day

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the strategy I used all day

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
the strategy I used all day
like<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.280> said<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.520> did<00:02:14.820> try<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> couple<00:02:15.420> other

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
like I said I did try a couple other

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.110 
like I said I did try a couple other
things<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.650> didn't<00:02:17.220> find<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.940> too

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
things but I didn't find it to be too

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.030 
things but I didn't find it to be too
effective<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:19.080> was<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.530> most<00:02:19.710> effective

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
effective this was the most effective

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.570 
effective this was the most effective
strategy<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> found<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.650> map<00:02:22.920> doing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
strategy that I found on this map doing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.360 
strategy that I found on this map doing
this<00:02:23.730> challenge<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:25.650> let<00:02:25.860> me<00:02:25.950> skip<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
this challenge so now let me skip to the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.740 
this challenge so now let me skip to the
end<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.670> round<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.420> show<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.630> guys

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
end of the round so I can show you guys

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.490 
end of the round so I can show you guys
how<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.380> all<00:02:28.650> ended<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.750> here<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.020> got<00:02:31.230> all<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
how this all ended so here I got all the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.550 
how this all ended so here I got all the
zombies<00:02:31.830> behind<00:02:31.980> me<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:33.020> just<00:02:34.020> did<00:02:34.170> my<00:02:34.320> full

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
zombies behind me and I just did my full

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520 
zombies behind me and I just did my full
loop<00:02:34.800> around<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.220> map<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.760> am<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:37.050> trying<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
loop around the map I am just trying to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.470 
loop around the map I am just trying to
round<00:02:37.950> them<00:02:38.100> all<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:38.520> get<00:02:38.760> them<00:02:38.910> all<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.360> know

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
round them all up get them all you know

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.840 
round them all up get them all you know
tight<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.080> close<00:02:40.770> together<00:02:41.130> before<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.550> start

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
tight and close together before I start

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.580 
tight and close together before I start
killing<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.300> off<00:02:42.420> but<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.200> know<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.320> don't

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
killing them off but you know I don't

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
killing them off but you know I don't
even<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.950> through<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.490> wave<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:45.120> ended<00:02:45.540> up

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
even get through this wave I ended up

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360 
even get through this wave I ended up
dying<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.200> made<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> stupid<00:02:46.680> mistake<00:02:46.830> that

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
dying I made a stupid mistake that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.820 
dying I made a stupid mistake that
easily<00:02:47.910> could<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.090> been<00:02:48.240> avoided<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.900> usually

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
easily could have been avoided I usually

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.700 
easily could have been avoided I usually
know<00:02:50.010> better<00:02:50.280> not<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.490> make<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.910> mistake<00:02:51.120> but

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
know better not to make this mistake but

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.320 
know better not to make this mistake but
you<00:02:52.710> know<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.190> know<00:02:53.370> sometimes<00:02:53.910> shit

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
you know so you know sometimes shit

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.680 
you know so you know sometimes shit
happens<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.840> guess<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.800> what<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.280> did<00:02:56.700> was<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.360> try

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
happens I guess but what I did was I try

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.210 
happens I guess but what I did was I try
to<00:02:57.750> make<00:02:57.960> my<00:02:58.110> way<00:02:58.260> towards<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.650> alleyway<00:02:59.070> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
to make my way towards the alleyway and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.800 
to make my way towards the alleyway and
I<00:02:59.280> went<00:02:59.520> through<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.820> doorway<00:03:00.120> there<00:03:00.570> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
I went through that doorway there and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.690 
I went through that doorway there and
right<00:03:01.380> when<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.560> went<00:03:01.800> through<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.980> doorway<00:03:02.370> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
right when I went through the doorway a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.470 
right when I went through the doorway a
zombie<00:03:03.450> jammed<00:03:03.780> me<00:03:04.020> up<00:03:04.200> right<00:03:04.410> there<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:06.270> I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
zombie jammed me up right there and I

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.880 
zombie jammed me up right there and I
ended<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.810> going<00:03:06.990> down<00:03:07.140> I'll<00:03:07.500> show<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.680> guys

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
ended up going down I'll show you guys

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.890 
ended up going down I'll show you guys
here<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> second<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> ever<00:03:09.510> want<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
avoid going down in that doorway there's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.340 
avoid going down in that doorway there's
a<00:03:14.240> see<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.330> wall<00:03:15.510> right<00:03:15.720> there<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.140> all<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
a see the wall right there with all the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.930 
a see the wall right there with all the
shadows<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.800> can<00:03:17.010> see<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> shadows<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
shadows you can see the shadows of the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.540 
shadows you can see the shadows of the
stairs<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.450> stuff<00:03:18.690> if<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.830> see<00:03:20.070> zombie

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
so don't go through there but I forgot

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.840 
so don't go through there but I forgot
to<00:03:31.110> do<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.410> there<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:32.310> ended<00:03:32.550> up<00:03:32.610> costing

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
to do that there and it ended up costing

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.340 
to do that there and it ended up costing
me<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> game<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.450> don't<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.140> would<00:03:34.290> have

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
me the game I don't think I would have

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.690 
me the game I don't think I would have
made<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.560> too<00:03:34.800> much<00:03:34.980> further<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:35.489> I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
made it too much further because I

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.750 
made it too much further because I
didn't<00:03:35.970> have<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.120> Thunder<00:03:36.450> gun<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:37.760> that's
