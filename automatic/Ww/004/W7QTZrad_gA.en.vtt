00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
get a good look at it might be a little

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.429 
get a good look at it might be a little
bit<00:00:22.590> blurry<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.039> i<00:00:23.130> turn<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.460> 3d<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.439> 3d

if you you know makes the game a little
less<00:02:08.280> cheap<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.060> same<00:02:09.270> time<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.840> know

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
less cheap but at the same time you know

firepower<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.640> them<00:02:14.849> at<00:02:14.909> once<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:16.019> little

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
firepower of them at once that little

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.699 
firepower of them at once that little
bar<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.680> there<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.489> bar<00:02:18.090> will<00:02:18.480> drain<00:02:19.379> pretty

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
bar up there the a bar will drain pretty

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.440

quickly<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.340> won't<00:02:20.519> be<00:02:20.580> able<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.120> keep

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
quickly and you won't be able to keep

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.780 
quickly and you won't be able to keep
firing<00:02:21.989> until<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.319> reads<00:02:24.260> yeah<00:02:25.549> one<00:02:26.549> drawback

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
firing until it reads yeah one drawback

up<00:02:33.060> right<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.840> feel<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.709> gyro<00:02:35.190> sensor

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
up right now I feel like the gyro sensor

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.160 
up right now I feel like the gyro sensor
does<00:02:35.910> read<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.299> better<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.660> you're<00:02:36.780> standing

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
does read you better if you're standing

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.390 
does read you better if you're standing
up<00:02:37.290> even<00:02:37.680> though<00:02:37.769> you're<00:02:37.950> supposed<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> be

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and my movements didn't always feel too

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.270
