00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
within the same pedal without having

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.980 
within the same pedal without having
this<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.150> basically<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.750> another

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this you know basically have another

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.750 
this you know basically have another
chain

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.299 

you<00:00:37.600> could<00:00:37.750> tell<00:00:37.929> that<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.320> upper<00:00:38.649> high<00:00:38.980> end

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
you could tell that the upper high end

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.729 
you could tell that the upper high end
or<00:00:39.489> mid<00:00:39.670> range<00:00:39.699> has<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.510> bit<00:00:40.809> more<00:00:40.839> of<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.230> nose<00:00:41.469> to

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
or mid range has a bit more of a nose to

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.349 
or mid range has a bit more of a nose to
it<00:00:41.859> so<00:00:42.070> it's<00:00:42.219> definitely<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.760> brighter<00:00:43.180> and

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
it so it's definitely a brighter and

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.299 
it so it's definitely a brighter and
more<00:00:43.539> edgy<00:00:43.989> so<00:00:44.140> if<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.350> had<00:00:44.500> I'm<00:00:44.980> playing<00:00:45.219> a

great pedal for you and it's set up

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.930 
great pedal for you and it's set up
exactly<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:29.020> same<00:01:29.290> way<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:30.190> tie<00:01:30.370> rod<00:01:30.610> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
exactly the same way as the tie rod the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.550 
exactly the same way as the tie rod the
only<00:01:31.180> difference<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.750> is<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.020> its<00:01:32.350> voice

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
only difference is is that its voice

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.230

more<00:01:32.950> with<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.190> little<00:01:33.370> bit<00:01:33.460> more<00:01:33.580> low<00:01:33.820> in<00:01:34.030> so

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
more with a little bit more low in so

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.120 
more with a little bit more low in so
your<00:01:34.390> fundamental<00:01:34.870> mid<00:01:35.050> is<00:01:35.290> more<00:01:35.920> in<00:01:36.040> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
your fundamental mid is more in the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.390 
your fundamental mid is more in the
lower<00:01:36.400> mid-range<00:01:36.790> so<00:01:37.860> also<00:01:38.860> what's<00:01:39.220> great

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
lower mid-range so also what's great

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.430 
lower mid-range so also what's great
about<00:01:39.430> amp<00:01:40.030> Tweaker<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.660> that<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.200> a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
built-in noise gate you have your boost

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.230 
built-in noise gate you have your boost
feature<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:44.710> have<00:01:44.770> an<00:01:45.010> effects<00:01:45.400> loop<00:01:45.670> both<00:01:46.090> of

feature you have an effects loop both of

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.750 
feature you have an effects loop both of
them<00:01:46.330> again<00:01:46.540> once<00:01:46.810> again<00:01:47.070> identical<00:01:48.070> built

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
them again once again identical built

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the game to the moon as well so let's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.580 
the game to the moon as well so let's
pull<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> gain<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.720> little<00:02:27.960> bit<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> fat

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
pull the gain up a little bit on the fat

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.260 
pull the gain up a little bit on the fat
rock<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.190> hear<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.970> what

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
rock so you can hear that just on what

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:53.220 
rock so you can hear that just on what
the<00:02:30.390> range<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.410> would<00:02:31.560> be

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.050 

so<00:02:54.230> definitely<00:02:54.710> some<00:02:54.920> great<00:02:55.250> attitude<00:02:55.820> and

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
so definitely some great attitude and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.030 
so definitely some great attitude and
again<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.900> built-in<00:02:57.230> noise<00:02:57.350> gate<00:02:57.650> doesn't

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
again the built-in noise gate doesn't

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.500 
again the built-in noise gate doesn't
hurt<00:02:58.190> because<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:58.640> can<00:02:58.790> eliminate<00:02:59.060> some<00:02:59.480> of

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
hurt because you can eliminate some of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.110 
hurt because you can eliminate some of
that<00:02:59.600> extra<00:02:59.960> noise<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.470> might<00:03:00.650> have<00:03:01.120> so

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
that extra noise that you might have so

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.360 
that extra noise that you might have so
again<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.260> more<00:03:03.560> fundamental<00:03:04.040> low<00:03:04.190> in

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
again you have a more fundamental low in

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.990 
again you have a more fundamental low in
the<00:03:04.460> fat<00:03:04.610> rock<00:03:06.280> side<00:03:07.280> tracker<00:03:07.550> over<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
the fat rock side tracker over to the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.350 
the fat rock side tracker over to the
tight<00:03:08.210> rock<00:03:09.940> immediately<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.060> hear<00:03:11.240> the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
tight rock immediately you hear the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.240 
tight rock immediately you hear the
difference<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.990> way<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.500> treble<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
difference in the way the treble of the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.340 
difference in the way the treble of the
upper<00:03:13.550> higher<00:03:13.760> mid-range<00:03:14.270> would<00:03:14.480> be<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:15.080> more

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
upper higher mid-range would be so more

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.880 
upper higher mid-range would be so more
in<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.560> Marshall<00:03:16.040> s<00:03:20.170> now<00:03:21.170> another<00:03:21.410> thing<00:03:21.650> too

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
in that Marshall s now another thing too

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.910 
in that Marshall s now another thing too
that<00:03:21.920> he's<00:03:22.340> done<00:03:22.580> is<00:03:23.090> he's<00:03:23.330> added<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.960> basically

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
that he's done is he's added a basically

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.830 
that he's done is he's added a basically
a<00:03:25.010> plexi<00:03:25.430> ECAM<00:03:25.790> which<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.150> give<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.660> up

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
a plexi ECAM which we give you that up

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.160 
a plexi ECAM which we give you that up
or<00:03:27.020> high<00:03:27.200> end<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.130> on<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:29.180> fat<00:03:29.450> rock<00:03:29.720> it

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
or high end so on the fat rock it

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.510 
or high end so on the fat rock it
doesn't<00:03:30.500> have<00:03:30.590> quite<00:03:30.740> effect<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> same

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
doesn't have quite effect it the same

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.830 
doesn't have quite effect it the same
way<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.850> don't<00:03:32.060> get<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.210> that<00:03:32.570> total

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
way so you don't get that that total

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.420 
way so you don't get that that total
sizzle<00:03:33.410> sizzle<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:33.950> if<00:03:34.010> you're<00:03:34.130> looking<00:03:34.340> for

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
sizzle sizzle so if you're looking for

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.890 
sizzle sizzle so if you're looking for
something<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.700> sings<00:03:35.060> more<00:03:35.330> but<00:03:35.540> still<00:03:35.630> has
