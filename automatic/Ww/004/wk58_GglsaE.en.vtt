00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.700
Welcome to Five
Games Five Minutes...

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.293
...from www.acornelectron.co.uk

00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:15.218
HOBGOBLIN 2 is a sideways-
scrolling platform game...

00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:17.389
...which has a very
arcade machine feel to it.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.789
This time it's not an
orb that's been stolen...

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:23.011
...but rather, a power so EVIL
has befallen the land of Altoris...

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:26.309
...that only a one-to-one battle
with the Hobgoblin Lord is required.

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:30.470
Rather like the original HOBGOBLIN...

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:33.181
...you need to battle
through some 50+ screens, ...

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.560
...zapping and kersplatting peasants,
ghosts, succubi and harpies.

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:39.414
What's a bit different is that,
when you collect a weapon, ...

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:42.882
...you do not immediately switch to
it, but instead choose whether or not...

00:00:43.047 --> 00:00:44.338
...to switch by pressing SPACE.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:47.668
Another welcome addition is that you
can now climb and descend the ladders.

00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:52.174
Other than that, the game
will delight fans of the original...

00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:54.448
...and perhaps even
some shoot-'em-up fans.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.959
The same tactics in mastering
wait, move and fire combinations...

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:59.222
...are needed for most enemies...

00:00:59.388 --> 00:01:02.351
...but the Big Boss is quite
'old school' arcade fare.

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:05.093
Played out against just
a forty second time limit.

00:01:05.537 --> 00:01:06.429
Great game.

00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:08.458
Apart from the nonsense
at the top of the screen.

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:13.517
FRANKENSTEIN 2000 is a
combination of six or seven...

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:17.106
...colourful subgames, with more of
the feel of the film Inner Space...

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.082
...than anything to do
with the infamous monster!

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:21.920
You control a
submarine inside its body.

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:25.284
And go on various ridiculous missions
which will apparently bring it back to life.

00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:27.737
Truth be told, I'm
far from convinced.

00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:30.567
Inside the monster's throat,
you have to shoot frogs.

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:33.256
Inside its lungs, you have
to shoot cigarette packets.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.922
Inside its stomach, you
collect bacon and avoid eggs.

00:01:36.204 --> 00:01:37.896
Are you getting the idea yet?

00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:40.078
The game is very, very silly.

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.263
A little difference in proceedings...

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:44.377
...is brought about by
the exploration levels.

00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:45.901
The heart is one of these.

00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.370
Here, you navigate through
a maze and torpedo the heart...

00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:50.444
...to, apparently, inject life.

00:01:50.552 --> 00:01:51.926
Finally, you reach the brain...

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.051
...and have to manoeuvre
around an electrified circuit...

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:55.982
...to collect eight electrons.

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:57.497
The game is not only silly.

00:01:57.778 --> 00:01:59.705
But it's almost ridiculously easy.

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:03.401
None of the mindless shooting bits put
up anything like the challenge you'd expect...

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:05.863
...and I completed this
game on my first go.

00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:07.974
Still, it's easy
and it's colourful...

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:09.732
...so young children will like it.

00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:11.209
Even if nobody else does!

00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:15.540
Forget alien-zapping and
blasting for two moments.

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:19.139
In BREAKTHROUGH, you
forego all this in favour of...

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:20.801
...breaking through
a number of blocks.

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:22.811
You've got to do two things.

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:25.152
Firstly, you've got
to find a flashing key.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.971
Secondly, you've got
to get to the door...

00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:29.102
...which opens when you
pick that flashing key up.

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:32.464
Other than that, the game
is actually quite difficult to describe.

00:02:33.097 --> 00:02:36.043
You're a wizard and you're in
an area full of red and cyan blocks.

00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:38.621
You can destroy red blocks
by standing in front of them, ...

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:39.719
...and pressing RETURN.

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.053
Similarily, you can create those
same red blocks by stadning in front...

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.901
...of an empty space
and pressing RETURN.

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:46.886
You can jump up and
destroy blocks...

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:49.568
...and create them not only directly
in front of you, but also...

00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:51.723
...one character space
up above you too.

00:02:52.112 --> 00:02:53.626
That's all that
there is to it.

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.427
You destroy the blocks
getting in the way...

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.439
...and you create pathways
to the key and the door.

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:00.219
You avoid the spiders, and
the swooping bat things, ...

00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:02.869
...by judicious use of
'block-creation skill'.

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:05.259
The game's not exactly fast...

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:08.368
...but then, if it were, it really
wouldn't work in the way that it does.

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:10.943
The only irk I've found is that
your wizard often goes...

00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:13.648
...one step too far in the
direction of travel sometimes.

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.563
REPTON is one of the Acorn
Electron's famous characters.

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.910
He's what Mario is to Nintendo.

00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.376
In his first outing here,
he's pitted in twelve screens...

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:26.313
...of diamonds, eggs and boulders.

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:28.247
The REPTON game demands thought.

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:31.042
Each screen needs to be
completed in a particular order.

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:33.378
You'll also need some
arcade skill to be able to...

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:35.406
...deal with the monsters
that hatch from the eggs.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.765
You're meant to be able
to crush them with boulders...

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:40.267
...but this first game has
an annoying bug that means...

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.155
...that this sometimes
doesn't work the way it should!

00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:45.305
The boulder sometimes falls right
through the monster you want it to crush!

00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:49.158
To see the map of the area,
you need to collect the map icon.

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:52.383
And, to open safes, you
need to collect the key icon.

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:55.194
All screens can be completed
without losing a life.

00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:56.739
And there's a lot
of fun to be had...

00:03:56.894 --> 00:03:58.277
...in working out
exactly how so.

00:03:58.682 --> 00:04:01.769
REPTON spawned countless
sequels and clones...

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.733
...but this one started them all, ...

00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:06.004
...and it's perhaps the
most affectionately remembered...

00:04:06.177 --> 00:04:07.773
...by most people who
played it at the time.

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.940
It's still an engaging and
engrossing game...

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:12.623
...twenty years on.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.211
BOFFIN is a highly-
regarded puzzle game...

00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:21.078
...featuring very aesthetic levels, and
even more imaginative creatures to avoid.

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:25.689
You can move left, right and
jump and, when you are mid-flight, ...

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:27.917
...you can raise your umbrella
Mary-Poppins style...

00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:29.483
...to float gently to Earth.

00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:32.385
Much better than crashing into
the ground and losing a life!

00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:35.776
You have the simple-sounding
mission on each screen...

00:04:35.954 --> 00:04:39.375
...to collect the five horseshoes and
petri-dishes and then get to the owl.

00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.667
Early levels are devoid of other life...

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:43.378
...and progress
is reasonably easy.

00:04:43.828 --> 00:04:45.425
Later levels introduce
the creatures.

00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:48.290
...including the giant Puffer-
Blimps that need to be flattened...

00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:49.600
...by poking them in the head...

00:04:49.944 --> 00:04:52.054
...and the spiders which
need to be outran.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.819
Watch out too for
trampolines and springboards...

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.006
These catapult you
around the playing area.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.620
BOFFIN is quite a likeable game
because of all the smooth animation.

00:05:00.898 --> 00:05:03.517
Some of the screen layouts
will have you foxed for many hours.

00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:08.605
The Electron version has 25 caves and
is peculiarly also known as BOFFIN v2.

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:13.152
There is a completely separate
BOFFIN v1 for the BBC Micro only.
