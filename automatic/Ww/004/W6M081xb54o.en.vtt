00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:11.180
 No, no, the 6-position ao that could say hate slightly 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.180
 Takarabe Ryoji there Wasshi Thank you for saying the right table 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 Well, that's right, right? 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.450
 I'm talking about Ice No. Challenge Challenge 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.620
 Roller Heroes of 8 Champions 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 It's a bit vague about what a low rider car is like 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:40.030
 Games made of origin is popular now through facebook a place called 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.990
 I want 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.450
 I think that I will not explain a little 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:51.070
 Ice Water Challenge 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.070
 Oh, two buckets worth 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.800
 It is the ice water 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.050
 Put on 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.489
 It is just a challenge 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.640
 It sounds like a tag game you say on youtube 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.960
 In the feeling that the person who is tagged should do it 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.460
 It is also to Takarabe to have around its tag 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:20.530
 I had to do it I thought I would do it in the winter after I wanted to do it in winter 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.870
 I thought it would not be interesting unless I did it in winter, but this story is until winter 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.190
 I will not have 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.390
 Then I thought it would be worthwhile to hit two of the summer but 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.810
 I'm surprised if it turns 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:42.539

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:45.000

 It will be interesting but 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.830
 I also think that rice is a bit overwhelmed 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.860

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.490
