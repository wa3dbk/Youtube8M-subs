00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.539 
do this with everything powered off but
my<00:02:18.799> Mac<00:02:19.190> came<00:02:19.670> with<00:02:19.879> this<00:02:20.120> dongle<00:02:21.110> right<00:02:21.549> max

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
my Mac came with this dongle right max

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.130 
my Mac came with this dongle right max
come<00:02:22.879> with<00:02:23.030> dongles<00:02:23.510> because<00:02:23.840> they<00:02:23.989> have

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
come with dongles because they have

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.350 
come with dongles because they have
digital<00:02:24.530> output<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:25.459> what<00:02:25.549> we<00:02:25.730> need<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:26.180> is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
digital output so what we need to do is

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.240 
digital output so what we need to do is
take<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.599> digital<00:02:27.170> output<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.739> turn<00:02:28.099> it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
take that digital output and turn it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.880 
take that digital output and turn it
into<00:02:28.370> VGA<00:02:28.900> simply<00:02:29.900> find<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> digital<00:02:30.739> output

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
into VGA simply find the digital output

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.400 
into VGA simply find the digital output
connector<00:02:31.549> on<00:02:31.670> your<00:02:31.700> Mac<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.239> then<00:02:32.720> plug<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
connector on your Mac and then plug the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.740 
connector on your Mac and then plug the
male-to-female<00:02:34.180> right<00:02:35.180> into<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.480> VGA

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
male-to-female right into the VGA

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.080 
male-to-female right into the VGA
connection<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.709> this<00:02:37.010> dongle<00:02:37.489> thing<00:02:37.940> is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
connection so this dongle thing is

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.000 
connection so this dongle thing is
really<00:02:38.299> just<00:02:38.420> an<00:02:38.750> adapter<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:39.379> you<00:02:39.560> can<00:02:39.680> plug<00:02:39.829> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
really just an adapter so you can plug a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.030 
really just an adapter so you can plug a
VGA<00:02:40.459> into<00:02:40.849> your<00:02:40.970> Mac<00:02:41.180> good<00:02:41.780> point<00:02:42.049> now<00:02:42.440> connect

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
VGA into your Mac good point now connect

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250
