00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.710
 everyone that is to say case 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.570

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.970
 new glitch video on call of 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.789

 for xp in us at 1.15 in part 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.460
 custom 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.900
 so this video I will try to you 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.029
 explain as best as possible and from a 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.519
 easiest way so to get started 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.810
 you will have to have a year to you that will 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.520
 found in a group like you the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.899
 shows in the video where he scored 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.480
 public party custom parties 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.190
 league game and everything and you are going 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.260
 go to the main menu as you 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.180
 I show it to you so you go part 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.340
 you're going to put your cursor on 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.809
 create a party but you're not going 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.030
 press extra you will do 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.829
 triangle and you will join your 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.170
 friend is in the group 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.910
 and as soon as you go to join him a 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.399
 re to a message focused Asia are being 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.500
 and as soon as this message disappears you 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.840
 will just have to press extra heron 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.690
 same time and you will see yourself in 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.230
 a group with a zero next to your 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.050
 pseudo 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.070
 and no prestige so the old 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.890
 technical that it was necessary 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.120
 to have prestige but this time 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.010
 it sells much simpler 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.020
 walk about once every two and one 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 times you are more prestige and 1.0 to 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.710
 side of your nickname 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.420
 it will take about a minute and 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.100
 that will put you in a part where 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.830
 are people realizing 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.290
 malik your boots and so you can xp 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.020
 so you want your ratio your weapons 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.760
 and your challenges so up to the and ben you 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.180
 go ict and with strangers against 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.010
 bots and with luck you go 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.680
 can resume the connection so 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.480
 that's what happened to me in the video 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.980
 the apron I believe and I took over the 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.260
 connection so that was less to each other 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.380
 of the party and I was able to put the mode 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.300
 of play that I wanted with the boots and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.890
 all I wanted so what is 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.900
 really good we slip what it is 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.670
 really very simple now I know 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.190
 that before the technique was really not 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.570
 simple at all and it was really rare 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.580
 and it really needed a lot of 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.020
 luck why we get there but this 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.540
 technique there to tell you frankly 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.700
 a walk about a face to both he 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.350
 you just need it and then add to it 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.400
 at the same time once you 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.739
 join poorly 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.060
 rami I find in the group so what 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.950
 which is otherwise if this clip is that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.750
 you do not have to be me 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.579
 also players he just has a friend 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.620
 lawyer must be in a group 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.900
 even he has to f case it does not matter 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.760
 and once you have no 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.379
 prestige and 1.0 next to your nickname 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.060
 as I will show it in the video 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.670
 well you're going to do that to fall 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.810
 with strangers who split the xp 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.019
 boots and so how are you going 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.370
 xp power against bots with them so 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.409
 the tutorial 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.180
 it will also be in a description if 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.440
 you misunderstood my account arij the 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.450
 always puts in the description 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.430
 so if you do not get there with my 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.000
 harry account or what and ben ali the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.819
 description 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.930
 I marked everything in it so I redid 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.540
 this video because you are really 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.459
 a lot to ask me I hope that 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.349
 really that this technique vedra because 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.780
 that it's easier we can do 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.010
 to go really super simple tried to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.750
 many faces you can not get there 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 but to tell you I'm paying 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.709
 only I arrive once in two and 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.250
 I also do this video because there is 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.319
 also the double xp until November 1st 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.019
 so this is the moment or never for you 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.019
 do the master prestige and to pass 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.760
 enormously prestige because they xp boots 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.160
 or you're going to do about 200 he 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.599
 is in the game with double xp 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.819
 I can tell you that you are going 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.699
 really go up in rank and you go 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.500
 do about prestige in one 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.329

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.470

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.049
 this technique is the simplest 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.489
 we can do and so here we go 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.739
