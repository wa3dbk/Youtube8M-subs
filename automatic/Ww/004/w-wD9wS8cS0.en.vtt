00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.610
 very good everyone here we are in a 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.330
 new online gta 5 video in which 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.889
 I bring you a tourism r versus cheetah 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.450
 let's make a comparison I'm here 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.009
 with my colleague or vicky who stops his 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.009
 channel in the description and let's do the 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.600
 Acceleration price comparison of 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.040
 tip speed and good as I'm already 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.100
 seeing we just started the two at 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.040
 same time and literally tourism r 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.660
 the cheetah is passed through the stone 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.510
 come on, I'm watching the one 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.790
 I carry is the cheetah and the one who carries my 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.400
 friend wiki is tourism r and I'm 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.300
 seeing that no acceleration surpasses it 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.310
 and then at top speed they keep 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.070
 both at a top speed equal but 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.990
 Tourism turns out to be much more 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.950
 rapid acceleration so that in the 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.590
 exit 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.710
 basically tourism r as that happens 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.260
 by the stone to chita so nothing here 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.570
 I do the race again with him and good 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.610
 now we are going to without shouting wheel 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.310
 we left everything at the same time and another 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.440
 It happens that good 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.290
 tourism, well, that leaves a lot 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.790
 before cheetah and cheetah then I 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.550
 has surprised because it is a 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.130
 that people told me if the cheetah is 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.830
 better than him in you uncle I do not know what and I 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.500
 flip because I know that he in you is 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.750
 better than cheetah in terms of 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.670
 acceleration and top speed not and by 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.860
 That's why I had asked for a lot of people 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.350
 of this video and I say well then 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.090
 let's compare it so so nothing 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.840
 Well here I bring it and now I'm going to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.549
 put on the internet in the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.500
 here on the page is the legendary 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.299
 motorsport so we can see the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.200
 comparison between tourism r that goes from 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.090
 500 thousand and the cheetah that is worth 650 thousand 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.299
 as I am seeing here if 150 thousand are 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.939
 150 thousand dollars plus dollars of fictitious 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.600
 of the game that we can save ourselves if we 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.399
 we buy tourism r to tune it or 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.289
 modify it from the good in the way that 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.350
 we want so nothing, I hope that you 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.909
 have liked this video that will help you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.609
 buy the car you want 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.470
 and so nothing because that's right if 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.759
 you like dow and you know we see the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.759
 next video see you later 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.460
 and
