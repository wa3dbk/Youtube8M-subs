several<00:01:35.130> awards<00:01:35.720> what<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.500> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
several awards what I like on here is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
several awards what I like on here is
they<00:01:37.680> actually<00:01:37.829> list<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.400> calories<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.210> well

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
they actually list of calories as well

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.499 
they actually list of calories as well
so<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.930> has<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> hundred<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.619> k<00:01:41.119> 180<00:01:42.119> calories

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
so it has a hundred and k 180 calories

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.490 
so it has a hundred and k 180 calories
per<00:01:43.049> 12<00:01:43.290> ounce<00:01:43.500> serving<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:45.320> that'll<00:01:46.320> give
