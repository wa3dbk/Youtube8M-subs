00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.090
 hi the goal of any today to 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.360
 pressure is to retain the pressure but without 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.640
 block the security mechanisms 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.660
 today we are going to explain the maintenance 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.000
 from the pot majesty 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.410
 the majesty pot presents a valve 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.900
 operation and valve 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.820
 security these two elements can not 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.170
 never be blocked 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.300
 to check the valve 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.640
 operation we will help one another 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.770
 thin metal rod with rod 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.720
 we will push through the bottom or 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.270
 from the inside of the pot the valve 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.120
 indicator red - another valve 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.890
 you have to move freely if you are not 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.640
 moves freely means that the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.160
 work is dirty or blocked 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.350
 the safety valve must be move 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.510
 with the push button that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.699
 we have in the mango we have to observe 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.409
 that the valve seat moves 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.270
 freely when we push to open 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.590
 it has to move when we form 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.380
 to close you have to seal 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.940
 perfectly the pot we should 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.560
 change the gasket of the pot if 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.140
 we observe that they lose us around 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.450
 of the lid the other option to change it 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.340
 is that after 500 hours of use or two 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.159
 years this clandestine etarra that 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.020
 make by the table window 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.939
 if you lose us by the valve 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.130
 safety on the front of the handle 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 it means that the valve is not 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.450
 dirty or have a worn seat 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 to proceed with the change we will use a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.850
 star number 2 screwdriver 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.979
 phillips and we will take that we have the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 screws that are anchored to the handle 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.979
 on the inside of the lid once 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.039
 disassembled by hand or if it is more 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.030
 hard with the help of a plier 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.770
 we will proceed to the liberation of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.210
 operating valve that only 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.369
 it is threaded 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.440
 the operating valve presents a 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.030
 rebate that will serve as a guide for the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.250
 correct subsequent placement 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.380
 we will release the operating valve 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.020
 pushing down lightly with 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.180
 finger to disassemble the valve 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.060
 security we will help ourselves with two keys 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.680
 fixed number 15 with one we will hold 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.420
 the valve head on the part of 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.980
 up and with the other manipulate we will do the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.330
 valve from the bottom or 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.950
 inside of the pot 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.930
 once disassembled from the valve 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.820
 we will check that the mockery of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.280
 valve is completely clean as 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.990
 the pier if once the road is cleaned 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.670
 It keeps losing us, we'll have to 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.160
 proceed to change the given valve 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.580
 that the joke or seat of 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580
 the valve 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.299
 to mount the decompression valve 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.250
 we will place the mockery in such a way that 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.590
 we have the widest part in the part 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.709
 from inside the valve and the head with 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.069
 the recess for the expulsion in the part 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.069
 higher 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.310
 in the head of the valve we find 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.200
 two holes these two holes serve 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.270
 to evacuate the pressure or steam from 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.950
 inside the pot we will place these 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.100
 two holes pointing towards the center 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.780
 of the lid in such a way that the steam is 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.819
 we escape out of the handle with which 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.310
 we will avoid aging 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.500
 we will tighten the valve helping us with 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.900
 the two fixed keys of the number 15 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.210
 for the assembly of the handle we will look 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.220
 in the hitch it brings to it in the 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.280
 metallic instrument that hitch has 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.830
 that pick up the valve head there 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.710
 make sure to pick it up because here 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.330
 when activating the opening command the theme 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.950
 this metal mechanism will pull the 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.810
 upper part of the valve allowing 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.209
 the decompression of the pot 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.650
 we will do the fixing of the handle returning 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.490
 to screw the two screws that 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.770
 we dismantled at the beginning 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.530
 once the screws are fixed we 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.350
 We will ensure in a comprehensive manner that the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.990
 Mango pushbutton activates the valve 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.670
 decompression repeatedly we have 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.020
 to note that the valve bolt 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.640
 moves in the opening position 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.760
 it remains open and in the position of 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.860
 closed the pot is sealed 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.739
 of the indicator valve we will look 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.870
 in two things 1 the state of the board 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.910
 red toric if it is very 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.970
 crushed or is slightly torn 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.710
 it will be time to change it and 2 the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.810
 state of the aluminum parts themselves 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.360
 the main stem of the valve 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.280
 indicator is painted red if 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.050
 the paint in the thickest area of the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.180
 same is behind tada or is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.030
 completely to aluminum it is possible that 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.260
 it would not be properly then it is 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.050
 the time also to change the valve 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.060
 of operation will also have to 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.620
 change it if the aluminum in the part of the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.680
 valve seat is corroded or 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.930
 It has black holes like 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.820
 we have already indicated before we will use the 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.560
 recess that presents the lid for 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.139
 couple it with the recess that presents the 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.880
 Indicator valve s recess will match 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.729
 one with the other and we will only have 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.620
 tighten it by hand 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.020
 finally we will talk about the part of 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.849
 below the body the rise is subject to 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.830
 a star screw of clips 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.099
 number 2 has no greater complication than 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.259
 tighten or loosen the handle however 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:17.919
 is an automatic anchoring system or 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.389
 clip can not be tightened when 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.230
 release the handle what we have to do 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.150
 is to replace the handle with a new one 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.680
 to do it we will have to make sure 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.720
 that the steel profile that is 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.440
 Soldier in the pot is completely 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.480
 straight in all its dimensions and without more 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.360
 then by the pressure of a blow 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.070
 dry it automatically fits inside the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.790
 mango with the body 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.790
 this is all friends
