 hello to all welcome to the iphone 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.290
 strict and for a new tutorial 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 video 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.680
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.630
 change the boot logo of your device 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.789
 so what is the boot the web 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.410
 it's very simple it's the logo that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.840
 appears when you start your 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.320
 natively it's the apple 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.480
 apple 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.000
 but today thanks to this tutorial 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.910
 you will know how to change this logo so 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.050
 to put one that will please you a little more 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 to start we will install two 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 tweak 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 the thing called animate that goes 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 to allow you to install 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.079
 bootlogo so especially since it 's not 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.730
 compatible and that the ios 6 and 5 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.340
 that's why we're going to install a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.670
 other tweak that is complementary 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.730
 is called animate fix for ios 4.1 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.539
 feat x 5 points 6 points x it will wear 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.480
 the compatibility with the ios4 the ios 5 is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.980
 also bones 6 once you have 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.719
 installed these two packages you go 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.740
 go to the categories 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.960
 then in add on to get the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.729
 buttes legault then you can 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.470
 directly go in the search for it 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.810
 and look for the logo boot 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.250
 if you know his name there is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.100
 a lot of logo boot he has more than 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.659
 1000 so you have a whole choice so 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 you come back from the search bar 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.180
 boot you add logo and you go 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.770
 have a boot list logo that has it 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.790
 appear you have more than 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.950
 choose the one you like 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.579
 for example I will take the first 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.229
 mj bootlogo in the description you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.790
 will be able to see the screenshots of this 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.649
 bootlogo so we'll go see them right 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.470
 there in the section called 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
 screenshot you wait for loading 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.040
 of page and water screenshot can 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.689
 see how it looks 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.100
 there we can see that there are people 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.100
 who will dance under the apple logo 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.219
 so here's this bootlogo so we go 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.439
 come back in sizes we're going 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.390
 install it you install it by clicking 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.020
 on the little button install and you 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.160
 confirm that it's 2 5 megawatts and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.690
 so he is quite heavy 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.400
 once the logo boot finishes you 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.250
 do not need to do re spring 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.130
 you go then dance there and then 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.000
 in the settings 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.980
 just the settings you have 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.780
 new section called bootlogo 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.730
 you click on it and you can 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.320
 then choose your logo in extra 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.880
 so I've already installed four 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.760
 loops to the word just before escape 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.250
 bootlogo mj bootlogo ryan bootlogo and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.930
 reboot bootlogo the one I come 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.760
 to install it's called mj bootlogo 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.550
 so I click on it you can 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.239
 to watch a preview ie what 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.870
 it looks like 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.720
 it looks like that so I'm going to install 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.739
 this one just check it I'll 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.959
 to show you others by 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.100
 example bootlogo escape that looks like 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.380
 that there is a small loading bar 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.790
 that will fill up and in the end it will me 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.260
 to say that my device is jailbroken 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.690
 of course it's a fake 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.050
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.489
 extend our device while standing 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.220
 on the power button you do that 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.320
 ideas to turn off your device 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.790
 value and turn off once it is 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.970
 a you restart it by pressing 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.049
 your power button 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.239
 firstly you will see at the apple 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.519
 apple but soon it will change 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.820
 to go to your bootlogo that you 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.400
 have checked in the settings so you 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.620
 go see here I had checked the one 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.120

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.830
