of<00:02:07.990> roll<00:02:08.260> it<00:02:08.500> which<00:02:09.400> puts<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.760> little<00:02:09.940> bit<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.150> a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
of roll it which puts a little bit of a

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.150 
of roll it which puts a little bit of a
tip<00:02:10.600> on<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.840> make<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.470> easier<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.920> thread

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
tip on it make it easier to thread

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.610 
tip on it make it easier to thread
indoor<00:02:12.520> starter<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.120> second<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:17.410> need

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
indoor starter in a second now we need

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.350 
indoor starter in a second now we need
to<00:02:17.710> go<00:02:17.830> ahead<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.130> wind<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.760> starter<00:02:19.090> pulley

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
to go ahead and wind the starter pulley

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.260 
to go ahead and wind the starter pulley
to<00:02:19.690> put<00:02:19.870> tension<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> starter<00:02:20.890> spring

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
to put tension on the starter spring

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.670 
to put tension on the starter spring
first<00:02:22.270> we'll<00:02:22.540> want<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.810> determine<00:02:23.440> which

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
first we'll want to determine which

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.250 
first we'll want to determine which
direction<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.430> need<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.640> wind<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.110> see

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
direction we need to wind it you can see

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.140 
direction we need to wind it you can see
on<00:02:26.380> my<00:02:26.530> starter<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> Rope<00:02:27.280> comes<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.910> way

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
on my starter the Rope comes in this way

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.530 
on my starter the Rope comes in this way
and<00:02:28.420> wraps<00:02:28.900> around<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.530> starter<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:30.220> that

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
and wraps around the starter like that

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.180 
and wraps around the starter like that
so<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.570> want<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.170> starter<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.620> pull<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.980> rope

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
so I want the starter to pull the rope

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.890 
so I want the starter to pull the rope
in<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.640> opposite<00:02:34.180> direction<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.160> wind

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
in the opposite direction so if I wind

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.960 
in the opposite direction so if I wind
counterclockwise<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.230> my<00:02:38.650> starter<00:02:39.130> you'll

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
counterclockwise on my starter you'll

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.390 
counterclockwise on my starter you'll
see<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.630> unwinds<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.590> pulls<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.190> Rope

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
see that as it unwinds it pulls the Rope

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.450 
see that as it unwinds it pulls the Rope
the<00:02:42.730> direction<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.360> want<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.780> go<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:45.310> now

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
the direction I want it to go so now

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.770 
the direction I want it to go so now
I'll<00:02:45.610> go<00:02:45.730> ahead<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.180> wind<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:48.000> about<00:02:49.000> six<00:02:49.570> or

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
I'll go ahead and wind this about six or

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.140 
I'll go ahead and wind this about six or
seven<00:02:50.110> full<00:02:50.380> turns<00:02:50.710> or<00:02:51.100> basically<00:02:51.610> until<00:02:52.060> I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
seven full turns or basically until I

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.820 
seven full turns or basically until I
have<00:02:52.240> enough<00:02:52.330> tension<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.080> spring<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
have enough tension on the spring that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.690 
have enough tension on the spring that
the<00:02:53.980> starter<00:02:54.340> can't<00:02:54.610> be<00:02:54.760> wound<00:02:54.970> any<00:02:55.180> more<00:02:59.700> okay

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
the starter can't be wound any more okay

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.970 
the starter can't be wound any more okay
at<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.060> point<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.660> have<00:03:02.110> as<00:03:02.260> much<00:03:02.440> tension<00:03:02.740> on

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
at this point I have as much tension on

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.250 
at this point I have as much tension on
the<00:03:03.070> starters<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.850> get<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.900> want<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.170> be

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
the starters I can get and I want to be

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.810 
the starters I can get and I want to be
careful<00:03:05.530> here<00:03:05.860> because<00:03:05.890> if<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.310> were<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.460> let<00:03:06.640> go

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
careful here because if I were to let go

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.699 
careful here because if I were to let go
of<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.180> there's<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.630> lot<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.900> sharp<00:03:08.170> objects

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
of this there's a lot of sharp objects

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.080 
of this there's a lot of sharp objects
on<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:09.040> starter<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.640> could<00:03:09.970> potentially

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
on this starter that could potentially

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.780 
on this starter that could potentially
cut<00:03:10.750> me<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.800> I'm<00:03:11.890> going<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.100> use<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> screwdriver

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
cut me so I'm going to use a screwdriver

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.290 
cut me so I'm going to use a screwdriver
and<00:03:13.240> stick<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> cogs<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.800> starter

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
and stick it in the cogs of the starter

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.130 
and stick it in the cogs of the starter
so<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.540> won't<00:03:16.660> unwind<00:03:18.810> now<00:03:19.810> what<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.020> need

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
so that it won't unwind now what I need

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.960 
so that it won't unwind now what I need
to<00:03:20.350> do<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.709> you'll<00:03:21.100> notice<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.610> starter

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
to do is you'll notice on the starter

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.090 
to do is you'll notice on the starter
pulley<00:03:22.239> there's<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.840> hole<00:03:23.140> that's<00:03:23.709> where<00:03:24.070> our

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
pulley there's a hole that's where our

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.210 
pulley there's a hole that's where our
rope<00:03:24.310> needs<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.140> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
rope needs to go this is the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.110 
rope needs to go this is the
corresponding<00:03:27.220> hole<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.760> starter

housing<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.780> need<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.500> line<00:03:29.739> these<00:03:29.920> two<00:03:29.980> up

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
housing I need to line these two up

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.030 
housing I need to line these two up
I<00:03:30.670> can't<00:03:31.420> wind<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.750> any<00:03:31.900> tighter<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.800> I'm<00:03:32.890> going

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I can't wind it any tighter so I'm going

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.890 
I can't wind it any tighter so I'm going
to<00:03:33.070> need<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.370> do<00:03:33.520> is<00:03:33.730> carefully<00:03:34.060> release<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
to need to do is carefully release the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.260 
to need to do is carefully release the
tension<00:03:35.140> until<00:03:36.130> those<00:03:36.310> two<00:03:36.550> holes<00:03:36.790> come<00:03:37.180> in

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
tension until those two holes come in

with the rope through the pulley now

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.280 
with the rope through the pulley now
it's<00:04:12.760> just<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:13.060> matter<00:04:13.210> of<00:04:13.360> tying<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.810> knot<00:04:13.990> in

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
it's just a matter of tying a knot in

the end of the rope I want to make sure

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.270 
the end of the rope I want to make sure
that<00:04:21.040> not<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:21.459> good<00:04:21.670> and<00:04:21.760> tight<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:23.280> it

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
that not it's good and tight and it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.650 
that not it's good and tight and it
can't<00:04:24.490> even<00:04:24.580> be<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:24.820> good<00:04:24.880> idea<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.480> put<00:04:25.630> a

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
though I think we'll be fine now I'll

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.170
