lights and that goes in with screen it's
pretty<00:01:30.450> hard<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> guess<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.560> guy<00:01:31.740> is

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
pretty hard to guess where your guy is

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.410 
pretty hard to guess where your guy is
actually<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.820> guessing<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.270> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
actually going I'm guessing it's just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
actually going I'm guessing it's just
going<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> random<00:01:34.170> path<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.520> keep<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
going on a random path and do keep in

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
going on a random path and do keep in
mind<00:01:36.119> though<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.600> invincible<00:01:37.020> when

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
mind though you are not invincible when

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
mind though you are not invincible when
you<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.159> part<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> glitch<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.030> other

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you do this part of the glitch so other

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.270 
you do this part of the glitch so other
people<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.900> blow<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.380> including<00:01:40.799> friends

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
people can blow you up including friends

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.770 
people can blow you up including friends
and<00:01:41.460> random<00:01:41.640> players<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.750> aware

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and random players so just do be aware

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
and random players so just do be aware
of<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.070> order<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> other

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of that so in order to do the other

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.160 
of that so in order to do the other
version<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.329> which<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:45.990> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
at all you're stuck in one position but

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.470 
at all you're stuck in one position but
I<00:02:34.280> guess<00:02:34.340> if<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.670> had<00:02:34.790> your<00:02:34.940> friend<00:02:35.210> set<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
I guess if you had your friend set of

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.300 
I guess if you had your friend set of
bounty<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.140> get<00:02:36.500> like<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.770> entire<00:02:37.040> game

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
bounty on you get like the entire game

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.830 
bounty on you get like the entire game
on<00:02:37.550> your<00:02:37.730> ass<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.450> would<00:02:38.600> be<00:02:38.630> actually
