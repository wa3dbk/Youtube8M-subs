00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.220
 I am nicolas the marketing manager of bmw distribution 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.700
 my goal for this beginning of the year is to make you even more numerous 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.189
 in a branch of paris 15 and vélizy 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.249
 with the teams we have thought about some recipes that seems well 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.550
 to work and it is first of all the idea of ​​brice that has caught my attention 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.859
 so I think of a departure 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.859
 because it's super trendy and that at bmw 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 we are in France 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.720
 the fun aspect of summer not necessarily a good idea 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.030
 so I was interested in that of Frederic 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.100
 so I did not have the idea to make a line but before shipping 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.070
 somewhere 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.979
 10:11 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.969
 an arrow mobilization actually the idea was to gather a maximum of people 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.250
 in the same place 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 no 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 at the end of May 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.880
 which still has the beach mode is a false good idea 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.490
 and then I said to myself that in 2011 it was necessary to bet on the new 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.570
 technology 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.500
 so I naturally pretty enticing myself 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.260
 correct 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.520
 was to make an animated greeting card one recreated in the concession in 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.250
 three clicks 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.350
 and by integrating the only one to finish and it is on the user manual this 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.180
 last generation of traces 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.180
 an algorithm composed by the sport 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.750
 while the popular protest 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.360
 but it's true to recruit 1000 we proposed a project that we all 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.900
