will<00:01:30.929> be<00:01:31.050> in<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.380> we've<00:01:32.130> got<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> stock<00:01:32.640> up

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
will be in this we've got a stock up

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.940 
will be in this we've got a stock up
scoping<00:01:33.390> right<00:01:33.569> there<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.349> got<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> great

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
scoping right there it's got a great

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.029 
scoping right there it's got a great
neutral<00:01:35.310> buoyancy<00:01:36.500> meaning<00:01:37.500> when<00:01:37.649> you<00:01:37.679> stop

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
neutral buoyancy meaning when you stop

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.620 
neutral buoyancy meaning when you stop
stripping<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.789> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> take<00:01:39.209> a<00:01:39.240> total

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
stripping it's not going to take a total

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.180 
stripping it's not going to take a total
nosedive<00:01:40.050> it'll<00:01:40.349> actually<00:01:40.619> hover<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.950> little

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
nosedive it'll actually hover a little

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.370 
nosedive it'll actually hover a little
bit<00:01:41.340> great<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.270> cold<00:01:42.420> water<00:01:42.660> conditions<00:01:43.259> in

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
bit great for cold water conditions in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.350 
bit great for cold water conditions in
the<00:01:43.470> early<00:01:43.740> spring<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.580> soon<00:01:44.910> as<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.149> ice

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the early spring as soon as this ice

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.449 
the early spring as soon as this ice
gets<00:01:45.660> off<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> river<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.410> here<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:47.039> bet
