00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 two 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.490
 when you ask for telepizza you just want that 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.380
 telepizza arrives the wait is over 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.710
 now we bring you the new three pizza 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.360
 floors for 795 if the truth is that already 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.250
 we had been waiting for some time 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.340
 leave the list and good with 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.610
 nervousness a little but good with desire 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.440
 to go as soon as possible and see how 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.600
 best possible that is a privilege 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.160
 also play as a competition the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.690
 maximum competition that can play a 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.180
 player of my age and good as well 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.100
 surround yourself with the players that are going 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.590
 there not, it's a luxury to be able to 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.600
 learn every day a little more and good 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.760
 well also to be able to express it here 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.680
 also the real one has touched us a group 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.360
 complicated but good at the same time affordable 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.670
 we trust to be able to go from 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.550
 round we know that japan is one of the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.230
 favorites to win the world and good 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.059
 we will try to fight against them 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.570
 these concentrations we will go little by little 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.970
 watching videos and plays of yours and good and 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 we will see 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 it's true that we hope they help 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.870
 not being in final stages always 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.820
 usually gives a little more security to 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.130
 such a big competition to be 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.860
 calmer but good is nice 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.320
 play a European and we'll see world already 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.940
 me on time but coming to the real one and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.160
 over you can be doing well 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.170
 playing in a super league team always 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.780
 It gives a little more and I think tables 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.660
 it's a unique opportunity is not that the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.580
 month in the real has been perfect for me 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.190
 and good with the call to go to 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.770
 world since it already rounds yes yes the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.500
 truth is that it is a pride for me 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.050
 not the power to go in the name of the real to 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.640
 a whole world and good I will try 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.260
 do the best possible also for 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.970
 to be able to leave the name of the real well 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.100
 I'm sorry I can not leave now 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.830
 have to leave the team now after 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.780
 how well I was moving to it 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.970
 but good now is that the team is 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.369
 in very good hands they are in a good 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.140
 streak that I trust that they will 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.290
 do great and I have no doubt about 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.290
 it
