00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.420
 now on the last push in the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.010
 Christmas shop once everywhere 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.120
 I will come out with defective items 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.650
 still because of the shit 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.420
 I notice that right now full fat 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 at it when I bought gta 5 though I did 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.970
 I did not want to buy it but that was it 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.470
 just too big 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 that just reminded me that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.570
 I used to gamble this earlier 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490

 Buy the game if you like this game 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.030
 not buys then you missed 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.750

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.430
 of the year 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.050
 but if you look at this game now 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.700

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.649
 ps4 and you wanted it for the ps4 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.649

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.210
