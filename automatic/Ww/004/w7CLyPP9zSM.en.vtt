ok<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> parents<00:02:26.340> should

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
ok so you think in the parents should

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.440 
ok so you think in the parents should
not<00:02:26.610> have<00:02:26.760> weight<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
not have weight because they have a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.180 
not have weight because they have a
responsibility<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.319> entire<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190

passengers<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.910> plane<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.510> well<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
passengers on the plane as well the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.110 
passengers on the plane as well the
earlier<00:02:31.230> like<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.370> believe<00:02:32.700> also<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
earlier like that but I believe also the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.610 
earlier like that but I believe also the
passengers<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> responsibility

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620

to<00:02:35.220> everyone<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.180> make<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:37.230> we're

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
to everyone to make it to do what we're

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.080 
to everyone to make it to do what we're
supposed<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.739> do<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.980> keep<00:02:38.099> them<00:02:38.280> safe<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.910> keep

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
supposed to do to keep them safe to keep

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.660 
supposed to do to keep them safe to keep
the<00:02:39.330> flight<00:02:39.540> safe<00:02:39.900> ok<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.319> our<00:02:40.739> line<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.489> right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the flight safe ok so our line was right

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.100 
the flight safe ok so our line was right
and<00:02:41.850> kicking<00:02:42.120> them<00:02:42.209> off<00:02:42.300> thats<00:02:42.569> basically<00:02:42.780> i

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
and kicking them off thats basically i

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.199 
and kicking them off thats basically i
don't<00:02:43.350> think<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:43.620> should<00:02:43.700> call<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.760> kicking

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
don't think they should call it kicking

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.330 
don't think they should call it kicking
them<00:02:45.330> off<00:02:45.420> that's<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.810> big<00:02:46.019> thing<00:02:46.049> ok<00:02:46.799> removing
