00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello again friends today we are going to talk 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.590
 from this 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.960
 as you all know I am seva bravatas 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.840
 and in the case of victorinox we have in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.689
 the tip of a small screwdriver 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 three millimeters for jobs over 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.090
 precision 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.090
 in the case of wenger we do not have it 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.000
 although they see war 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.420
 when opening cans, it 's much more 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.910
 cash 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 Each victorino has the advantage of 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.290
 dispose of this screwdriver 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 here we have left 84 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.079
 millimeters and to the right of 91 are 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.120
 identical but not of measures 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.329
 since one is something bigger than the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.329
 other 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.530
 from here you can see it 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.130
 As you all know 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.990
 apart from the uses of can openers and the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.960
 historian 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.960
 it also helps us to peel oranges 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.299
 you know how it is done 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.299
 you have to give it that way 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.480
 and go counting like this in segments and then 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.010
 lift the skin 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.100
 that the orange and star peeled 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.130
 then we have more uses than the best 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.430
 you ignore for example comes to us very 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.980
 all right 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.450
 at the time of starting staples here 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.820
 we have a staple 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.600
 For example, we started 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.600
 giving him 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.350
 from this side 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.990
 We fits perfectly 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 we raise 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.149
 and when it's up, we give it the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.149
 return 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.550
 and on the other side we introduce 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.209
 and we have the staple torn off going 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.209
 pretty good 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.660
 another use comes in handy 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.910
 to open nuts fix 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.630
 and we introduce 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.630
 we turn 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.680
 and we already have the nut open 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.960
 then we could use it too 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.800
 well 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.800
 take it out 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.000
 All this 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.490
 finally we can go pulling out the nut 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.680
 beige 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.680
 it is quite easy, it suits us very well 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.200
 then in the case of the bng er 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.310
 we could use it very well for example for 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.150
 open boxes that have a seal because 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.750
 it cuts a lot we would catch and so tearing 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.270
 we would have the box 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.910
 it's great to open anything 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.900
 that needs to be torn 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.950
 then we could use it too 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.660
 for example if we have 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.959
 the handle of a pot that is very 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.090
 hot instead of taking it with the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.319
 hook we could also use 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.069
 and the bird opener at war 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.069
 as a hook 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.680
 and good 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.250
 up to this point 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.680
 so you can see all the uses a little 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.659
 that can be given to our can openers 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.659
 I hope you liked the video chao
