we've been able to do is take our own
game<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.360> instead<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.110> leaving<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.680> on

this into the feedback isn't the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
this into the feedback isn't the
quickest<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.570> something<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> so

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
quickest and do something about it so

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.619

find that strikes at zero directors cup
is<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> definitive<00:01:19.080> version<00:01:20.720> basically

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
is the definitive version basically

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.950 
is the definitive version basically
