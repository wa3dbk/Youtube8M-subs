i started using gmail but I ever needed

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.449 
i started using gmail but I ever needed
anything<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.590> could<00:02:12.739> just<00:02:12.920> search<00:02:13.070> for<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.400> I

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
anything I could just search for it so I

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.560 
anything I could just search for it so I
could<00:02:13.519> archive<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.090> not<00:02:14.180> think<00:02:14.360> about<00:02:14.420> it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
could archive it and not think about it

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.699 
could archive it and not think about it
and<00:02:14.750> it'd<00:02:14.870> be<00:02:14.930> fine<00:02:15.110> they<00:02:15.380> make<00:02:15.560> everything

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.520 
and it'd be fine they make everything
easy<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.570> integrated<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:18.260> makes<00:02:18.440> for

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
easy and integrated it just makes for

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.160 
easy and integrated it just makes for
