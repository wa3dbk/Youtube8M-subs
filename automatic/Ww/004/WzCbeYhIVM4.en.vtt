well<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.590> an<00:00:49.739> engine<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> flat

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
well they have an engine that is a flat

well they have an engine that is a flat
plane<00:00:51.660> crank<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.500> there's<00:00:53.039> been<00:00:53.190> all

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
plane crank I know there's been all

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.709

inside<00:00:55.440> baseball<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.399> Mustang<00:00:56.730> people

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
inside baseball kind of Mustang people

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
inside baseball kind of Mustang people
but<00:00:57.539> finally<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.590> official<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.430> we

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
but finally it's official that's what we

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.970 
but finally it's official that's what we
have<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.449> main<00:01:00.629> benefit<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.620> flat

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
have here and the main benefit of a flat

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.679 
have here and the main benefit of a flat
plane<00:01:02.460> crank<00:01:02.489> v8<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.689> alternating

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
plane crank v8 is you get a alternating

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.980 
plane crank v8 is you get a alternating
firing<00:01:07.530> order<00:01:07.799> which<00:01:08.310> makes<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.420> exhaust

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
firing order which makes the the exhaust

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
firing order which makes the the exhaust
gas<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.799> dealt<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:11.610> efficiently<00:01:12.360> in

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
gas it's dealt with more efficiently in

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
gas it's dealt with more efficiently in
this<00:01:12.960> type<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.229> engine<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.979> also<00:01:14.220> don't<00:01:14.729> have

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this type of engine you also don't have

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
this type of engine you also don't have
a<00:01:15.619> rotating<00:01:16.619> counter<00:01:17.040> balance<00:01:17.310> shaft<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.610> it's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
a rotating counter balance shaft so it's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.020 
a rotating counter balance shaft so it's
actually<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.450> lighter<00:01:19.140> v8<00:01:19.650> any<00:01:20.280> more<00:01:20.490> efficient

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
actually a lighter v8 any more efficient

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.020 
actually a lighter v8 any more efficient
v8<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.509> some<00:01:22.140> cases<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.189> lower<00:01:23.610> torque

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
v8 in some cases it can be lower torque

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420 
v8 in some cases it can be lower torque
but<00:01:24.509> depending<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.200> how<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> tuned<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
but depending on how you tuned it you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.789 
but depending on how you tuned it you
can<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.909> higher<00:01:27.119> torque<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.650> we

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
can get higher torque at it so what we

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
can get higher torque at it so what we
have<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:28.950> we've<00:01:29.640> got<00:01:29.820> 500<00:01:30.210> horsepower

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
have here we've got 500 horsepower

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.649 
have here we've got 500 horsepower
actually<00:01:31.560> forward<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.159> set<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.490> 500<00:01:33.329> plus

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
actually forward to set it's 500 plus

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.060 
actually forward to set it's 500 plus
horsepower<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> torque<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.869> 400<00:01:36.869> plus

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
horsepower and torque is 400 plus

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.690 
horsepower and torque is 400 plus
pound-feet<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.100> torque

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
pound-feet of torque

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.859 
pound-feet of torque
we<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.950> wait<00:01:41.159> there's<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
we like that but wait there's more the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.520 
we like that but wait there's more the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
with a couple of changes here but in

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.600

thing<00:02:34.950> because<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.640> personally<00:02:36.300> think<00:02:36.630> this

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
thing because I personally think this

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.280

looks<00:02:37.230> F<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.950> awesome<00:02:38.600> but<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.630> digress

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
looks F and awesome but I digress

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.070 
looks F and awesome but I digress

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
one to three settings this has spoke to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.020 
one to three settings this has spoke to
Jamal<00:02:55.260> Hamidi<00:02:55.770> who<00:02:55.920> runs<00:02:56.100> SVT<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.790> he<00:02:56.910> was

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
telling us that there are five settings

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.880 
telling us that there are five settings
here<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.180> one<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.660> those<00:03:00.780> settings<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
here but one of those settings like the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.190 
here but one of those settings like the
Audi<00:03:02.070> system<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.240> do<00:03:03.360> individual

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
Audi system you can do individual

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.810 
Audi system you can do individual
settings<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.830> can<00:03:04.980> have<00:03:05.220> stiff<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
settings so you can have stiff on the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.580 
settings so you can have stiff on the
suspension<00:03:06.360> as<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.690> different<00:03:07.110> engine<00:03:07.290> mapping

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
