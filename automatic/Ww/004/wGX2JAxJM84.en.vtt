00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.840 
this device it's only ninety bucks as I
mentioned<00:01:48.420> before<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.100> ages<00:01:50.430> 14

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
mentioned before and it is for ages 14

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.120 
mentioned before and it is for ages 14
up<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> remote<00:01:52.680> control

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
up and here we have the remote control

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
up and here we have the remote control
you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.610> see<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:53.970> once<00:01:54.149> again<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you can see here once again that it is a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.819 
you can see here once again that it is a
2.4<00:01:56.360> gigahertz<00:01:57.360> controller<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
2.4 gigahertz controller so I think it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
2.4 gigahertz controller so I think it
has<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> very<00:01:59.310> long<00:01:59.520> range<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.930> does<00:02:01.079> require

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
has a very long range so it does require

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
has a very long range so it does require
some<00:02:01.469> batteries<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.219> believe<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.880> to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
some batteries I believe it's going to

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.240 
some batteries I believe it's going to
be<00:02:03.060> four<00:02:03.360> double<00:02:03.780> A<00:02:03.869> batteries<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.829> also<00:02:04.979> have

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
be four double A batteries we also have

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.249 
be four double A batteries we also have
here<00:02:05.549> some<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> spare<00:02:06.390> blades<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.110> have

simple and here we have the actual

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.180 
simple and here we have the actual
quadcopter<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.810> as<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.290> guys<00:02:29.410> can<00:02:29.590> see<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.069> is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
quadcopter and as you guys can see it is

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.979 
quadcopter and as you guys can see it is
very<00:02:30.220> interesting<00:02:31.150> here<00:02:31.480> at<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.600> bottom<00:02:31.900> you

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
very interesting here at the bottom you

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.680 
very interesting here at the bottom you
have<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.260> HD<00:02:32.650> camera<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.370> inside<00:02:33.850> as<00:02:34.510> I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
have the HD camera so inside as I

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.420 
have the HD camera so inside as I
mentioned<00:02:35.110> earlier<00:02:35.380> we<00:02:35.560> have<00:02:35.590> some<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
mentioned earlier we have some of the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.280 
mentioned earlier we have some of the
protectors<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.600> going<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.780> be<00:02:37.930> for

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
protectors and this is going to be for

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.860 
protectors and this is going to be for
them<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.640> guess<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.690> case

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
them this is I guess so that in case

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.320 
them this is I guess so that in case
you're<00:02:41.050> flying<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> inside<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:43.060> blades

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
you're flying on the inside the blades

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.180 
you're flying on the inside the blades
don't<00:02:43.569> hit<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.930> wall<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.860> end<00:02:45.069> up

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
don't hit the wall and you end up

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.280 
don't hit the wall and you end up
damaging<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.850> unit<00:02:46.209> alright<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.260> we

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
damaging the unit alright so here we

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.020 
damaging the unit alright so here we
have<00:02:47.500> set<00:02:47.769> up<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> device<00:02:48.250> already<00:02:48.519> we<00:02:48.820> put

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
have set up the device already we put

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.610 
have set up the device already we put
the<00:02:49.120> stands<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.660> bottom<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.170> then<00:02:50.290> just

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
channel as we can see here but now we

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.509 
channel as we can see here but now we
have<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> pair<00:03:14.140> Adan<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.650> took<00:03:14.800> four<00:03:15.160> batteries

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
have a pair Adan it took four batteries

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.420 
have a pair Adan it took four batteries
in<00:03:15.819> order<00:03:16.060> for<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.590> get<00:03:17.590> started<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.250> then
