00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this and I just found it's clearish more

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.840 
this and I just found it's clearish more
so<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.470> don't<00:02:38.320> get<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.440> closer<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.769> can<00:02:39.850> slides

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
so you don't get the closer I can slides

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.120 
so you don't get the closer I can slides
perfect

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.600

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
there's no sounds like that and it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.790
