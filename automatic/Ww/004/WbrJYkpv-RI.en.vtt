think there are a few more of these

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.460 
think there are a few more of these
throughout<00:00:26.659> the<00:00:26.810> world<00:00:26.989> that<00:00:27.140> I'm<00:00:27.259> gonna<00:00:27.349> have

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
to fill with water and MC at it so that

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.719 
to fill with water and MC at it so that
kind<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.689> sucks<00:00:29.929> now<00:00:30.829> it<00:00:30.949> happened<00:00:31.279> yesterday

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:31.729

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
and it crashed my servers so that's why

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.250 
and it crashed my servers so that's why
they<00:00:36.829> were<00:00:36.890> down<00:00:37.100> for<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:37.519> long<00:00:37.750> but<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:38.780> don't

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.459 
know where the other one is it somewhere
over<00:00:40.879> there<00:00:41.000> any<00:00:41.420> way<00:00:41.600> back<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.140> villages

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
over there any way back to the villages

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.560 
over there any way back to the villages

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
now you can see here I have tons of

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.959 
now you can see here I have tons of
villagers<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.379> now<00:00:46.129> basically<00:00:46.519> the<00:00:46.760> way<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
villagers and now basically the way the

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.150 
villagers and now basically the way the
villager<00:00:47.269> mechanic<00:00:47.660> works<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.170> with<00:00:48.800> doors

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
villager mechanic works is with doors

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.669 
villager mechanic works is with doors
now<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.329> create<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.629> villager<00:00:51.050> house<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:51.530> have

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
now to create a villager house you have

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.860 
now to create a villager house you have
to<00:00:51.829> have<00:00:51.980> a<00:00:52.190> door<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.699> roof<00:00:53.269> essentially

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
to have a door and roof essentially

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.459 
to have a door and roof essentially
that's<00:00:54.589> really<00:00:55.010> all<00:00:55.219> they<00:00:55.429> go<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.320> if<00:00:57.320> I

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
that's really all they go to so if I

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.229 
that's really all they go to so if I
just<00:00:57.499> did<00:00:57.769> something<00:00:57.949> like<00:00:58.160> this<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:58.999> put<00:00:59.210> a

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
just did something like this and put a

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.020 
just did something like this and put a
door<00:00:59.480> down<00:01:00.159> then<00:01:01.159> maybe<00:01:01.309> I<00:01:01.460> had<00:01:01.670> some<00:01:01.850> wood

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
door down then maybe I had some wood

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.880 
door down then maybe I had some wood
over<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.420> like<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:05.110> then<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:06.290> qualifies<00:01:06.680> as<00:01:06.860> a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
over it like so then that qualifies as a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.890 
over it like so then that qualifies as a
house<00:01:07.100> because<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.640> has<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.150> door<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.660> roof

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
house because it has a door and a roof

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.500 
house because it has a door and a roof
that's<00:01:09.590> all<00:01:09.860> they<00:01:10.220> really<00:01:10.400> need<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.330> I'm<00:01:11.390> not

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
that's all they really need so I'm not

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
that's all they really need so I'm not
gonna<00:01:11.630> have<00:01:11.780> one<00:01:11.900> right<00:01:12.020> here<00:01:12.200> because<00:01:12.410> it

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
gonna have one right here because it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.130 
gonna have one right here because it
looks<00:01:12.710> bad<00:01:12.890> but<00:01:13.550> basically<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.180> have<00:01:14.480> tons<00:01:14.990> of

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
looks bad but basically I have tons of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.740 
looks bad but basically I have tons of
houses<00:01:15.560> with<00:01:15.830> tons<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.610> doors<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.180> that's

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
houses with tons of doors and that's

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.500 
houses with tons of doors and that's
what's<00:01:18.080> making<00:01:18.290> them<00:01:18.500> multiply<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.130> fast<00:01:19.510> you

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
what's making them multiply so fast you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.670 
what's making them multiply so fast you
can<00:01:20.660> see<00:01:20.780> there<00:01:20.960> are<00:01:21.050> tons<00:01:21.260> of<00:01:21.350> them<00:01:21.410> in<00:01:21.530> here

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
can see there are tons of them in here

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.040 
can see there are tons of them in here
they<00:01:22.130> breathe<00:01:22.430> really<00:01:22.760> really<00:01:23.120> quickly<00:01:23.360> are

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
they breathe really really quickly are

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.840 
they breathe really really quickly are
they<00:01:24.170> create<00:01:24.500> iron<00:01:24.860> golems<00:01:25.250> which<00:01:25.550> I<00:01:25.670> can<00:01:25.820> then

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
they create iron golems which I can then

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.540 
they create iron golems which I can then
kill<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.570> get<00:01:26.630> their<00:01:26.810> iron<00:01:27.430> they're<00:01:28.430> probably

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
kill and get their iron they're probably

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.420 
kill and get their iron they're probably
some<00:01:28.850> more<00:01:29.000> around<00:01:29.270> here<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.230> can<00:01:30.410> see<00:01:30.590> on

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
some more around here but you can see on

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.000 
some more around here but you can see on
each<00:01:31.730> house<00:01:31.970> I<00:01:32.240> have<00:01:32.270> several<00:01:32.690> doors<00:01:33.020> now

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
each house I have several doors now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.490 
each house I have several doors now
which<00:01:34.220> allows<00:01:34.460> them<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.670> breed<00:01:35.090> very<00:01:36.080> well<00:01:36.290> and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
which allows them to breed very well and

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.760 
which allows them to breed very well and
very<00:01:36.560> efficiently<00:01:37.160> very<00:01:37.400> quickly<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.500> the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
very efficiently very quickly so the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.290 
very efficiently very quickly so the
iron<00:01:40.010> golems<00:01:40.340> will<00:01:40.490> come<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.760> take<00:01:40.820> out<00:01:41.090> any

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
iron golems will come and take out any

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.500 
iron golems will come and take out any
mobs<00:01:41.570> that<00:01:41.750> happen<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.200> come<00:01:43.150> as<00:01:44.150> long<00:01:44.300> as<00:01:44.420> they

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
mobs that happen to come as long as they

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.660 
mobs that happen to come as long as they
have<00:01:44.630> room<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:45.080> so<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.040> I've<00:01:46.100> got<00:01:46.280> lots<00:01:46.400> of

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
have room to do so so I've got lots of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.900 
have room to do so so I've got lots of
doors<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.300> this<00:01:47.420> house<00:01:48.070> more<00:01:49.070> around<00:01:49.370> here<00:01:49.700> and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
doors on this house more around here and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.910 
doors on this house more around here and
then<00:01:50.060> tons<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:51.050> them<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.260> this<00:01:51.440> house<00:01:51.620> so<00:01:51.830> I've

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
then tons of them on this house so I've

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.220 
then tons of them on this house so I've
got<00:01:52.070> 16<00:01:52.490> right<00:01:52.670> here<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.570> way<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:53.840> ratio

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
got 16 right here and the way that ratio

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.400 
got 16 right here and the way that ratio
works<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.940> number<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.630> doors<00:01:56.900> compared

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
works is I the number of doors compared

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.680 
works is I the number of doors compared
to<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.590> number<00:01:57.980> of<00:01:58.280> villagers<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:58.940> point<00:01:59.240> 35

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
to the number of villagers is a point 35

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.950 
to the number of villagers is a point 35
ratio<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.860> there<00:02:01.010> can<00:02:01.160> be<00:02:01.190> point<00:02:02.000> 35<00:02:02.450> villagers

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
ratio so there can be point 35 villagers

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.530 
ratio so there can be point 35 villagers
at<00:02:03.260> any<00:02:03.500> time<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.670> village<00:02:04.970> compared<00:02:05.420> to

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
at any time I in the village compared to

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.930 
at any time I in the village compared to
the<00:02:05.630> number<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.930> doors<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.640> find<00:02:07.880> the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
the number of doors so to find the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.279 
the number of doors so to find the
number<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:08.330> possible<00:02:08.720> villagers<00:02:09.110> you

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
number of possible villagers you

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.750 
number of possible villagers you
multiply<00:02:09.710> the<00:02:09.770> number<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.280> doors<00:02:10.490> by<00:02:10.850> point<00:02:11.150> 35

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
multiply the number of doors by point 35

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.479 
multiply the number of doors by point 35
so<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.209> see<00:02:13.439> they'll<00:02:14.439> breed<00:02:14.739> really<00:02:15.220> fast

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
so you can see they'll breed really fast

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.339 
so you can see they'll breed really fast
after<00:02:16.150> you've<00:02:16.269> traded<00:02:16.510> with<00:02:16.810> each<00:02:16.930> villager

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
after you've traded with each villager

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.429 
after you've traded with each villager
15<00:02:17.769> tons<00:02:18.069> which<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.519> their<00:02:18.670> limits<00:02:19.060> between<00:02:20.049> 3

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
15 tons which is their limits between 3

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.170 
15 tons which is their limits between 3
and<00:02:20.590> 15<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.040> believe<00:02:21.280> then<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.879> can<00:02:22.000> go<00:02:22.090> ahead

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and 15 I believe then you can go ahead

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.550 
and 15 I believe then you can go ahead
and<00:02:22.269> kill<00:02:22.510> them<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.900> they<00:02:23.019> will<00:02:23.200> repopulate

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and kill them and they will repopulate

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.190 
and kill them and they will repopulate
almost<00:02:24.220> instantly<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:25.689> can<00:02:25.840> also<00:02:25.959> have

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
almost instantly you can also have

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.960 
almost instantly you can also have
multiple<00:02:26.739> floored<00:02:27.099> houses<00:02:27.519> if<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.790> put

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
multiple floored houses if you put

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.759 
multiple floored houses if you put
stairs<00:02:28.299> going<00:02:28.629> up<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.019> next<00:02:29.230> floors<00:02:29.470> and

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
stairs going up to the next floors and

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.140 
stairs going up to the next floors and
they<00:02:29.829> will<00:02:30.010> actually<00:02:30.489> take<00:02:30.640> advantage<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
they will actually take advantage of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.690 
they will actually take advantage of
these<00:02:31.269> houses<00:02:31.659> by<00:02:31.810> walking<00:02:32.110> up<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.319> stairs

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
these houses by walking up the stairs

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.800 
these houses by walking up the stairs
