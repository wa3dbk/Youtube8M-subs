all right the TR not TR not so not that

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.650 
all right the TR not TR not so not that
I<00:00:03.000> came<00:00:03.210> up<00:00:03.360> with<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:04.319> attach<00:00:04.799> 20<00:00:05.580> pound<00:00:05.819> braid

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
I came up with to attach 20 pound braid

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.030 
I came up with to attach 20 pound braid
to<00:00:07.230> sixty<00:00:07.560> pound<00:00:07.770> fluorocarbon<00:00:08.630> and<00:00:10.040> the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
to sixty pound fluorocarbon and the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.890 
to sixty pound fluorocarbon and the
braid<00:00:11.280> already<00:00:11.700> has<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> Bimini<00:00:12.360> loop<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.750> it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
braid already has a Bimini loop in it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.499 
braid already has a Bimini loop in it
and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.769> fluorocarbon<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.360> be

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and the fluorocarbon is is going to be

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.189 
and the fluorocarbon is is going to be
tied<00:00:16.049> tied<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> Bimini<00:00:17.640> loop<00:00:18.199> what

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
tied tied right to the Bimini loop what

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.300 
tied tied right to the Bimini loop what
I'm<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> do<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.740> I'm<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> bring<00:00:20.160> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I'm going to do is I'm going to bring it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.000 
I'm going to do is I'm going to bring it
up<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.430> middle<00:00:20.820> right<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.830> go

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
up the middle right here like this we go

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.179 
up the middle right here like this we go
around<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.460> outside<00:00:23.900> up<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.260> middle<00:00:25.560> around

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
around the outside up the middle around

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.089 
around the outside up the middle around
the<00:00:26.640> outside<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.019> middle<00:00:28.320> around<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the outside up the middle around the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.970 
the outside up the middle around the
outside<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.420> middle<00:00:30.720> we'll<00:00:31.349> continue<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
outside up the middle we'll continue to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.299 
outside up the middle we'll continue to
do<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.309> about<00:00:33.210> six<00:00:33.570> or<00:00:33.719> eight<00:00:33.840> times<00:00:34.309> okay

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
do this about six or eight times okay

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.459 
do this about six or eight times okay
now<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> reason<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.690> came<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.170> its

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
now the reason that I came up with its

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.690 
now the reason that I came up with its
not<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:38.719> because<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> Sabeel

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
not is because I really like the Sabeel

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
not is because I really like the Sabeel
not<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> GT<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.290> really<00:00:44.070> like

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
not really like the GT not really like

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.869 
not really like the GT not really like
the<00:00:44.399> FG<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.879> compression

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the FG not I like the the compression

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.770 
the FG not I like the the compression
and<00:00:48.149> constriction<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.710> offer<00:00:50.449> but<00:00:51.449> not

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and constriction that they offer but not

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.560 
and constriction that they offer but not
every<00:00:52.379> single<00:00:52.860> brand<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.520> fluorocarbon<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
every single brand of fluorocarbon has a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.330 
every single brand of fluorocarbon has a
finish<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.829> grabbing

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
finish on it that's really grabbing

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.090 
finish on it that's really grabbing
every<00:00:56.969> single<00:00:57.300> brand<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:58.430> braid<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:01.100> don't

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
every single brand of braid so I don't

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
every single brand of braid so I don't
have<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> lot<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.550> confidence<00:01:03.030> sometimes<00:01:03.390> in

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
have a lot of confidence sometimes in

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.830 
have a lot of confidence sometimes in
those<00:01:04.110> knots<00:01:04.489> with<00:01:05.489> certain<00:01:05.850> lines<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
those knots with certain lines so I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
those knots with certain lines so I
wanted<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> use<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> constriction

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
wanted to kind of use the constriction

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.920 
wanted to kind of use the constriction
and<00:01:09.560> also<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.729> pair<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.540> some

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and also you know pair that up with some

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.460 
and also you know pair that up with some
kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> stop<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.369> very<00:01:15.119> simple

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
kind of a stop or not so very simple

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.630 
kind of a stop or not so very simple
the<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:18.540> TR<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.380> simply<00:01:19.799> some

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the the TR not is simply some

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.609 
the the TR not is simply some
constriction<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.320> top

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
constriction and then right at the top

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.270 
constriction and then right at the top
here<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.110> put<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.500> uni<00:01:26.189> knot<00:01:26.369> one

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
here I'm going to put in a uni knot one

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
here I'm going to put in a uni knot one
two<00:01:30.140> three<00:01:31.850> okay<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.509> uni<00:01:33.840> knot<00:01:33.960> would<00:01:34.140> go

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
two three okay that uni knot would go

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.270 
two three okay that uni knot would go
like<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:35.420> pull<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> tight<00:01:39.920> like<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.070> would

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
like that pull that tight like you would

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.789 
like that pull that tight like you would
and<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.479> what's<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.170> happen<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.680> I'm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
and now what's going to happen is I'm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.260 
and now what's going to happen is I'm
going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> start<00:01:44.220> pulling<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> down<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
going to start pulling this down and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.010 
going to start pulling this down and
this<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.100> braid<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.600> start<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this the the braid is going to start to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.850 
this the the braid is going to start to
form<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:50.220> constriction<00:01:51.200> around<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
form a constriction around the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.030 
form a constriction around the
fluorocarbon<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.759> well<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.750> having<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> stopper

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
fluorocarbon as well as having a stopper

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
fluorocarbon as well as having a stopper
knot<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.820> point<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.630> starts<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
knot so at this point it starts to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.719 
knot so at this point it starts to
constrict<00:01:58.680> against<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> line<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.549> as<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.600> pull

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
constrict against the line and as I pull

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.630 
constrict against the line and as I pull
it's<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.240> constricting<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.399> I'm<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it's it's constricting and I'm going to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.850 
it's it's constricting and I'm going to
pull<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.850> down

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
pull it down

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.730 
pull it down
it's<00:02:07.010> going<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.190> tighten<00:02:07.580> up<00:02:07.960> right<00:02:08.960> there

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.270 

okay<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.850> now<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:15.230> constricting<00:02:15.740> against

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
okay so now it's constricting against

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.260 
okay so now it's constricting against
the<00:02:16.460> line<00:02:16.640> all<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.030> way<00:02:17.060> down<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:18.850> all<00:02:19.850> of

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
the line all the way down and all of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.550 
the line all the way down and all of
those<00:02:20.420> are<00:02:20.480> coming<00:02:20.780> down<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.290> stopping

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
those are coming down and stopping

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.660 
those are coming down and stopping
against<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.130> knot

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
against this knot

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.990
