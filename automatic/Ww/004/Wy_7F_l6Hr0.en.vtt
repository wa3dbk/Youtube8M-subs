00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
oh right now I'm uh getting the door to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340 
oh right now I'm uh getting the door to
the<00:00:32.610> cabinet<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> project<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.200> we're

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the cabinet with the project that we're

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.740 
the cabinet with the project that we're
doing<00:00:34.379> today<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.220> vanity<00:00:35.640> those<00:00:36.329> those

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
doing today with the vanity those those

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
doing today with the vanity those those
doors<00:00:37.020> we'll<00:00:37.199> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> eat<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.770> also<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
doors we'll have to eat it also into the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.200 
doors we'll have to eat it also into the
cabin<00:00:40.129> what<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.250> doing<00:00:41.519> now<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.879> fitting

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
cabin what I'm doing now it's fitting

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.509 
cabin what I'm doing now it's fitting
the<00:00:42.300> size<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:43.379> using<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:44.030> smoothing<00:00:45.030> plane<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
the size I'm using a smoothing plane and

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.250 
the size I'm using a smoothing plane and
this<00:00:47.519> plane<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.150> down<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.540> I<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.900> to<00:00:49.019> fetch

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this plane it down so I get it to fetch

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.420 
this plane it down so I get it to fetch
a<00:00:50.600> good<00:00:51.600> chip<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.350> using<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> smoothing<00:00:53.309> plane

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
a good chip for using a smoothing plane

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.600 
a good chip for using a smoothing plane
or<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.879> planes<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.159> you've<00:00:56.309> set

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
or all planes really is when you've set

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.710 
or all planes really is when you've set
your<00:00:56.790> plane<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:58.860> style<00:00:59.720> or

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
your plane on your on your style or

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.109 
your plane on your on your style or
whatever<00:01:01.049> surface<00:01:01.290> you're<00:01:01.619> planing<00:01:02.030> set<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
whatever surface you're planing set it

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.100 
whatever surface you're planing set it
off<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.449> an<00:01:03.570> angle

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
off at an angle

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.789 
off at an angle
what<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.920> does<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> changes<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.180> iron

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
what this does is it changes that iron

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
what this does is it changes that iron
blade<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.240> different<00:01:09.240> lower<00:01:09.570> angle<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
blade to a different lower angle of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.359 
blade to a different lower angle of
attack<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.540> helps<00:01:13.500> make

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
attack and it really really helps make

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.350 
attack and it really really helps make
the<00:01:14.549> cut<00:01:14.729> smoother<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.409> tends<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
the cut smoother and also it tends to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.460 
the cut smoother and also it tends to
peel<00:01:18.590> let's<00:01:19.590> say<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.630> grains<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.380> wood

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
peel let's say the grains of the wood

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.600 
peel let's say the grains of the wood
instead<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.729> hitting<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.750> dead<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.610> all

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
instead of hitting all them dead on all

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.990 
instead of hitting all them dead on all
at<00:01:26.790> once<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.259> helps<00:01:28.909> after<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
at once so it really helps after you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.110 
at once so it really helps after you
have<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.329> ear<00:01:30.689> styles

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
have your ear styles

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.810 
have your ear styles
padded<00:01:33.120> which<00:01:33.870> every<00:01:34.200> night<00:01:34.320> use<00:01:34.610> you'll<00:01:35.610> need

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
padded which every night use you'll need

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
padded which every night use you'll need

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to do the up rails the rails have a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.990 
to do the up rails the rails have a
particular<00:01:42.020> problem<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.700> Grain

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
particular problem you have in Grain

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.230 
particular problem you have in Grain
that<00:01:45.210> you're<00:01:45.300> not<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.540> plane<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.909> with

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that you're not at the plane so with

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.880 
that you're not at the plane so with
that<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.840> need<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.050> low<00:01:49.320> angle<00:01:49.470> block

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that you will need a low angle block

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
that you will need a low angle block
plane<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:51.950> because<00:01:52.950> you're<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
planing end grain you really want this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.320 
planing end grain you really want this
to<00:01:56.970> be<00:01:57.060> sharp<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.740> your

it's<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.440> tip<00:02:08.890> here<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.700> come<00:02:10.179> in<00:02:10.539> from<00:02:10.960> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
it's a tip here is to come in from the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.460 
it's a tip here is to come in from the
edges<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:12.490> coming<00:02:12.820> into<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.090> center<00:02:13.470> that

way<00:02:14.770> you<00:02:15.670> won't<00:02:15.820> risk<00:02:16.510> blowing<00:02:16.780> out<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.890> at<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
way you won't risk blowing out be at the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.640 
way you won't risk blowing out be at the
side<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.790> your<00:02:18.910> style<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.600> came<00:02:20.110> across<00:02:20.230> here

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
side of your style I came across here

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.100 
side of your style I came across here
like<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.700> would<00:02:21.820> probably<00:02:22.060> drip<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
like this it would probably drip the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.370 
like this it would probably drip the
side<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.070> my<00:02:24.160> style<00:02:24.430> which<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:24.970> fit<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
side of my style which I just fit and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.320 
side of my style which I just fit and
planed<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.860> nice<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.040> smooth<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.700> would<00:02:27.820> not

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
planed it nice and smooth that would not

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.060 
planed it nice and smooth that would not
be<00:02:28.510> good

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
be good

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.050 
be good
another<00:02:30.070> another<00:02:30.790> secret<00:02:31.209> mystery<00:02:31.990> tip<00:02:33.060> which

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
another another secret mystery tip which

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.610 
another another secret mystery tip which
I<00:02:34.390> don't<00:02:35.350> understand<00:02:36.220> why<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:36.580> works

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
I don't understand why this works

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.900 
I don't understand why this works
however<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.640> get<00:02:39.790> your<00:02:40.030> end<00:02:40.239> grain<00:02:40.570> wet

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
however you get your end grain wet

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.620 
however you get your end grain wet
let's<00:02:42.910> soak<00:02:43.209> in<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.450> little<00:02:43.480> bit<00:02:44.040> dry<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.100> off

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
let's soak in a little bit dry it off

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.130 
let's soak in a little bit dry it off
that<00:02:46.630> way<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.900> won't<00:02:47.140> get<00:02:47.860> rust<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.340> on<00:02:48.790> your

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
that way you won't get rust on on your

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.280 
that way you won't get rust on on your
freshly<00:02:50.140> sharpened<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.860> hand<00:02:51.489> plank<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.290> you
