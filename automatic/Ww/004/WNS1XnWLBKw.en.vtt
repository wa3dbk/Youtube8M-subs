00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
know you know I've been labeled an urban

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
know you know I've been labeled an urban
art<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.130> guess<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> skating<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
art I guess because of the skating and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.380 
art I guess because of the skating and
because<00:01:15.810> i<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.150> pieces<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.240> kind

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
because i think the the pieces are kind

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.359 
because i think the the pieces are kind
of<00:01:18.450> abstract<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.470> i<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> lot<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of abstract but i think a lot of it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.190 
of abstract but i think a lot of it
really<00:01:20.580> was

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
really was

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.319 
really was
myself<00:01:21.619> where<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:21.979> live<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:22.909> know<00:01:23.030> like<00:01:23.119> my

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
myself where I live you know like my

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.300 
myself where I live you know like my
studio<00:01:23.689> back<00:01:23.899> in<00:01:24.020> Brooklyn<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:25.039> was<00:01:25.159> right

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
studio back in Brooklyn it was right

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.730 
studio back in Brooklyn it was right
behind<00:01:25.430> like<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.789> navy<00:01:26.420> yard<00:01:26.719> and<00:01:27.140> it's<00:01:27.590> like

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
behind like a navy yard and it's like

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.620 
behind like a navy yard and it's like
all<00:01:27.860> these<00:01:28.009> pipes<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.610> everything<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.270> I

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
all these pipes and everything so I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.419 
all these pipes and everything so I
think<00:01:30.259> it<00:01:30.350> was<00:01:30.439> just<00:01:30.500> part<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.829> like<00:01:31.009> where<00:01:31.399> I

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
think it was just part of like where I

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.600 
think it was just part of like where I
live<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.789> then<00:01:32.090> where<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.899> lived<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.439> New<00:01:33.860> York

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
live and then where I lived in New York

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.380 
live and then where I lived in New York
right<00:01:35.390> behind<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.869> was<00:01:36.350> coned<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.179> that's<00:01:38.179> all

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
right behind it was coned and that's all

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.139
