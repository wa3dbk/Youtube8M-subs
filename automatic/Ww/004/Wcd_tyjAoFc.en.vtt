00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello dear chip user, we are here 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.980
 anna send because of this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.620
 namely the 17 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.809
 the new flagship we want first 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.269
 a word about the equipment lose 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 what we have here is a 52 inch full 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.980
 hd display that pretty enlightened on 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 the first look is exactly like 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 always out of the chip test lab if that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.260
 then get 52 inches of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.480
 c02 more than the predecessor of the honda 6 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 at the resolution but are the same 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.130
 we stayed as we said full 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.620
 hd and best wears the device easy 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.629
 because here hides one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 Real novelty that is beside the sun 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.210
 called smart key or smart button the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.640
 can one prove with a function of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.230
 choice for example in the app or one 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 special function like the camera 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 or you can also someone directly 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.480
 call if you as it pushes for 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.539
 for example , a very nice feature 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.190
 so far from crime and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.230
 i can save these expensive values 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.760
 no one models anyway 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.330
 can afford exactly copied by jason 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 Blake 7 is here the fingerprint sensor 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.689
 with which I start the mobile phone lock 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 can quasi enter the code without quasi 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.830
 pretty cool and actually 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.159
 placed sensibly because I have the phone yes 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.049
 anyway in my hand and then 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.340
 not awkward as with other phones 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.550
 for example, the bottom of the home 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.750
 button must press 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.240
 the fingerprint sensor and the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
 that's what special features can do 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.080
 accept and reject calls 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.730
 how that works exactly we have to 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.340
 then find out in the test because it could 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.960
 not yet shown at the demo 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.410
 because live on stage calls you 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.150
 Of course no one 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.520
 I leave it here because the front 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.920
 camera for self is also quite 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.380
 Interestingly it is an 8 megapixel 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.260
 camera pretty much from that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.270
 Of course there are models in high resolution 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.250
 the already more resolution for the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.210
 front camera but offer eight megapixels 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 is really above average 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.400
 Right now I'm kicking it again 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.160
 stay with the camera here is namely 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.080
 a 20 megapixel camera like we currently have 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 in an interview with the president of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.850
 bombay and horn have experienced 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.950
 the sensor is probably like eating 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.980
 with seven of sony and it's just that 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.230
 latest generation 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.420
 we are still using dual tone flash led 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.970
 used for lightning illumination 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.910
 of course, the glass is the camera 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.230
 Protecting is sapphire crystal that's kind of like 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.260
 what we actually see from apple 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 wanted for the display and now here in 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.840
 have a smaller shape for the camera yet 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.280
 to the inner values â€‹â€‹of the eight nuclear cpu 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.820
 with a maximum of 2 2 ghz to 64 bit 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.560
 does not support so much because it supports 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.060
 is five on android but we are 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.600
 do not have four gigabytes of ram 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.430
 that's nice with 64 bit 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.129
 but does not have the big advantage yet 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.040
 fit advantage but is it the dual sim 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.890
 Function is fit here on the page 2 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.689
 nano sim cards in 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.430
 I can just a company or a 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.159
 private users are using something pretty 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.560
 cool but you can also use it differently 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.239
 you can, for example, instead of the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.909
 second sim card also a micro sd 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.489
 card in to do the 16 gb internal 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.870
 storage also needs to expand 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.790
 but then of course decide 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.920
 namely rather two sim cards or 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.889
 namely only a sim card but for it 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.419
 another micro sd card otherwise 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.349
 design it is very simple 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.959
 but it looks noble it is also I believe 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.400
 yes the lettering is made of aluminum here 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.849
 slightly increased so it looks very noble 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.439
 how a piece of love so htc 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.989
 down here are two speakers 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.209
 to ensure a good sound 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.389
 lte has sex is also on board again 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.099
 So fastest surfing currently faster 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.379
 it does not go as 300 megabits in 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.790
 Germany currently has this device 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.140
 on it 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.870
 otherwise the battery is like already at 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.200
 predecessor with 3100 milliamp hours 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.140
 very tall and voluptuous and should be over 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.510
 two days keep in normal use 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.940
 what you took from 8 at 8 o'clock 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.650
 is a torch screenshot feature 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.150
 I can finger twice here 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.310
 drink on it and then with one 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.910
 made screenshot therefore does not have a 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.530
 annoying key combination press around the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.310
 screenshot is very nice 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.800
 otherwise the emotion ios is 3.1 too 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.789
 on it the some new tricks on board 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.729
 has and quite a lot 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:45.600
 promising device also really great 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.000
 Price and mood it is quite as 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.010
 first in the new bachelor minor of 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.600
 way and anna is an online market 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.919
 It is exclusive to mobile devices 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.539
 get discounts and there you get that 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.050
 So it's the first thing that still happens 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.520
 Amazon saturn media market exactly where you are 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.319
 can order 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.520
 Another interesting feature is the feature 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:13.199
 in the hangar 7 an infrared 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.090
 interface is integrated 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.250
 so you can for example tv 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.319
 control or other smartphone devices 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.449
 for example, just one 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.720
 Infrared interface has got it 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.370
 Handy comes in two colors at least now 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.050
 2 are actually presented one 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.610
 Golden suspected was not today 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.870
 shown but once in this fantasy 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.900
 bra and still in a dark variant 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.900
 are
