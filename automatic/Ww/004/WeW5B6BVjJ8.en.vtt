 players in the cinemas of 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.269
 Teaser trailer definitely want more 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.730
 makes and that's exactly what we look at 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.730
 27 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.730
 Hello 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.710
 I'm just I was looking for you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.160

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 offender description fits exactly 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.390
 I write that you have everything for the case 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.740
 that I am like the others 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.880

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.870

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.870

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.600
 Here you are the future of ours 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.600
 society 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.940
 I'm sick because I'm sick 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.180
 was that a dream 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.180
 or did it really happen? 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.830
 for a german production really 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.390
 an exciting teaser trailer that is not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.250
 correctly conveyed what exactly 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.720
 But the interest goes away with me 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.430
 to want to find out exactly that and 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.080
 so that made one as this one 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.580
 really good job with nice wearing 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.810
 music accompanied fast cut 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.820
 in the middle of it david kross and the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.500
 beautiful pretty more students then gives 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.970
 at least the feeling of one together 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.380
 conspiracy thriller where i am 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.700
 to find out why is in the reason 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.560
 is synonymous if the whole on one 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.630
 book template is based and is actually 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.000
 exquisite quake brings us cook 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.460
 media expected from 20 august 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.810
 2015 in German cinemas and tells 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.670
 The story of a young man 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.800
 played by david kross awakens on u 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.120
 railroad track does not know who it is 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 is not up to the last time 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.990
 But remember a search picture 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.429
 by himself that means he is up 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.110
 the flight and just on this flight 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.430
 he finds a diary of him 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.600
 even written by hand 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.370
 is and names a girl 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.620
 played by the school one 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.660
 similar brand has wr and so is 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 Clearly something they have in common and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 Above all, it is a dive into the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.370
 Past then again and again with 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.959
 flashbacks is told behind it 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.060
 a kind of conspiracy that extends into 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.170
 the highest circles are drawing and I like it 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.880
 Such a miller in this direction 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.410
 are knitted and then I have to say 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 because the teaser really a nice look 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.900
 if you are in German film yes 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.790
 always a bit basic 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.440
 it is careful if they can do a lot 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.300
 for this exciting calf david kross and 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.250
 the mega games in front of the camera so 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.690
 pretty young but experienced cast 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.130
 and if the film is rudimentary 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.630
 can and then the right trailer 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.640
 what this teaser promises if 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.230
 I like it from 20 august my 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.850
 interest is definitely aroused because of me 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.140
 17 with you you will find that 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.459
 cool or not at all 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.260
 Let me know in any case 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.600
 I'm through this trailer shows to 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.280
 better if that would be a thumb there if 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.290
 this video made it stay we will 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.400
 not otherwise that you know there is 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.440
 still a few left around me and 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.840

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.540
