heading out to Honolulu as you can see I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.749 
heading out to Honolulu as you can see I
did<00:01:51.360> take<00:01:51.509> away<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.869> gates<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.640> think<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> looks

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
did take away my gates I think it looks

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
did take away my gates I think it looks
a<00:01:54.000> lot<00:01:54.210> better<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> gates<00:01:55.049> without<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
a lot better with the gates without the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
a lot better with the gates without the
gates<00:01:56.390> just<00:01:57.390> until<00:01:57.570> someone<00:01:58.020> makes<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.320> pretty

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
gates just until someone makes a pretty

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.700 
gates just until someone makes a pretty
good<00:01:58.799> gate<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.399> think<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.270> fine<00:02:00.509> um<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
good gate I think it's just fine um and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.830 
good gate I think it's just fine um and
I<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.719> much

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
I don't think I'm going to get much

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.240 
I don't think I'm going to get much
ground<00:02:04.170> equipment<00:02:04.350> until<00:02:04.740> someone

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
ground equipment until someone

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.830 
ground equipment until someone
mass-produces<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.600> it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
mass-produces it because right now it's

then i'm also planning on getting some
all<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:31.240> next<00:06:31.480> step<00:06:31.660> for<00:06:31.690> me<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:31.990> getting<00:06:32.290> the

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
all the next step for me is getting the

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.990 
all the next step for me is getting the
actual<00:06:32.800> map<00:06:33.010> for<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.400> one<00:06:33.640> to<00:06:33.760> four<00:06:33.910> hundred

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
actual map for the one to four hundred

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.730 
actual map for the one to four hundred
then<00:06:34.600> I'm<00:06:34.690> going<00:06:34.840> to<00:06:34.900> go<00:06:34.990> back<00:06:35.020> to<00:06:35.200> collecting

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
then I'm going to go back to collecting

then I'm going to go back to collecting
I<00:06:35.950> felt<00:06:36.250> like<00:06:36.340> to<00:06:36.490> read<00:06:36.610> jetblue's<00:06:36.970> on<00:06:37.090> the<00:06:37.180> way

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
I felt like to read jetblue's on the way

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.560 
I felt like to read jetblue's on the way
but<00:06:38.260> I<00:06:38.290> need<00:06:38.530> to<00:06:38.560> get<00:06:39.100> leaf<00:06:39.610> like<00:06:39.790> three<00:06:40.450> and
