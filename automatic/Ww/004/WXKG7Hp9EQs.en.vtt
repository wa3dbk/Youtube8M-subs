the nollie varial heelflip is a
combination<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.119> nollie<00:00:27.359> heelflip<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.470> a

people attempt to do the nollie varial
heelflip<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.370> fingerboards<00:00:35.370> they<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
heelflip in fingerboards they do it

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.090 
heelflip in fingerboards they do it
completely<00:00:36.750> wrong<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.500> fact<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.370> should<00:00:38.570> be

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
completely wrong in fact it should be

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.410 
completely wrong in fact it should be
that<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.850> trick<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.360> do

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
that what they do the trick that they do

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
that what they do the trick that they do
is<00:00:42.809> probably<00:00:43.440> call<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> nollie<00:00:44.129> forward<00:00:44.610> heel

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
is probably call the nollie forward heel

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060 
is probably call the nollie forward heel
flip<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.320> want<00:00:46.559> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
flip and that's not what we want so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.619 
flip and that's not what we want so
you'll<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.370> people<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.700> now<00:00:47.910> he'll<00:00:48.239> flip<00:00:48.390> side

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.580 

see<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> board<00:00:52.489> Patail<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> board

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
see that with a board Patail the board

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.020 
see that with a board Patail the board
goes<00:00:55.590> lower<00:00:55.920> than<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> nose<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.420> board<00:00:59.030> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
goes lower than the nose the board and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.810 
goes lower than the nose the board and
that's<00:01:00.449> completely<00:01:00.870> incorrect<00:01:01.460> if<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> watch

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that's completely incorrect if you watch

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
that's completely incorrect if you watch

you<00:01:15.330> might<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> board<00:01:15.840> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> dip<00:01:16.320> down

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
you might see the board kind of dip down

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.289 
you might see the board kind of dip down
but<00:01:18.770> that's<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:20.549> we're<00:01:20.700> trying<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.090> try

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

a nollie heelflip so this is how I do

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.460 
a nollie heelflip so this is how I do
one<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:50.840> when<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> pop<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> boy

one like that when you pop the boy
you're<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.799> pop<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.189> similar<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you're going to pop it's similar to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.969 
you're going to pop it's similar to
nollie<00:01:53.850> heelflip<00:01:54.600> except<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> push

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
nollie heelflip except you want to push

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.319 
nollie heelflip except you want to push
the<00:01:56.009> board<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.420> wrist<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:59.329> and

the board with your wrist like this and
that<00:02:00.509> will<00:02:00.570> give<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.020> nollie<00:02:01.259> backside

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that will give you that nollie backside

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
that will give you that nollie backside
Shepherd<00:02:02.250> rotation<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.570> makes<00:02:03.810> that's

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
Shepherd rotation that makes that's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.679 
Shepherd rotation that makes that's
probably<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> hardest<00:02:04.740> part<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.130> trick

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
probably the hardest part of the trick

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
probably the hardest part of the trick
getting<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.719> feeling<00:02:07.320> down<00:02:07.740> you're<00:02:08.429> going

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
getting that feeling down you're going

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.690 
getting that feeling down you're going

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
to kind of fill your wrist push it out

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.020 
to kind of fill your wrist push it out
it<00:02:11.700> feels<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.209> weird

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
it feels really weird

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.610 
it feels really weird
once<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.300> get<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.510> hang<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.500> was

once you get the hang of it it was

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.570 
once you get the hang of it it was
really<00:02:15.010> easy<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.990> nollie<00:02:17.200> heelflip<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:18.340> kind

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
really easy the nollie heelflip you kind

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.930 
really easy the nollie heelflip you kind
of<00:02:18.640> pop<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.150> push<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.540> forward<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:20.850> when<00:02:21.850> you

you<00:02:41.980> did<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.250> nollie<00:02:42.459> forward<00:02:43.180> heel<00:02:43.330> flip

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
you did that nollie forward heel flip

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.479 
you did that nollie forward heel flip
you<00:02:43.930> kind<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.200> hit<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.650> off<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.890> edges<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.220> tiny

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
you kind of hit it off the edges of tiny

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.830 
you kind of hit it off the edges of tiny
bit<00:02:45.760> maybe<00:02:46.330> an<00:02:46.540> angle<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.230> your<00:02:48.100> finger

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
bit maybe an angle like this your finger

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.300 
bit maybe an angle like this your finger
and<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:49.989> will<00:02:50.140> get<00:02:50.230> your<00:02:50.350> board<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:51.040> spin

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
and this will get your board to spin

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.880 
and this will get your board to spin
correctly<00:02:52.080> realistically<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.530> atman

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
correctly realistically and the atman

correctly realistically and the atman
stand<00:02:57.250> fast<00:02:57.670> rotation<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.390> what<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.600> want

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
stand fast rotation is what you want

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.199 
stand fast rotation is what you want
obviously<00:03:01.690> when<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.930> board<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.260> spinning

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
obviously when the board is spinning

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.050 
obviously when the board is spinning
you'll<00:03:04.209> see<00:03:04.450> coming<00:03:04.810> with<00:03:04.930> ninety<00:03:05.350> at<00:03:06.060> first

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
you'll see coming with ninety at first

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.059 
you'll see coming with ninety at first
and<00:03:07.330> that's<00:03:07.480> okay<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:08.080> name<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.380> he'd<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:08.739> 90

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
and that's okay my name is he'd go 90

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.600 
and that's okay my name is he'd go 90
yet<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:10.030> keep<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.330> practicing<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.050> see

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
yet just keep on practicing that see

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.610 
yet just keep on practicing that see
kind<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:12.640> pop<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.150> push<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.450> out<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.470> might

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
kind of pop it push it out and you might

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.900 
kind of pop it push it out and you might
get<00:03:14.739> in<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.190> know<00:03:15.310> 45<00:03:15.940> degrees<00:03:16.890> 50<00:03:17.890> 90<00:03:18.549> degrees

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
get in you know 45 degrees 50 90 degrees

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.490 
get in you know 45 degrees 50 90 degrees
eventually<00:03:19.660> that<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:20.019> get<00:03:20.110> all<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.350> way

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
eventually that you can get all the way

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.530 
eventually that you can get all the way
180<00:03:21.010> degrees<00:03:21.370> around<00:03:21.549> before<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.239> remember

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
180 degrees around before you remember

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.470 
180 degrees around before you remember
on<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.989> board<00:03:23.200> at<00:03:24.100> first<00:03:24.370> maybe<00:03:24.640> catch<00:03:24.970> at<00:03:25.180> 90

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
on the board at first maybe catch at 90

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.449 
on the board at first maybe catch at 90
degrees<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:26.049> rotate<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.220> can't

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
degrees and rotate it if you can't

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.620 
degrees and rotate it if you can't
rotate<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.329> kind<00:03:28.630> of<00:03:28.660> give<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.019> at<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.260> end<00:03:29.440> and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
rotate it kind of give it at the end and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.850 
rotate it kind of give it at the end and
that<00:03:31.630> will<00:03:31.810> kind<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.049> get<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> trick<00:03:32.650> and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
that will kind of get you the trick and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.240 
that will kind of get you the trick and
you<00:03:32.920> get<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.160> hang<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.900> when<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.010> catch

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
you get the hang of it so when you catch

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.240 
you get the hang of it so when you catch
it<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.610> like<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.940> catch<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:38.170> board<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:39.220> my

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it I like to catch the board with my

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.170 
it I like to catch the board with my
front<00:03:39.760> finger<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.829> don't<00:03:41.829> know<00:03:41.890> why<00:03:42.100> this<00:03:42.180> down

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
front finger I don't know why this down

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.569 
front finger I don't know why this down
I'm<00:03:43.750> going<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:44.200> kind<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.040> keep<00:03:45.190> my<00:03:45.310> back
