 Of course you can also buy so said 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.580
 Here two hands would be full then 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.440
 We have about nine dates in this case 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.500
 this applies only really delicious in 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.500
 raw food quality here two tablespoons 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 kasan 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.240
 a spoonful of history 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.609
 are slow 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.579
 peeled handful very rich in omega 3 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:38.479
 and omega 6 fatty acids and very rich 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.549
 high quality protein and here one more 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.649
 About half a teaspoon of vanilla 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.350
 So a little vanilla depending on your needs 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.039
 plus 120 milliliters of purified 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.149
 Water can also be a bit more 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.280
 if you want to know only the ingredients 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.130
 such as china seed hemp seeds 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.500
 or dates gets look in the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.189
 video description purely there there is 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.060
 left to the shops also to the vita mix so 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.399
 and now we make the recipe 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:13.190
 the water is already in it 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:16.010
 Let's take five more dates for that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.519
 Just do it to me so about the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.140
 half of the data we have here and 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:32.269
 the teaspoon also peeled hand tame 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.980
 just remember that the vanilla and 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.180
 that was everything so have now 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910
 Here we are the water hand 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.349
 Vanilla and the data in it do it in the lid 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.859
 on it and cure about every minute 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.859
 maybe faster too 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.980
 slowly up 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.510
 so that's half a minute up 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.700
 would have to cure the highest level 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:27.280
 actually enough then we have the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.280
 shots we just do it 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.430
 so and to this mass of pureed 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.599
 dates and hemp seeds do me that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:54.400
 now just the two tablespoons kasan 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.720
 Now you just want to over here and 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.090
 then we can stir that up 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.579
 So it's a good idea 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.620
 so everyone sparingly with 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.040
 This liquid is covered up 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.670
 this mass so if that is well below 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.670
 was chosen 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.970
 Let's just let the one about a 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.009
 half an hour stand 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.930
 what is happening here now the cic her 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.960
 say that next to the liquid and 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.539
 begin to swell and that then forms 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:35.580
 This pudding-like consistency in the 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:38.169
 In the meantime I clean the mixer 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.880
 and then we can 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:45.010
 Ran up here these would be too 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.099
 Cure so the container is now 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.960
 clean again then I am doing now 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.960
 Here the world like in the mix belter 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.370
 So the far ones are going to invade now 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:03.720
 the four dachshunds come to this and 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.720
 then we purify it all again 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.970
 that's how it looks 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.540
 to larger quantities works then 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.700
 better I have just got out of this 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.360
 Let it soak for 30 minutes 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.700
 after we turn 30 again 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.620
 minutes have passed 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.700
 we have the soaked shazam here 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.070
 I hope you can recognize that 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.550
 So that's a really nice pudding 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.510
 like consistency 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.170
 and they are really nice and soft 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.170
 become 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:21.010
 until the fall still the jam this 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:59.999
 and the blackberry raspberry is ready 

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:02.199
 china poland 

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:03.039
 I 've already tasted it super delicious 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.329
