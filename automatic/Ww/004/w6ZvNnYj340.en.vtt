 Hello everyone I am a strong and today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.629
 we are here to talk about the expected thief 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.150
 reboot of the classic for pc eidos weblog 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.519
 it is a very difficult game to frame 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.040
 since the developers have the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 need to innovate to renew 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.359
 especially the brand while on the other 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 aside there are very conservative fans 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.410
 who absolutely don't want i 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.660
 their memories come somehow 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.060
 ordinary for this reason before 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 leave you to our analysis I wanted 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
 remember to subscribe to ours 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.809
 YouTube channel in addition to following Italy 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.460
 obviously on the website but also on 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.790
 facebook and on twitter 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790
 good vision 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.739
 in short, we could have done this 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.719
 live more in the fundamental game phase 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.559
 to immerse yourself in the gloomy atmosphere of 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.420
 typhus 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.829
 in the beginning the city despite being 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.199
 far from perfect a place 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.820
 quiet where the powerful dominate 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.989
 the town and corrupt guard and the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.120
 signor delle adri roams freely 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.190
 Critics Everything seems to flow 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379
 normally until one night 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.540
 gambette derin union his partner of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.799
 adventures are engaged from below 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.080
 to complete the same 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 mission during which two yes 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.549
 they come across a strange ritual 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.500
 Baron is invoking a dark power 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.590
 which should bring the program 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.299
 industrial enlightenment in the city 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 during yet another bickering for hogan 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.590
 and the daring fall in the middle 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.280
 of ritual bearing down in a state of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 unconsciousness 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.299
 after a few moments, garrett and yes 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.000
 will awaken in the middle of a city 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.890
 darker and darker changed 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.050
 the baron at random power but for a while 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.090
 Time no longer appears in public, 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.700
 people murmur that he was infected by the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.920
 morrow early garnett and find out also 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.900
 passed other nando from the accident and into 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.470
 many had given up the data e 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.030
 his companion the structure that makes you 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.520
 seems to leave room for exploration 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.960
 even if a big indicator will show 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.330
 always where the goal is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.130
 next the missions at least 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.770
 initially they will all be rather 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.940
 similar to each other a variety will be given 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.560
 by our attitude 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.600
 then why do you decide whether to pass 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.179
 unnoticed or whether to try to fight 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.040
 directly through your enemies 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.959
 concentration a capacity too 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.880
 gavetta realizes to possess only 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 after the ritual the protagonist is a bit 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.040
 slow down time during 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.260
 fighting 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.610
 in spite of language the powers however the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.600
 lord of thieves is not able to 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.640
 counter too many enemies 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.440
 simultaneously element that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.200
 acknowledge always succeeded in terrific 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.220
 areas your moves before taking action 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.110
 fortunately the developers have 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.880
 thought of different alternative routes 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.489
 leaving to the player and different 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.170
 possibility to choose and back off 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.850
 different tools available from 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.739
 use for its purposes with 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.690
 an action to hoist yourself on a platform 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.239
 high instead of which attached one 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.280
 rope or a wrench thanks to the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.280
 which open control units that regulates 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.239
 the alarm of some apartments 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.620
 ingenious inhabitants of the city 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.580
 will try in every way to keep 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.290
 garnett away and in rapini 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.850
 the protagonist will find himself thinking about 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.770
 be a master in the resolution of 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.600
 small and puzzling or finding 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.370
 switch hidden clues 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.140
 what is noted however is that in addition to 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.000
 the one provided by the developers who a 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.190
 network can do nothing else 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.170
 It is true that this is everyone's rule 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.750
 video games, however, in this situation 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.300
 the developers were less good at 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.100
 masking this limit sometimes indeed 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.080
 you will wonder why now it can 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.500
 be open while the next one is not 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.980
 as well as the lord of thieves is indeed 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.770
 strange that I can't even jump for 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.030
 overcome an obstacle ball a coffee table 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.900
 during the presentation of it makes you there 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.340
 been told that one of the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.440
 main features of the game 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.420
 will be able to plan their own shots 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.459
 this should mean that once 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.920
 introduced the story the game will become 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.180
 much less linear and will leave you 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.580
 the possibility to choose freely 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.140
 which mission to address as well as 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.340
 roam freely on the streets 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.069
 of the city 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.959
 from a technical point of view, I support the exhibition 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.790
 all the problems encountered in the 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.530
 other products that come out on horseback 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.150
 of the console generation 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.250
 for many details it is possible 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.610
 don't notice the limitations imposed by 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.680
 playstation 3 xbox 360 on pc that if 4 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.790
 one ethos montreal tried to 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.620
 make the most of the hardware a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.360
 provision by offering timing of 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.940
 loading faster textures in high 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.739
 defining a very solid framerate but 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.359
 you always notice with the basic bone structure is 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.680
 a little dated these first hours in 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.180
 company of those who do have allowed us 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.220
 to better appreciate the work done 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.290
 from the dossons in the characterization of 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.090
 garrett and the city from what we have 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.130
 could see the script looks like 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.660
 well written with a good and different rhythm 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.850
 questions capable of pasting the 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.889
 player of the screen when 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.050
 review however will check how much 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.520
 the problems highlighted will go 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.100
 actually of the influence in the 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.020
 gameplay therefore laughter with eurogamer.it 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.020
 to find out what the new fans will look like
