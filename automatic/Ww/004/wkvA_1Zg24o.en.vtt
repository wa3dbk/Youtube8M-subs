00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.250
 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.220
 Andrei I want to present you a short 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.780
 panasonic headphone video review 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:20.100
 namely model j headphones 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:24.260
 e 118 is usually banal 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.460
 apple headphones for apple 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:34.190
 iPod also mp3 player for anyone 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:39.960
 phone so there are headphones with a drop 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:44.309
 vacuum inserts with plug three with 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.879
 in half that way they 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.449
 look 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.390
 were acquired in sitilinka for 240 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.730
 rubles that is the price is very small for 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.350
 panasonic 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.690
 respectively, now we open and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.949
 let's see what their sound quality is and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.870
 compare with some similar 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.570
 headphones look like this 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.909
 headphones when they got out of it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 plastic box 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.500
 what to look for when 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.450
 choosing a headphone i mean i always 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.329
 paid attention when choosing headphones 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.369
 so that the wire is soft enough 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:26.659
 especially in the cold season so he 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:30.649
 did not like much and did not break 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:36.259
 accordingly it is very convenient to have 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:39.600
 vacuum liners to 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.119
 being in the subway was normally audible 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.049
 that is, especially if listening to music is 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.320
 still fine and watch a movie by 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.179
 some 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.049
 mobile device is already problematic 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.899
 not all trains can be comfortable 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.799
 watching movies is especially uncomfortable in 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.700
 old noise that is annoying 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.570
 and prevents 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.429
 listen like this 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.640
 Kapka's earpiece , that is, an earpiece 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.870
 the inner and outer parts are very 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.959
 little ones 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:23.159
 what can I say about the car cord quality 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:24.019
 the cord here goes double in no 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:29.400
 shell 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:33.209
 double plug to return wire 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.030
 soft enough and flexible but 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.230
 to the touch and he seems to feel that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.829
 something a little bit he doesnâ€™t fall for so 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.680
 let's say softer and more comfortable 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.970
 with these headphones were bundled two 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.239
 extra liner valves for 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:02.599
 comparison I took the standard headphones 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:07.409
 samsungovskie from the tablet and I want a kitten 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.579
 compare that is even on appearance and 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.819
 to the touch 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.930
 Samsung headphones are several 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.959
 better made and looks better 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.859
 more pleasant to the touch that is more 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:28.049
 thick wires so let's say they are more 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:32.489
 soft looks more expensive looks 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.590
 so let's say more expensive remains 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.690
 check the sound quality of such 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:42.449
 headphone better I'll try it now 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:47.419
 I tried to compare on the tablet samsung 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:49.919
 and I'll tell you how it all happens I 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:54.720
 tested these headphones on 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:57.690
 samsung tablet and what I want to say 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.690
 sound quality from samsung data 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.480
 Headphones that I comparing and 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.160
 Panasonic almost identical then 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.199
 there is so high and low frequencies 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.709
 they are quite identical only 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:17.250
 I can say that samsung have narrow 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.350
 Headphone sound is slightly louder but 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.040
 probably due to the fact that here somehow 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:31.080
 more so big probably vacuum 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:32.280
 Liners that what is still minus headphones 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.270
 from panasonic 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.050
 it is that the disengagement to the right and 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.910
 left ear yes that is enough on 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.880
 long distance then there it is 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.710
 incomprehensible loop will hang our 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.840
 what is convenient to easily catch on 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.340
 can reduce it was centimeters on 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.220
 10 and now this lock does not move 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.870
 accordingly very uncomfortable 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.740
 respectively, summing up I want to say 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:08.010
 what headphones from panasonic 118 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.230
 For my money, I think I want to work 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.280
 still note that unlike some 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.740
 consumer goods vskih Chinese headphones 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.040
 who sell what's in the underground 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.169
 crossings in tents in the subway and so on 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.220
 then the sound quality is enough here 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:29.340
 good let not hold out ananda 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.190
 good headphones but nevertheless those 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.229
 headphones that come bundled with 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.229
 some chinese fakes 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.400
 vacuum liners it pli in the ears 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.650
 keeps well enough that is not 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.879
 crashes does not interfere does not deliver 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:53.240
 no discomfort and I want to note that 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.940
 they are very very small hope my 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.370
 Review helped someone in choosing and in 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.370
 good luck everyone to new meetings
