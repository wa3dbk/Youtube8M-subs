00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.320
 revol: What is this exchange ... 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.780
 eyes: Now from Dive, Awaker exactly 1 kill, 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.500
 Just come here! From the cool Ult 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.080
 Run away from the EQ, FlashIN, Numa! 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.580
 Is it in the form of exchange, protecting Top Tower? 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.480
 eyes: Well from the Hook, apaMEN set back in reverse 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.880
 Teleport is also flying, to go to Scotty aiming 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.100
 It is Sweet but Charm is hit, no, Cleanse, 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.920
 Now that Rkp is being targeted! ? 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.800
 Well, I've beat Raphonitte, I've beat it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.100
 Aero shuts down, 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.740
 Well then Sweet 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.340
 The shape given to Scotty of CROOZ Rascal Jester, 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.020
 Well here's the development of Zhonya from here 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.880
 No Scotty still gets over the damage 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.820
 Take Double Kill! 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.940
 Well, Aero is a Mega Gnar and is doing damage! 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.140
 Has made damage but there is no Carry team 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.940
 Triple Kill Brings Scotty! 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.540
 ACE ghetto. 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.320
 eyes: Well, in the form of reverse counter 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.820
 Kazuta will go in, but here 7 kanes are in time, 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 Ceros, who is wearing a shield 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.220
 Here comes Teleport, 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.720
 I run away once in a jump. 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.680
 Well, I avoided Cerm from FlashIN Ceros! 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.880
 I just hit it, but 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.840
 Moyashi's good equalizer but not enough damage! 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
 Now where you want to engage Teleport, Awaker 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.240
 Although it tucks on Snare, Health once backs 50% 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.920
 Launched BonziN, 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.980
 The equalizer is in good shape, 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.440
 However, it has not hit the Carry team, 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.860
 Yutapon is completely Free, 1 kill is Moyashi, 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.560
 Double Kill can be taken further, 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.920
 Now it's down, let's change 1-2. 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.120
 Well, in the collective battle, I got back the flow, 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.700
 7th heaven, but amuse comes here 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.220
 Go for Mueki! AMUSE is good damage! 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 1 vs 4! 1 vs 4! 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.740
 No, yunn came on telport, yunn came 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.640
 Tank came but Baron canceled 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.780
 And AMUSE will you aim at this, 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.520
 I have to use Zhonya but I'm aiming 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.000
 This is still aiming! 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.560
 Come on yunn right BodyBlock. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.840
 eyes: Oh Raphonitta Now we went to aim Rkp 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.540
 Charm is not hit, it was avoided! 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.520
 Avoided, Scotty good shape with reverse counter, 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.400
 Damaged with Ult, Joke, 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.120
 Throwing, I can not escape from apaMEN, 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.520
 This, this character is Hard CC. 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.480
 Now it is Rkp to bring Triple Kill. 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.920
 eyes: Cool is going to put, 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.220
 Come on Hook! Decide, apaMEN Snare Stun! 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.380
 revol: Just this few games, you're strong 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.960
 eyes: From slow, let's get Teleport. 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.920
 Lillebelt caught the Raphonitte Q! 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.740
 It's Cool Ult after Ult, 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.520
 Well I picked up Scott 1! 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.920
 eyes: Well, with the Jungler 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.980
 A collision is likely to occur, 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.480
 Well, yoshiaki and Envy, 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.780
 Both have skills, in a form that talks to each other, 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.220
 It was yoshiaki who applied EQ first. 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.960
 Just Envy's Q, Q 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.740
 Here in tei from FlashIN Snare 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.540
 Stopped is Clockday, but Red Buff Dead! 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.320
 Envy takes FirstBlood, 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.980
 I'm putting more Q! 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.780
 It is Envy who once again put a Q from Snare, again! 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.120
 Double Kill Bring Envy! 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.580
 Now from Topare, Snare, which was put Pink. 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.700
 Flash has already been cut off in the battle 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.800
 Envy will also hit Q here, now red Buff, 1, 2, 3 times! 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.880
 It's Smite and it's from Slow! 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.960
 No Dead? No shield! 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.340
 Envy 3 kill eyes! 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.440
 revol: In other words Leblanc's damage 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.435
 It's almost like passing by, isn't it? 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.980
 Equipped with Magic Resist as well ... 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.980
 eyes: Ha ha ha ha ha ... 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.235
 Ah ... 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 revol: I can not go through it, though. 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.500
 eyes: I walked back and went back, 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.936
 eyes: Oh my! revol: Hah! 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.180
 eyes: Come on wearing Homeguard, eh! 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.480
 90% in Q Ult! From E, 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.860
 tei has a great deal of damage. 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.680
 eyes: Well, avoid, Rabbit Five, pretty much, 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 Now, 7 kane devices are set, but E Blink OUT is selected, 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.200
 I fit the equalizer, but I can not pick up 1 kill, 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.740
 It is Rabbit Five that is picked up reversely, 2 kill exchange ... 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.820
 eyes: A scene that breaks an Inhibitor, doing Group Up 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.880
 Awaker came in, was it beautifully wrapped this time, 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.480
 Rumble Moyashi's Ult 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.120
 Hmmm, only BonziN has been decided, 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.400
 Estel just hit Charm on Ceros! 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.320
 Insufficient Health, Insufficient Damage! 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.720
 Well, it's Rabbit Five, which is a form of drawing from the front line. 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.620
 Pursuit, Triple Kill Bring Yutonon, 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.560
 Jump from to Quadra! 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.680
 Well, do you have Penta or not Penta? 

00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:17.035
 Oh, I can not do it-here. 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.300
 Quadra ... oh! PENTA! ULT! 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.280
 Yutapon PENTAKILL!
