00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:13.700
 So let's say good morning to you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.289
 Today butter was a grape 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.410
 For this I use a ball cookie cutter 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.600
 and that is in my art 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.029
 two-sided once the bigger and the poor 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.529
 the smaller balls practically yes it is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.150
 very handy you can do that a bit 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.880
 faithful to the original 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.670
 Of course I only use butter 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:45.469
 a plate on which I then in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:52.890
 end my grape take a break 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:55.100
 Today, yes, we'll have enough 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 always comes up always comes to the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.710
 I'll say yes I have 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.879
 that was enough so that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 it's a bit supple 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.240
 bit as good turvy and now 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 At first we only manage 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.409
 a basis a grape is not 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.180
 so flat that looks so synonymous 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.270
 a little different and I take it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.939
 the bigger balls to say okay 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 after that the smaller ones we catch 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.210
 then maybe to the water 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:33.840
 bit too cool , very hot 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 Water is very important then it is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.159
 really comes out but that comes from 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.590
 but only if it is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.880
 water is hot enough 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:49.229
 otherwise we have a problem so sure 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.079
 otherwise not just thank you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 outdo 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.380
 but not much so there you need 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.680
 really not much because that works 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.770
 really guess what I think just fine 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.890
 it's just that one with the bigger one 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.359
 the basis can create where you then the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.500
 delicacies therefore noon was with the 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.780
 can make small balls 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.629
 so that it really works as well 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.349
 a grape I find that now completely 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.629
 important so i think now i have only 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.060
 times big enough I try that first 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:26.239
 with the little ones and look there comes 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.650
 slowly she gets shape and form 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.940
 Of course you can do it all up too 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.299
 make another plate 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.329
 I just got it right now 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.200
 I had thought of it because they too 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.260
 a bit of a sweeping leaf 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.079
 I actually think it's really great 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.549
 a little something for yourself, of course 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.069
 a flat plate must therefore be 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.150
 its not as something going on 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.540
 we have it in such a thing now 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:57.450
 shallower shell brought slowly sees 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:00.150
 what that becomes and what the rest is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.010
 we do not stop with a little decoration 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:10.019
 very much but a little bit 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.090
 that's why sÃ¤nken fits so much need 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.190
 We do not think so 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.790
 piece of butter is quite enough there 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.760
 you do not have to do more, so more 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.109
 he does not like it out yet 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.970
 I do not take a ball here 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:29.220
 the down again yes that should be yes 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.019
 even so that fits well if the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.930
 The water is hot enough that fits all 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.430
 great then will I have the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 so many participated so much 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.650
 Feierei it is always a great 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.260
 Idea too so if you're mine right now 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.410
 so dream with a rustic bread time 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.000
 I think that's really great, too 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.640
 arrange on the board 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.980
 he then acts one more time 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.230
 everything else on such occasions 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.490
 There you can really join in a lot 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.350
 so now I have a little one 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.140
 little deco a little grape 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.060
 leaf to it and I think that's enough 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.350
 totally off to the very best 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.180
 to present to the table 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.510
 I wish you a lot of fun with that 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.820
 to do exactly that, I hope so 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.360
 great idea for you magnetically new 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.360
 to hire
