00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.339
 what to do with it 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.900
 to me i will also be on my first room the aex is a question you still ask 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.359
 to keep the task ahead of me 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.510
 He also offers unanswered input to these affiliates 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.560
 of course, the floppy disk that has become unwell is also included 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
 nijmegen 25 but I have questions about it 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.489
 baarn and but also looks at our own for me 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.579
 and this time no short circuit and then I'm going to ask here again 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.920
 answer that got on me in pieces and valentine 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.970
 well once i am best of 9 if you have to be with you and a bit off the tree 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.040
 look 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.580
 I don't like the chance that wood nowadays comes from wood waste like a cheese 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.760
 on a pizza is melted cheese 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.540
 He also pointed out hunting harness and Parmesan cheese 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
 I prefer plastic bags, preferably 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.670
 weekly as a plastic bags for each time another groping like 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.239
 it all 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.240
 separate and bags should not be useful at all, some tournaments of course 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.640
 is going to be in January as I use says not to complain at all 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.610
 it actually has pretty simple 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.200
 and yes that means so I hope that I am not going to be anything like nine out of nine 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.330
 a black skinny for ten years and it is no surprise that registration is taking place 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 and dove gray pants 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 and very sometimes really just make a blue jeans color is because I get you 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.210
 a black goodbye that's just my thing 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.670
 I can very emotionally rocket that with all that is it would just be real 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 October television series and films if someone gets there then I also want quickly 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.609
 can drive 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.369
 but not really there is from the ikea that are just as good to do there in terms of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.620
 price and the meetings he is really wondering how criminal 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.790
 and in the summer that is just an apple and a whole season of illness 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.810
 and to pick up the opportunity 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.479
 on the one hand sp states that the respondents term strongly 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.579
 on the other hand i have the impression that one has here 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.010
 a line already needed that they did at the time 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.369
 ds put forward the year with which I already very much 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.769
 also good to see those two kind of music styles 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.039
 and if they cease to take it 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.259
 but i am stronger than hoped 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:19.389
 separate that I ask for credit with the contribution that banks make 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.459
 he didn't have the dullest weekend in that color 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.899
 but still the tide is in my opinion 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:29.329
 at my house and calves from chili and he has been out of Mijdrecht for 16 years 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.069
 enormously spicy yet and he's really used to it 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.469
 my darling time 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.919
 In addition, a few have been addressed and what is the perfect aex is that 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.709
 answer questions here 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.090
 arena deck xx ask what is your sailing 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.650
 we hope to eventually see accommodation that is natural and will soon see the line 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.810
 his lequesne church street 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.259
 what do you actually think is the end of the herb barrel 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:57.949
 Americans actually eat from his place to be fumigated or traded 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.189
 pronounced 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.840
 that was too late that ssr own say in extreme gecko 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:08.809
 and the connection beesd from the spice barrel and said I say their from top lawyer 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.829
 and I did not really have the time to get those questions 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.779
 Imagine choosing from a hundred free pirnie can be 2 tb yourself 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.809
 Celler was pinched by email 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.639
 but of those not but I am really going to even imagine that the group 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.079
 But he experienced that many more nice things to postpone I would be the first 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.139
 requesting commitments that the official that makes it has has that 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.099
 maybe only talk negative effects and think a lot of people 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.019
 just don't know he speaks for nothing 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.059
 arcadis also started four years ago with a blog as a sponsor of 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:43.839
 digital house diary 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.619
 abroad for some time 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:51.479
 and at that time he just told a blog that a problem had begun 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.549
 and thereby add message 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.869
 and thirdly with Germany in December 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:02.689
 what is going on with me and bulgaria 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.699
 and that of the fun so we decided to 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.259
 after a bizarre story you had to start doubling there 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.639
 and from Asia have started weakly with and and another label that can keep 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.620
 and that was chosen because she can't come over and then only 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.810
 from two b 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.759
 this time chosen not just really liked 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.749
 typical and you must limit it 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:30.069
 but while doing something doubled to it 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.519
 thierry siquet ps mh that is a seat when we are forgotten 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.570
 but over the years, mourning days may have been different 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.819
 more convenient 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.129
 also indicate that they are known for another hour year if this is not the comic series m 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.340
 yes that is really very large than assumed from a roll of akzo known 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.020
 state 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.330

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.650
 spokeswoman has actually started it 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.499
 hence an attacker and such is being held 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:04.619
 requested in July if you could choose a color that you would like for the rest of you 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.610

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.159

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.320

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.110
 mighty key question if you offered to live an album in a basement 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.819
 somewhere in a hotel 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.319

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.499
 brought home 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:03.180
