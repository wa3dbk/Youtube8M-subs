don't like to flat iron it myself

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.770 
because I won't get it that straight so
I<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.640> feel<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:12.060> putting<00:02:12.360> heat<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.750> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.809 
I just feel like I'm putting heat in it
for<00:02:13.080> nothing<00:02:13.440> now<00:02:13.860> maintaining<00:02:14.099> my<00:02:14.580> hair

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
for nothing now maintaining my hair

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.420 
for nothing now maintaining my hair
whenever<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.269> do<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.870> blown<00:02:16.410> out<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.890> just

basically i'm going to get my sewing
done<00:03:36.720> today<00:03:36.959> which<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.319> my<00:03:37.620> protective<00:03:38.130> style

so<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.510> goes<00:03:39.690> along<00:03:39.870> with<00:03:40.049> my<00:03:40.200> philosophy<00:03:40.799> of

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
so it goes along with my philosophy of

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.589 
so it goes along with my philosophy of
just<00:03:41.190> leaving<00:03:41.370> your<00:03:41.579> hair<00:03:41.730> alone<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.329> it

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
just leaving your hair alone and it

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.180 
just leaving your hair alone and it
definitely<00:03:42.810> grows<00:03:43.290> whenever<00:03:43.859> you<00:03:44.040> are

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
definitely grows whenever you are

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.490 
definitely grows whenever you are
natural<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.849> best<00:03:45.150> hair<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.660> get<00:03:45.900> typically

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
natural the best hair to get typically

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.370 
natural the best hair to get typically
for<00:03:46.709> sewing<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.459> Brazilian<00:03:48.299> or<00:03:48.510> peruvian<00:03:48.930> hair

for sewing is Brazilian or peruvian hair

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.520 
for sewing is Brazilian or peruvian hair
because<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.069> matches<00:03:50.430> more<00:03:50.970> with<00:03:51.239> life

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
because it matches more with life

other video I do still have the heat
damage<00:04:09.239> but<00:04:09.450> what<00:04:09.569> I've<00:04:09.720> noticed<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.349> a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
damage but what I've noticed is that a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.589 
damage but what I've noticed is that a
lot<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:10.980> has<00:04:11.130> grown<00:04:11.400> out<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.389> thought

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
lot of it has grown out and I thought

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.830

about cutting it but it kind of
is<00:04:16.320> no<00:04:16.560> point<00:04:16.859> because<00:04:17.220> I'm<00:04:17.340> going<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.489> get<00:04:17.699> a
