 . ba sausage solo sausage to the waist naked 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.290
 . 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:25.630
 all we write we write good afternoon good afternoon 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.490
 good afternoon with you the pit bike is coming 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.369
 autumn by day becomes shorter 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.670
 we want today's story to you 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:49.570
 tell about how to extend our 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:50.980
 comrades shorter funny teenage so little 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.350
 then we need to talk about what we 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.290
 need so we need a relay 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.690
 voltage regulator 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.380
 Here is such a thing this relay performs 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.790
 voltage reduction functions i.e. 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.329
 converts voltage with lighting 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.990
 12 volt on-board generator coils 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.939
 networks further so that the lights do not shine 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.340
 when necessary when not necessary we will 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.649
 set 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.510
 the switch is such a switch 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.100
 use in our case this 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.780
 mount on the steering wheel you can use 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.440
 any other switch 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.240
 normally open contact and 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.080
 actually need the light itself 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 equipment 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.270
 these are lights 12 volts from twelve 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.280
 volt power we use such 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.010
 small daytime running lights 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.070
 our task is to be seen from the side 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.570
 you can use any other 12 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.760
 cult headlights 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.770
 well recommend using headlights on 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.920
 based on LEDs as they possess 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.540
 greater efficiency that is, they are a good light 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.700
 give even a powerful good color for 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.009
 so that the installation was of high quality and we will 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.100
 use soldering iron and shrink 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.159
 tubes I advise you to do this and 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.200
 do not twist the connections on non-sticky 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.200
 electrical tape that you took away from my grandfather 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.590
 blue kittens 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.939
 first thing we remove the elements 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.460
 plastic and buck 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.450
 we need to do this in order to 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:28.930
 connect the relay controller itself 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:37.300
 wire lighting winding like him 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:40.510
 it holds together normally and without removing 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.620
 already and so with the generator rises 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.940
 5 wires two of them are free as 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.920
 non-yellow rule 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.890
 we will use them for 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.470
 connect the wing to the regulator consider 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.610
 wiring diagram on the relay regulator and 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.820
 four wires are present as a rule 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.690
 there are green and red wires 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.240
 colored green wire is minus output 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:13.260
 red wire respectively output plus 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.800
 we connect them to the light bulb through 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.160
 switch 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.110
 breakers break the positive wire 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.540
 the next two wires in our case are they 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.180
 some very strange yellow color 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.010
 and as if you are pink these colors can 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.070
 differ these wires we connect to 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.810
 two wires going 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.910
 generators that are free and how 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.020
 the rule is they are yellow here 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.640
 polarity is not important 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.130
 we just connect them all the circuit 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.840
 very simple as we have no response 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.260
 parts of the connectors that were on the relay 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.320
 regulators and also on these two outputs 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.900
 we just cut them cleaned and 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.980
 we connect by soldering before 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.620
 wire connection 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.890
 we put on pieces of heat shrink tubing 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.820
 this will allow us to qualitatively 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.820
 to insulate the connection 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.070
 set the shield pre-fixed 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.120
 on it headlights 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.900
 put the power button off 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.970
 lights have connected everything according to the scheme we 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.030
 set daytime running lights on our 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.800
 Drift trike assembled approximately 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.669
 the lights themselves look like this 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.790
 off or regulator fixed on 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.750
 under the tank on the steering column we are now 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.750
 let's check 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.680
 everything works everything is gorgeous now we can 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.680
 Drift by night parking
