00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
this was more about having the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.759 
this was more about having the
opportunity<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.420> bring<00:03:08.690> Kevin<00:03:09.049> Jones<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.560> join

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
opportunity to bring Kevin Jones to join

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.890 
opportunity to bring Kevin Jones to join
us<00:03:09.950> than<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.400> was<00:03:10.610> about<00:03:10.760> Josh<00:03:11.090> Boone<00:03:11.360> not

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
us than it was about Josh Boone not

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.900 
us than it was about Josh Boone not
fulfilling<00:03:12.260> expectations<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.459> fact<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.760> we

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
fulfilling expectations the fact that we

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.130 
fulfilling expectations the fact that we
had<00:03:14.000> an<00:03:14.090> opportunity<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.540> bring<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.780> guy<00:03:14.930> like

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
had an opportunity to bring a guy like

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.110 
had an opportunity to bring a guy like
Kevin<00:03:15.350> Jones<00:03:15.709> who<00:03:16.190> led<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.549> big<00:03:16.700> east<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
Kevin Jones who led the big east and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.180 
Kevin Jones who led the big east and
both<00:03:17.239> scoring<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.780> rebounding<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.980> who's<00:03:19.160> a

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
both scoring and rebounding and who's a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.920 
both scoring and rebounding and who's a
really<00:03:19.549> great<00:03:19.820> character<00:03:20.329> off<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.600> floor<00:03:20.840> as

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
really great character off the floor as

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.990 
really great character off the floor as
well<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.590> think<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.340> was<00:03:22.430> an<00:03:22.489> opportunity<00:03:22.880> we

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
well I think that was an opportunity we

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.580 
well I think that was an opportunity we
couldn't<00:03:23.239> pass<00:03:23.390> up<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.140> we're<00:03:24.320> willing<00:03:24.530> to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
couldn't pass up and so we're willing to

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.819
