00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.340
 very good 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 Today I show you how to make some 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.170
 nutella cupcakes is a recipe 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.619
 quick easy and with a result 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.619
 great 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.680
 we're just going to need a sheet 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.539
 of puff pastry an egg no cloth and sugar 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 glas 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.059
 and to shape these cupcakes 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.649
 you can use a cortapastas like this one 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.649
 or just a small glass 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.350
 before starting we will light the oven to 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.399
 175 degrees and we will prepare a tray 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.399
 with baking paper 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.399
 we stretch the puff pastry sheet with 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.829
 careful not to break it we throw a little 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.590
 of icing sugar on the countertop and 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.780
 We put the dough remove paper 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.070
 that takes and we throw a little more 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.070
 icing sugar on top 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.130
 with a roller without doing much pressure 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.930
 we remove all the wrinkles for 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.930
 leave her completely ready 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.940
 ah 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.100
 we take the cortapastas and let's go 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.360
 cutting the dough trying to take advantage 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.360
 as much as possible 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.690
 once we have finished we remove the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.549
 leftover and we paired the circles every 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.070
 cake is going to be formed by two 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.040
 circles 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.170
 to take the nutella you can use a 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.970
 couple of dessert spoons or for 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 make it faster a pastry bag 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.450
 like me if you do not have a little bag of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 which we use to freeze also 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.250
 OK 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.799
 we take a couple of tablespoons of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.799
 nutella in the sleeve and cut the tip 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.359
 let's put some Nutella on 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.609
 center we will leave the other part of the 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.609
 cake with nothing to cover it 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.349
 when we have them all we beat 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.780
 the egg and with a brush we painted 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.959
 egg all the edges so that when covering 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.350
 they stick well we're just going to put a 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.480
 egg on the edges 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.420
 now we take the other part of the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.880
 cake and place it on top and with 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.960
 the fingers we press well so that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.960
 be well sealed 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.050
 we will place them in the tray that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.050
 we have prepared before 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.480
 with the egg that has left us we paint 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:24.459
 the cupcakes on top so that at 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.459
 bake them take a little color 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.730
 we put them in the oven at medium altitude 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.930
 for about 15 minutes or 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.930
 until they start to brown 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.239
 and when we have them golden brown 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:07.390
 we take out we throw them sugar glas 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.390
 over and place them on a plate 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.440
 ready here are the cupcakes of 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.540
