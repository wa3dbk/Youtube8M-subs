00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.600 
people use like some of the PVC and
stuff<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.570> my<00:01:55.659> if<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:56.140> was<00:01:56.350> this<00:01:56.890> character

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
stuff on my if I was this character

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.760 
stuff on my if I was this character
would<00:01:57.819> I<00:01:57.850> really<00:01:58.359> be<00:01:58.390> running<00:01:58.869> around<00:01:58.990> finding

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
would I really be running around finding

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.139 
would I really be running around finding
demons<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.340> monsters<00:02:00.429> and<00:02:00.700> that's<00:02:01.000> of

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
demons and monsters and that's of

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.919 
demons and monsters and that's of
material<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.590> also<00:02:03.459> when<00:02:04.329> you<00:02:04.420> take<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.780> from

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
material and also when you take it from

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.630 
material and also when you take it from
a<00:02:05.020> fashion<00:02:05.530> perspective<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:06.219> can<00:02:06.369> really

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
a fashion perspective you can really

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.850 
a fashion perspective you can really
bring<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.569> character<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.319> life<00:02:08.530> and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
bring that character to life and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.190 
bring that character to life and
actually<00:02:09.459> be<00:02:09.610> able<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.879> be<00:02:10.119> your<00:02:10.330> own<00:02:10.539> anime

actually be able to be your own anime
character<00:02:11.680> every<00:02:12.040> day<00:02:12.250> Zack<00:02:12.879> and<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.330> think<00:02:13.629> as

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
character every day Zack and I think as

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.069
