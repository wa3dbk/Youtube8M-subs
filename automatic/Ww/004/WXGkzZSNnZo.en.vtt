through our adaptive power harmonization

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.440 
through our adaptive power harmonization
so<00:01:55.950> we're<00:01:56.100> running<00:01:56.430> additional<00:01:56.909> thermals<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so we're running additional thermals in

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.539 
so we're running additional thermals in
the<00:01:57.540> bottom<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> device<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.500> really<00:01:58.799> keeps

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the bottom of the device it really keeps

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.819 
the bottom of the device it really keeps
it<00:01:59.759> cool<00:01:59.969> keeps<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.570> quiet<00:02:00.719> keeps<00:02:01.439> running

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it cool keeps it quiet keeps running

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.520 
it cool keeps it quiet keeps running
powerfully<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.810> let<00:02:03.930> me<00:02:04.020> show<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.229> one

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
powerfully and so let me show you one

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.459 
powerfully and so let me show you one
more<00:02:04.590> time<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.950> rip<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.399> flip<00:02:05.520> hinge

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
more time I rip and flip hinge

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.700 
more time I rip and flip hinge
disconnect<00:02:07.469> flip<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> around<00:02:09.830> back<00:02:10.830> in

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
disconnect flip it around back in

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.920 
disconnect flip it around back in
you've<00:02:12.220> got<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> full-powered<00:02:13.240> ultrabook

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
you've got a full-powered ultrabook

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.340 
you've got a full-powered ultrabook
right<00:02:14.410> here<00:02:14.590> core<00:02:14.830> i7<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.810> thinkpad<00:02:17.320> helix

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
right here core i7 this thinkpad helix

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.980 
right here core i7 this thinkpad helix
and<00:02:18.150> will<00:02:19.150> be<00:02:19.240> out<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.420> first<00:02:19.720> quarter

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
and will be out in first quarter

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.700 
and will be out in first quarter
starting<00:02:20.950> at<00:02:21.070> 1499
