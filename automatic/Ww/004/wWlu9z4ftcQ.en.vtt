00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
ping pong balls and then I'm using a pen

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.020 
ping pong balls and then I'm using a pen
to<00:01:38.670> make<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> hole<00:01:39.180> bigger<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:41.030> basically

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.310 
need to be perfect so there you have
another<00:02:43.910> hole<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:46.370> pop<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.660> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
another hole and just pop it on to the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.960 
another hole and just pop it on to the
LED<00:02:48.620> light<00:02:48.770> see<00:02:49.070> how<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.340> likes<00:02:49.550> slides<00:02:49.820> around

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
LED light see how it likes slides around

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.400 
LED light see how it likes slides around
like<00:02:50.210> that<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.420> don't<00:02:50.630> want<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.050> do<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.200> so

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
like that I don't want it to do that so

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.960 
like that I don't want it to do that so
that's<00:02:51.590> what<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.890> where<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.580> hot<00:02:52.730> glue<00:02:52.940> gun

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
that's what the where the hot glue gun

00:02:52.970 --> 00:04:03.420 
that's what the where the hot glue gun
comes<00:02:53.420> in

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.360 

okay<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.669> finally<00:04:05.150> finished<00:04:06.010> all<00:04:07.010> together

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
okay so I finally finished all together

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.360 
okay so I finally finished all together
the<00:04:07.819> poking<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.870> stretching<00:04:09.769> of<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.040> hole

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
the poking and stretching of the hole

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.970 
the poking and stretching of the hole
that<00:04:11.299> sounds<00:04:11.659> really<00:04:11.810> weird<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.680> took<00:04:12.829> me

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
that sounds really weird that took me

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.949 
that sounds really weird that took me
about<00:04:13.129> like<00:04:13.340> 30<00:04:13.579> minutes<00:04:13.819> or<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.480> feel<00:04:14.840> like

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
about like 30 minutes or so I feel like

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.680 
about like 30 minutes or so I feel like
this<00:04:15.109> was<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.290> lot<00:04:15.500> more<00:04:15.709> than<00:04:15.859> 100<00:04:16.510> I'm<00:04:17.510> not

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
have with these these lights is the B

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.210 
have with these these lights is the B
plug<00:04:30.610> because<00:04:31.610> in<00:04:32.300> America<00:04:33.199> we<00:04:33.229> have<00:04:33.590> one

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
plug because in America we have one

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.760 
plug because in America we have one
that's<00:04:34.430> small<00:04:34.940> like<00:04:35.150> this<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.840> then<00:04:36.650> the

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
that's small like this and then the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.469 
that's small like this and then the
other<00:04:36.949> side<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> little<00:04:37.699> bit<00:04:37.909> wider<00:04:38.120> but

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
other side is a little bit wider but

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.210 
other side is a little bit wider but
this<00:04:38.630> one<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:38.900> just<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.199> same<00:04:39.440> size<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:40.099> it

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
this one is just the same size so it

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.279 
this one is just the same size so it
just<00:04:40.400> kind<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.639> slides<00:04:40.909> slides<00:04:41.780> out<00:04:41.960> of<00:04:41.990> my

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
just kind of slides slides out of my

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.339 
just kind of slides slides out of my
outlet<00:04:42.860> easily<00:04:43.639> but<00:04:44.000> that's<00:04:44.840> not<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.169> big<00:04:45.320> of

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
outlet easily but that's not that big of

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.649 
outlet easily but that's not that big of
a<00:04:45.470> deal<00:04:45.620> this<00:04:45.680> did<00:04:46.099> ship<00:04:46.310> from<00:04:46.520> from<00:04:47.150> China<00:04:47.389> so

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:47.659 
a deal this did ship from from China so

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.200 
a deal this did ship from from China so
I<00:04:48.490> guess<00:04:49.490> they're<00:04:49.669> just<00:04:49.699> shipping<00:04:50.120> it

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
I guess they're just shipping it

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.339 
I guess they're just shipping it
internationally<00:04:50.750> they<00:04:50.840> don't<00:04:51.020> know<00:04:51.110> this

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
internationally they don't know this

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.320 
internationally they don't know this
fits<00:04:51.590> into<00:04:51.770> everything<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.280> know<00:04:52.430> but<00:04:53.180> um

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
fits into everything you know but um

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.790 
fits into everything you know but um
let's<00:04:53.659> I'm<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.080> going<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.229> test<00:04:54.409> it<00:04:54.620> make

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
let's I'm just going to test it make

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.360 
let's I'm just going to test it make
sure<00:04:54.860> everything<00:04:55.430> is<00:04:55.990> has<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.159> ping-pong<00:04:58.159> ball

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
sure everything is has a ping-pong ball

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.450 
sure everything is has a ping-pong ball
now<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.419> can<00:04:59.780> either<00:05:00.080> leave<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.190> at<00:05:01.310> this

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
now you can either leave it at this

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.279 
now you can either leave it at this
point<00:05:01.699> or<00:05:02.409> just<00:05:04.510> leave<00:05:05.510> it<00:05:05.570> at<00:05:05.659> this<00:05:05.750> point<00:05:05.990> or

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
point or just leave it at this point or

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.540 
point or just leave it at this point or
you<00:05:06.710> can<00:05:06.889> do<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.099> next<00:05:07.340> step<00:05:07.520> because<00:05:07.759> this<00:05:08.210> is

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
you can do the next step because this is

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.999 
you can do the next step because this is
right<00:05:10.550> now<00:05:10.729> they<00:05:11.289> some<00:05:12.289> of<00:05:12.320> them<00:05:12.500> are<00:05:12.620> secure

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
but some of them could possibly fall off
