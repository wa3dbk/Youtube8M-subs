to wrap the excess wire around eight to
ten<00:01:53.240> times<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:53.959> then<00:01:54.709> I'll<00:01:54.979> cut<00:01:55.310> off<00:01:55.459> the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
ten times and then I'll cut off the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.199 
ten times and then I'll cut off the
excess<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.750> make<00:01:57.319> sure<00:01:57.349> to<00:01:57.950> push<00:01:58.220> down<00:01:58.250> any<00:01:58.939> of

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
going to do is spread the loops apart to

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.680 
going to do is spread the loops apart to
create<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.680> ring<00:02:16.519> or<00:02:16.819> finger<00:02:17.480> armor<00:02:19.630> what<00:02:20.630> do
