00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello again means to another pokemon 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.660
 counter and good can see that the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.310
 pokemon that we're going to trust the one 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.470
 let's stop this time it will be 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.090
 nothing more and nothing less than a 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.400
 pokémon already quite old in the truth 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.110
 of fourth generation and such many are 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.930
 They wonder why we will try 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.030
 copy a pokemon already very old not 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.030
 it would be better with what the new ones will do in 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.550
 certain point if at a certain point no longer 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.960
 that garzón although it is a pokémon that 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.570
 has seen energy do with each generation 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.460
 a little more is a pokémon that without 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.370
 But they are always looking for the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.500
 way to keep reusing cover 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.770
 his weaknesses of making him a 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.329
 true attack machine and always 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.100
 they found a way to get him out 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.260
 even more profit though each generation 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.239
 do not energize a bit more even if you have 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.100
 dragon life even if you have four play 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.140
 weakness to type of ice and although now 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.940
 be a new fairy type weakness 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.590
 they always find the way to 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.020
 get the most out of this 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.420
 pokemon so it's a pokémon that although 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.520
 be very old is still one of the most 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.890
 used and that deserves a pokémon 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.140
 counter 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.010
 and good, we start by analyzing this 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.440
 pokemon which is a dragon type pokémon 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.960
 4th generation land is highlighted by 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.030
 have a good speed and apart a 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.950
 good physical attack 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.479
 so it's a very careful pokémon 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.710
 that now we are going to see three ways 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.740
 effective to stop it 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.360
 ok here we have three pokemon two of 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.270
 they who won a lot against 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.760
 garzon to old generations 1 that 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 it was quite known that this album is 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.080
 snow usually garzon stands out 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.270
 forever find the way to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.729
 stop what would stop him for 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.460
 example if it's weak against ice type 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.100
 they put the fence so that it would resist 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.899
 more attacks now that he was weak 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.490
 against the fairy- type pokemon you 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.960
 started to use with iron head 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.960
 to stop them 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
 now that if it's dragon type you're 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.470
 company used with insurance 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.030
 ability to increase the attack and 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.400
 be able to charge the other dragons of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 just one hit so as you can see 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.780
 garzon is a pokémon that although it has 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.670
 many weaknesses are always 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.020
 find a way to get more out of it 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.510
 profit so that's why it's a 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.280
 incredible pokémon to which obviously 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 I'm sure all of those who 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560
 they are listening to this video and watching it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.209
 have ever used it or have it 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.310
 wanted to use or have used it 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.320
 against you and well now let's see 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.860
 Three effective ways to stop Garzón 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.500
 first of all we have something more nou 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.730
 pokemon already quite old I also think 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.110
 which is fourth generation if I do not 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.270
 wrong type and the or plant 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.160
 and good because this pokemon and because in 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.010
 another ice-type pokemon because 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.150
 as I said at the beginning although 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.570
 I would hit with a 4 I attack with a 20 and 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.520
 would lower it a total of 200% doing 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.440
 the calculation of damage 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.760
 Garzón, as I mentioned, is usually seen 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.290
 fence that decreases to have attenuates the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.910
 ice type attacks so if 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.709
 we use because another type pokemon 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.900
 ice we are sure that with this fence 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.310
 Garching will be able to resist and we will 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.930
 to be able to attack with a type attack 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.110
 fire since you can also put it 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 fang fire which would destroy us 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.050
 then because I do more not because everyone 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.630
 the ice type pokemon that can 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.250
 find garzon 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.510
 masnou both would be the best since 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.700
 has defenses at a certain point 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.690
 considerable in which they would allow 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.920
 attack an earthquake without any problem 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.660
 Dragon claw 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.760
 even though he has weakness for 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.380
 four to fire type and hook can 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.960
 learn fang fire remember that 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.150
 has no stuff 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.850
 although it would be 4 perfective but so 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.770
 regular is not usually seen so 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.450
 bombs no thanks your defenses would be the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.790
 best of ice type pokemon that what 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.970
 could tell now let's talk about the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.280
 second that would be tough x because everything x 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.580
 because remembering the types of garzon 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.630
 that are land and dragon and types of 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.740
 tough x that would be flying and already gives everything 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.450
 x is immune to both things that 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.890
 the two types of garzon so the two 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.590
 only things with which we garzon 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.540
 could hit by staff we would be immune 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.880
 which is fine but as I said 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.620
 It has been started for a long time 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.170
 see garzon with iron head for 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.440
 entrust all the fairy type pokemon 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.700
 that used to be super effective 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.020
 then with a head attack from 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.750
 iron, which is also what is usually 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.060
 see or sharp rock could hit you super 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.680
 effective with something other than state 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.780
 remember that Garzón still has a 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.340
 very good attack and head of iron and 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.030
 sharp rocks are the movements that 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.650
 however you are very much garzón 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.050
 it would be like so to say it is you 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.009
 basic that you could see so 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.139
 we can 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.300
 and whoever we meet is going to 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.430
 have and will have what to stop 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.320
 this top x 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.970
 so in a way although all that 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.340
 I wanted a great pokemon and have immunity 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.350
 to these attacks it still has that 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.090
 small disadvantage against garzon 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.070
 and good now let 's talk about the last 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.250
 pokemon the pokemon that par excellence 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.280
 will trust you still garzón equally 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.680
 if it is a one against one it has nothing 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.220
 to do gar sum in the field against 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.810
 to summers well as I commented though 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.370
 assume well only would have the 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.320
 immunity from being fairy type against 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.300
 dragon type attacks and not type 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.389
 land as it has tough x not us 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.250
 could hit super effective attacks 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.160
 steel type apart from not coming 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.560
 with staff and touch kisses also of type 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.750
 water which is resistant against 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.410
 steel would be a neutral damage that apart 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.479
 it's not very effective so how can you see and 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.800
 apart also those of fang fire and 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.500
 anything else that comes to him 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.110
 put or you can see them to see 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.419
 submerge the quarry assume the stop 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.160
 so somerville apart from being kind 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.720
 fairies be immune to dragon type be 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.759
 resistant to everything else that can 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.889
 throw good at a certain point be neutral 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.860
 but just as well hold it well and 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:05.410
 have a separate carantoña playground that 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.180
 would hit super effective making him think that 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.970
 one that I do not mistake to anoint 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.280
 chop we can equally well put a 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.620
 drum what is here this pokemon 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.050
 outside 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.389
 I do not know something like what legislation would 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.310
 to flee so therefore the best 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.520
 counter that I see him for garzon is 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.990
 nothing more and nothing less than his environment and 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.340
 in this body that mont counter can 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.250
 see that I showed you three ways 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.560
 effective to have this one garzon that is 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.880
 a very good pokémon the truth that 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.220
 It deserves that some day we make a video 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.540
 special but good for the moment I think 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.130
 that this would be all thanks for this 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.660
 video I hope you liked it and if 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.419
 they liked remember they can give like 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.770
 comment subscribe and thanks for that 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.750
 this video also know that if 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.100
 you have some counter for garzon 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.740
 and that they want to leave in the section of 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.810
 comments can do it equally 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.699
 well and we will go back feeding 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.419
 all thanks for watching this video up 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.840
 the next 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.840
 goodbye
