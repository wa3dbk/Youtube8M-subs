so<00:00:00.480> what<00:00:00.599> we<00:00:00.780> have<00:00:00.989> right<00:00:01.230> now<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> window

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
so what we have right now is a window

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.919 
so what we have right now is a window
based<00:00:02.280> applications<00:00:02.460> so<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.510> window<00:00:03.780> base

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
based applications so it's a window base

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.680 
based applications so it's a window base
template<00:00:04.440> with<00:00:05.220> all<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.759> files<00:00:06.150> that<00:00:06.359> are

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
template with all the files that are

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.299 
template with all the files that are
there<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.230> look<00:00:07.379> at<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> files<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> while

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
there we look at the files in a while

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.120 
there we look at the files in a while
let's<00:00:08.670> look<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:08.970> Xcode<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.630> little<00:00:10.230> bit<00:00:10.349> more<00:00:10.620> um

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
let's look at Xcode a little bit more um

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.419 
let's look at Xcode a little bit more um
so<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.880> we<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.799> left<00:00:13.950> side<00:00:14.219> we

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
so what we have is on the left side we

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.980 
so what we have is on the left side we
have<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.639> run<00:00:14.880> button<00:00:15.179> if<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.450> look<00:00:15.630> at<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.780> run

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
have a run button if you look at the run

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.290 
have a run button if you look at the run
button<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.190> run<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.609> have<00:00:17.850> not<00:00:18.060> changed

enlarge<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:53.009> working<00:01:53.399> area<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.540> by<00:01:55.110> removing

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
enlarge your working area so by removing

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
enlarge your working area so by removing
all<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:56.640> views<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.030> are<00:01:57.090> there

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
all the different views that are there

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.990 
all the different views that are there
all<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.259> all<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.469> views<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.159> here

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
all you can get all the views in in here

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.230 
all you can get all the views in in here
and<00:02:00.380> work<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.590> them<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.460> there's<00:02:02.759> views<00:02:03.000> on

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and work with them so there's views on

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.039 
and work with them so there's views on
all<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.840> sides<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.860> i<00:02:04.920> normally<00:02:05.369> prefer<00:02:05.579> using

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
all the sides so i normally prefer using

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.050 
all the sides so i normally prefer using
the<00:02:07.049> entire<00:02:07.350> space<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.979> i<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> entire

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the entire space so i can see the entire

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.330 
the entire space so i can see the entire
code<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.959> i'll<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.349> using<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:11.069> just

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
code and i'll be using it this way just

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
code and i'll be using it this way just
to<00:02:11.430> switch<00:02:11.819> between<00:02:12.030> files<00:02:12.569> i'll<00:02:12.810> use<00:02:12.989> this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to switch between files i'll use this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.370 
to switch between files i'll use this
but<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.460> select<00:02:14.820> different<00:02:15.540> files<00:02:16.050> as

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
but I can just select different files as

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.680 
but I can just select different files as
in<00:02:17.130> when<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.430> required<00:02:17.700> next<00:02:18.450> thing<00:02:18.600> is

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
in when it's required next thing is

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.740 
in when it's required next thing is
organizer<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.700> organizer<00:02:21.090> has<00:02:21.450> is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
organizer so what this organizer has is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.100 
organizer so what this organizer has is
if<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.290> currently<00:02:22.710> selected<00:02:24.110> documentation

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
if the currently selected documentation

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.110 
if the currently selected documentation
file<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.620> has<00:02:25.890> vast<00:02:26.520> amount<00:02:26.970> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
file so it has vast amount of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.960 
file so it has vast amount of
documentation<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.680> iOS<00:02:29.100> three<00:02:29.550> library

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
documentation and that iOS three library

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.280 
documentation and that iOS three library
is<00:02:30.770> documented<00:02:31.770> inside<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.610> always<00:02:33.450> 4.3

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.490 
is documented inside I always 4.3
library<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.680> documented<00:02:35.210> inside<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.080> you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
library is documented inside this so you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.670 
library is documented inside this so you
can<00:02:37.710> get<00:02:37.920> any<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:39.240> everything<00:02:39.570> about<00:02:40.020> export

iphones that are connected to that have

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.310 
iphones that are connected to that have
been<00:03:08.670> used<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.420> particular<00:03:09.810> computer

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
been used in this particular computer

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.790 
been used in this particular computer
for<00:03:11.130> program<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.660> that's<00:03:12.900> organizer<00:03:13.410> let's

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
for program so that's organizer let's

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.620 
for program so that's organizer let's
get<00:03:14.040> out<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.250> let's<00:03:15.000> see<00:03:15.150> what<00:03:15.270> else<00:03:15.300> we<00:03:15.600> have

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
get out and let's see what else we have

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.080 
get out and let's see what else we have
so<00:03:16.470> at<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.650> bottom<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.100> have<00:03:17.130> file<00:03:17.519> structure

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
so at the bottom we have file structure

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.240 
so at the bottom we have file structure
we<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.690> different<00:03:19.140> tabs<00:03:19.560> here<00:03:19.920> where<00:03:20.190> you

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
we have different tabs here where you

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.880 
we have different tabs here where you
can<00:03:20.370> see<00:03:20.430> warnings<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.840> see<00:03:21.989> threads<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.680> can

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
can see warnings can see threads you can

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.590 
can see warnings can see threads you can
see<00:03:23.070> breakpoint<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.090> what's<00:03:24.300> going

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
see breakpoint you can see what's going

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.009 
see breakpoint you can see what's going
on<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:27.000> first<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.810> file

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
on and this the first one is the file

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.930 
on and this the first one is the file
structure<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.489> does<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.730> file

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
structure so what does the file

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.120 
structure so what does the file
structure<00:03:30.390> show<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.720> shows<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.290> project<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:32.010> I

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
structure show it shows the project if I

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.520 
structure show it shows the project if I
right<00:03:32.310> click<00:03:32.340> show<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.090> finder<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.989> see<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
right click show in finder I can see the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.250 
right click show in finder I can see the
project<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:36.090> project<00:03:36.120> folder<00:03:36.930> where<00:03:37.140> it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
project and the project folder where it

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.290 
project and the project folder where it
has<00:03:37.410> rest<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.860> files<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
has rest of the files you will see the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.240 
has rest of the files you will see the
organization<00:03:39.930> over<00:03:40.140> here<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.590> not<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.980> same

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
organization over here is not the same

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.710 
organization over here is not the same
as<00:03:41.310> here<00:03:41.760> because<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:43.440> lets<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:45.120> xcode

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
as here because this lets you this xcode

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.539 
as here because this lets you this xcode
organizes<00:03:46.230> files<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.040> better<00:03:47.220> way

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
organizes files for you in a better way

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.280 
organizes files for you in a better way
so<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.330> arrange<00:03:48.600> them<00:03:48.810> according<00:03:49.200> to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
so you can arrange them according to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.380 
so you can arrange them according to
your<00:03:49.380> preferences<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.519> create<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.030> new

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
your preferences like I can create a new

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.250 
your preferences like I can create a new
group<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:52.459> call<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.670> say<00:03:54.950> main<00:03:55.950> files<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:58.110> I

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
group and call it say main files and I

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.520 
group and call it say main files and I
can<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.769> copy<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.340> paste<00:03:59.549> this<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.350> it

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
can just copy and paste this so this it

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.890 
can just copy and paste this so this it
will<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.890> create<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.280> folder<00:04:02.850> here<00:04:03.239> with<00:04:03.660> the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
will not create a folder here with the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.320 
will not create a folder here with the
name<00:04:04.049> my<00:04:04.260> main<00:04:04.560> files<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:05.100> just<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:06.090> for

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
name my main files it just just for

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.120 
name my main files it just just for
representation<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:07.350> Forgan<00:04:07.709> izing<00:04:08.010> your

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
representation just Forgan izing your

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.650 
representation just Forgan izing your
code<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:08.820> that's<00:04:09.060> why<00:04:09.390> this<00:04:09.450> gives<00:04:10.049> here<00:04:10.290> and

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
code so that's why this gives here and

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.759 
code so that's why this gives here and
there<00:04:12.660> are<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> bunch<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:13.019> different<00:04:13.410> folders

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
there are a bunch of different folders

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.979 
there are a bunch of different folders
here<00:04:13.799> which<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.280> don't<00:04:14.430> see<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:14.850> your<00:04:15.060> actual

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
here which you don't see in your actual

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.289 
here which you don't see in your actual
project<00:04:16.380> let's<00:04:16.620> go<00:04:16.979> ahead<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.459> see<00:04:17.669> what<00:04:18.030> they

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
project let's go ahead and see what they

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.170 
project let's go ahead and see what they
are<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:19.169> then<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> application<00:04:20.040> runs<00:04:20.669> first

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
are so then the application runs first

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.600 
are so then the application runs first
okay<00:04:21.900> let's<00:04:22.049> look<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.320> from<00:04:22.560> bottom<00:04:22.979> so

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
okay let's look it from bottom so

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.490 
okay let's look it from bottom so
products<00:04:24.000> products<00:04:24.450> has<00:04:24.720> hello<00:04:25.020> world<00:04:25.320> app

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
one of the one that I use quite often is

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.129 
one of the one that I use quite often is
it's<00:05:37.229> called<00:05:37.729> I'll<00:05:38.729> just<00:05:39.030> say<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.419> draw<00:05:39.780> and

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
it's called I'll just say a draw and

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.399 
it's called I'll just say a draw and
inside<00:05:40.889> I<00:05:40.919> dro<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.370> can<00:05:41.669> just<00:05:41.880> say<00:05:43.820> say<00:05:44.820> icon

inside I dro I can just say say icon

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.010 
inside I dro I can just say say icon
already<00:05:46.409> includes<00:05:46.800> close<00:05:47.190> effect<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:48.020> it

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
already includes close effect so it

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.990 
already includes close effect so it
doesn't<00:05:49.380> add<00:05:49.590> that<00:05:49.860> gloss<00:05:50.159> effect<00:05:50.550> if<00:05:50.669> I<00:05:50.820> say

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
let's move on so this is kind of all the

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.930 
let's move on so this is kind of all the
information<00:06:52.750> about<00:06:53.320> file<00:06:54.040> their<00:06:54.460> strings

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
information about file their strings

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.970 
information about file their strings
where<00:06:55.240> you<00:06:55.300> can<00:06:55.450> keep<00:06:55.660> some<00:06:55.810> strings<00:06:56.140> then

where you can keep some strings then
there's<00:06:57.190> hello<00:06:57.430> world<00:06:57.760> pcs<00:06:58.240> this<00:06:58.480> is<00:06:58.660> the

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
there's hello world pcs this is the

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.530 
there's hello world pcs this is the
compiled<00:06:59.440> header<00:06:59.650> file<00:07:00.010> which<00:07:00.540> complete

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
compiled header file which complete

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.120 
compiled header file which complete
compiled<00:07:01.960> some<00:07:02.140> of<00:07:02.290> the<00:07:02.380> frameworks<00:07:02.860> for<00:07:02.920> you

compiled some of the frameworks for you

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.680 
compiled some of the frameworks for you
so<00:07:03.280> it<00:07:03.400> doesn't<00:07:03.430> have<00:07:03.760> to<00:07:03.880> compile<00:07:04.240> it<00:07:04.420> again

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
so it doesn't have to compile it again

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.630 
so it doesn't have to compile it again
and<00:07:04.840> again<00:07:04.930> which<00:07:05.320> takes<00:07:05.590> time<00:07:05.920> while

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
and again which takes time while

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.780 
and again which takes time while
building<00:07:06.940> the<00:07:07.090> project<00:07:07.540> sorry
