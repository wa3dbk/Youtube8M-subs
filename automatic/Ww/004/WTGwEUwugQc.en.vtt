00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
a Colin Kapernick from last year but he

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.470 
a Colin Kapernick from last year but he
can<00:02:19.530> really<00:02:19.650> make<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> throws<00:02:20.280> his<00:02:21.060> throw<00:02:21.390> off

the<00:02:21.660> run<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.110> 83<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.680> take<00:02:22.920> advantage<00:02:23.069> of

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
the run is an 83 so take advantage of

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.070 
the run is an 83 so take advantage of
that<00:02:23.610> scramble<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.420> guy<00:02:24.600> get<00:02:24.900> him<00:02:24.990> out

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
that scramble with this guy get him out

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.380 
that scramble with this guy get him out
of<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> pocket<00:02:25.470> play<00:02:26.190> actions<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.700> 56<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.330> you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
of the pocket play actions of 56 so you

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.940 
of the pocket play actions of 56 so you
probably<00:02:27.600> want<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.870> stick<00:02:28.080> away<00:02:28.200> from<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.709> I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
probably want to stick away from that I

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.590 
probably want to stick away from that I
don't<00:02:29.520> run<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> lot<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.850> play<00:02:29.970> action<00:02:30.150> anyways

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
don't run a lot of play action anyways

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.540 
don't run a lot of play action anyways
but<00:02:30.840> that's<00:02:31.320> one<00:02:31.590> thing<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.920> he's<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.310> very

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
but that's one thing that he's not very

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.780 
but that's one thing that he's not very
good<00:02:32.700> at<00:02:33.200> but<00:02:34.200> definitely<00:02:35.010> get<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.340> guy<00:02:35.520> move

his deep is an 80 so he's got very good
accuracies<00:03:24.060> there<00:03:24.680> 75<00:03:25.680> off<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.010> run<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.489> you

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
accuracies there 75 off the run so you

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.430 
accuracies there 75 off the run so you
can<00:03:26.730> move<00:03:26.880> him<00:03:27.000> around<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.269> little<00:03:27.440> play-action

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
needs to stay a little more in the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.650 
needs to stay a little more in the
pocket<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.430> look<00:03:38.850> at<00:03:38.970> those<00:03:39.120> kind<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.480> routes

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.620 
pocket but look at those kind of routes
right<00:03:39.900> there

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
right there

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.210 
right there
number<00:03:42.630> two<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:42.959> matt<00:03:43.200> barkley<00:03:43.650> another<00:03:44.040> guy

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
number two is matt barkley another guy

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.770 
number two is matt barkley another guy
that's<00:03:44.459> not<00:03:44.610> really<00:03:45.120> high<00:03:45.299> on<00:03:45.329> speed

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
that's not really high on speed

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.990 
that's not really high on speed
interestingly<00:03:46.680> enough<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.549> actually<00:03:47.730> had<00:03:47.970> a

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
interestingly enough I actually had a

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000 
interestingly enough I actually had a
pretty<00:03:48.150> easy<00:03:48.390> time<00:03:48.630> running<00:03:49.019> with<00:03:49.140> him<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.530> you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
pretty easy time running with him so you

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.520 
pretty easy time running with him so you
might<00:03:50.220> try<00:03:51.060> playing<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.720> little<00:03:52.049> read<00:03:52.230> with<00:03:52.410> him

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
might try playing a little read with him

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.840 
might try playing a little read with him
just<00:03:52.799> every<00:03:52.980> once<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.250> while<00:03:53.370> throw<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.700> into

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
just every once in a while throw it into

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.680 
just every once in a while throw it into
throw<00:03:54.090> somebody<00:03:54.329> off

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
throw somebody off

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.009 
throw somebody off
he's<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.440> 73<00:03:55.980> overall<00:03:56.370> he<00:03:56.880> does<00:03:57.090> only<00:03:57.299> have<00:03:57.540> 65

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
he's a 73 overall he does only have 65

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.720 
he's a 73 overall he does only have 65
speed<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.650> very<00:03:58.860> low<00:03:59.130> strength<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.670> agility

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
speed and very low strength and agility

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.870 
speed and very low strength and agility
but<00:04:00.269> for<00:04:01.110> some<00:04:01.260> reason<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:02.280> sending<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.730> work

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
but for some reason it's sending to work

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.920 
but for some reason it's sending to work
a<00:04:03.030> little<00:04:03.120> better<00:04:03.299> with<00:04:03.450> him<00:04:03.690> than<00:04:03.900> with

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
a little better with him than with

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.370 
a little better with him than with

Osweiler his throw powers in 84 which is
very<00:04:07.620> solid<00:04:07.950> not<00:04:08.250> incredibly<00:04:08.670> high<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.000> very

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
very solid not incredibly high but very

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.960 
very solid not incredibly high but very
solid<00:04:09.540> his<00:04:09.930> throw<00:04:10.230> accuracy<00:04:10.829> is<00:04:10.950> an<00:04:11.070> 84<00:04:11.579> again

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
solid his throw accuracy is an 84 again

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.870 
solid his throw accuracy is an 84 again
which<00:04:12.540> again<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:13.109> pretty<00:04:13.650> high<00:04:13.950> for<00:04:13.980> for<00:04:14.579> Ricky

put him at number one but when I
actually<00:06:05.700> got<00:06:05.910> in<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.330> played<00:06:06.740> he<00:06:07.740> set<00:06:07.980> things
