attributes and a few that I actually
want<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> talk<00:00:38.969> about<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.690> firstly<00:00:40.140> 87<00:00:41.100> jump

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
want to talk about now firstly 87 jump

want to talk about now firstly 87 jump
in<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> reason<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.510> highlighting<00:00:42.809> that

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
in now the reason I'm highlighting that

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.810 
in now the reason I'm highlighting that
is<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.469> he's<00:00:43.590> also<00:00:43.860> got<00:00:44.040> 99<00:00:44.460> head<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
is because he's also got 99 head and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.220 
is because he's also got 99 head and
accuracy<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.629> reason<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.899> mention<00:00:46.200> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
accuracy and the reason I mention that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.400 
accuracy and the reason I mention that
is<00:00:46.649> because<00:00:46.890> he<00:00:47.340> stands<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.850> 6<00:00:48.239> foot<00:00:48.480> 2<00:00:48.780> says

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
is because he stands at 6 foot 2 says

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
is because he stands at 6 foot 2 says
you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.649> probably<00:00:49.860> imagine<00:00:49.980> he<00:00:50.670> wins<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> lot

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you can probably imagine he wins a lot

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
you can probably imagine he wins a lot
of<00:00:51.239> headers<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.719> he<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.199> score<00:00:52.469> them<00:00:52.680> very

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
of headers and he can score them very

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.830 
of headers and he can score them very
very<00:00:53.399> easily<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.180> person<00:00:54.539> likes<00:00:54.690> to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and when it comes to dribbling as I said

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.180 
and when it comes to dribbling as I said

not the best dribbler overall but I am a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.160 
not the best dribbler overall but I am a
decent<00:02:20.610> enough<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> team<00:02:21.450> season<00:02:21.690> card<00:02:21.960> in

decent enough for a team season card in
my<00:02:22.440> opinion<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.830> ball<00:02:22.980> control<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.340> pretty

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
my opinion is ball control is pretty

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.100 
my opinion is ball control is pretty
good<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.850> he's<00:02:24.000> fairly<00:02:24.330> hard<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.690> dispossess

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
good so he's fairly hard to dispossess
