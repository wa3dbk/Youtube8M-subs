it as strong safety and at the snap as
you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.990> come<00:01:25.140> fly<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.560> updated<00:01:25.950> gap

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
you can see we come fly an updated gap

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.539 
you can see we come fly an updated gap
that's<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.330> two-lane<00:01:27.689> rush<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
that's a two-lane rush you know and
it'll<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.970> rotate<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> two

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290

two defensive linemen come through the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
two defensive linemen come through the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
gap sometimes it'll be the one on the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.530 
gap sometimes it'll be the one on the
right<00:01:38.610> sometimes<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> left

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
doesn't really matter me as long as it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
doesn't really matter me as long as it
comes<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.399> once<00:01:44.700> again<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.240> did<00:01:45.509> was<00:01:45.540> pinch

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
comes and once again all I did was pinch

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.380 
comes and once again all I did was pinch
my<00:01:46.049> line<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.290> crash<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.799> down<00:01:46.979> call<00:01:47.759> press<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.469 
you need to zone out both of them or
zone<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.829> neither<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.640> zone<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
zone out neither just zone out one it's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.170 
zone out neither just zone out one it's
not<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.200> consistent

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
not really going to be that consistent

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.819 
not really going to be that consistent
but<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:58.189> two<00:01:59.189> men<00:01:59.430> crazy<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.939> gap

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
but as you can see two men crazy a gap

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
but as you can see two men crazy a gap
nickel<00:02:01.829> 2<00:02:01.979> 45<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.670> me<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.149> now<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> best

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
nickel 2 45 to me right now is the best

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.990 
nickel 2 45 to me right now is the best
formation<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> game<00:02:06.770> but<00:02:07.770> however<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
formation in the game but however the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.910 
formation in the game but however the
rest<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.929> rest<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> defense<00:02:10.590> I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
rest of that the rest of the defense I

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.870 
rest of that the rest of the defense I
had<00:02:11.009> built<00:02:11.220> around<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.940> said

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
had built around it like I said

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.790 
had built around it like I said
kind<00:02:13.210> of<00:02:13.270> weary<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.840> patch<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.380> coming

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
kind of weary of this patch this coming

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.380 
kind of weary of this patch this coming
so<00:02:15.630> once<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.720> patch<00:02:17.050> drops<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:17.860> my<00:02:18.760> 34<00:02:19.270> is

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
so once that patch drops if my 34 is

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.270 
so once that patch drops if my 34 is
ineffective<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.110> time<00:02:20.350> you'll<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:20.920> seeing

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
ineffective this time you'll be seeing

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.860 
ineffective this time you'll be seeing
that<00:02:21.460> soon<00:02:22.290> re<00:02:23.290> oh<00:02:23.440> oh<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.880> if<00:02:25.000> not<00:02:25.150> I'm<00:02:25.570> going

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that soon re oh oh and if not I'm going

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.230 
that soon re oh oh and if not I'm going
to<00:02:25.960> draw<00:02:26.170> I'll<00:02:26.410> do<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.980> mini-guide<00:02:27.850> on<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
to draw I'll do it a mini-guide on the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.070 
to draw I'll do it a mini-guide on the
245<00:02:29.130> formation<00:02:30.130> because<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.940> just

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
245 formation because it's just

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.080 
245 formation because it's just
ridiculous
