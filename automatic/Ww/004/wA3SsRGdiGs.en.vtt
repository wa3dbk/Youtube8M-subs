it<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.150> that's<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.720> leave<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:41.050> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
it because that's going to leave like a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.900 
it because that's going to leave like a
white<00:02:41.380> cast<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.100> just<00:02:42.250> not<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.640> look<00:02:42.790> as

the<00:02:45.310> SPF<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.000> definitely<00:02:46.570> look<00:02:46.690> into<00:02:46.810> getting

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
the SPF but definitely look into getting

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.080
