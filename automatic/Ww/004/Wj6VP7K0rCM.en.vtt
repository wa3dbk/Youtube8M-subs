00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.890
 link that has happened 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.419

 Chargers batteries melhem actions I had computer for mobile with getting 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.670
 behind 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.610
 What are you going to do with this garbage being closed down? 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.370
 The question that we manufacturer has to prepare I answer 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.870
 the only thing that is going to happen is the question of the autonomy of your father the 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.680
 devices have more functionality the abap would end up faster than the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.750
 people can barely spend a whole day 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.230

 the motorola palermo tokyo specifically can not stay 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.410
 practically with a period of four hours the battery charged 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.490
 that decreases 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.890
 tremendous autonomy of the device greatly diminishes the ease 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 you have to have your eyes on a phone you end up having to use 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.230
 nutricard a time 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.720
