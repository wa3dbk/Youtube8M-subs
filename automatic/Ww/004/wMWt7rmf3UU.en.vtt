00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.160
 inhabitant 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.789
 I think I'll have a meeting with nine 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:59.000

00:00:47.789 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.650
 thank you men 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.050
 today you have a mission you will have to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.050
 an enemy base to defeat the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 but where is that capital patience? 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 record 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.220
 Let me first say is that it is 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.850
 there is a small war in a city 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.370
 in afghanistan 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:54.660
 then it is to stay based on these 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:56.580
 enemies and destroyed them because we are 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.530
 assault team 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.979
 so we're going to get into their base 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:11.570
 first and we have to capture the leader 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:17.000
 their name is al al 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.000
 well I'll get the map, wait is what? 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:31.500
 let's be in the alpha sector then the city 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:37.380
 It's here but it 's happening in the war. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:40.560
 I mentioned here is the only way to 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.730
 to enter their base through the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.260
 gate between two towers from there to people 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.450
 have access to the base 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.650
 the base is located here is where it is 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:01.769
 happening the war where things are 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.880
 here and there is the second base where 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:09.269
 gets the type attack stuff 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:13.650
 helicopters tanks would withdraw air 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:17.940
 You go jeep here at that point. 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.250
 The city here is going to have a soldier Ryan. 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.209
 from there you take a path that leads 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.970
 up to the base 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.820
