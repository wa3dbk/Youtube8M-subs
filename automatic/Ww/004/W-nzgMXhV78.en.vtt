00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
here then the only thing separating them

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.270 
here then the only thing separating them
from<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.079> outside<00:01:44.409> is<00:01:44.619> this<00:01:44.740> piece<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:45.040> sugar

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
from the outside is this piece of sugar

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.090 
from the outside is this piece of sugar
ok<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.210> ideas<00:01:46.450> we<00:01:46.570> hang<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.930> in<00:01:47.079> inside<00:01:47.920> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
ok so the ideas we hang it in inside the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.889 
ok so the ideas we hang it in inside the
hive<00:01:48.280> ok<00:01:48.850> she's<00:01:49.149> come<00:01:49.329> from<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.539> different

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
hive ok she's come from a different

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.330 
hive ok she's come from a different
colony<00:01:50.289> than<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.500> other<00:01:50.619> B<00:01:50.829> is<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.100> they<00:01:51.189> don't

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
colony than the other B is so they don't

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.950 
colony than the other B is so they don't
recognize<00:01:51.789> her<00:01:51.909> scent<00:01:52.180> if<00:01:52.360> she<00:01:52.539> were<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:52.810> put

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
recognize her scent if she were just put

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.840 
recognize her scent if she were just put
in<00:01:52.990> with<00:01:53.170> them<00:01:53.320> they'd<00:01:53.469> kill<00:01:53.680> her<00:01:53.770> ok<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.579> this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
in with them they'd kill her ok so this

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.580 
in with them they'd kill her ok so this
way<00:01:55.030> she<00:01:55.240> hangs<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.659> there<00:01:55.810> they<00:01:56.079> get<00:01:56.229> used<00:01:56.439> to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
way she hangs in there they get used to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.649 
way she hangs in there they get used to
her<00:01:57.130> she<00:01:57.579> also<00:01:57.700> takes<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.240> their<00:01:58.450> scent

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
her she also takes on their scent

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:59.969 
her she also takes on their scent
because<00:01:58.750> they<00:01:58.930> weren't<00:01:59.229> walking<00:01:59.469> around<00:01:59.799> her
