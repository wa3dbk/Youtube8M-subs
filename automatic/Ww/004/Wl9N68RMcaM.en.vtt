exhaust with some penetrating that

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
exhaust with some penetrating that
should<00:00:25.619> hopefully<00:00:25.800> loosen<00:00:26.279> them<00:00:26.399> up<00:00:26.489> the<00:00:26.880> cars

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
should hopefully loosen them up the cars

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.999 
should hopefully loosen them up the cars
a<00:00:27.210> few<00:00:27.239> years<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.750> these<00:00:27.930> fasteners<00:00:28.500> will<00:00:28.890> be

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
a few years on these fasteners will be

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.459 
a few years on these fasteners will be
rusted<00:00:29.399> pretty<00:00:29.669> good<00:00:29.930> they<00:00:30.930> may<00:00:31.230> end<00:00:31.410> up

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:31.469 
rusted pretty good they may end up

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.229 
rusted pretty good they may end up
breaking<00:00:31.680> so<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.250> prepared<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:32.910> replace
