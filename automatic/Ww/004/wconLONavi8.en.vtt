00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello dear friends in today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 the video will be a video review on a homemade 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.719
 and motherhood rifle 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.730
 which I did a couple of years ago such 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.190
 air can be collected for short 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.710
 time span not or complex 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.960
 equipment and such a hug and to can 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.519
 compete even with expensive crossbows 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 the only negative and they charge the dollar 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.690
 since to effect a shot to me 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.440
 need to pump air and so little about 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.570
 constructions 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.379
 my air consists of a receiver 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 Clara rotary crane Well of course 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.440
 sleeping 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 of subtlety do not understand places 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.239
 internal morning 10 millimeters in 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 principle of operation such that through the valve 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 pumped air receiver for there and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.930
 stored at the time of the work 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 shots need to sharply press the trigger 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.710
 a mechanism that releases energy 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.170
 compressed air 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.479
 which goes through it pretty 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.540
 tubule 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.080
 reports throwing projectiles 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.330
 trunk movement thereby making it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.479
 and production so shot from 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 such vozdushki can shoot not only 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.210
 yourself komi my quivering and terrible 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.210
 so here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.189
 I think this is a great option for 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.869
 homemade budgetary airplanes and now 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.869
 shoot a little changed 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.229
 well that's all everyone who liked it 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.180
 video put likes write to 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.520
 comments so we want to see 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.949
 all these my videos but I'm with you 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.600
