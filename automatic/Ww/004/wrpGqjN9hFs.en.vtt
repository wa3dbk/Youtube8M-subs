00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.570
 ah 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.770
 that we can really make noise 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.750
 we are teaching we started 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.700
 climb the wide wide touches to butt to 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.100
 stop and suddenly our songs 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.230
 heal well that has always existed 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.150
 Noise and melody have always lived 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.010
 holding hands the melody is one of 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.700
 keys pop music mostly 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.860
 it is good to understand the dynamics of 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.350
 structured theme is the subject of noise 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.320
 it's an aesthetic question it 's a bit 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.809
 confused and you have to complete a 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.000
 little tube or go look for more than the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.760
 open there sometimes also makes 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.520
 Cop a more attractive fun or more 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.200
 to be different right in our case 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.420
 it's compensated because we make melodies that 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.149
 sometimes they are like very pop but when you put 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.100
 more noise us in the expository mix 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.840
 I think you can not have an idea 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.460
 clear of how my house sounds I do not know what 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.460
 have more or less recorded 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.070
 enjoy another way 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.930
 direct bustamante catch the improvement of 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.150
 one week 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.050
 we are not a group of colleagues 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.000
 happening we are being attacked 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.010
 and then when we are in studies 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.840
 when I was composing it's a something 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.520
 more an experience more in what reading 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.640
 of protection or in a way we prefer 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.010
 the studio I would like to just record 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.320
 songs make videos and make covers 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.210
 and already the director of the tier I do not like 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.790
 nothing because I do not see that I can not 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.630
 control anything I do not know how with the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.280
 mixtures 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.290
 nothing sounds to me what to me 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.720
 had to sound like we like to combine 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.620
 two in fact it's a pretty exercise 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 usual to take home or to study what 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.120
 what we do in total and bring the total 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.280
 what has been worked on in the study there is 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.190
 one thing that is that we always have the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.690
 Spanish groups that we do is not to say 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.080
 one thing in common is that some 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.259
 way we are groups that 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.400
 we went from the most traditional Spanish pop 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.290
 doing in many the sixties 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.540
 even so all this then we 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.599
 we find everything going up towards it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.599
 address
