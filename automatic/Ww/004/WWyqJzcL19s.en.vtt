00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.733
It's not brigadeiro,
but tastes like childhood.

Who invented this?

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:09.200
I don't know who invented,
but this is a Portuguese thing.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.300
Yes, cookery, confectionery
from Portugal.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.366
We were colonized by the Portuguese,
so many things from our cookery

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.733
are inspired by the Portuguese cookery.

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.866
And quindim is one of the most
popular sweets around here.

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:29.400
You will find it like this
in bakeries, markets.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.366

with this paper. It's its charm.

And you can bake it in a larger tray.
A quindão.

COMMENTS OF THE WEEK

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.966
And in the giant foods video,

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:57.433
Sophia said that in Salvador
there's a 1 kilo acaraje.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.300
It's not possible!
It's not possible!

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.633
-I believe it.
-I believe it too,

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:04.733
but I can't imagine how it
would be to hold it.

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.133
But I could eat.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:09.800
There's a saying
"I only believe when I see".

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.533
-I only believe when I eat.
-In this case, that's it.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.366
Eduardo, my namesake, said that quantity
without quality doesn't work,

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.933
but quality without quantity doesn't
help the Brazilian hunger.

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:23.533
-We are really hungry.
-That's true!

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:28.166
So he said that quality is important,
but quantity is up to whom will eat.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.366
-I agree with him.
-Me too. I like to eat a lot,

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:33.100
and with quality is even better.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.166
Duca ate almost everything.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.233
I have this habit.

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:37.733
Now, what is he going to do?

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:40.800
Pay attention to the technique.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.966
Fold it.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.300
That’s it.

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:45.900
I want another.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.333
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.633
Duca, I want to know if you
can guess today's recipe.
