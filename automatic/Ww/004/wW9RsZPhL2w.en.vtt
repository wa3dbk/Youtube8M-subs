out the ignition with a with a new one
it<00:00:18.630> came<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.199> two<00:00:19.230> extra<00:00:19.770> keys<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.580> new<00:00:20.760> keys

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
it came with two extra keys two new keys

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.620 
it came with two extra keys two new keys
but<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.380> now<00:00:23.119> secured<00:00:24.119> light<00:00:24.300> starts

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
but as you see now secured light starts

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.089 
but as you see now secured light starts
flashing<00:00:24.689> which<00:00:25.470> means<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> has<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> be

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
flashing which means it has to be

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.450 
flashing which means it has to be
programmed<00:00:26.750> in<00:00:27.750> most<00:00:28.019> cases<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.830> if

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
programmed in most cases like this if

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.339
