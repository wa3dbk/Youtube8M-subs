00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello my name is Alexei Petrov and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.150
 you look t with t in the last few 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.299
 days I used a budget smartphone 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.750
 highscreen zero since review in russia 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.369
 it costs 5990 rubles, let's see 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.840
 what can I get for this money 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.210
 external device looks very 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 presentable sharp edges monolithic 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.529
 design on the back cover only the inscription 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 highscreen and camera 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.769
 made of black polycarbonate with 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 nice texture 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.760
 on top is a micro usb port and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.950
 headphone jack 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.899
 transfer yusbi to the top of the smartphone 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.090
 always puzzled why 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.860
 for example it will be inconvenient to talk on 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 phone if it is charged 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.090
 power button designers highscreen 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.629
 left-handed volume rocker 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.090
 on the right opening the back cover we see 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.510
 1800 milliamp replaceable battery 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.780
 o'clock 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.309
 two SIM card slots and micro-sd slot 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.440
 by the way both sim cards work 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.170
 at the same time calling you 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.900
 any while speak 1 2 just 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 a fly in the ointment can only become 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.700
 The fact that the standard 3g is supported only 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.380
 one slot 4 and a half inch 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.799
 smartphone display is built on ips 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.920
 540 by 960 dot matrix 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 it's a bit for 2014 but for 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.360
 budget smartphone come off however 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.110
 such low resolution leveled 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.780
 technology 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 language solutions liquid crystal 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.630
 panel 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.490
 touch layer combined into one 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.070
 summer air gaps 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.840
 in practice this means more juicy and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.439
 contrast picture than others 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.150
 models 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.369
 but with a screen built on the base of others 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.649
 technology gadget installed

 1 gigabyte operational 4 gigabyte 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.329
 internal memory is very little 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.430
 to today's standards 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.430
 position saves the possibility of installation 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.320
 micro sd memory card 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.300
 characteristics are budget but many 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.250
 popular and not too demanding 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.830
 games like trials fusion 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.230

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.240
 plus is the usb interface support 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.640

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.980
 such as watching movies or 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.890

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.600
 note macro camera mode can 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.880
 focus on objects in two three 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.130

 smartphone is capable of standing 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.550
 note that a small battery capacity 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.590
 makes itself felt and even with such 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.080
 the screen resolution the device does not live on 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.390
