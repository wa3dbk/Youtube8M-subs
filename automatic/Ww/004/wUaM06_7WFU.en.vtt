hey<00:00:01.020> everybody<00:00:01.380> Jimbo<00:00:01.979> Jimmy<00:00:02.280> here<00:00:02.520> and<00:00:02.700> today

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hey everybody Jimbo Jimmy here and today

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.660 
hey everybody Jimbo Jimmy here and today
i'll<00:00:03.240> be<00:00:03.270> showing<00:00:03.419> you<00:00:03.750> too<00:00:04.680> neat<00:00:05.130> ways<00:00:05.339> to

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
i'll be showing you too neat ways to

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.670 
i'll be showing you too neat ways to
make<00:00:05.790> an<00:00:05.910> infinite<00:00:06.390> restaurant<00:00:06.810> loop<00:00:06.990> now

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
make an infinite restaurant loop now

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.470 
make an infinite restaurant loop now
infinite<00:00:08.040> redstone<00:00:08.460> loops<00:00:08.670> can<00:00:09.030> be<00:00:09.150> used<00:00:09.330> for

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
infinite redstone loops can be used for

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.459 
infinite redstone loops can be used for
dispensers<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.670> really<00:00:11.670> fast<00:00:11.880> Pistons<00:00:12.469> now

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
dispensers and really fast Pistons now

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.290 
dispensers and really fast Pistons now
over<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.549> i<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.150> most<00:00:16.049> known<00:00:16.379> design<00:00:16.770> and

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
over here i have a most known design and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.830 
over here i have a most known design and
i<00:00:18.560> think<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.710> kind<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.789> hard<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.660> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
i think it's kind of hard to do if you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.259 
i think it's kind of hard to do if you
don't<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> true<00:00:22.619> quick<00:00:23.519> trigger<00:00:23.880> finger

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
don't have a true quick trigger finger

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.170 
don't have a true quick trigger finger
there<00:00:24.980> now<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.369> make<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.640> you're<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
there now to make this you're going to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.710 
there now to make this you're going to
need<00:00:27.210> less<00:00:27.990> than<00:00:28.199> repeaters<00:00:28.619> redstone

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
need less than repeaters redstone

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.749 
need less than repeaters redstone
something<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> activate<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.410> current<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
something to activate the current and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.139 
something to activate the current and
yeah<00:00:33.690> that's<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.910> fast

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
yeah that's it really and really fast

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.690 
yeah that's it really and really fast
trigger<00:00:36.300> finger<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.870> right<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> you

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
trigger finger all right to do this you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.959 
trigger finger all right to do this you
sit<00:00:38.969> redstone<00:00:39.540> peter<00:00:39.930> s<00:00:40.200> 0<00:00:40.640> redstone<00:00:41.640> repeater

sit redstone peter s 0 redstone repeater

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.030 
sit redstone peter s 0 redstone repeater
diagonal<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.140> Kristen<00:00:43.680> repeater

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
diagonal to that Kristen repeater

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.029

diagonal<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.789> redstone<00:00:45.180> repeater<00:00:45.570> look<00:00:45.719> at

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
diagonal and redstone repeater look at

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.740 
diagonal and redstone repeater look at
bringing<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:47.460> shape<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:48.420> you're

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
bringing that little shape then you're

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.450 
bringing that little shape then you're
going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> put<00:00:49.829> redstone<00:00:50.039> all

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
going to have one to put redstone all

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
going to have one to put redstone all
between<00:00:51.090> these<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> set<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.989> altamax

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
between these and set that altamax

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.029 
between these and set that altamax
although<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.820> hit<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.149> spin<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
although I just hit that back spin and

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
although I just hit that back spin and
that<00:00:56.039> will<00:00:56.160> create<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.850> redstone<00:00:57.329> infinite

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that will create our redstone infinite

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920 
that will create our redstone infinite
loop<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> correctly<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.899> place<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
loop if we do it correctly now place a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020 
loop if we do it correctly now place a
block<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:02.280> don't<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.789> put<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
block or you don't have to you can put a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.690 
block or you don't have to you can put a
lever<00:01:03.180> by<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> buttons<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.580> create<00:01:05.580> an

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
lever by like a buttons and create an

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600 
lever by like a buttons and create an
activation<00:01:06.090> current<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.460> will

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
activation current like so this will

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.210 
activation current like so this will
create<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.350> now<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.710> our<00:01:10.890> infinite

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
create this now to get our infinite

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.050 
create this now to get our infinite
redstone<00:01:11.729> loop<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.170> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
redstone loop we are going to have to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.810 
redstone loop we are going to have to
this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.900> trigger<00:01:16.320> finger<00:01:16.560> part<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this is the trigger finger part it's to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.219 
this is the trigger finger part it's to
really<00:01:18.299> quickly<00:01:19.049> y<00:01:20.060> hoy<00:01:21.560> okay<00:01:22.560> Oh<00:01:23.030> quickly

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
really quickly y hoy okay Oh quickly

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.890 
really quickly y hoy okay Oh quickly
destroy<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.560> replace<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.070> redstone<00:01:26.900> really

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
destroy and replace this redstone really

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.039 
destroy and replace this redstone really
fast<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.799> yes<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.329> although

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
fast like this yes like that although

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
fast like this yes like that although
you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.740> faster<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.820> just

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you can do a lot faster I was just

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.830 
you can do a lot faster I was just
really<00:01:33.270> slow<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.850> that's<00:01:35.850> work<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.810> now

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
really slow so that's work and so now

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.480 
really slow so that's work and so now
it's<00:01:37.079> our<00:01:37.170> infinite<00:01:37.470> redsnow<00:01:37.829> loop<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.400> we

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it's our infinite redsnow loop and we

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.679 
it's our infinite redsnow loop and we
can<00:01:38.640> hook<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.909> too<00:01:39.119> many<00:01:39.210> things<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
can hook up too many things like a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.370 
can hook up too many things like a
piston<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.560> come<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.630> mom<00:01:42.630> piston<00:01:43.049> don't<00:01:43.229> want

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
piston so come on mom piston don't want

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
piston so come on mom piston don't want
to<00:01:43.470> go<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:45.390> history<00:01:46.430> for<00:01:47.430> instance<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.970> I'll

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
to go like history for instance and I'll

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.630 
to go like history for instance and I'll
go<00:01:48.270> pretty<00:01:48.450> fast

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
go pretty fast

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.690 
go pretty fast
yeah<00:01:50.500> that<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.650> stop<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.100> current<00:01:52.340> just<00:01:52.520> to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
yeah that and stop the current just to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.120 
yeah that and stop the current just to
show<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.030> or<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:54.710> press<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.950> button

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
show it or you can press the button

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.300 
show it or you can press the button
again<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.370> get<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.880> current<00:01:56.180> flowing<00:01:56.390> again

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
again to get the current flowing again

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.719 
again to get the current flowing again
now<00:01:58.310> over<00:01:59.300> here<00:01:59.630> I<00:02:00.200> haven't<00:02:01.130> never<00:02:01.340> designed

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
now over here I haven't never designed

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.630 
now over here I haven't never designed
which<00:02:02.240> will<00:02:02.450> create<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:03.020> really<00:02:03.860> fast<00:02:04.159> current

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
which will create a really fast current

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.330 
which will create a really fast current
like<00:02:05.540> uber<00:02:06.259> fast<00:02:06.500> current<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.990> well

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
like uber fast current that well

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.680 
like uber fast current that well
sometimes<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.490> burns<00:02:10.670> out<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.120> just<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.540> to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
sometimes it burns out you just have to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.250 
sometimes it burns out you just have to
play<00:02:12.080> with<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:13.430> right<00:02:13.720> let's<00:02:14.720> I'll<00:02:15.020> show
