00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.830
 how about welcome friends let's see 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.100
 quickly in this video how with the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.930
 samsung galaxy s 4 do a test of the 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.560
 screen to see if it has some 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.410
 fissures let's say on the sides by the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.259
 upper and lateral parts and that with 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.360
 it is not working well what it is 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.250
 the touch when we play and other things 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.259
 we are going to do this through the menu 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.130
 of test that we have already seen but that 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.440
 We are going to use 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.450
 one of the buttons especially what 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.140
 we go to the phone as if we were 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.460
 make a call 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.710
 press more 30 strict pad and here 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.720
 We are already on the menu with everything already 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 I say we have seen one to read and we have 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.399
 seen also those those sensors and now 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 what we are going to see is the 2 here is the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.050
 button this touch and with this we are going to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.690
 check let's do a test of the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.730
 screen touch screen like 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.879
 you see here we have now all this that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.880
 then meet then meet the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.549
 we have to do everything 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
 being careful not to know the good ones and not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.120
 you know nothing but we will finish the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.880
 test 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.610
 here you see it I'm here we'll finish the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.130
 test as you see today I give here a 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.440
 start or I give menu several times we do not 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.500
 reveals out how we will stop 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.070
 leave when we finish the test then 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.370
 is ending this form and this way 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.930
 what do we get out of this as you see 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.400
 and do a screen check 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.229
 from the touch of the screen that does not have 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.630
 no problem of some hit or something 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.090
 I know that falling out of some 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.430
 hit and that has suffered some damage the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.440
 screen and we notice that we press and do not 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.780
 then it works with this mode touch 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.580
 we do the test and if it works 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.220
 correctly as we have seen that we have 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.890
 done all the figures as there will be 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.050
 passed and we will have the screen then without 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.560
 no kind of problem and good friends 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.260

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.720
