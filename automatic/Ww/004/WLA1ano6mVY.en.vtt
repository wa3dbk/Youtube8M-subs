00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.020
 we are already in the olympic games and 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.570
 leader in sports they offer you Thursday 26 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.280
 July the Olympic guide a supplement 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.139
 of collection with the records the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.160
 stories and projections the athletes 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.180
 Venezuelans you can not miss 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.279
 and football is often unpredictable 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.340
 yes it is true that the selection is 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.349
 working very well these years and the 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.599
 numbers are there and the titles have been 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.849
 I got all I want is that 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.699
 the selection continue working this way 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.350
 way with the environment that there is and that 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.629
 final will continue to win as they were 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.490
 we are lucky that we have 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.160
 coincided 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.530
 very good-natured people very good 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.150
 partners that we know each one what is 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.160
 our role within the team as 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 you comment and for the sake of the selection 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.950
 we work every coach has his 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.890
 way to be your way of working your 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.240
 own character and his own philosophy yes 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.610
 it is true that tito has passed many 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.320
 years with next to pepe and surely 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.770
 because it keeps a bit the line of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.570
 thinking about soccer of al 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.730
 football you want to practice but good 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.640
 let's see that the work system 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.590
 employs and will surely be very accepted and 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.050
 the first day that I had I was of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.240
 ball boy at the stadium in the camp 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.940
 nou and I saw oliver kahn in the goal and 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.890
 when I saw the goalie because a 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.540
 I said that is my lifelong idol 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.400
 I had that image 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.260
 impacted 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.040
 I've always tried to take from the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.220
 difference 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.410
 as a person as an athlete by the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.090
 character that has always transmitted by 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.800
 what has given as a goalkeeper therefore the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.930
 reference symposium for me and it will be 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.520
 freedom I think the team should 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.160
 national to the america cup last that 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.930
 disputed he did very well very well with a 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.300
 very good or very intense football with a 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.950
 pressure very dynamic players and already 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.140
 how much when we had to suffer 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.120
 here the party I have to say with a lot 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.340
 heat was very difficult for us but 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.380
 but a nice game I think that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.240
 showed the selection in the habit that 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.650
 that has very important players and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.180
 that they will do it very well surely 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.190
 it also indicates the future by the most 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.899
 known to me is rondón not because 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.369
 it's a reference I even touched 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.830
 suffer it in the game against Malaga 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:19.570
 there 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:21.280
 and we are winning but with doña arango yo 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.930
 I would stay with always with those two 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.960
 references of Venezuelan football I think 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.580
 that have been are still for me 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.680
 very important players for this country 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.050
 but without a doubt that impressed me 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.330
 much the vinotinto selection when I could 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.590
 come here today against them 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.860
 with the man selection for me when 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.120
 I was proposed to come to port hair to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.390
 know the facilities you have created 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.510
 the mayor rafael lacava everything for the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.730
 grassroots training for me was a 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.590
 it was a huge illusion as I had it 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 raised as I have been told how is the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.860
 project everything that has been invested 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.900
 for the good of grassroots football that is so 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.260
 important for this sport and about 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.760
 everything for venezuela I think it was a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.250
 very nice project to come and meet 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.349
 therefore it was proposed to me to participate 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.069
 with a series of with a selection of 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.480
 goalkeepers of the country 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.030
 that in the end it would surely end 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.520
 learning more things from them than me 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.970
 can teach you but 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.650
 I come to have fun to try 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.840
 teach what my coaches during 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.030
 my training stage have taught me in 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.340
 professional stage and if that can 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.020
 serve them be for a future the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.080
 to be able to get some to be professional 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.590
 it's much better than 120 goalies that go 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.050
 between 11 and 17 years were chosen in 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.290
 all venezuela that for free 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.420
 will be sharing with this star 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.010
 world football 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.110
 your knowledge your simplicity your delivery 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.630
 for him because of soccer because we talked 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.810
 a while ago and who can find out 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.120
 something on the internet is going to realize that 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.450
 dictated was a person trained in that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.150
 philosophy of which you spoke is to that 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.710
 it's grassroots football where so many 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.620
 results 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.660
 have obtained by organized work and 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.970
 meticulous since when you enter with 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.370
 eight nine ten years until good that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.860
 you make your debut or those who can do it 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.500
 in the first team but it 's a machine 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.870
 to produce footballer and it's a machine 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.420
 because I know because my son too 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.150
 was there in a machine to produce 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.730
 good human beings I am delighted 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.740
 I am delighted and surely from here 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.680
 to the 25th day that ends everything much more 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.780
 why 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.330
 it's like he told the mayor to touch 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.370
 goalkeepers is what is always what one 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.440
 you want when it 's goalkeeper to work with 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.600
 they can help them in what 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.580
 can we have always been the forgotten ones 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.100
 to let us forgotten 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.750
 then of fear because 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.250
 and we do the opposite of what the 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.810
 people want to see goals then 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.150
 we try to avoid it 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.620
 is the bad thing about this flight to the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.470
 back trying to avoid them but good 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.150
 It is also pleasing to be remembered for 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.500
 example as they say in the case of iker 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.810
 what is he talking about he can get 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.820
 big gold 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.740
 it's a pride that as a goalie you talk 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.860
 of these things also because in the end 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.910
 we are part of this sport and it would be 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.910
 very good also positive
