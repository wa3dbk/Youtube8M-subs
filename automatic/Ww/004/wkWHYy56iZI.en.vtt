00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.150
 update with a new method the 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.470
 console through auto hehe and the fs of 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.890
 3 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.310
 well first thing we have to mention 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.099
 in the lounge so I put in the lawn 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.020
 where we have it installed in mine 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.230
 I have installed 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.380
 about what you see 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.560
 if you do not see 60 applications is here 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.480
 God's 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.350
 we execute him 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.309
 and we have to have activated in network 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 the option 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.660
 good who is 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.050
 valdés and the stars 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.050
 a configurator 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.780
 and the option this can be worth 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.790
 we have to have green with what I have 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.790
 me in the event that we had 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.830
 off as now we would now give you a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.720
 then later to boiled 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.890
 we select where we have our 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.750
 Launch saved point and we give ax 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.350
 an axis will not be a message of options 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.930
 saved on the route we do not want is 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 turn off the console is worth starting the one 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.960
 was started today we look at that option 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.030
 activated that's the first thing 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.480
 and here we are going to go out 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.590
 the fsb is worth 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:55.940
 having the fs of and let's do now 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:00.730
 same is to go to the pce worth going to the car hehe 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.730
 so we leave here and now we continue 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.590
 good guys we are already in the winner 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.479
 in auto jeje valero to start the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.330
 application and someone does not visit will be 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.120
 forgotten and is that the tests that I did 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.130
 when I was going to do this tutorial I 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.650
 I noticed that in some consoles when 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.650
 we use in this way did not jump 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.200
 updated voucher to correct that fault 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.860
 and for those who all try to do this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.070
 and do not make them 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.600
 before starting to update with the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.590
 we have gone from the console we left it in the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.640
 efesé of vale then in this case what 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.210
 we would do is start the dash loud 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.890
 and with the das lounge activated or has it 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.700
 started the application of doubts the only 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.010
 console then we will start to update 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.250
 several and right now throwing the dash 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.030
 lawn in my console and good 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.030
 one that 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.670
 once we start in the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.780
 lounge then we will start to update 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.640
 OK 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.680
 well here in the days let's check 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.750
 that we have the last 16 747 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.420
 once proven that we put in the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.630
 when you see here you will be studying lan and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.270
 then in you 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.910
 here will tell us that if we want to use this 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.930
 new function of use we will say that 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.220
 yes and here in this little window will tell us what 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.380
 that we just did at the beginning of 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.200
 tutorial that activating the option can be 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.010
 it's worth how we know it's activated 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.010
 we will press ok 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.680
 we must continue to see then and jump to the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.810
 administration is connecting with me 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.000
 he knows he's a jasper and he's starting 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.930
 to update 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.689
 well, good 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.690
 to the law of the phrase in two seconds the 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:56.370
 is writing in another eight seconds 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.260
 and we have been working on Saturdays the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.860
 avatars data 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.410
 and good 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.640
 the avatars are seeing them and it seems 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.640
 that everything would be installed 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.970
 and we will see that the speeding 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.010
 has been done correctly 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.380
 we will get a message saying what is 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.640
 current and this perfectly the console 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.200
 how are you seeing this process is very 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.390
 simple very very fast 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.540
 and the truth that someone who has my not 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.280
 update then do not be afraid then 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.760
 here as you see it ended up attracting the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.760
 realization 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.639
 for curious data when finished 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.159
 update the console goes off and it 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.039
 Restart alone is worth once they have been 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.560
 restarted we have the new one installed 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.060
 and the most important ones and 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.919
 avatars installed so 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.150
 because we finished this videotutorial 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.300
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.890
