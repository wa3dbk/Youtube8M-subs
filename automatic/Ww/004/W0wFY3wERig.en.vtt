00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.130
 AEA chicken beauty're talking about 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.700
 Catimba and I'm making a video today. 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.699
 different and video tutorial video lesson is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.560
 about providing what is called so much the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.289
 bixiga no 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 as you should already know some of you and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.810
 was what is appropriate for xbox 360 but 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.119
 it's not like this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.120
 You, like you, buying some 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.399
 estrus more paddle handle is also in PC 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.420
 very good microphone both in xbox and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.719
 on the pc and recover some extra pounds and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.410
 and as it had no video tutorial 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.000
 Brazilian decides to do is for the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.579
 bought whistle the team that so one of the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 Americans but is this a little 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.820
 so I'm going to show some of the cars 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.840
 here as prevention being bought and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.809
 also first to good the guy gives 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.239
 since I do not know the name of the cables 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:08.729
 type was american everything not under the names 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.860
 I only get hit print there and cut the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.890
 photo shows there to stay here has 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.080
 difficult part of my city and he bought 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 But I'll leave a photo for you too. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.130
 you do not have drive to a store and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.229
 a store that sells things 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 I can think of it as electronic 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.200
 who should know then first I know 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.140
 that you buy here pictured 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.970
 click here and in the supporter another tip is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:44.930
 centered thicker here with you 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:49.049
 Are you seeing that I had to buy 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 already the second is a little different 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.719
 the second is that a tip has 12 input 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.780
 I think the name is like this and 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.659
 input also type just showed 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.159
 which was to connect the audio sit 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.920
 and listen to these things 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.620
 so this is a hypothesis of searcy 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.670
 point which is thirds to connect the audio 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.590
 or understand in komaki will also 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.280
 have to buy this one I think 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:30.040
 that's a splitter is so you have to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:33.010
 buy also adapted for travel and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.329
 also after the culprit of all this 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.329
 it was difficult here 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.019
 People, I had to be here without 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:53.040
 want to bathe here but fan 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:53.040
 after you told me your take here 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:04:18.180
 also if you pick up your 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.180
 business 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.520
 have already been alone here right are in 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.520
 This is the story you want. 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.009
 own xbox as you are seeing 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.009
 against that cable you bought 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:45.680
 connects the lower connecting part 43 c and 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.370
 to the point that it is thicker and 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.860
 connect at the peak of the pc ready only this 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.069
 It's getting normal now you'll only have one 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.949
 A little more down but it catches 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:03.440
 normally 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:06.470
 So it's all because you did not see the 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.870
 cost tori ice making is 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.110
 explaining this and the American few 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.169

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.800

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.050

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.389

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.530

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.990
