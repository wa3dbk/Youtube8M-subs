00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello qatar to all welcome 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.130
 again to everland in today's video 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.020
 I want to talk to you about a topic that stays 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 a lot of interest for everyone and it's like 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.740
 choose a good laptop to design well 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.740
 so let's start the video 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.410
 two 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.680
 how many are wondering 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.960
 how to choose the best dish 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.150
 for design I made a category of six 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.010
 teams that in my opinion I consider 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.930
 which are the best suited to work 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.150
 design and one of will so 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.560
 let's start with the teams the first 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.440
 I recommend team is the 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.180
 inspired 15 5000 this a computer that 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.410
 comes 15 inches with a processor 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.449
 intel core i7 5500 brings 4 megabytes of cache 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.090
 and work a speed of 3 points elo 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.530
 gigahertz its ram memory is 8 gigs and 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.829
 it's from the double channel we also have 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.380
 geforce 920 nvidia video card of 4 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.750
 dedicated gigas has a sata hard drive 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.700
 of a terabyte that works 5400 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.640
 revolutions is pretty fast and a 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.160
 optical drive I decided and divide your price 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.340
 is $ 800 and that equals more or 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.780
 less to 660 euros if suddenly they have not 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.640
 seen the previous video how 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.229
 configure a pc for design can 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.970
 click here in this part of the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.310
 screen and watch the video where we teach 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.259
 how to choose components by components 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.119
 a team and assemble it for our 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.210
 own needs we continue with the 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.369
 78 lenovo 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.690
 of 17.3 inches work with a 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.430
 intel core i7 processor 4.710 hq its 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.000
 Video card is from the nvidia brand 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.310
 gtx 860 with 4 gigs dedicated only 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.890
 for the video of a ram memory of 16 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.110
 gigas a hard drive of a job that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.970
 also works at 5400 revolutions per 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.190
 minute has a battery life of 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.619
 plus or minus 5 hours the next team 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.690
 is the toshiba qosmio x 70 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.409
 Beck has a 17-inch screen 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.720
 an intel core i7 4.720 s processor 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.600
 fourth generation hq with true cobos 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.340
 2.0 has a hard drive of a job and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.710
 It has a solid state hard drive 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.769
 8 gigas it does something very very fast 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.000
 works with card technology 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:15.190
 video and it's the r 9m 265 x this one comes with 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.040
 4 gigs dedicated only for the video 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.230
 has with 16 gigas of ram and brings two 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.940
 Slots for memory expansion in addition 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.680
 something that little by now they are 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.319
 bringing is that it brings a unit of 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.320
 bluray something that makes it very comfortable and very 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.420
 versatile now its price is at 1,930 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.720
 Dollars 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.250
 at about 1600 euros the next team in 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.690
 the list is to its learned and 500 times is 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.459
 a team that comes with a screen 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.580
 15 inches an intel core i7 processor 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:51.930
 3.632 9 have internal memory of 4 gb and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.940
 a geforce gtx 650 video card 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.530
 this card is with 2 gigs 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.870
 specifically for video work 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.239
 its storage of 500 gigas and brings a 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.250
 24 gb solid state disk has 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.550
 card reader 2 in ones and within 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.150
 sd card and micro sd super ajax and lass 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.959
 between the 2,600 dollars and the 2,200 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.480
 euros a pleasant surprise is the hp z 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.049
 17 g 2 this equipment comes with a 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.290
 intel core i7 processor 4.710 m that 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.110
 comes with a 17.3-inch screen 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.069
 in led technology has a memory of 8 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.750
 gb dual channel has a hard disk of 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.940
 266 but well in solid state to what 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.260
 It makes it very comfortable and also this 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.500
 following this card staff 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.370
 video 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.680
 every 2 thousand 200 m of 2gb specifically 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.590
 dedicated to what is the video its price 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.360
 It is between 2 000 700 dollars and more or 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.340
 minus two thousand three hundred euros 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.030
 the pressure very good team coming from 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.790
 hp the next one is the macbook pro retina 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.590
 of 15 inches this equipment as it generates 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.360
 much controversy many designers 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.090
 for want to work with mac yo 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.709
 preferably I do not use anymore because I do not 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.150
 like technology or more than anything 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.430
 operating system to work what 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.110
 It's design accepts the whole family of 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.820
 adobe that is true but the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.770
 programs that we designers or 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.260
 the artists work like the autocad 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.390
 as the family of authors are not 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.760
 all still for mac then that's 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.230
 a small compatibility problem 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.760
 this macbook pro works with a 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.850
 i7 four core intel processor 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.280
 nuclei to 2.2 giga hertz has a trick 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.320
 voice that makes it reach up to 3.4 ideas 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.529
 hertz and have the cache of 6 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.019
 megas 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.459
 to 16 gigs of ram memory come 

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:38.299
 integrated and brings a hard drive 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:41.359
 256GB solid storage also 

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:44.449
 works with noise technology r9 but 

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:46.279
 works with the m 370 x that brings 2 gigas 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.879
 dedicated memory only for the 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:52.129
 video this comes with ddr5 technology 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.109
 It has output for mini displayport and it's 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.679
 native the output that brings now does not bring 

00:04:54.109 --> 00:05:01.590
 many ports and the price is between 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:05.390
 1999 dollars and a thousand 655 euros 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.850
 and now if the jewel this is the boss go 2 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.010
 15m xl this computer comes out 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.540
 competition really because then also 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.910
 which brings a very large screen of 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.940
 17 inches an intel core i7 processor 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.070
 fourth generation who works at 4.0 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.400
 gigas rights and with subway games arrives 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.220
 up to 4.5 giga hertz brings a memory 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.680
 ram of 32 gigs brings three usb ports 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.990
 it was an hdmi port and it brings two 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.410
 displayport and nothing more and nothing less than 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.940
 a nvidia quadro card at 4200 the 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.830
 Cooling system is very very 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.430
 modern and the design because although not 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.650
 competes with the sea or with the asus it is 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.270
 very robust and makes it a team of 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.890
 excellent work for everything you have 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.390
 what to see with design is not more for today 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.520
 thanks for watching this video if you liked it 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.910
 dale like to share it by putting it in your 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.860
 networks 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.110
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel and good 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.580
 see you in a next video one thing 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.440
 more if they suddenly want us to talk 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.730
 some specific design theme I do not know 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.830
 anything that comes to mind 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.750
 write it here let's make more blogs 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.430
 so they can share it and they can 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.020
 debate also about these issues 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.610
 on the website that is going to come out here in 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.320
 the bottom part will find the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.630
 blog that we published about this topic 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.980
 with comparisons with prices and with that 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.980
 kind of things so see you
