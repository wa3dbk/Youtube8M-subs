flagship I ate we're going to jump in
and<00:00:09.090> go<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.510> drive<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> here<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.219> are<00:00:11.250> inside

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
and go for a drive so here we are inside

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.990 
and go for a drive so here we are inside
the<00:00:12.030> BMW<00:00:12.509> i8<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.340> 357<00:00:14.340> brake<00:00:14.519> horsepower

the BMW i8 we have 357 brake horsepower

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.880 
the BMW i8 we have 357 brake horsepower
we've<00:00:15.450> got<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> combustion<00:00:16.109> engine<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
we've got the combustion engine and the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.179 
we've got the combustion engine and the
electric<00:00:16.980> motors<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.480> combustion<00:00:18.750> engine

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
electric motors so the combustion engine

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.090 
electric motors so the combustion engine
is<00:00:20.210> 228<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> electric<00:00:22.800> motors

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
is 228 of that and the electric motors

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.300 
is 228 of that and the electric motors
129<00:00:24.000> Nord<00:00:24.660> 60<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> 4.4<00:00:25.710> seconds<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.099> we've<00:00:26.220> got

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
129 Nord 60 to 4.4 seconds so we've got

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.179 
129 Nord 60 to 4.4 seconds so we've got
quite<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> lot<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> power<00:00:27.090> under<00:00:27.660> foot<00:00:28.349> butter

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
quite a lot of power under foot butter

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.820 
quite a lot of power under foot butter
start<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.060> start<00:00:30.570> stop<00:00:30.929> button<00:00:30.960> this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
start it up start stop button this

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.639 
start it up start stop button this
brings<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> life<00:00:32.610> very<00:00:32.910> electrically<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
brings in to life very electrically and

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.260 
brings in to life very electrically and
pop<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> into<00:00:34.920> drive<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.550> we'll<00:00:35.670> pull<00:00:35.820> away<00:00:35.910> in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
pop it into drive so we'll pull away in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
pop it into drive so we'll pull away in
the<00:00:36.780> hybrid<00:00:37.110> mode<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.530> basically<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.340> going

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the hybrid mode so basically we're going

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.889 
the hybrid mode so basically we're going
to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.579> running<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.000> electric<00:00:39.420> motors<00:00:39.719> right

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to be running on electric motors right

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.400 
to be running on electric motors right
now<00:00:40.460> which<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.270> giri<00:00:42.510> sort<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> silence

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
now which is that giri sort of silence

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.639 
now which is that giri sort of silence
with<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> sort<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> UFO<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:45.050> buzz<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
with a sort of UFO like buzz to it and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.229 
with a sort of UFO like buzz to it and
this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> sort<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> love<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:48.000> cars

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this is what I sort of love about cars

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.229 
this is what I sort of love about cars
like<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.020> cool<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.059> put

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
like this is so cool but then if you put

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.709 
like this is so cool but then if you put
your<00:00:51.360> foot<00:00:51.480> down

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
your foot down

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
your foot down
like<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.680> second<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.280> following<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
like I will in a second I'm following a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.600 
like I will in a second I'm following a
cyclist<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> moment<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.920> will<00:00:56.100> hear<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
cyclist at the moment you will hear the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.040 
cyclist at the moment you will hear the
combustion<00:00:56.969> engine<00:00:57.649> springing<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.920> life

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
combustion engine springing into life

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.939 
combustion engine springing into life
stand<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.530> away<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.859> go

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.700 

actors<00:01:04.519> on

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.890 

which<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.340> pretty<00:01:07.520> cool<00:01:07.700> have<00:01:08.510> you<00:01:08.570> got<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
which is pretty cool have you got the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.470 
which is pretty cool have you got the
option<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.890> go<00:01:10.010> into<00:01:10.040> a<00:01:10.310> completely<00:01:10.880> drive

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
option to go into a completely drive

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.440 
option to go into a completely drive
mode<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:12.800> will<00:01:12.950> kill<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.550> engine<00:01:14.330> at

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
mode so that will kill the engine at

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.899 
mode so that will kill the engine at
some<00:01:14.660> point

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.020 

there<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.689> back<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.140> electric<00:01:19.909> but<00:01:20.909> we've

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there we go back on electric but we've

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
there we go back on electric but we've
got<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.390> theory<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> total<00:01:22.380> twenty<00:01:22.710> three<00:01:22.920> mile

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
got a theory a total twenty three mile

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359 
got a theory a total twenty three mile

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
range on electric only with it it

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.240 
range on electric only with it it
charges<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> electric<00:01:27.420> battery<00:01:27.750> from

got Comfort and eco pro modes different

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.069 
got Comfort and eco pro modes different
levels<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.789> when<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.149> will<00:01:39.240> kick<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.569> there<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
levels of when it will kick in there in

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
levels of when it will kick in there in
the<00:01:40.200> power<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.710> you've<00:01:41.429> actually<00:01:41.549> got<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the power but you've actually got a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.539 
the power but you've actually got a
surprising<00:01:42.420> amount<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.750> kick<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.170> too

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
surprising amount of kick to it too

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.809 
surprising amount of kick to it too
which<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.700> cool<00:01:44.909> pop<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> over<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.289> sport<00:01:46.649> mode

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
which is cool pop it over to sport mode

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.199 
which is cool pop it over to sport mode

love<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.280> looks<00:06:17.490> I<00:06:17.610> love<00:06:17.730> how<00:06:17.910> it<00:06:17.970> went<00:06:18.120> from

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
love the looks I love how it went from

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.060 
love the looks I love how it went from
sort<00:06:18.360> of<00:06:18.480> concept<00:06:18.960> style<00:06:19.260> looks<00:06:19.560> to<00:06:20.040> a

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
sort of concept style looks to a

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.890 
sort of concept style looks to a
production<00:06:20.550> car<00:06:20.730> on<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.030> road<00:06:21.210> which<00:06:21.750> is

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
production car on the road which is

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.270 
production car on the road which is
something<00:06:22.080> you<00:06:22.260> always<00:06:22.530> hope<00:06:22.740> is<00:06:22.950> going<00:06:23.160> to

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
something you always hope is going to

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.920 
something you always hope is going to
happen<00:06:23.610> but<00:06:23.760> more<00:06:23.970> often<00:06:24.210> not<00:06:24.480> these<00:06:24.690> days

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
happen but more often not these days

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.360 
happen but more often not these days
just<00:06:25.320> doesn't<00:06:25.710> because<00:06:26.040> there<00:06:26.160> are<00:06:26.250> so<00:06:26.340> many

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
just doesn't because there are so many

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.010 
just doesn't because there are so many
regulations<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.270> bulls<00:06:27.450> and<00:06:27.720> things<00:06:27.900> that

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
regulations and bulls and things that

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.990 
regulations and bulls and things that
these<00:06:28.260> cars<00:06:28.500> have<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:28.980> follow<00:06:29.130> and<00:06:29.790> I<00:06:29.850> think

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
these cars have to follow and I think

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.920 
these cars have to follow and I think
one<00:06:30.090> of<00:06:30.120> the<00:06:30.240> things<00:06:30.390> that<00:06:30.540> has<00:06:30.660> been<00:06:30.840> most

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
one of the things that has been most

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.570 
one of the things that has been most
impressed<00:06:31.320> too<00:06:31.500> is<00:06:31.950> how<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.220> hybrid

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
impressed too is how the hybrid

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.040 
impressed too is how the hybrid
technology<00:06:32.700> you<00:06:33.120> know<00:06:33.240> it's<00:06:33.360> a<00:06:33.450> kin<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:33.870> the

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
technology you know it's a kin to the

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.780 
technology you know it's a kin to the
