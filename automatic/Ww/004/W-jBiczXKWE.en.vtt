00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.730
 yes 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.110
 hello how about youtube friends good at 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 this time I have been bringing you this 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.580
 this texture that now will not see how 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.980
 it's called but right now we're going to see your 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 name and we will proceed to install it 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480
 not so for those who do not know how to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.369
 install a texture because right now I'm going 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.829
 to say how it is by means of the rangers 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.090
 pro we give the key above 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.530
 we go to blow launcher options 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.140
 here where it says package of textures and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.750
 you are going to give a good note to use 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.879
 and they will give him select and they will find him 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.320
 in the folder where I have it I have it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.140
 here and it's called craft space 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.210
 we simply give them the selections and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 already installed, remember that you have to 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.960
 be in hong now we give it back 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.310
 and we see what 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.520
 is already installed 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.630
 texture and let's start a review 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 on our map 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.140
 and you can work as you can see 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.409
 I will not lie to you 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.650
 this texture I liked a lot more 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.360
 that the kraft you want to have done 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.240
 but my favorite is that I did not know her 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.940
 and we will have tried all day 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 there in the recondite 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.220
 because they have yellow 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.470
 and as we can see it costs 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.110
 I do not know why I have a lot because they have 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.540
 skin 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.220
 they look like their successes are called 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.690
 female doctors who enters areas 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.250
 contaminated and here we see this little pig 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.260
 I'm going to find something crap is that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.330
 that little pig was not inside the train 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.990
 but I do not know how the fuck got on 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.729
 because I had actually removed a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.110
 rail to stop the cart but 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.380
 out of nowhere I realized that suddenly 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.399
 is turning written by this 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.969
 I really do not know what's happening here and also 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.649
 Let's see 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.770
 well here we go the sheep how 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.170
 learn are more sheep have face like this 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.050
 of annoying and is considered tared 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.770
 imputed as of all annoying the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.600
 mushrooms 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.390
 not cows 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.330
 they show a lot of their faces a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.730
 Soda is like that of pigs like 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.350
 that if with the normal texture I feel sorry 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.480
 to kill them like this is not going to give more pity 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.140
 Chicks now look like chicks and 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.290
 some ducks 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.750
 here we see the wolves 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.489
 has the truth about the best we are going to 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.950
 see all the blocks as we can see 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.609
 they have good textures I think all 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.920
 they have texture yes or yes in texture here 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.920
 we see the carrots the potatoes 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.500
 wheat I do not know I do not know if it was made watermelon or 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.400
 pumpkins 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.400
 The Cactus 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.960
 eggplant all the other blocks 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.700
 emerald diamonds 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:11.940
 redstone lapis lazuli and we saw the trees 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.900
 its textures that I do the same I think 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.900
 that will change us 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.200
 and let's see the maps 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.260
 that as we can see here are the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.560
 clippers look great 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.959
 skeletons look like sugar the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.590
 they're really good and it's that this 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.900
 texture see the face you do not respect me for 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.190
 the one that I did the time spiders is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.910
 of two fangs 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.910
 the thunder man are more scary and we are going to 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.490
 I had not realized that these 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.830
 crimes already saw is a Chinese live 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.180
 the zombies the truth 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.180
 these are the zombie picks 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.490
 they are the zombies 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.890
 good good to clarify that I do not have zombies 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.330
 do not have to add here 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.330
 add the airs 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.420
 zombie 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.739
 hernando 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.550
 zombie 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.550
 add them 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.060
 yesterday is to show the zombies are now 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.920
 over there good that sprout or serge and then 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.420
 we see that they are great and now what 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.950
 most liked are the images of the 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.930
 frames that are in hd not these tasks are 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.270
 imagine having a house like this 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.900
 built with these pictures the truth 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.940
 I wanted super good 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.699
 and well folks this would be all the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.009
 review I hope you like this 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.080
 texture of now that is very cool and 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.340
 Well, see you in the next video
