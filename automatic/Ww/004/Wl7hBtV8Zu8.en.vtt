this<00:00:14.160> glitch<00:00:14.429> I'm<00:00:14.580> sure<00:00:14.700> everyone<00:00:15.000> knows

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
this glitch I'm sure everyone knows

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.670 
this glitch I'm sure everyone knows
about<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.900> flood<00:00:16.109> flood<00:00:16.320> glitch

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
about it's the flood flood glitch

about it's the flood flood glitch
basically<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.670> take<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.940> flood<00:00:18.150> flood

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
basically you can take the flood flood

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.179 
basically you can take the flood flood
out<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> snowy<00:00:18.900> mountain<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> use<00:00:20.010> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
out of snowy mountain and use it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
glitch everyone knows about it but I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.230 
glitch everyone knows about it but I
just<00:00:23.220> thought<00:00:23.460> it'd<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:23.760> cool<00:00:24.180> thing

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
just thought it'd be a really cool thing

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.790 
just thought it'd be a really cool thing
you<00:00:24.539> show<00:00:24.660> off<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.019> quick<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.710> know

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you show off really quick and you know

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.230 
you show off really quick and you know
maybe<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.189> explore<00:00:26.519> around<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.029> see<00:00:27.150> if

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
maybe we can explore around and see if

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.120 
maybe we can explore around and see if
we<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.480> figure<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.019> exactly<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:28.980> do

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we can figure out what exactly can we do

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.620 
we can figure out what exactly can we do
with<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.429> glitch<00:00:29.670> where<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.269> take<00:00:30.420> it

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
with this glitch where can we take it

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.609 
with this glitch where can we take it
what<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.260> do

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
what can we do

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.190 
what can we do
etc<00:00:32.040> etc<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.000> first<00:00:33.690> let's<00:00:33.899> get<00:00:33.989> into<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
etc etc so first let's get into the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.510 
etc etc so first let's get into the
basics<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.590> pulling<00:00:34.770> off<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> glitch<00:00:35.280> because

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

have<00:01:09.900> been<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> bit<00:01:10.290> confusing<00:01:10.710> I've<00:01:11.130> seen

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
have been a bit confusing I've seen

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.179 
have been a bit confusing I've seen
videos<00:01:11.880> before<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.439> my<00:01:13.770> own

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
videos before of this so it's not my own

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.080 
videos before of this so it's not my own
little<00:01:14.760> thing<00:01:15.170> obviously<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
little thing obviously but what what I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
little thing obviously but what what I
generally<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.409> didn't<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.950> how<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
generally is I didn't really get how to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.010 
generally is I didn't really get how to
do<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> took<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> ton<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.360> tries<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
do it and it took me a ton of tries to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.210 
do it and it took me a ton of tries to
figure<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:22.590> once<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.770> figure<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.009> out

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
figure it out but once you figure it out

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.010 
figure it out but once you figure it out
it's<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.520> easy<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.570> gonna<00:01:24.659> explain<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it's really easy so I'm gonna explain it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.390 
it's really easy so I'm gonna explain it

want to do is you want to aim for the
crevasse<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.540> did<00:01:33.720> jump<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
crevasse like I did jump up then you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.920 
crevasse like I did jump up then you
want<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> spam<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.060> attack<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.720> here

flood flood is named Steve for those of
you<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.899> don't<00:01:43.079> know<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:44.119> named<00:01:45.119> him<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you that don't know I named him that in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.179 
you that don't know I named him that in
the<00:01:45.630> lp<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:46.649> his<00:01:46.799> name<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the lp and that is what his name is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.789 
the lp and that is what his name is
Steve<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.000> matches<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.320> beyond<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
Steve it matches and that's beyond the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.020 
Steve it matches and that's beyond the

out<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.799> cool<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.909> want<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.180> do

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
out really cool now what we want to do

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
out really cool now what we want to do
is<00:02:05.880> well<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> guess<00:02:07.079> what<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.320> want<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
is well I guess what we want to do is

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800 
is well I guess what we want to do is
explore<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.399> mean<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:09.090> got<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> flood<00:02:09.599> flood

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
explore I mean we got the flood flood

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.070 
explore I mean we got the flood flood
out<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> gates<00:02:10.410> he's<00:02:10.709> free<00:02:11.330> free<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> roam

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
out of the gates he's free free to roam

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.790 
out of the gates he's free free to roam

slit<00:02:14.040> icy<00:02:14.280> wasteland<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.390> suppose<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.890> can

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
slit icy wasteland I suppose and we can

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.730 
slit icy wasteland I suppose and we can
see<00:02:17.250> what<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.270> him<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:19.530> he

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
see what can we do with him is he

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.200 
see what can we do with him is he
helpful<00:02:20.010> for<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> level<00:02:20.550> would<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.060> have<00:02:21.180> been

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
helpful for the level would it have been

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.840 
helpful for the level would it have been
better<00:02:21.440> maybe<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.770> they<00:02:23.010> let<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.460> ride<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
better maybe if they let you ride the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.400 
better maybe if they let you ride the
full<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.240> for<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> entire<00:02:24.720> level<00:02:24.960> maybe<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
full up for the entire level maybe it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.630 
full up for the entire level maybe it
would<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.590> helped<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> complete<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> faster

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
would have helped you complete it faster

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.410 
would have helped you complete it faster
maybe<00:02:26.820> would<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.060> been<00:02:27.150> an<00:02:27.270> interesting

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
maybe would have been an interesting

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.720 
maybe would have been an interesting
gameplay<00:02:27.780> mechanic<00:02:28.380> now<00:02:28.830> interesting<00:02:29.520> thing

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
gameplay mechanic now interesting thing

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.120 
gameplay mechanic now interesting thing
to<00:02:29.910> know<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:31.530> know<00:02:31.620> I've<00:02:31.740> done<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.070> before

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
to know you know I've done this before

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.480 
to know you know I've done this before
and<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:34.020> ice<00:02:34.230> physics<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> foot<00:02:35.070> foot<00:02:35.310> are

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
and the ice physics on the foot foot are

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.970 
and the ice physics on the foot foot are
actually<00:02:36.240> pretty<00:02:36.900> well<00:02:37.080> programmed<00:02:37.710> even

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
actually pretty well programmed even

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.200 
actually pretty well programmed even
though<00:02:38.040> he<00:02:38.130> wasn't<00:02:38.310> meant<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.640> ever<00:02:38.880> run<00:02:39.180> on

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
though he wasn't meant to ever run on

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.340 
though he wasn't meant to ever run on
ice

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
ice

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.860 
ice
he<00:02:40.830> runs<00:02:41.070> really<00:02:41.340> fast<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.300> normal<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
he runs really fast just like normal and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.470 
he runs really fast just like normal and
it'll<00:02:43.080> gain<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.470> lot<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.680> speed<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.480> it's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
it'll gain up a lot of speed and it's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.330 
it'll gain up a lot of speed and it's
it's<00:02:45.960> really<00:02:46.200> interesting<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.920> see<00:02:46.950> how<00:02:47.160> he

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it's really interesting to see how he

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.120 
it's really interesting to see how he
works<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.870> ice<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.650> don't<00:02:49.950> know<00:02:50.040> if

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
works just on the ice I don't know if

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.380 
works just on the ice I don't know if
you're<00:02:50.220> still<00:02:50.460> with<00:02:50.610> me<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.150> those<00:02:51.240> people

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
you're still with me and those people

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.630 
you're still with me and those people
tend<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:52.140> tune<00:02:52.350> out<00:02:52.530> rather<00:02:53.010> quickly<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.550> this

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
tend to tune out rather quickly so this

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.070 
tend to tune out rather quickly so this
is<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:53.880> gonna<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.390> quick<00:02:54.570> there's

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
is just gonna be really quick there's

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.380 
is just gonna be really quick there's
gonna<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> little<00:02:55.800> bit<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.010> exploration

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
gonna be a little bit of exploration

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.890 
gonna be a little bit of exploration

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.199 
to come up here and there is one
extension<00:03:37.560> glitch<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.340> could<00:03:38.550> call<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:39.090> an

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
extension glitch if you could call it an

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.630 
extension glitch if you could call it an
extension<00:03:39.570> glitch<00:03:39.989> but<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.980> don't<00:03:41.400> like

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
extension glitch but I I don't like

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.280 
extension glitch but I I don't like
doing<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.150> because<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.720> breaks<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.140> game

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
doing it because it breaks the game

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.320 
doing it because it breaks the game
quite<00:03:43.890> literally<00:03:44.400> yes<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.850> will<00:03:45.000> break<00:03:45.270> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
quite literally yes you will break the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.060 
quite literally yes you will break the
game<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.900> do<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.110> extension<00:03:46.350> glitch<00:03:46.739> I'm

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
game if you do the extension glitch I'm

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.640 
game if you do the extension glitch I'm
about<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.520> show<00:03:47.989> so<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.020> guess<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.320> should<00:03:49.500> just

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
about to show so I guess I should just

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.310 
about to show so I guess I should just
get<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.459> red<00:03:51.150> eco<00:03:51.540> doesn't<00:03:51.989> really<00:03:52.140> do

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
get to it red eco doesn't really do

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.110 
get to it red eco doesn't really do
anything<00:03:52.530> with<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.860> flood<00:03:53.040> flood<00:03:53.250> even

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
anything with the flood flood even

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.220 
anything with the flood flood even
though<00:03:54.209> you're<00:03:54.390> never<00:03:54.660> really<00:03:54.930> supposed<00:03:55.170> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
though you're never really supposed to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.360 
though you're never really supposed to
have<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.590> doesn't<00:03:55.770> make<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.010> fluff<00:03:56.190> lot

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
have it doesn't make the fluff lot

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.030 
have it doesn't make the fluff lot
really<00:03:56.550> any<00:03:56.790> stronger<00:03:57.770> but<00:03:58.770> that's<00:03:58.890> because

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
really any stronger but that's because

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.199 
really any stronger but that's because
the<00:03:59.220> foot<00:03:59.400> flat<00:03:59.580> really<00:03:59.790> does<00:03:59.940> kill

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the foot flat really does kill

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.550 
the foot flat really does kill
everything<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.630> one<00:04:00.750> hit<00:04:00.900> already<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.470> it

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
everything in one hit already so it

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.220 
everything in one hit already so it
doesn't<00:04:01.770> really<00:04:01.890> need<00:04:02.130> ready<00:04:02.430> go<00:04:02.959> I'm<00:04:03.959> kind<00:04:04.200> of

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
doesn't really need ready go I'm kind of

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.210 
doesn't really need ready go I'm kind of
just<00:04:04.440> blabbing<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.160> guess<00:04:07.220> something

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220

place and they got that cool building

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.750 
place and they got that cool building
looks<00:04:28.280> interesting<00:04:29.280> I'm<00:04:29.370> not<00:04:29.490> really<00:04:29.610> sure

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
looks interesting I'm not really sure

looks interesting I'm not really sure
what<00:04:29.910> its<00:04:30.000> name<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.360> but<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.540> think<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.139> might

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
what its name is but I think it might

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.659 
what its name is but I think it might
have<00:04:31.440> even<00:04:31.530> beaten<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.040> height<00:04:32.220> record<00:04:32.400> for

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
have even beaten the height record for

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.730 
have even beaten the height record for
the<00:04:32.760> Sears<00:04:32.940> Tower<00:04:33.030> I'm<00:04:33.720> not<00:04:34.110> entirely<00:04:34.470> sure

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
the Sears Tower I'm not entirely sure

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.820 
the Sears Tower I'm not entirely sure

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
but um yeah that's a nice random tangent

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.450 
but um yeah that's a nice random tangent
for<00:04:38.400> your<00:04:39.169> random<00:04:40.169> tangent<00:04:40.620> collection<00:04:41.250> book

of glitch videos anyway

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.980 
of glitch videos anyway
yeah<00:04:44.820> I'm<00:04:44.940> ed<00:04:45.090> which<00:04:45.270> videos<00:04:45.600> are<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.810> little

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
yeah I'm ed which videos are a little

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.490 
yeah I'm ed which videos are a little
weird<00:04:46.260> too<00:04:46.530> because<00:04:47.930> when<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:48.960> do<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.260> glitch

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
weird too because when I do a glitch

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.230 
weird too because when I do a glitch
video<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:49.889> actually<00:04:50.370> commentate<00:04:50.850> over<00:04:50.880> it

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
video I actually commentate over it

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.870 
video I actually commentate over it
rather<00:04:51.449> than<00:04:51.979> you<00:04:52.979> know<00:04:53.010> just<00:04:53.550> show<00:04:53.729> the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
rather than you know just show the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.850 
rather than you know just show the
glitch<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.479> I<00:04:54.990> know<00:04:55.050> some<00:04:55.380> people<00:04:55.500> might<00:04:55.680> like

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
glitch and I know some people might like

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.530 
glitch and I know some people might like
that<00:04:56.100> some<00:04:56.280> people<00:04:56.490> might<00:04:56.610> not<00:04:56.639> I'm<00:04:57.000> gonna<00:04:57.180> end

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
that some people might not I'm gonna end

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.870 
that some people might not I'm gonna end
the<00:04:57.660> video<00:04:57.780> pretty<00:04:58.380> soon<00:04:58.740> now<00:04:58.949> but<00:04:59.520> as<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.669> can

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
the video pretty soon now but as you can

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.210 
the video pretty soon now but as you can
see<00:04:59.940> I<00:05:00.120> came<00:05:00.510> down<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:01.110> interestingly<00:05:01.590> enough

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
see I came down and interestingly enough

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.279 
see I came down and interestingly enough
the<00:05:02.820> flood<00:05:03.120> flood<00:05:03.389> mechanics<00:05:03.960> are<00:05:04.080> still

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
the flood flood mechanics are still

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.320 
the flood flood mechanics are still
there<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:05.370> jumps<00:05:05.699> like<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.850> flood<00:05:06.150> flood

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
there like it jumps like a flood flood

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.939 
there like it jumps like a flood flood
you<00:05:06.510> hear<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.870> flood<00:05:07.080> flood<00:05:07.289> everything<00:05:07.650> like

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
you hear the flood flood everything like

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:08.300 
you hear the flood flood everything like
that

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
that

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.060 
that
is<00:05:08.460> still<00:05:08.820> there<00:05:09.060> intact<00:05:09.600> but<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.470> flood<00:05:10.949> is

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
is still there intact but the flood is

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.830 
is still there intact but the flood is
gone<00:05:11.280> obviously<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.180> didn't<00:05:12.479> really<00:05:12.660> have<00:05:12.720> to

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
gone obviously I didn't really have to

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.430 
gone obviously I didn't really have to
say<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.139> out<00:05:13.260> loud

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
say that out loud

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.620 
say that out loud
but<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:14.669> know<00:05:14.729> for<00:05:15.030> those<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.479> are

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
but you know for those of you that are

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.510 
but you know for those of you that are
deaf<00:05:15.780> watching<00:05:16.320> now<00:05:17.039> you<00:05:17.070> know

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
deaf watching now you know

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.090 
deaf watching now you know
so<00:05:18.139> what<00:05:19.139> flood<00:05:19.320> has<00:05:19.440> disappeared<00:05:19.919> but<00:05:20.039> the

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
so what flood has disappeared but the

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.500 
so what flood has disappeared but the
mechanics<00:05:20.520> are<00:05:20.639> still<00:05:20.820> there<00:05:20.970> now<00:05:21.150> this<00:05:21.360> is

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
mechanics are still there now this is

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.500 
mechanics are still there now this is
where<00:05:21.660> things<00:05:21.810> get<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.110> little<00:05:22.650> bit<00:05:23.039> weird<00:05:23.510> if

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
where things get a little bit weird if

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.810 
where things get a little bit weird if
you<00:05:24.570> try<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.080> go<00:05:25.199> into<00:05:25.380> any<00:05:25.620> area<00:05:25.820> this

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
you try and go into any area this

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.090 
you try and go into any area this
happens<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.389> game<00:05:27.570> freezes<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.320> goodnight

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
happens the game freezes and goodnight

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.670 
happens the game freezes and goodnight
now<00:05:29.850> you<00:05:30.630> might<00:05:30.780> be<00:05:30.810> thinking<00:05:30.930> oh<00:05:31.410> crap<00:05:31.440> you

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
now you might be thinking oh crap you

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.100 
now you might be thinking oh crap you
broke<00:05:32.010> my<00:05:32.160> game<00:05:32.340> drew<00:05:32.789> you<00:05:32.970> bastard<00:05:33.510> how<00:05:33.810> dare

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
broke my game drew you bastard how dare

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.080 
broke my game drew you bastard how dare
you<00:05:34.289> you<00:05:34.770> know<00:05:34.919> I<00:05:34.950> can't<00:05:35.639> believe<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:36.060> trusted

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
though you probably watch the video you

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.640 
though you probably watch the video you
know<00:05:38.940> if<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.330> tried<00:05:39.570> this<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:40.080> then<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:40.470> did

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
know if you tried this and then you did

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.020 
know if you tried this and then you did
this<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:41.099> you<00:05:41.340> didn't<00:05:41.550> watch<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.789> video<00:05:41.849> all

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
this and you didn't watch the video all

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.580 
this and you didn't watch the video all
the<00:05:42.090> way<00:05:42.180> through<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:42.450> can<00:05:42.720> only<00:05:42.900> say<00:05:43.139> you

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
the way through I can only say you

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.510 
the way through I can only say you
didn't<00:05:43.770> watch<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.039> video<00:05:44.130> all<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.430> way

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
didn't watch the video all the way

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.020 
didn't watch the video all the way
through<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:45.630> you<00:05:46.050> stink<00:05:46.410> now<00:05:46.560> but<00:05:47.070> it's<00:05:47.820> no

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
through so you you stink now but it's no

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.779 
through so you you stink now but it's no
problem<00:05:48.240> at<00:05:48.510> all<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:50.039> what<00:05:50.400> you're<00:05:50.550> supposed

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
problem at all the what you're supposed

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.089 
problem at all the what you're supposed
to<00:05:50.849> do<00:05:51.030> is<00:05:51.270> reset<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.050> game<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.500> you'll<00:05:52.979> be

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
to do is reset the game and you'll be

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.110 
to do is reset the game and you'll be
absolutely<00:05:53.460> fine

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
absolutely fine

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.420 
absolutely fine
and<00:05:54.360> also<00:05:54.990> one<00:05:55.470> thing<00:05:55.530> to<00:05:55.710> note<00:05:55.949> that<00:05:56.099> I<00:05:56.160> didn't

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
and also one thing to note that I didn't

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.100 
and also one thing to note that I didn't
show<00:05:56.550> is<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.789> if<00:05:57.090> you<00:05:57.210> die<00:05:57.389> while<00:05:57.660> riding<00:05:57.930> the

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
show is that if you die while riding the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.219 
show is that if you die while riding the
flood<00:05:58.530> in<00:05:59.400> snowy<00:05:59.669> mountain<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.479> will<00:06:00.630> appear

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
flood in snowy mountain you will appear

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.860 
flood in snowy mountain you will appear
in<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.500> recent<00:06:01.889> load<00:06:02.310> zone<00:06:02.340> of<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.000> game<00:06:03.180> but

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
in the recent load zone of the game but

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.080 
in the recent load zone of the game but
you<00:06:04.320> will<00:06:04.470> just<00:06:04.650> be<00:06:04.740> flat<00:06:05.220> flat<00:06:05.460> less<00:06:05.669> so<00:06:06.030> you

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
you will just be flat flat less so you

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.760 
you will just be flat flat less so you
have<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.389> perform<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.900> glitch<00:06:07.050> again<00:06:07.169> if<00:06:07.650> you

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
have to perform the glitch again if you

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.379 
have to perform the glitch again if you
like<00:06:07.949> the<00:06:08.070> foot<00:06:08.220> plot<00:06:08.400> so<00:06:08.789> it's<00:06:09.300> an

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
like the foot plot so it's an

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.939 
like the foot plot so it's an
interesting<00:06:09.630> little<00:06:09.900> glitch<00:06:10.199> nice<00:06:10.650> little

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
interesting little glitch nice little

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.279 
interesting little glitch nice little
fun<00:06:11.190> thing<00:06:11.490> that<00:06:11.940> you<00:06:12.419> can<00:06:12.539> try<00:06:12.750> out<00:06:12.780> at<00:06:13.110> home

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
fun thing that you can try out at home

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.650 
fun thing that you can try out at home

extension glitch oh my goodness I feel
like<00:06:19.620> there's<00:06:19.800> something<00:06:20.039> here<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.669> feel<00:06:21.090> like

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
like there's something here I feel like

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.490 
like there's something here I feel like
someone<00:06:21.510> could<00:06:21.630> do<00:06:21.750> something<00:06:22.110> more<00:06:22.320> with

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
someone could do something more with

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.779 
someone could do something more with
this<00:06:22.680> than<00:06:22.889> what's<00:06:23.039> already<00:06:23.160> been<00:06:23.370> displayed

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
this than what's already been displayed

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.629 
this than what's already been displayed
but<00:06:24.240> you<00:06:24.360> know<00:06:24.479> if<00:06:25.169> you<00:06:25.410> beat<00:06:25.710> a<00:06:25.830> lot<00:06:26.039> maybe<00:06:26.280> an

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
but you know if you beat a lot maybe an

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.250 
but you know if you beat a lot maybe an
interesting<00:06:26.970> idea<00:06:27.270> would<00:06:27.510> be<00:06:27.539> just<00:06:27.840> beating<00:06:28.139> a

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
interesting idea would be just beating a

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.020 
interesting idea would be just beating a
level<00:06:28.380> with<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:29.039> foot<00:06:29.370> flat<00:06:29.580> and<00:06:29.610> seeing<00:06:29.910> if

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
level with the foot flat and seeing if

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.969 
level with the foot flat and seeing if
it's<00:06:30.180> a<00:06:30.330> faster<00:06:30.810> method<00:06:31.139> of<00:06:31.229> doing<00:06:31.349> it<00:06:31.560> might

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
it's a faster method of doing it might

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.680 
it's a faster method of doing it might
be<00:06:32.010> a<00:06:32.130> good<00:06:32.310> way<00:06:32.460> to<00:06:32.520> speedrun<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:33.120> game<00:06:33.300> I'm

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
be a good way to speedrun the game I'm

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.779 
be a good way to speedrun the game I'm
not<00:06:33.960> sure<00:06:34.199> but<00:06:34.680> it<00:06:35.310> was<00:06:35.460> an<00:06:35.580> interesting

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
not sure but it was an interesting

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.610 
not sure but it was an interesting
