00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.810
 do not 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.359
 today I'm going to talk about aerial photography 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.399
 for this we have come to the area 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.930
 volcanic de la garrotxa and we are going to 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.019
 perform a hot air balloon flight 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.879
 with cool friends volta oms 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.739
 let's try to make some 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.620
 images of the volcanic cones that there are 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.659
 distributed throughout the region the flight 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.850
 in hot air balloon is highly 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.440
 recommended to start in this 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.610
 specialty has a couple of 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.580
 inconveniences 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.979
 we can not go through areas too much 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.310
 large and we can not choose or 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.990
 To steer too much the direction of the flight 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 the only precaution to start is 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.460
 choose a day that has the sky 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.140
 completely uncovered or with a light 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.149
 diffuse irregular 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.069
 we must avoid the compact clouds 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.920
 small because they are going to project us 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:34.899
 too dark shadows in the landscape 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.899
 they are waiting for us, we are going there 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.750
 as the balloon flight is smooth and slow 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.120
 we do not need any special technique 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.200
 for taking pictures as to 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.060
 the optics 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.300
 I carry so much wide angle is like the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.800
 short objectives on this particular flight 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.740
 I have a 17 35 millimeters and an 80 200 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.110
 also to kill the reflections of light 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.429
 In the water, it is very 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.090
 Using polarizer filters is 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.090
 all right 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.960
 Well, we've already had a landing 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.270
 between trees but the flight has gone very 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.840
 well and I think some picture I'm going to 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.840
 can teach 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.620
 and the most professional way to perform 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.319
 aerial photography is through a 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.300
 small high- wing small plane or a 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.910
 helicopter these two systems are the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.819
 more professional especially because of its 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.739
 autonomy and your comfort however the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.140
 price can be very high by way of 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.640
 example I will tell you that on a flight that 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.640
 perform on the coral reef 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.750
 Australian to photograph the barrier 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.519
 from the air 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.980
 a flight in a three helicopter 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.840
 one hour squares cost me over a thousand 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.760
 euros today we are going to try one thing 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.160
 different let's fly with this to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.230
 motor let's fly with friend mikel 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.180
 from the company to the club bulls which is a 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.040
 company specialized in flights of these 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.840
 of this type and that operates in the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.840
 prepirineo leridano in the pre-Pyrenees 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.750
 Catalan the advantages of a paramotor 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.549
 this guy are many and especially his 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.500
 maneuverability we can fly to 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.470
 very slow speeds we can 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.390
 bring a lot closer to our subject we can 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.640
 take off from anywhere 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.920
 let's take off from a small field 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.709
 and also does not have a closed structure 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.960
 like a window or doors, but 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.000
 it is simply a metal structure 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.760
 nothing stands between the camera and the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.120
 landscape that we are photographing 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.340
 technical level here we 're going to notice 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.770
 more vibrations not like in the balloon 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.740
 hot air so we're going to have to 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.460
 shoot at fast speeds so 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.860
 less than at least 1 125 a 125 water 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.210
 of second however this is not going to be 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.270
 a problem because we can always 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.540
 work with very open diaphragms 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.970
 because because all our landscape almost 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.980
 will always be at infinity and so 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.470
 we will not have to close the 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.380
 diaphragm to get depths 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.820
 of large field will not be necessary 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.830
 so now let's take advantage of that the 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.470
 wind has stopped and we are going to make a 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.960
 flight through the sierra del montsec to see if 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.210
 we got some good photos at 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.250
 end of the episode I will show you some 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.350
 of the photos of this flight and other 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.740
 achieved by flight systems 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.740
 aerial 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.779
 well you have seen that we have had 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.580
 a small mishap at the takeoff has 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:55.740
 commented mikel that this has only 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.289
 happened twice in 15 years of 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.009
 experience has not been anything that is 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.009
 let's try again
