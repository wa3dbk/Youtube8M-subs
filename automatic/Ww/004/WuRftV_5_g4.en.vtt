00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 then the artistic career 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.710
 and encompasses within the cinema art 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.099
 television theater whatever is fair or 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.219
 is unfair because because if it's fair 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 should be the one who prepares the most and if 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.750
 it is unjust that the one who has 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.600
 Charisma goes through the screen 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.420
 it seems to me if it's just has to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.060
 get the one to have a bad time 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.680
 prepare 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:37.970
 for nothing I think there's something there that 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.800
 understand that to succeed or to be 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.790
 stay and to get in this medium 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.920
 what happened because you did not arrive without having 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.260
 backstage witches clear what 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.550
 most important things for you or for 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.940
 any actor or actress that what you 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.680
 you lived the same I think there are many 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.080
 actors who never did anything and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.390
 also the technique fills you with vices and 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.299
 it fills you with a lot of things that to me 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.310
 in my case I do not want them for me 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.890
 people there are actors that serves them the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.650
 technique and I think it's something that serves 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.590
 from a training 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.570
 now go to study to know how to act and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.340
 to study to know how to play remember 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.400
 the whole punk era no one knows how to play a 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.460
 string then and they make a sound of the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.040
 shell of the parrot I usually prefer 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.510
 to the monkees that if I did not feel a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.060
 I prefer the whole life band new 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.150
 york don the ramones the clash the sex 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.090
 pistols have to listen to johnny ramone 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.220
 how they play they play like that because by not having 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.350
 the technique after passing the limit that the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.030
 technique does not allow you to not have 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.130
 technical transfer the limit that the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.340
 technique does not allow you when you have 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.140
 techniques is how do you structure when 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.270
 they are not tied fach and for me for the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.570
 art you have to make a broken face for the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.570
 art 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.880
 same and cheering you up there is an anecdote to give me 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.100
 always count my husband I hope to be 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.869
 telling you well that two musicians very 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.780
 rough gangsters sing of me 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.390
 let's not sing, so I think it was 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.220
 I can do that too, that's why the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.620
 famous recital of the sex pistols that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.380
 were these 12 15 people and all 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.950
 they left there making bands to see 1 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:32.970
 12 15 people on being pistols 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 20 and from there came the today you live thousands 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.370
 of bands that later became something 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.580
 pibes who saw for the first time these 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.340
 kids who came up doing this without knowing 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.450
 why the moments to see was very 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.040
 important because the beethoven 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.140
 mozart are like the rockers of the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.739
 classical music for me that is the one that 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.450
 goes beyond the barrier of what is done 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.220
 if it's just last night I listened 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.440
 a post to me I love music I am 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.750
 jazz fanatic and last night I started 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.200
 listen to sopena mendelssohn has there 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.730
 very much in awful let me go go for another 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.980
 side and ask you until I would almost tell you 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.140
 that you explain it to me with the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.420
 disclosure capacity that we have 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.700
 because you explain well boots is sometimes 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.510
 the willingness to have a better time but 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.489
 it's many years it 's fine but not 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.590
 listen to positive to sound just this you 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.720
 I'm going to say if we had lumbar 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.250
 a beer that I laughed for days during a 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.690
 work but nobody will laugh a minute 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.690
 with we do not have time a work go 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.270

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.640
 smoke this weekend 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.140
 If I want to sit down and smoke, I hope 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.790
 here said I want that I want assaulted 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:53.120

 I want to try porro once my life that 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.110
 I'm going to die, I'm 42 years old 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.020

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.830

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:51.270
