week build a well-developed back my main

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.679 
week build a well-developed back my main
concern<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.580> might<00:00:20.880> miss<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.480> some

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
concern is that I might miss out on some

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.830 
concern is that I might miss out on some
bag<00:00:22.199> development<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.949> also<00:00:23.699> squat<00:00:24.480> twice<00:00:24.810> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
bag development I also squat twice a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.970 
bag development I also squat twice a
week<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.350> well<00:00:27.140> yeah<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.170> think<00:00:28.380> that'll<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
week as well yeah I think that'll get it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
week as well yeah I think that'll get it
done<00:00:29.160> you're<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.730> missing<00:00:30.179> any<00:00:30.539> major

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
done you're not missing any major

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.350 
done you're not missing any major
muscles<00:00:31.830> everything's<00:00:32.160> getting<00:00:32.579> properly

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
muscles everything's getting properly

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.090 
muscles everything's getting properly
stimulated<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:34.170> those<00:00:34.620> three<00:00:34.829> movements

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
stimulated with those three movements

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
stimulated with those three movements
you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.579> build<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.239> well-developed<00:00:36.660> back<00:00:37.020> off

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you can build a well-developed back off

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
you can build a well-developed back off
of<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.969> unless<00:00:38.969> you're<00:00:39.840> back<00:00:40.079> genetics<00:00:40.770> just

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
of that unless you're back genetics just

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
of that unless you're back genetics just
suck<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.270> which<00:00:42.480> case<00:00:42.690> you're<00:00:42.870> probably<00:00:43.050> going

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
suck in which case you're probably going

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
suck in which case you're probably going
to<00:00:43.320> need<00:00:43.379> some<00:00:43.649> runs<00:00:43.770> also<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.539> generally<00:00:45.539> don't

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to need some runs also I generally don't

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.889 
to need some runs also I generally don't
think<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.110> anyone<00:00:46.350> needs<00:00:46.800> both<00:00:47.070> rows<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
think that anyone needs both rows and

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.319 
think that anyone needs both rows and
chin<00:00:48.899> ups<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> same<00:00:49.620> time<00:00:49.890> unless<00:00:50.329> their

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
chin ups at the same time unless their

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.630 
chin ups at the same time unless their
back<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.739> alighting<00:00:53.309> muscle

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
back is just a really alighting muscle

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.869 
back is just a really alighting muscle
group<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> deadlift<00:00:56.489> combined

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
group that I think a deadlift combined

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.250 
group that I think a deadlift combined
with<00:00:57.090> some<00:00:57.270> sort<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> chin<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.809> or<00:00:57.960> pull<00:00:58.109> up

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
with some sort of chin up or pull up

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
with some sort of chin up or pull up
that<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> deadlift<00:00:59.280> combined<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> row

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that or a deadlift combined with a row

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.229 
that or a deadlift combined with a row
will<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> job<00:01:01.829> done<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.609> face<00:01:02.820> pulls<00:01:03.120> are

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
will get the job done the face pulls are

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
will get the job done the face pulls are
just<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> bring<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> rear<00:01:04.260> delts

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
just there to bring up the rear delts

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.580 
just there to bring up the rear delts
and<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> good<00:01:05.100> pre<00:01:05.369> ab<00:01:05.549> exercise<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.590> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and is a good pre ab exercise and of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.810 
and is a good pre ab exercise and of
course<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> extra<00:01:08.220> rear<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.549> work

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
course that extra rear that work

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.030 
course that extra rear that work
finishes<00:01:09.330> off<00:01:09.500> how<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> look

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
finishes off how you're going to look

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.580 
finishes off how you're going to look
for<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> mind<00:01:11.659> that<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.900> generally<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
for a mind that will generally get the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.249 
for a mind that will generally get the
job<00:01:13.799> done<00:01:13.880> trap<00:01:14.880> development<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.780> you're<00:01:16.080> not

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
job done trap development if you're not

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
job done trap development if you're not
genetically<00:01:16.890> best<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> traction<00:01:17.970> might

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
genetically best in the traction might

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.600 
genetically best in the traction might
need<00:01:18.540> some<00:01:18.810> shrugs<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
need some shrugs but that's going to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.969 
need some shrugs but that's going to
depend<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> individual<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
depend on the individual and how you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
depend on the individual and how you
respond<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> other<00:01:23.880> exercises<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> again

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
respond to the other exercises so again

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
respond to the other exercises so again
it<00:01:27.780> comes<00:01:27.869> down<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.259> genetics<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.040> are

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it comes down to genetics but there are

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
it comes down to genetics but there are
plenty<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.000> people<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.960> good

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
plenty of people out there a good

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770 
plenty of people out there a good

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
those three exercises you listed should

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
those three exercises you listed should
be<00:01:38.130> okay<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:39.299> you're<00:01:39.479> not<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.170> have

be okay and if you're not then you have

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560 
be okay and if you're not then you have
to<00:01:40.500> suss<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.189> individual<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> add<00:01:42.360> in

it's<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.330> cute<00:04:01.630> theory<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:03.030> don't<00:04:04.030> see<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
it's a cute theory I don't see the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.080 
it's a cute theory I don't see the
evidence<00:04:05.320> for<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.739> but<00:04:06.550> at<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.700> end<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
evidence for it but at the end of the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.120 
evidence for it but at the end of the
day<00:04:07.269> we<00:04:07.810> know<00:04:08.110> how<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.350> body<00:04:08.620> seems<00:04:09.040> to

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
day we know how the body seems to

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.550 
day we know how the body seems to
respond<00:04:09.730> as<00:04:10.000> far<00:04:10.209> as<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.840> nervous<00:04:11.170> system

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
respond as far as the nervous system

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.080 
respond as far as the nervous system
maybe<00:04:11.769> not<00:04:12.040> we<00:04:12.220> don't<00:04:12.370> understand<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.910> full

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
maybe not we don't understand the full

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.930 
maybe not we don't understand the full
mechanisms<00:04:13.750> behind<00:04:14.080> what's<00:04:14.590> going<00:04:14.890> on<00:04:15.070> but<00:04:15.790> we

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
mechanisms behind what's going on but we

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.880 
mechanisms behind what's going on but we
know<00:04:16.150> how<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.810> affects<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.260> in<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.440> real<00:04:17.680> world

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
know how it affects it in the real world

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.690 
know how it affects it in the real world
and<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:19.350> we<00:04:20.350> do<00:04:20.560> know<00:04:20.709> how<00:04:20.890> basic<00:04:21.250> recovery

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
and so we do know how basic recovery

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.670 
and so we do know how basic recovery
works<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:22.510> knowing<00:04:22.870> whether<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.229> adrenal

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
works and so knowing whether the adrenal

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.840 
works and so knowing whether the adrenal
fatigue<00:04:23.770> or<00:04:24.310> not<00:04:24.490> as<00:04:24.700> real<00:04:25.030> isn't<00:04:25.300> relevant

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
fatigue or not as real isn't relevant

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.750 
fatigue or not as real isn't relevant
to<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:27.470> might<00:04:27.740> turn<00:04:27.980> out<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.220> be<00:04:28.490> real

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
to it and it might turn out to be real

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.630 
to it and it might turn out to be real
but<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.830> really<00:04:30.830> haven't<00:04:31.010> seen<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.400> evidence

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
but I really haven't seen the evidence

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.540 
but I really haven't seen the evidence
for<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.300> while<00:04:33.260> some<00:04:33.500> coaches<00:04:33.920> do<00:04:34.220> believe

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
for it and while some coaches do believe

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.670 
for it and while some coaches do believe
in<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.030> do<00:04:35.360> know<00:04:35.660> a<00:04:35.690> lot<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.050> coaches<00:04:36.650> who

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
in it I do know a lot of coaches who

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.070 
in it I do know a lot of coaches who
don't<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.310> know<00:04:37.730> some<00:04:38.030> very<00:04:38.420> intelligent<00:04:38.780> very

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
don't I know some very intelligent very

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.740 
don't I know some very intelligent very
educated<00:04:39.710> coaches<00:04:40.190> who<00:04:40.430> think<00:04:41.180> it's<00:04:41.360> just<00:04:41.660> a

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
educated coaches who think it's just a

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.930 
educated coaches who think it's just a
myth<00:04:42.010> alright<00:04:43.010> guys<00:04:43.130> that's<00:04:43.430> really<00:04:43.520> all<00:04:43.910> I
