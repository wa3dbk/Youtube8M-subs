00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
now Bravo on this map is the the most

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
now Bravo on this map is the the most
sought-after<00:00:54.920> flag<00:00:56.690> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> game<00:00:58.050> probably

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
sought-after flag in the game probably

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.779 
sought-after flag in the game probably
because<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> open<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.730> if

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
because it's out in the open so if

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
because it's out in the open so if
anybody<00:01:00.149> tried<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> steal<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.350> basically

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
anybody tried to steal it they basically

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.670 
anybody tried to steal it they basically
have<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> expose<00:01:02.250> themselves<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.680> getting

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
shot down so it's easy to defend once

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.260 
shot down so it's easy to defend once

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.969 
blow the c4 to kill anybody was over
there<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:03.899> might<00:02:04.079> go<00:02:04.229> check<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
there and I just might go check it to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.289 
there and I just might go check it to
make<00:02:05.009> sure<00:02:05.159> they<00:02:05.399> didn't<00:02:05.610> actually<00:02:05.729> capture

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
make sure they didn't actually capture

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
make sure they didn't actually capture
it<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.630> did<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> recapture<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.590> throw

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
it if they did I recapture it throw

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
it if they did I recapture it throw
another<00:02:08.340> seafloor<00:02:08.789> pack<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.629> come<00:02:09.840> back

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
another seafloor pack and I come back

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.460 
another seafloor pack and I come back
and<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.679> come<00:02:10.920> back<00:02:11.129> over<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.610> Bravo

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
and I come back over here to Bravo

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.430 
and I come back over here to Bravo
and<00:02:12.560> just<00:02:13.370> pick<00:02:13.730> anybody<00:02:14.030> off<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.020> just

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
and just pick anybody off and I just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.170 
and just pick anybody off and I just
keep<00:02:15.620> doing<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.010> strategy<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.760> whole<00:02:16.910> time

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
keep doing this strategy the whole time

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.990 
keep doing this strategy the whole time
and<00:02:17.360> actually<00:02:17.720> go<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> 17<00:02:19.160> kill<00:02:19.640> streak

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and actually go on a 17 kill streak

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
and actually go on a 17 kill streak
before<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.420> get<00:02:20.630> taken<00:02:20.990> out<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.770> being<00:02:22.130> at<00:02:22.310> you

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
before I get taken out so being at you

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.650 
before I get taken out so being at you
only<00:02:22.550> need<00:02:22.790> seven<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:24.500> do<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.800> achievement

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
only need seven to do this achievement

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.850 
only need seven to do this achievement
this<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:26.960> should<00:02:27.110> actually<00:02:27.230> suit<00:02:27.710> you

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
this is this should actually suit you

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.190 
this is this should actually suit you
pretty<00:02:28.190> well<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.670> actually<00:02:29.330> if<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.660> thinking

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
pretty well and actually if I thinking

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.320 
pretty well and actually if I thinking
about<00:02:30.260> if<00:02:30.530> i<00:02:30.620> had<00:02:30.740> had<00:02:30.770> hardline<00:02:31.490> equipped<00:02:32.240> i

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
about if i had had hardline equipped i

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.920 
about if i had had hardline equipped i
probably<00:02:32.570> could<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.780> did<00:02:33.080> all<00:02:33.830> three<00:02:34.930> parts

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
probably could have did all three parts

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.970 
probably could have did all three parts
of<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:36.080> achievement<00:02:36.470> cuz<00:02:36.710> i<00:02:36.770> would<00:02:36.890> have

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
of this achievement cuz i would have

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.380 
of this achievement cuz i would have
gotten<00:02:37.160> all<00:02:37.250> my<00:02:37.310> killstreaks<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.240> i<00:02:38.270> could

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
gotten all my killstreaks and i could

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.720 
gotten all my killstreaks and i could
have<00:02:38.480> just<00:02:38.630> thrown<00:02:38.840> all<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:40.310> killstreak

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
have just thrown all the the killstreak

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.190 
have just thrown all the the killstreak
rewards<00:02:41.060> out<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.360> my<00:02:41.480> teammates<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:41.960> probably

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
rewards out to my teammates so probably

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.480 
rewards out to my teammates so probably
coulda<00:02:42.350> did<00:02:42.470> everything<00:02:42.710> in<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.280> match

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
coulda did everything in this one match

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.030 
coulda did everything in this one match
if<00:02:43.670> i<00:02:43.790> had<00:02:44.230> hardline<00:02:45.230> but<00:02:45.380> again<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.680> this

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
if i had hardline but again this this

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.550 
if i had hardline but again this this
game<00:02:46.220> was<00:02:46.340> played<00:02:46.580> before<00:02:46.760> i<00:02:46.970> even<00:02:47.560> was

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
game was played before i even was

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.650 
game was played before i even was
attempting<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.100> try<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> get<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:50.209> hardline

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
attempting to try to get the hardline

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.699 
attempting to try to get the hardline
pro<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.480> had<00:02:53.570> pretty<00:02:53.780> pretty<00:02:54.170> campus

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
pro so but you had pretty pretty campus

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.140 
pro so but you had pretty pretty campus
this<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.160> not<00:02:55.310> i<00:02:55.550> don't<00:02:55.610> play<00:02:55.820> like<00:02:55.850> this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
this is not i don't play like this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.350 
this is not i don't play like this
normally<00:02:56.480> i<00:02:56.690> running<00:02:56.930> gun<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:58.330> know<00:02:59.330> I

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
normally i running gun but you know I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.150 
normally i running gun but you know I
just<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.840> don't<00:02:59.900> know<00:03:00.020> why<00:03:00.230> why<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.560> decided<00:03:00.860> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
just I don't know why why I decided to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.310 
just I don't know why why I decided to
do<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:01.459> strategy<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.720> just<00:03:02.990> hit<00:03:03.140> me<00:03:03.170> this

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
do this strategy it just hit me this

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.390 
do this strategy it just hit me this
occurred<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.740> me<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.860> know<00:03:03.980> everybody<00:03:04.340> always

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
occurred to me you know everybody always

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.850 
occurred to me you know everybody always
try<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.760> rush<00:03:04.970> Bravo<00:03:05.420> if<00:03:05.900> i<00:03:06.050> just<00:03:06.200> take<00:03:06.380> alpha

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
try to rush Bravo if i just take alpha

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.040 
try to rush Bravo if i just take alpha
and<00:03:07.070> hold<00:03:07.790> down<00:03:07.940> Bravo<00:03:08.270> up<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.660> window<00:03:08.930> I

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
and hold down Bravo up this window I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.540 
and hold down Bravo up this window I
probably<00:03:09.350> could<00:03:09.620> probably<00:03:10.010> could<00:03:10.220> hold<00:03:10.430> it

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
probably could probably could hold it

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.190 
probably could probably could hold it
down<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.240> tested<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.020> actually

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
down and so I tested it and it actually

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.100 
down and so I tested it and it actually
worked<00:03:12.530> pretty<00:03:12.620> well<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:13.160> game<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:14.110> just

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
worked pretty well in this game and just

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.960 
worked pretty well in this game and just
you<00:03:15.560> know<00:03:15.590> coincidentally<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.430> actually<00:03:16.730> fit

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
you know coincidentally it actually fit

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.970 
you know coincidentally it actually fit
in<00:03:17.090> with<00:03:17.300> trying<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.840> get<00:03:18.340> hard<00:03:19.340> line<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:20.570> i

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
in with trying to get hard line so i

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.080 
in with trying to get hard line so i
just<00:03:21.980> keep<00:03:22.100> rinsing<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.489> repeating<00:03:22.580> and<00:03:23.030> as

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
just keep rinsing and repeating and as

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.600 
just keep rinsing and repeating and as
far<00:03:23.269> as<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.570> sea<00:03:24.320> floor<00:03:24.440> pack<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.160> enemy<00:03:25.459> has

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
far as the sea floor pack the enemy has

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.130 
far as the sea floor pack the enemy has
no<00:03:25.790> idea<00:03:26.090> where<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.480> are<00:03:26.660> because<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:27.050> just

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
no idea where you are because it just

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.720 
no idea where you are because it just
shows<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.410> they<00:03:27.620> got<00:03:27.769> killed<00:03:28.040> by<00:03:28.220> safe<00:03:28.489> for

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
shows that they got killed by safe for

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.759 
shows that they got killed by safe for
so<00:03:28.940> they<00:03:29.630> have<00:03:29.780> no<00:03:29.930> idea<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.320> i'm<00:03:30.620> actually

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
so they have no idea that i'm actually

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.949 
so they have no idea that i'm actually
in<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.250> room<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.060> that's<00:03:32.480> why<00:03:32.690> they<00:03:32.810> got

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
in that room and that's why they got

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.560 
in that room and that's why they got
killed<00:03:33.230> from<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:37.180> actually<00:03:38.180> catch<00:03:38.360> them

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
killed from so and actually catch them

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.750 
killed from so and actually catch them
twice<00:03:38.810> with<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.080> same<00:03:39.170> tactic<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.550> seems

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
twice with the same tactic and it seems

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.310 
twice with the same tactic and it seems
like<00:03:40.910> what<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.120> lot<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.420> people<00:03:41.540> like<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.019> do

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
like what a lot of people like to do

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.190 
like what a lot of people like to do
which<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:43.160> just<00:03:43.580> it's<00:03:44.269> not<00:03:44.450> sensible<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.080> me

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
which is just it's not sensible to me

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.740 
which is just it's not sensible to me
but<00:03:46.040> whenever<00:03:46.640> they<00:03:46.850> go<00:03:46.970> capture<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.420> point

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
but whenever they go capture a point

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.240 
but whenever they go capture a point
they<00:03:48.019> can't<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.440> run<00:03:48.650> up<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.890> point<00:03:49.130> and

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
they can't just run up to the point and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.210 
they can't just run up to the point and
crops<00:03:49.519> everybody<00:03:50.120> has<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.390> dolphin<00:03:51.140> dive<00:03:51.410> onto

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
crops everybody has to dolphin dive onto

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.820 
crops everybody has to dolphin dive onto
the<00:03:52.519> flag<00:03:52.790> even<00:03:53.299> if<00:03:53.480> there's<00:03:53.720> no<00:03:54.110> threat<00:03:54.620> or

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
the flag even if there's no threat or

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.400 
the flag even if there's no threat or
enemy<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.910> vicinity<00:03:56.209> dolphin<00:03:56.930> dive<00:03:57.140> onto

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
enemy in the vicinity dolphin dive onto

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.320 
enemy in the vicinity dolphin dive onto
the<00:03:57.560> flag<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:58.370> what<00:03:58.549> ends<00:03:58.730> up<00:03:58.790> happening<00:03:58.850> is

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
the flag so what ends up happening is

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.990 
the flag so what ends up happening is
you<00:03:59.510> dolphin<00:03:59.870> dive<00:04:00.049> 128<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:01.850> immediately

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
you dolphin dive 128 and you immediately

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.060 
you dolphin dive 128 and you immediately
start<00:04:02.390> capturing<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:03.140> they're<00:04:03.560> not<00:04:03.709> worried

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
start capturing and they're not worried

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.650 
start capturing and they're not worried
they're<00:04:04.280> not<00:04:04.400> paying<00:04:04.610> attention<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:05.420> scout

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
they're not paying attention to scout

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.030 
they're not paying attention to scout
the<00:04:05.750> area<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.200> make<00:04:06.320> sure<00:04:06.380> that<00:04:06.650> there<00:04:06.799> is<00:04:06.890> no

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
the area to make sure that there is no

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.160 
the area to make sure that there is no
sea<00:04:07.310> floor<00:04:07.640> claymores<00:04:08.180> around<00:04:08.510> because<00:04:09.049> they

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
sea floor claymores around because they

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.780 
sea floor claymores around because they
just<00:04:09.290> dived<00:04:09.620> right<00:04:09.830> onto<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.310> flag<00:04:10.580> and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
just dived right onto the flag and

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.550 
just dived right onto the flag and
started<00:04:11.090> capturing<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.690> that's<00:04:12.200> why<00:04:12.350> they

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
started capturing and that's why they

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.430 
started capturing and that's why they
don't<00:04:12.739> notice<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.790> big<00:04:14.000> flashing<00:04:14.360> c4<00:04:14.989> pack<00:04:15.260> in

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
don't notice the big flashing c4 pack in

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.490 
don't notice the big flashing c4 pack in
the<00:04:15.530> ground<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:16.330> get<00:04:17.330> multi<00:04:17.780> kills<00:04:17.989> off<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.380> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
the ground and get multi kills off of it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.250 
the ground and get multi kills off of it
so<00:04:19.090> again<00:04:20.090> it's<00:04:20.209> probably<00:04:20.450> won't<00:04:20.660> work<00:04:20.870> every

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
so again it's probably won't work every

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.030 
so again it's probably won't work every
single<00:04:21.440> time<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.770> try<00:04:22.099> it<00:04:22.160> because

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
single time you try it because

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.520 
single time you try it because
you<00:04:23.640> know<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:23.970> team<00:04:24.270> with<00:04:24.480> any<00:04:24.630> type<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:24.960> common

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
you know a team with any type of common

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.480 
you know a team with any type of common
sense<00:04:26.600> won't<00:04:27.600> just<00:04:27.870> rush<00:04:28.830> into<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.190> area

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
sense won't just rush into the area

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.970 
sense won't just rush into the area
gung-ho<00:04:29.790> they<00:04:30.660> probably<00:04:30.930> will<00:04:31.230> see<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.590> c-4

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
gung-ho they probably will see the c-4

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.220 
gung-ho they probably will see the c-4
pack<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.550> destroy<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.000> they<00:04:33.720> probably<00:04:33.990> will

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
pack and destroy it they probably will

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.110 
pack and destroy it they probably will
check<00:04:34.470> up<00:04:34.650> here<00:04:34.860> in<00:04:34.980> this<00:04:35.070> room<00:04:35.310> them<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.880> in

check up here in this room them and in

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.420 
check up here in this room them and in
other<00:04:36.750> adjacent<00:04:37.350> buildings<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.100> make<00:04:38.250> sure

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
other adjacent buildings to make sure

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.150 
other adjacent buildings to make sure
that<00:04:38.640> nobody<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.240> there<00:04:39.390> but<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:41.010> know<00:04:41.040> a

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
that nobody is in there but you know a

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.770 
that nobody is in there but you know a
lot<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.400> people<00:04:41.490> don't<00:04:41.910> play<00:04:42.090> tactically<00:04:42.600> like

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
lot of people don't play tactically like

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.710 
lot of people don't play tactically like
that<00:04:42.960> they<00:04:43.080> do<00:04:43.140> stupid<00:04:43.830> shit<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.430> just<00:04:44.720> run

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
that they do stupid shit and just run

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.720 
that they do stupid shit and just run
around<00:04:45.840> haphazardly<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.830> dolphin<00:04:47.370> diving

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
around haphazardly and dolphin diving

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.550 
around haphazardly and dolphin diving
onto<00:04:48.060> every<00:04:48.360> fucking<00:04:48.780> thing<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:49.140> they<00:04:49.290> can

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
onto every fucking thing that they can

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.730 
onto every fucking thing that they can
I've<00:04:50.460> actually<00:04:50.760> had<00:04:51.630> people<00:04:51.690> dolphin<00:04:52.470> dive

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
I've actually had people dolphin dive

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.610 
I've actually had people dolphin dive
into<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.280> face<00:04:53.580> full<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:53.970> bullets<00:04:54.570> doing<00:04:55.500> that

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
into a face full of bullets doing that

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.930 
into a face full of bullets doing that
stupid<00:04:55.860> shit<00:04:56.280> but<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.810> digress<00:04:58.790> but<00:04:59.790> you're

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
stupid shit but I digress but you're

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.760 
stupid shit but I digress but you're
doing<00:05:00.240> doing<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:00.600> tactic<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.080> said<00:05:01.290> very<00:05:01.560> was

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
doing doing this tactic I said very was

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.200 
doing doing this tactic I said very was
very<00:05:01.980> effective<00:05:02.430> for<00:05:02.460> me<00:05:02.700> in<00:05:02.850> this<00:05:02.970> game

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
very effective for me in this game

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.210 
very effective for me in this game
actually<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.230> match<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.560> did<00:05:04.740> right<00:05:05.040> after

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
actually the match I did right after

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.480 
actually the match I did right after
this<00:05:05.520> where<00:05:06.000> where<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.530> was<00:05:07.530> doing<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.160> actual

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
this where where I was doing the actual

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.360 
this where where I was doing the actual
share<00:05:08.850> packages<00:05:09.390> I<00:05:09.860> wasn't<00:05:10.860> even<00:05:11.100> playing<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
share packages I wasn't even playing a

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.920 
share packages I wasn't even playing a
game<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.550> domination<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.240> was<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.510> same<00:05:12.690> map

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
game of domination I was on the same map

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.630 
game of domination I was on the same map
we're<00:05:13.230> playing<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.560> game<00:05:13.590> of<00:05:13.920> TDM<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.580> I

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
we're playing a game of TDM and I

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.120 
we're playing a game of TDM and I
employed<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.270> same<00:05:15.570> exact<00:05:16.170> tactic<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.710> taking

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
employed the same exact tactic of taking

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.040 
employed the same exact tactic of taking
that<00:05:17.220> building<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.270> one<00:05:18.420> next<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:18.870> and

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
that building and the one next to it and

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.030 
that building and the one next to it and
it<00:05:19.920> worked<00:05:20.160> pretty<00:05:20.400> well<00:05:20.700> for<00:05:21.800> that<00:05:22.800> as<00:05:23.010> well

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
it worked pretty well for that as well

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.810 
it worked pretty well for that as well
so<00:05:26.030> no<00:05:27.950> tactic<00:05:28.950> works<00:05:29.130> pretty<00:05:29.310> well<00:05:29.430> on<00:05:29.700> this

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
so no tactic works pretty well on this

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.520 
so no tactic works pretty well on this
map<00:05:30.090> it's<00:05:30.690> one<00:05:30.810> of<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:30.960> few<00:05:31.140> maps<00:05:31.380> that

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
map it's one of the few maps that

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.280 
map it's one of the few maps that
actually<00:05:31.920> you<00:05:32.010> can<00:05:32.600> hold<00:05:33.600> down<00:05:33.720> two<00:05:34.050> points

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290
