all put it on but you really have to
test<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.489> before<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:35.969> tell<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

full<00:00:36.660> HD<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.920> let's<00:00:38.100> take<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> look

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
full HD or not so let's take a look

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.569 
full HD or not so let's take a look
what's<00:00:38.640> what's<00:00:38.879> inside<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.399> there's<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
what's what's inside so there's the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.590 
what's what's inside so there's the
camera<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.820> extreme

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
camera so so this one is the extreme

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.920 
camera so so this one is the extreme
model<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> lot<00:00:46.920> different<00:00:47.100> than<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
model this is a lot different than the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
model this is a lot different than the
k2000<00:00:48.930> we've<00:00:49.110> done<00:00:49.320> earlier<00:00:49.710> which<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.160> what

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
k2000 we've done earlier which with what

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.240 
k2000 we've done earlier which with what
features<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> flip-down<00:00:51.480> monitor<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
features a flip-down monitor so you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
features a flip-down monitor so you
mount<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> horizontally<00:00:54.300> where's<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.629> one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
mount it horizontally where's this one

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.209 
mount it horizontally where's this one
you<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> mount<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.559> vertically<00:00:55.949> like

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you have to mount it vertically like

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.880 
you have to mount it vertically like
this<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> looks<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.079> bit<00:00:58.289> bigger<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this so it looks a little bit bigger but

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.520 
this so it looks a little bit bigger but
in<00:00:59.129> fact<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.579> pretty<00:00:59.940> much<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> same<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.170> I'm

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
in fact it's pretty much the same so I'm

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
aside from the color there - I think

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.840 
aside from the color there - I think
identical<00:01:33.479> unit<00:01:34.460> they<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.820> like

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
identical unit they all look like

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.469 
identical unit they all look like
point-and-shoot<00:01:36.540> camera<00:01:38.000> one<00:01:39.000> thing<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
point-and-shoot camera one thing that I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.530 
point-and-shoot camera one thing that I
will<00:01:39.840> recommend<00:01:40.020> though<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.640> want<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
will recommend though is if you want to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
will recommend though is if you want to
conceal<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.079> better<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> black<00:01:43.860> black

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
conceal it better get the black black

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
conceal it better get the black black
one<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.119> concealed<00:01:45.570> better<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.170> my

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
one because it concealed better in my

format<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.170> card<00:05:00.430> exposure<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:01.970> can

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
format the card exposure so you can

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.780 
format the card exposure so you can
actually<00:05:02.360> adjust<00:05:02.570> it<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:04.130> have<00:05:04.580> higher

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
actually adjust it to have higher

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.360 
actually adjust it to have higher
exposure<00:05:05.210> lower<00:05:05.660> exposure<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.440> find<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.220> the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
exposure lower exposure I find it the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.250 
exposure lower exposure I find it the
best<00:05:07.400> at<00:05:08.680> 1:1<00:05:09.680> 3rd<00:05:09.980> exposure<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:11.000> it's<00:05:11.840> just<00:05:12.080> a

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
best at 1:1 3rd exposure so it's just a

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.240 
best at 1:1 3rd exposure so it's just a
plea<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.890> decide<00:05:13.220> motion<00:05:13.910> detection<00:05:15.250> etcetera

easier<00:06:56.370> to<00:06:56.430> conceal<00:06:56.880> because<00:06:57.240> you<00:06:57.360> mount<00:06:57.600> it

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
easier to conceal because you mount it

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.150 
easier to conceal because you mount it
horizontally<00:06:58.410> and<00:06:58.440> you<00:06:58.560> have<00:06:58.710> a<00:06:58.740> flip<00:06:59.010> down

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
horizontally and you have a flip down

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.530 
horizontally and you have a flip down
monitor<00:06:59.580> what's<00:06:59.790> this<00:06:59.910> one<00:07:00.120> you<00:07:00.210> mount<00:07:00.419> it

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540

monitor what's this one you mount it
vertically<00:07:00.930> so<00:07:01.580> from<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.910> outside

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
vertically so from the outside

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.970 
vertically so from the outside
perspective<00:07:03.480> it<00:07:03.930> looks<00:07:04.110> a<00:07:04.230> lot<00:07:04.380> bigger<00:07:04.560> but

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
perspective it looks a lot bigger but

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.330 
perspective it looks a lot bigger but
it's<00:07:05.400> about<00:07:06.120> the<00:07:06.270> same<00:07:06.830> they<00:07:07.830> are<00:07:07.860> built<00:07:08.250> in

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
it's about the same they are built in
