00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
out Optimus Prime in robot mode so he

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.580 
out Optimus Prime in robot mode so he
has<00:03:26.620> head<00:03:27.400> articulation<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.690> moves<00:03:28.960> because

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
has head articulation it moves because

has head articulation it moves because
also<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.820> transformation<00:03:31.600> part<00:03:32.290> right

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
also of the transformation part right

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.550 
also of the transformation part right
here<00:03:32.770> so<00:03:33.460> you<00:03:33.550> can<00:03:33.820> push<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.330> head<00:03:34.630> down<00:03:34.660> or

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
here so you can push the head down or

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.580 
here so you can push the head down or
you<00:03:35.770> can<00:03:35.950> lift<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.280> up<00:03:36.460> it's<00:03:37.150> up<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.840> what

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
you can lift it up it's up to you what

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.730 
you can lift it up it's up to you what
your<00:03:39.040> preference<00:03:39.550> is<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.450> other<00:03:40.930> than<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.320> we

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
your preference is so other than that we

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.020 
your preference is so other than that we
have<00:03:41.950> arm<00:03:42.580> articulation<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.630> then<00:03:45.030> graduate

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
have arm articulation and then graduate

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.450 
have arm articulation and then graduate
joint<00:03:46.420> for<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:47.230> really<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.560> ratchet<00:03:48.010> joint<00:03:48.220> but

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
joint for not really a ratchet joint but

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.420 
joint for not really a ratchet joint but
there's<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.820> joint<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.360> elbow<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.890> moves

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
there's a joint for the elbow it moves

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.330 
there's a joint for the elbow it moves
so<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.060> out<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.570> then<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.590> have<00:03:53.740> a<00:03:53.770> subway

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
so in and out and then we have a subway

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.000 
so in and out and then we have a subway
store<00:03:54.610> circulation<00:03:55.180> -<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.680> wrist<00:03:56.680> joint

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
store circulation - and wrist joint

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.810 
store circulation - and wrist joint
right<00:03:57.760> here<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:58.600> fingers<00:03:58.960> move<00:03:59.340> like<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:00.550> it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
right here the fingers move like so it

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.880 
right here the fingers move like so it
opens<00:04:01.240> and<00:04:01.420> close<00:04:01.720> just<00:04:02.260> be<00:04:02.410> careful<00:04:02.710> on<00:04:02.740> the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
opens and close just be careful on the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.980 
opens and close just be careful on the
index<00:04:03.490> finger<00:04:03.580> because<00:04:04.120> sometimes<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:04.690> pops

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
index finger because sometimes it pops

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.640 
index finger because sometimes it pops
out<00:04:05.170> then<00:04:06.160> ratchet<00:04:07.060> join<00:04:07.330> here<00:04:07.930> on<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.380> hips

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
out then ratchet join here on the hips

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.170 
out then ratchet join here on the hips
so<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.520> swivels<00:04:10.330> also<00:04:10.690> in<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.170> out<00:04:12.180> ratchet

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
so it swivels also in and out ratchet

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.560 
so it swivels also in and out ratchet
joints<00:04:13.540> also<00:04:13.690> for<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.680> knees<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.310> an<00:04:16.210> ankle

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
joints also for the knees and an ankle

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.960 
joints also for the knees and an ankle
joint<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.989> pivots<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.100> out<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.549> forward

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
joint the pivots in and out and forward

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.420 
joint the pivots in and out and forward
and<00:04:19.239> back<00:04:19.420> so<00:04:19.870> those<00:04:20.170> are<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> parts<00:04:20.620> for<00:04:21.010> or
