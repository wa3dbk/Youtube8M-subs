00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
power the fact that you have to give it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.230 
power the fact that you have to give it
back<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.140> me<00:01:49.340> that's<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.640> gives<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.000> his

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.859 
back to me that's what gives it his
power<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> produce<00:01:52.590> something

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
power so you have to produce something

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.410 
power so you have to produce something
to<00:01:54.869> get<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.619> money<00:01:55.799> back<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.310> give<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.790> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.360 
to get the money back to give it to to
the<00:01:57.509> bank<00:01:58.490> that's<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.759> gives<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> its<00:02:00.329> power

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
the bank that's what gives it its power

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.470 
the bank that's what gives it its power
now<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.300> just<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:05.060> comprehending<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.120> and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
now is just not comprehending that and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.240 
now is just not comprehending that and
I'm<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.660> okay<00:02:07.170> well<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.530> tried<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.950> explain<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
I'm like okay well I tried to explain it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
I'm like okay well I tried to explain it
another<00:02:08.550> way<00:02:08.729> well<00:02:10.160> it's<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.730> central<00:02:12.360> bank

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
another way well it's the central bank

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.160 
another way well it's the central bank
is<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.990> Sun<00:02:13.260> right<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.720> I'm<00:02:15.720> explaining

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
is like the Sun right and I'm explaining

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.290 
is like the Sun right and I'm explaining
it<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.380> analogy<00:02:17.010> basically<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.150> like

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
it in analogy basically that it's like

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.560 
it in analogy basically that it's like
as<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.810> Sun<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.980> provides<00:02:20.430> heat<00:02:21.030> which<00:02:21.390> is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
as the Sun and it provides heat which is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.330 
as the Sun and it provides heat which is
the<00:02:21.780> dollars<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.870> there's<00:02:24.870> two<00:02:25.170> ways<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.830> at

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the dollars and there's two ways that at

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610 
the dollars and there's two ways that at
the<00:02:26.550> end<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.790> his<00:02:26.940> life<00:02:27.120> cycle<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.600> can<00:02:27.750> end<00:02:27.960> is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the end of his life cycle it can end is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.350 
the end of his life cycle it can end is
one<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:32.250> can<00:02:32.310> explode<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.060> provide

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
one it can it can explode and provide

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.970 
one it can it can explode and provide
you<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> whole<00:02:33.900> lot<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.290> heat<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.800> got

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
you with a whole lot of heat and we got

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.050 
you with a whole lot of heat and we got
and<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.830> or<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.490> turn<00:02:41.490> into<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.790> black<00:02:42.030> hole

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and and or it can turn into a black hole

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.920 
and and or it can turn into a black hole
and<00:02:42.570> provide<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.260> with<00:02:43.410> no<00:02:43.620> heat<00:02:44.630> either<00:02:45.630> way

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
and provide you with no heat either way

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.180 
and provide you with no heat either way
you're<00:02:46.470> dead<00:02:50.270> right<00:02:51.270> is<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.710> do<00:02:53.100> you

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
you're dead right is it is this do you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.160 
you're dead right is it is this do you
understand<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.760> concept<00:02:56.690> another<00:02:57.690> question

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
understand that concept another question

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.430 
understand that concept another question
he<00:02:58.410> asked<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.450> okay<00:03:00.450> how's<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.750> all<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
he asked is okay how's it all going to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.540 
he asked is okay how's it all going to
end<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:02.070> how<00:03:02.990> how<00:03:03.990> could<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.860> obviously<00:03:05.400> I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
end right how how could and obviously I

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.800 
end right how how could and obviously I
don't<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.880> whether<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.300> going<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.690> be<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
don't know whether it's going to be a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.540 
don't know whether it's going to be a
supernova<00:03:07.739> or<00:03:08.250> or<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:09.530> black<00:03:10.530> hole<00:03:10.770> but<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.250> most

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
supernova or or a black hole but I most

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.900 
supernova or or a black hole but I most
likely<00:03:11.820> think<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.360> going<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.630> explode<00:03:12.989> and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
likely think it's going to explode and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.150 
likely think it's going to explode and
and<00:03:14.910> you're<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.989> get<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.530> lot<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.739> dollars

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
and you're going to get a lot of dollars

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.100 
and you're going to get a lot of dollars
but<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.120> go<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.270> other<00:03:21.420> way<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.900> course

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
but it can go the other way of course

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.400 
but it can go the other way of course
right<00:03:22.489> now<00:03:23.489> um<00:03:23.820> uh<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.450> answer<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.230> this

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
right now um uh the the answer to this

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.620 
right now um uh the the answer to this
question<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.670> only<00:03:29.820> guess<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.510> is

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
question is I can only guess and this is

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.199 
question is I can only guess and this is
my<00:03:30.810> guess<00:03:31.280> basically<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.310> think<00:03:32.640> they're<00:03:33.120> going

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
my guess basically I think they're going

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.140 
my guess basically I think they're going
to<00:03:33.270> devalue<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.080> dollar<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:35.610> okay<00:03:35.940> well

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
to devalue the dollar and like okay well

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.370 
to devalue the dollar and like okay well
how<00:03:36.270> do<00:03:36.330> they<00:03:36.480> going<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.690> do<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.989> well<00:03:37.170> what

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
how do they going to do that well what

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.229 
how do they going to do that well what
is<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> dollar<00:03:37.860> measured<00:03:38.310> against<00:03:38.550> other

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
is the dollar measured against other

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.979 
is the dollar measured against other
currencies<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:41.100> how<00:03:42.030> would<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.270> Duvall<00:03:42.780> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
currencies so how would you Duvall you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.050 
currencies so how would you Duvall you
the<00:03:43.620> dollar<00:03:43.800> against<00:03:44.220> or<00:03:44.489> their<00:03:44.610> currency<00:03:45.000> as

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the dollar against or their currency as

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.479 
the dollar against or their currency as
well<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:46.850> give<00:03:47.850> them<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.330> bunch<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> dollars

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
well you give them a bunch of dollars

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.160 
well you give them a bunch of dollars
for<00:03:50.489> something<00:03:50.910> right<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.870> what<00:03:52.050> do<00:03:52.110> they

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
for something right and what do they

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.660 
for something right and what do they
have<00:03:52.700> Treasury<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.850> debt<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:56.100> take<00:03:56.370> you

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
have Treasury and debt so you take you

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.360 
have Treasury and debt so you take you
by<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.910> debts<00:03:57.360> your<00:03:58.019> Treasury<00:03:58.350> notes<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.830> any

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
by the debts your Treasury notes and any

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.790 
by the debts your Treasury notes and any
other<00:03:59.580> debts<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.180> they<00:04:00.360> haven't<00:04:00.800> like

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
other debts that they haven't like

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.790 
other debts that they haven't like
Freddie<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.250> Fannie<00:04:02.370> debt<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.530> then<00:04:04.530> tell

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
Freddie and Fannie debt and then tell

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.650 
Freddie and Fannie debt and then tell
them<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.010> say<00:04:05.310> good<00:04:05.730> luck<00:04:05.760> with<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.060> right

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
them to say good luck with that right

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.190 
them to say good luck with that right
now<00:04:08.000> because<00:04:09.000> everyone<00:04:09.480> has<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.840> mentality

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
now because everyone has the mentality

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.559 
now because everyone has the mentality
that<00:04:10.500> they<00:04:10.769> need<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:10.980> rate<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.340> return

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
that they need a rate of return

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.300 
that they need a rate of return
and<00:04:12.659> they<00:04:13.079> can't<00:04:13.349> just<00:04:13.560> hold<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.890> dollars

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
and they can't just hold the dollars

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.659 
and they can't just hold the dollars
they<00:04:15.299> those<00:04:16.079> owners<00:04:16.470> those<00:04:16.919> central<00:04:17.280> banks

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
they those owners those central banks

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.509 
they those owners those central banks
will<00:04:17.970> try<00:04:18.449> to<00:04:18.680> get<00:04:19.680> rid<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.889> those<00:04:20.100> dollars

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
will try to get rid of those dollars

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.600 
will try to get rid of those dollars
into<00:04:20.759> their<00:04:21.180> complete<00:04:21.660> economy<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.490> only

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
into their complete economy and the only

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.999 
into their complete economy and the only
way<00:04:23.759> they<00:04:23.910> can<00:04:23.970> do<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.720> maybe<00:04:25.410> by<00:04:26.130> up

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
way they can do that is maybe by up

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.570 
way they can do that is maybe by up
there<00:04:29.009> on<00:04:29.570> their<00:04:30.570> currency<00:04:31.080> they<00:04:32.070> can<00:04:32.250> be<00:04:32.400> too

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
there on their currency they can be too

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.230 
there on their currency they can be too
much<00:04:32.729> of<00:04:32.789> that<00:04:32.970> or<00:04:33.270> else<00:04:33.330> then<00:04:33.599> there'd<00:04:33.840> be<00:04:33.990> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
much of that or else then there'd be a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.249 
much of that or else then there'd be a
deflation<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.509> their<00:04:36.720> area<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:39.169> there's<00:04:40.169> a

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
deflation in their area so there's a

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.200 
deflation in their area so there's a
there's<00:04:40.860> there's<00:04:41.310> not<00:04:41.490> much<00:04:41.729> they<00:04:41.940> can<00:04:42.000> do

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
there's there's not much they can do

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.600 
there's there's not much they can do
except<00:04:42.630> by<00:04:42.919> real<00:04:43.919> stuff<00:04:44.690> from<00:04:45.690> from<00:04:46.680> Americans

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
except by real stuff from from Americans

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.430 
except by real stuff from from Americans
from<00:04:48.000> other<00:04:48.330> countries<00:04:48.599> that<00:04:48.930> are<00:04:49.050> willing<00:04:49.259> to

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
from other countries that are willing to

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.640
