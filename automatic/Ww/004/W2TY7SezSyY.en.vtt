this<00:00:22.170> speaker<00:00:22.529> actually<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> replacement

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
this speaker actually is a replacement

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
this speaker actually is a replacement
as<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.000> mentioned<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.600> our<00:00:24.750> Fidelio

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
as you mentioned for our Fidelio

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.470 
as you mentioned for our Fidelio
loudspeaker<00:00:25.949> Fidelia<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.180> popular

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
loudspeaker Fidelia was a very popular

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.589 
loudspeaker Fidelia was a very popular
loudspeaker<00:00:28.439> because<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.760> actually<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.359> very

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
loudspeaker because it actually was very

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.630 
loudspeaker because it actually was very
easy<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.990> drive<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.740> any<00:00:32.009> type<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.489> amplifier

including even single-ended triode so as
we<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.090> replacing<00:00:36.780> Fidelio<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.680> wanted<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
we are replacing Fidelio we wanted to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
we are replacing Fidelio we wanted to
make<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.610> speaker<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.149> even<00:00:39.450> more

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
make this speaker just even more

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.990 
make this speaker just even more
friendly<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.290> tube<00:00:40.829> amplifier<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
friendly for tube amplifier the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
friendly for tube amplifier the
mid-range<00:00:42.329> driver<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> same<00:00:43.469> unit<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
mid-range driver is the same unit that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100 
mid-range driver is the same unit that
we<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.309> using<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.789> our<00:00:44.879> flagship<00:00:45.480> Lohengrin

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
we are using on our flagship Lohengrin

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.979 
we are using on our flagship Lohengrin
loudspeaker<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> very<00:00:47.610> high<00:00:47.879> sensitivity

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
loudspeaker it's a very high sensitivity

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.049 
loudspeaker it's a very high sensitivity
unit<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.320> tweeter<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.920> brand<00:00:50.309> new<00:00:50.520> unit

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
unit the tweeter is a brand new unit

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.930 
unit the tweeter is a brand new unit
also<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.809> extend<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.410> over<00:00:53.280> 40<00:00:53.640> kilohertz

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
also it extend up to over 40 kilohertz

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
also it extend up to over 40 kilohertz
and<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.899> two<00:00:55.140> drivers<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.280> back

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and there are two drivers in the back

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.029 
and there are two drivers in the back
you<00:00:56.789> know<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.449> are<00:00:57.600> 16<00:00:58.020> ohm<00:00:58.170> units<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.859> are

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you know these are 16 ohm units that are

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
you know these are 16 ohm units that are
parallel<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.480> 8<00:01:00.809> ohm

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
parallel so we can have this 8 ohm

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
parallel so we can have this 8 ohm
impedance<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:02.219> very<00:01:02.460> easy<00:01:02.699> for

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
impedance that's very easy for

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.270 
impedance that's very easy for
single-ended<00:01:03.870> triode<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.739> amplifier<00:01:05.159> or

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
any kind of amplifier actually in terms

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
any kind of amplifier actually in terms
of<00:01:07.680> crossover<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.400> speaker<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.000> very

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
design this is very typical also what we

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.819 
design this is very typical also what we
were<00:01:33.299> doing<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> Fidelio<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.680> it's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
were doing with the Fidelio because it's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
were doing with the Fidelio because it's
a<00:01:34.979> multiple<00:01:35.400> cabinet<00:01:36.000> design<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.720> you

a multiple cabinet design you know you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.560 
a multiple cabinet design you know you
have<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> special<00:01:37.770> hopper<00:01:38.670> module<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
have the special hopper module which is

what the upper range it's open because

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.530 
what the upper range it's open because
it<00:02:32.100> depends<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.550> finish<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.120> sometimes

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it depends of the finish and sometimes

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.420 
it depends of the finish and sometimes
we<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:33.990> custom<00:02:34.170> finish<00:02:34.740> also<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.250> we

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
we can do custom finish also that we

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.340 
we can do custom finish also that we
have<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.640> evaluate<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.600> it's<00:02:36.750> hard<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.110> tell

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
have to evaluate so it's hard to tell

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.200 
have to evaluate so it's hard to tell
