00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
crowd will bruin Laura throughout

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.319 
crowd will bruin Laura throughout
because<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.649> his<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.950> lack<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.159> activity<00:01:43.670> and

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
because of his the lack of activity and

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.489 
because of his the lack of activity and
the<00:01:44.450> fact<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.719> he<00:01:44.869> wouldn't<00:01:45.079> step<00:01:45.259> on<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
the fact that he wouldn't step on the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.679 
the fact that he wouldn't step on the
gas<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.889> take<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.100> guy<00:01:46.249> out<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.639> I<00:01:47.479> think

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
gas and take the guy out and I think

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.709 
gas and take the guy out and I think
justifiably<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.329> people<00:01:50.329> are<00:01:50.420> going<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.600> turn

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
justifiably so people are going to turn

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.389 
justifiably so people are going to turn
around<00:01:50.959> and<00:01:51.109> say<00:01:51.200> well<00:01:51.439> may<00:01:51.920> offer<00:01:52.159> fights

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
around and say well may offer fights

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.300 
around and say well may offer fights
