00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.020
 thank you very much thank you thank you 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.240
 Today I am going to talk about my favorites in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:16.139
 the league and besides nfl I am 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 jimena and this is from sanchez but I 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.890
 I'm going to give my favorites for this 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
 liguilla the ones that I think are going to happen 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.100
 but before, as your opinion is what most 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.350
 it matters to me 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.689
 waller his tweets Mauricio Eduardo says 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.849
 that blue cross will make lasagna morelia beat 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 a tie to tiger gene will achieve a this 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.590
 case and saints will settle in his house 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.590
 eugenio laborín at manuel jorge eduardo 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.410
 waldo gonzález avishai ale rosa da silva 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.450
 hugo and toño gonzález believe that saints 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 toluca lion and america pass to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.590
 semifinals and good the truth I think 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.480
 just like you twitterers that they go 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 to move on to the semifinals let's start with the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.010
 first match blue cross against toluca 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.210
 that in the first game there were 30 but 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 I like one thing that surely 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.039
 nobody knows 26 tournaments in tournaments 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.320
 shorts that has disputed the blue cross 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.799
 only twice has he traced the marker 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.140
 so I think blue cross is going to win 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.460
 this match but that already 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.380
 will not go to the semifinal on 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.150
 next game lion against monarchs 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.520
 that we all thought that the beast was going to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.380
 win and suddenly monarchs traces 33 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 but despite this I think that the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.950
 fiera is very confident and they are going to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.840
 get the pass to the semifinal america 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.420
 against tigers that were 22 in the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.430
 volcano I think this can be a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.140
 small advantage for the america because 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.640
 comes the Aztec and others and they come 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.380
 motivated the boys of america I 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.300
 I think that they will win there and the last 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.210
 match of this group saints against 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.390
 roosters in querétaro were 32 I think 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.220
 that saints will win at home my 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.140
 first bet is that all the locals 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.119
 they win the blue cross match against 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.720
 toluca although he wins blue cross advances 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.740
 toluca and this farley will give me 9.90 for 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.410
 weight bet and now the truth them 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.690
 I want to confess something that what I most 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.090
 like in these bets is to bet on the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.039
 nfl with a lot of emotion I like to see 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.350
 all the matches I do not know what will happen 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.119
 with this blog and I do not know what will happen with 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.119
 my life now that the lfp ends 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.810
 and this week of nfl I bet for the 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.300
 matches that for me are the most 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.060
 exciting and this is the first the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.730
 packers that go 551 against the lions 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.470
 that go 65 the last three times that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.510
 these have faced the won 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.880
 green bay which local is the favorite 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.230
 even if they do not have aaron rogers I'm going 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.610
 to go for the detroit lions that I 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.830
 they give 1.43 pesos per weight wagered 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.290
 in this game the truth is very obvious 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.230
 who will win I think is the pats that 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.940
 they take 8 3 against the Texans who go 29 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.650
 the last two times they have 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 faced these teams has won 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.120
 by more than two annotations the patriots 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.250
 so obviously here that patriots is 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.070
 the favorite I'm going to go with them and 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.920
 nothing else gives me 1.25 pesos per peso 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.810
 bet 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.849
 my third bet is in the game of 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.040
 broncos that go 92 against the chips that 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.019
 go 92 also this game I think it 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.489
 is going to make the last ones very interesting 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.290
 three times they have faced 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.480
 victory has been from denver but also 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.980
 they just faced two weeks ago and 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.489
 well I'm going to go for the favorite 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.200
 wins broncos and this gives me 1.47 by weight 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.480
 bet and my fourth and last game in 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.180
 the one that I will bet is on the monday 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.760
 night and it's saints that go 92 against the 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.980
 guys that go 10 to 1 the saints of 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.930
 new orleáns with a very aerial offensive 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.060
 dangerous and like the best ties 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.680
 for my liking another bis against ones 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.930
 sea hawks that in the attack 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.060
 terrestrial are unstoppable this I think that 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.889
 it's a very close game but I'm leaving 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.180
 to go for saint I'll have him again 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.099
 the faith to saints after I 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.230
 they did lose to that the law pair and this 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.409
 bet gives me three pesos per peso 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.409
 bet 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.560
 and all these games I'm going to 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.070
 put in par and gives me 7.88 pesos for 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.070
 weight wagered 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.709
 and these are my bets for the end of 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.500
 week remember to put your 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.330
