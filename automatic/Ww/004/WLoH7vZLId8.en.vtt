00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
just there's not really much to do

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.089 
just there's not really much to do
underwater<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.590> if<00:00:25.920> you're

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
underwater but you know if you're

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.800 
underwater but you know if you're
building<00:00:26.490> something<00:00:26.730> underwater<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.779> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
building something underwater like a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169 
building something underwater like a
tunnel<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:29.130> an<00:00:29.250> underwater<00:00:29.609> house<00:00:29.910> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
tunnel or like an underwater house this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.720 
tunnel or like an underwater house this
will<00:00:30.420> definitely<00:00:30.689> come<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.380> handy<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
will definitely come in handy so the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.850 
will definitely come in handy so the
first<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.050> people<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> lot

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
first one is that what people do a lot

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
first one is that what people do a lot
of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> time<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:35.940> use<00:00:36.090> torches<00:00:36.540> when

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of the time is they use torches when

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.139 
of the time is they use torches when
they<00:00:37.110> start<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> suffocate<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.430> put<00:00:38.850> torch

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
they start to suffocate just put torch

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.119 
they start to suffocate just put torch
on<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> wall<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
on the wall and then you know you get a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.160 
on the wall and then you know you get a
nice<00:00:41.309> little<00:00:41.460> air<00:00:41.730> bubble<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.840> under

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
nice little air bubble they can go under

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.350 
nice little air bubble they can go under
and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> torch<00:00:44.430> pops<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:44.879> again<00:00:45.180> but

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and then the torch pops off again but

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.510 
and then the torch pops off again but
you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.440> replenish<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.340> air

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you know that will replenish your air

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
you know that will replenish your air
supply<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.180> only<00:00:48.390> problem<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
supply but the only problem with this is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
supply but the only problem with this is
that<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.800> needs<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.280> too<00:00:50.520> high<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that it needs to be too high and you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
that it needs to be too high and you
need<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.750> able<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> stand<00:00:52.559> next<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
need to be able to stand next to it you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.369 
need to be able to stand next to it you
can't<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.520> place<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> floor<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.930> do

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
can't just place it on the floor and do

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
can't just place it on the floor and do
it<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.100> doesn't<00:00:56.430> work<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.910> has<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it because that doesn't work it has to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
it because that doesn't work it has to
be<00:00:57.390> head<00:00:58.020> height<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> first

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
be head height so that's the first

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.400 
be head height so that's the first
problem<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.899> second<00:01:01.320> one

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
problem with that one now the second one

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
problem with that one now the second one
is<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.100> people<00:01:02.550> use<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> door

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
is the one that people use with the door

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630 
is the one that people use with the door
you<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> door<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> look<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you just put a door down and look it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640 
you just put a door down and look it
creates<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> lovely<00:01:06.240> air<00:01:06.570> bubble<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.350> sit

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
creates a lovely air bubble you just sit

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
creates a lovely air bubble you just sit
in<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.540> air<00:01:09.689> back

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
in it and then you can get your air back

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
in it and then you can get your air back
have<00:01:10.650> some<00:01:10.830> food<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.640> whatever<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
have some food you know do whatever you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.420 
have some food you know do whatever you
want<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> problem<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.189> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
want but the problem with this is that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.429 
want but the problem with this is that
once<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.200> have

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
once you get out of it you know you have

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
once you get out of it you know you have
to<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.670> over<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to like you go over there and then you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
to like you go over there and then you
run<00:01:19.140> out<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> run<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
run out of there you have to run all the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
run out of there you have to run all the
way<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.820> door<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.689> your

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.039 
way back to this door just to get your
air<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.340> good<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:24.509> say<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
air so this one can be good if say you

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
air so this one can be good if say you
are<00:01:25.320> building<00:01:25.619> an<00:01:25.710> underwater<00:01:26.070> house<00:01:26.369> like

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
are building an underwater house like

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.609 
are building an underwater house like
here<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.240> I've<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.750> always<00:01:28.140> come<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
here so I've just always come back to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.580 
here so I've just always come back to
here<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.490> my<00:01:29.670> um<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:30.180> air<00:01:30.810> bubble<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
here for my um my air bubble or you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
here for my um my air bubble or you
could<00:01:31.770> put<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.100> plant<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.820> couple<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.180> these

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
could put like plant a couple of these

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.060 
could put like plant a couple of these
doors<00:01:33.540> around<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.960> place<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.380> could<00:01:34.530> also<00:01:34.740> work

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
doors around the place I could also work

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.859 
doors around the place I could also work
but<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.880> problem<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
but the problem with this is that you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
but the problem with this is that you
know<00:01:37.140> you're<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.829> mind<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> door

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
know you're gonna have to mind the door

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.219 
know you're gonna have to mind the door
and<00:01:38.729> that'll<00:01:38.939> take<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> while<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and that'll take a while if you want to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.859 
and that'll take a while if you want to
move<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> rely<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.659> one

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
move it and you have to rely on that one

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
move it and you have to rely on that one
spot<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:43.799> air<00:01:44.009> from<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.670> that's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
spot to get your air from so that's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
spot to get your air from so that's
another<00:01:45.689> bad<00:01:45.960> thing<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.619> oh<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:46.950> god

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100

or even knew about it all you do you

don't even have to be on the ground you
can<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.049> say<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:01.860> air<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.399> runs

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
can be up here say if your air just runs

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
can be up here say if your air just runs
out<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.030> you're<00:02:03.149> floating<00:02:03.360> around<00:02:03.540> just

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
out and you're floating around just

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.800 
out and you're floating around just
collect<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.399> bucket<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.790> water<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.420> no<00:02:06.630> matter

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
collect a bucket of water and no matter

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.650 
collect a bucket of water and no matter
where<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.350> an<00:02:07.710> air<00:02:08.190> bubble<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.759> appear

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
where you are an air bubble will appear

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660 
where you are an air bubble will appear
straight<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.259> front<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.619> your<00:02:10.770> face

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
straight in front of your face

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
straight in front of your face
and<00:02:11.790> your<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.690> air<00:02:12.870> will<00:02:13.050> be<00:02:13.170> replenished

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and your your air will be replenished

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.000 
and your your air will be replenished
but<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.360> problem<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
but the one problem with this is that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.680 
but the one problem with this is that
you<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.640> place<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.180> bucket<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.540> water

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
you have to place the bucket of water

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.800 
you have to place the bucket of water
back<00:02:19.080> down<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:20.040> empty<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.520> out<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:21.510> you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
back down to empty it out and then you

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.479 
back down to empty it out and then you
can<00:02:22.050> do<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> again<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> can't

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
can do it again but you know you can't

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.100 
can do it again but you know you can't
just<00:02:23.550> place<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.090> water<00:02:24.270> bucket<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
just place the water bucket in the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.570 
just place the water bucket in the
middle<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.380> nowhere<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.400> actually

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
middle of nowhere you have to actually

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.030 
middle of nowhere you have to actually
go<00:02:27.030> onto<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> floor<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:28.050> at<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> wall<00:02:28.560> or<00:02:28.800> any

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
go onto the floor or at a wall or any

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280 
go onto the floor or at a wall or any
block<00:02:29.430> basically<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.840> place<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.170> back

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
block basically just to place it back

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.559 
block basically just to place it back
down<00:02:31.350> again<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.040> still<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.610> by<00:02:33.120> far<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
down again but this still is by far the

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.630 
down again but this still is by far the
easiest<00:02:33.750> method<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.410> use<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.100> that's<00:02:35.250> about<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
easiest method to use so that's about it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.100 
easiest method to use so that's about it
