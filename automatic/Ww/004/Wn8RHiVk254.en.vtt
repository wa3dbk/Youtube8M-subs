data blue red comes after a comma

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.440 
data blue red comes after a comma
sometimes<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> middle<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
description sometimes it's after a dash

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.450 
description sometimes it's after a dash
sometimes<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:36.870> after<00:00:37.350> beginning<00:00:37.559> now<00:00:38.219> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
sometimes it's after beginning now this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.840 
sometimes it's after beginning now this
happened<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.870> data<00:00:40.290> set<00:00:40.590> was

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
happened because this data set was

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.580 
happened because this data set was
consolidated<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.120> multiple<00:00:42.809> systems<00:00:43.410> in

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
consolidated from multiple systems in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
consolidated from multiple systems in
the<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.160> encode<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.390> color

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the way they encode the color

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.990 
the way they encode the color
information<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.649> different<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.370> each<00:00:47.520> system

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
information was different in each system

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.049 
information was different in each system
now<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.300> could<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:49.050> create<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.710> wild<00:00:50.430> formula

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
now we could just create a wild formula

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.729 
now we could just create a wild formula
here<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:51.989> takes<00:00:52.469> into

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
here that actually takes into

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
here that actually takes into
consideration<00:00:52.770> each<00:00:53.730> bit<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> logic<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
consideration each bit of logic the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.250 
consideration each bit of logic the
colors<00:00:55.410> after<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.039> comma<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.120> color<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
colors after a comma the color is in the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
colors after a comma the color is in the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
middle the color is after a dash the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
middle the color is after a dash the
colors<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> beginning<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.890> no<00:01:02.370> way<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:03.000> do

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
colors at the beginning but no way we do

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.660 
colors at the beginning but no way we do
not<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.710> an<00:01:04.949> amazing

two carat 15 comma now the concept here

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.670 
two carat 15 comma now the concept here
is<00:03:14.980> if<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.670> give<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.000> some<00:03:16.540> big<00:03:17.110> number

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
is if you give it some big number

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.330 
is if you give it some big number
because<00:03:18.370> look<00:03:18.820> up<00:03:19.060> only<00:03:19.450> does<00:03:20.340> approximate

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
because look up only does approximate

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.880 
because look up only does approximate
match<00:03:21.550> it'll<00:03:22.330> just<00:03:22.360> keep<00:03:22.810> searching<00:03:23.440> until<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
match it'll just keep searching until it

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.670 
match it'll just keep searching until it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
finds that number y 2 to the 15th

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.729
