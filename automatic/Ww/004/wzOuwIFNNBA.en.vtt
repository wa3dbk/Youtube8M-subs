00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.850 
removing here and there's disapproves a
Philips<00:02:24.010> head<00:02:24.100> screw<00:02:25.260> underneath<00:02:26.260> here<00:02:26.590> there

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
Philips head screw underneath here there

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.570 
Philips head screw underneath here there
are<00:02:26.980> three<00:02:27.400> cables<00:02:27.850> connected<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.810> card

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
are three cables connected to the card

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.030 
are three cables connected to the card
so<00:02:30.580> whenever<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.810> remove<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.500> card<00:02:32.830> you're

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
so whenever you remove this card you're

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.979 
so whenever you remove this card you're
just<00:02:33.160> going<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> slightly<00:02:33.940> lift<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.570> up<00:02:34.750> and

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
just going to slightly lift it up and

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.470 
just going to slightly lift it up and
disconnect<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.320> cabling<00:02:39.180> I'll<00:02:40.180> show<00:02:40.390> you

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
disconnect the cabling I'll show you

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.620 
disconnect the cabling I'll show you
what<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.660> mean<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:42.310> kind<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.700> stubborn

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
what I mean it's kind of stubborn

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.860 
what I mean it's kind of stubborn
something<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> little<00:02:44.440> bit<00:02:45.000> you'll<00:02:46.000> see<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
something a little bit you'll see the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.690 
something a little bit you'll see the
cables<00:02:47.260> they<00:02:47.320> give<00:02:47.470> me<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.920> enough<00:02:48.220> room<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
cables they give me just enough room to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.670 
cables they give me just enough room to
disconnect<00:02:51.700> cables<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.420> here<00:02:52.630> I'm<00:02:53.320> turning

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
disconnect cables and here I'm turning

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.490 
disconnect cables and here I'm turning
so<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.070> see<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:55.720> cable<00:02:55.930> goes<00:02:56.230> to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
so you can see that this cable goes to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.160 
so you can see that this cable goes to
the<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:56.830> side<00:02:57.070> of<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.400> speaker<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:58.780> goes<00:02:59.019> to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
the one side of the speaker this goes to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.800 
the one side of the speaker this goes to
the<00:02:59.320> other<00:02:59.500> speaker<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.390> then<00:03:01.540> there's<00:03:01.720> a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
the other speaker and then there's a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.300 
the other speaker and then there's a
cable<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.410> middle<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.709> connects<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.250> to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
cable in the middle that connects it to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.509 
cable in the middle that connects it to
the<00:03:03.430> system<00:03:03.970> board<00:03:05.070> basically<00:03:06.070> are<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> going

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
the system board basically are you going

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.220 
the system board basically are you going
to<00:03:06.610> do<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:07.830> get<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.950> new<00:03:09.100> board<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:10.230> replace

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
to do is get the new board and replace

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.020 
to do is get the new board and replace
it<00:03:11.470> doesn't<00:03:12.280> happen<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.519> be<00:03:12.580> anything<00:03:12.850> wrong

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
problem in some cases by loading in the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.610 
problem in some cases by loading in the
drivers<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.239> basically<00:04:19.750> all<00:04:19.900> I'm<00:04:20.109> doing<00:04:20.470> is
