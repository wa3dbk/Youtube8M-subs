 I usually call snape 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.359

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.199
 long distance as I usually call it . 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.809

 things you will see in the video galera 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.610
 Why the locks are giving is my pc 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.740
 Unfortunately you know I followed 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 improvised he's not rolling number 24 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 very well it's actually running a lot 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.710
 Bad I have to unfold protector 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.119
 and gameplay record gameplay then for once 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.930
 I ask gives many excuses for this 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.729
 road says guys but it was worth it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.229
 tutorial and video and today the world is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.549
 enjoy the canal, so live with the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.079
 video 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.939
 Good crowd, let's start by talking about the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.610
 scar banes for those who do not know oak 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.860
 are carbines and they were exclusive to the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.229
 kit in genre number 23 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.259
 But now number was 4 are guns 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.880
 kit or weapons that you can use 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.320
 any kit 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 I honestly am enjoying playing 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.210
 lots of meat and laugh with when you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.969
 should know icom has several 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.640
 equipment now how to pld c4 today you 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.890
 Okay, so it 's quite feasible for you to play with 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.159
 a carbenet a machine gun is well 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.110
 cool for clÃ´ surrenders and mid range and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.420
 same time patience and four you have 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.760
 the rich equipments and equipment of 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.140
 recognition that that ball died 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.420
 I only go back to those who do not know 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.030
 front I will talk about it too c 4 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.110
 etc and this guys because the beta 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.120
 of the game yet because we 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.280
 In the end, I do not know if you know 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.230
 final version we will have many others 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.480
 equipments we will have flu having f3 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.260
 then you know the f3 in your lan as 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.760
 av theme 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.100
 we go main spout or the risk goes 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.740
 be a much used class for this 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.820
 if it is not the most used in the neighborhood 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.800
 painting 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.390
 and for those who think the oak are 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.640
 Do not think so, guys. 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.320
 Oak trees are very strong guys this one. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.090
 home you are playing now 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.890
 it's very strong 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.410
 as you can see, it's not very difficult 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.420
 of killing the guys with her and then cw 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.080
 My friend, it's worse, it's much more 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.550
 strong 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.500
 So what did you think of this? 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.959
 think oak should continue 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.440
 being exclusive to the engineer or you 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.540
 Find your cool now the galley let's 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.630
 talk about the automatic scenes that 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.470
 they are weapons of all kits now and you 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.020
 you can use support snip money or 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.180
 the assault number was three times not 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.700
 it takes automatic were unique to 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.330
 class snipe foot now number 24 she gets 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.360
 called mr designer frames man ray 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.670
 force and they are from all kits 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.900
 they are very good play by the project 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.650
 and now I can see that they are very 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.720
 good 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.280
 If you like to play close with 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.860
 certainty of being automatic is a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.420
 very good option especially if you 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.019
 what I 'm doing in that video there 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.880
 a 4x mira and it was singing site 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.220
 it is very good to play in the middle and 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.830
 short-range use that sighting of 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.290
 corner who tend to were site you have 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.100
 you release it and just press the t key 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.720
 to change 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.400
 at first it 's complicated but after 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.310
 Do you get used to this crosshair? 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.080
 It's very easy and it's very good people 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.239
 then you have a great choice also for 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.890
 Do you like or advance carbine? 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.840
 the first option that I passed and now the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.040
 second semi automatic option 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.900
 Good, I'm going to talk some more about this. 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.640
 alternately first galley 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.190
 I do not advise you to play with this 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.799
 alternate way in assault rifles 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.350
 carbon or machine guns in general 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.840
 in case shooting the iays light machine gun 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.520
 The Chinese girl has to play 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.800
 cool if you have using neighborhood 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.530
 where but to play carbon to the site 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.539
 uai was the pw i do not advise this 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.180
 that's because for machine guns we're going 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.889
 so short and medium range is not 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.539
 It's great that you use three-sided 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.139
 times or four months that that you 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.949
 You know since f3 is like this and it does not 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.210
 changed a lot 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.500
 so when you want to play with mine? 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.330
 that I 'm doing in that 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.870
 video now I advise you to play 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.240
 of semi-automatic dmri or is 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.460
 Of course, a good chance is with the check. 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.560
 chance you're good as this rich man 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.410
 you have a cool reflex you can 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.120
 by an action boot now last at 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.039
 talk a little about the bag a sensor 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.810
 Ball is a ball that you play. 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.360
 similar to a grenade and which is 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.740
 listening for targets next to her if I do not 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.530
 I'm mistaken for a distance of five meters 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.330
 She exports everyone she is without 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.800
 doubt a choice that can not be missed 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.599
 if you play aggressively and with 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.580
 rich class with 11 you can see this 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.710
 I played the ball, I listened to a 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.970
 I've gotten better and better 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.560
 I killed a lot 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.840
 it is worth remembering the guys she also 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.370
 bougadense beta is in the final version 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.470
 she'll probably see it in the same age 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.780
 no bad company 2 you play ball she 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.310
 flashes and appears on the map is medium 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.750
 that she let go of those wrists 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.360
 so those pulses 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.490
 in df 4 beta is not 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.050
 showing this you always get her 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.610
 disappears, you do not see where she is anymore 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.169
 Who is he disputing then you? 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.669
 probably a little bit too 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.860
 let's see if in the final version and still going 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.020
 improve this bag went up so much people 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.490
 used in the ranch galley you played 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.770
 a good chance just missing me this loss 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.150
 with and the guys go there and activate because 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.310
 they will see that they are losing and with 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.590
 who was not there was too many faces 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.120
 the actress million in rush 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.889
 I hope it continues to be useful so 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.440
 in neighborhood four in the final version 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.060
 will start to see the hook matches that 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.810
 will get to that ours will te ranch 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.669
 etc 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.789
 is a very good equipment there and does not 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.530
 may lack for the rich an aggressive 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.580
 so this is it expected to be enjoy 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.110
 I hope this video helped 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.580
 you somehow 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.199
