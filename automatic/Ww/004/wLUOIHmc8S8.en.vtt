suburban kind of environment you know

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
suburban kind of environment you know
your<00:00:48.989> laws<00:00:49.200> will<00:00:49.710> vary<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> weather<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.579> can

carry<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> fixed<00:00:51.360> blade<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
carry a fixed blade but if you can and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
carry a fixed blade but if you can and
you<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> idea<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> Azula<00:00:54.840> -

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you like the idea I think the Azula -

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.200 
you like the idea I think the Azula -
makes<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> great<00:00:55.500> EDC<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> help<00:00:57.059> illustrate

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
makes a great EDC so to help illustrate

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
makes a great EDC so to help illustrate
that<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> couple<00:00:58.410> size<00:00:58.680> comparisons

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
that I do have a couple size comparisons

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.939 
that I do have a couple size comparisons
and<00:00:59.579> first<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.539> I've<00:01:00.690> got<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> SE<00:01:01.350> Candiru

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and first up I've got the SE Candiru

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
and first up I've got the SE Candiru
which<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> smaller<00:01:02.910> cousin<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
which is like the smaller cousin to the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.219 
which is like the smaller cousin to the
Azula<00:01:04.500> -<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.100> I've<00:01:05.460> also<00:01:05.610> got<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.330> se3<00:01:06.840> which

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Azula - and I've also got this se3 which

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.140 
Azula - and I've also got this se3 which
is<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> larger<00:01:08.010> knife<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> camp<00:01:08.939> knife

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
is a larger knife more of a camp knife

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.250 
is a larger knife more of a camp knife
in<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:10.020> opinion<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.299> as<00:01:12.299> Goldilocks<00:01:12.960> might

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
in my opinion and as Goldilocks might

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.289 
in my opinion and as Goldilocks might
say<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.740> Zulu<00:01:14.130> -<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:14.610> too<00:01:14.790> big<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.060> too

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
say the Zulu - it's not too big not too

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.230 
say the Zulu - it's not too big not too
small<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.610> daily<00:01:17.880> carrying

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
small it's just right for daily carrying

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
small it's just right for daily carrying
great<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.780> personal<00:01:19.170> fixed-blade<00:01:19.619> let's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
great little personal fixed-blade let's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.330 
great little personal fixed-blade let's
take<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> closer<00:01:21.060> look<00:01:21.210> at<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> blade<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
take a closer look at the blade here and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
take a closer look at the blade here and
what<00:01:23.340> we've<00:01:23.460> got<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> modified<00:01:24.540> drop<00:01:24.960> point

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
what we've got is a modified drop point

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
what we've got is a modified drop point
really<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> guess<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> regular<00:01:26.939> drop

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
really I guess it's just a regular drop

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.350 
really I guess it's just a regular drop
point<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.479> classic<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.350> business<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
point it's very classic all business you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.300 
point it's very classic all business you
get<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.630> nice<00:01:31.020> amount<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> belly<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.130> been

three sub 3-inch long blade and I'll
tell<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.519> do<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:21.090> takes<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.420> little

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
tell you it can do it it takes a little

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
tell you it can do it it takes a little
bit<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.780> technique<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.909> do

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
bit of technique but if you have to do

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.449 
bit of technique but if you have to do
it<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.390> totally<00:02:24.750> possible<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.220> can

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
it it's totally possible so you can

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.770 
it it's totally possible so you can
baton<00:02:26.760> with<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> blade<00:02:27.299> is<00:02:27.450> held<00:02:27.629> up

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
baton with it and the blade is held up

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.979 
baton with it and the blade is held up
famously<00:02:28.290> there's<00:02:28.530> no<00:02:28.680> chipping<00:02:29.129> or<00:02:29.400> cracking

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
famously there's no chipping or cracking

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.259 
famously there's no chipping or cracking
or<00:02:30.989> anything<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.830> edges<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.430> as

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
or anything like that the edges on as

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.759 
or anything like that the edges on as
true<00:02:33.629> as<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.780> ever<00:02:33.959> was<00:02:34.049> although<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.530> have

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
true as it ever was although I have

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.650 
true as it ever was although I have
sharpened<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.519> multiple<00:02:36.000> times<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.540> this

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
sharpened this on multiple times at this

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.619 
sharpened this on multiple times at this
point<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.799> it's<00:02:38.129> just<00:02:38.280> great<00:02:38.430> stuff<00:02:38.700> now<00:02:38.760> 1095

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
point so it's just great stuff now 1095

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.830 
point so it's just great stuff now 1095
is<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.440> non<00:02:40.709> stainless<00:02:41.190> steel<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.760> they

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
is a non stainless steel so they

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.369 
is a non stainless steel so they
powder-coated<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.959> blade

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
powder-coated this blade

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.500 
powder-coated this blade
give<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.980> nice<00:02:44.099> powder<00:02:44.730> coat<00:02:44.970> finish<00:02:45.299> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
give it a nice powder coat finish and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.420 
give it a nice powder coat finish and
it's<00:02:46.260> holding<00:02:46.560> up<00:02:46.680> real<00:02:46.829> well<00:02:47.010> although<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it's holding up real well although you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.800 
it's holding up real well although you
definitely<00:02:47.849> want<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.000> keep<00:02:48.120> some<00:02:48.329> oil<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.780> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
definitely want to keep some oil on it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.309 
definitely want to keep some oil on it
so<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.950> there<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.280> go<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.760> blade

together and one piece of constructive
criticism<00:03:50.940> would<00:03:51.569> be<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.930> fact<00:03:52.139> that<00:03:52.200> they

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
criticism would be the fact that they

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.559 
criticism would be the fact that they

they take a Torx bit you know when

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.059 
they take a Torx bit you know when
you're<00:03:54.720> banging<00:03:55.139> on<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.349> knife<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.799> you<00:03:55.829> are

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
you're banging on this knife if you are

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.890 
you're banging on this knife if you are
batana<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.849> or<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.299> doing<00:03:57.419> some<00:03:57.629> hard

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
batana with it or just doing some hard

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.990 
batana with it or just doing some hard
cutting<00:03:58.169> it's<00:03:58.530> possible<00:03:59.129> for<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.579> handle

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
cutting it's possible for the handle

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.240 
cutting it's possible for the handle
scales<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.359> get<00:04:00.510> kind<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.810> loose<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.349> if

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
scales to get kind of loose and if

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.949 
scales to get kind of loose and if
you're<00:04:02.370> out<00:04:02.489> there<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.510> woods

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
you're out there in the woods

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.690 
you're out there in the woods
I<00:04:04.049> mean<00:04:04.290> odds<00:04:04.560> are<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.919> don't<00:04:04.950> have<00:04:05.099> your<00:04:05.310> Torx

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
I mean odds are you don't have your Torx

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.640 
I mean odds are you don't have your Torx
bits<00:04:06.510> with<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.139> don't<00:04:07.200> have<00:04:07.349> your<00:04:07.470> torch

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
bits with you you don't have your torch

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.150 
bits with you you don't have your torch
drivers<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.540> almost<00:04:09.810> impossible<00:04:10.620> to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
drivers so it's almost impossible to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.530 
drivers so it's almost impossible to
tighten<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.519> handle<00:04:11.790> scales<00:04:11.940> back<00:04:12.209> up<00:04:12.389> when

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
tighten the handle scales back up when

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.119 
tighten the handle scales back up when
you're<00:04:12.660> out<00:04:12.780> there<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:13.139> would<00:04:13.590> recommend<00:04:14.069> just

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
you're out there I would recommend just

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.969 
you're out there I would recommend just
switching<00:04:14.639> to<00:04:14.790> some<00:04:15.060> flathead<00:04:15.720> screws<00:04:16.560> that

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
switching to some flathead screws that

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.650 
switching to some flathead screws that
way<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.250> could<00:04:17.430> use<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.579> coin<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.239> could<00:04:18.449> use

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
way you could use a coin you could use

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.089 
way you could use a coin you could use
your<00:04:18.840> Swiss<00:04:19.019> Army<00:04:19.320> knife<00:04:19.470> or<00:04:19.709> whatever<00:04:19.950> you

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
your Swiss Army knife or whatever you

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.770 
your Swiss Army knife or whatever you
got<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.789> tighten<00:04:20.969> the<00:04:21.120> thing<00:04:21.329> down

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
got to tighten the thing down

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.840 
got to tighten the thing down
and<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.320> think<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.680> would<00:04:22.770> be<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.920> nice<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.340> nice

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and I think that would be a nice a nice

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.630 
and I think that would be a nice a nice
little<00:04:24.120> improvement<00:04:25.040> over<00:04:26.040> these<00:04:26.160> original

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
little improvement over these original

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.550 
little improvement over these original
screws<00:04:26.940> but<00:04:27.240> that's<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.110> worst<00:04:28.260> thing<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.470> have

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
screws but that's the worst thing I have

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.750 
screws but that's the worst thing I have
to<00:04:28.620> say<00:04:28.650> about<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.040> handle<00:04:29.340> I'd<00:04:29.430> say<00:04:29.580> it's<00:04:29.730> a

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
to say about the handle I'd say it's a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.670 
to say about the handle I'd say it's a
pretty<00:04:29.910> rockin<00:04:30.420> handle<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:30.960> really<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.560> is

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
pretty rockin handle and really it is

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.040 
pretty rockin handle and really it is
