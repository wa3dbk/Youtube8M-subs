my sketch now the next thing to to do to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.480 
my sketch now the next thing to to do to
develop<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.480> design<00:02:19.840> is<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:21.160> could

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
develop this design is that you could

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.800 
develop this design is that you could
use<00:02:21.750> standard<00:02:23.460> SolidWorks<00:02:24.540> electrical<00:02:25.540> tools

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
use standard SolidWorks electrical tools

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:34.050 
use standard SolidWorks electrical tools
to<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:27.100> example<00:02:28.200> edit<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.740> route<00:02:32.700> which<00:02:33.700> we

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
to for example edit the route which we

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.600 
to for example edit the route which we
can<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.660> if<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.680> grab<00:02:36.070> hold<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.490> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
can see if I can just grab hold of the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.930 
can see if I can just grab hold of the
route<00:02:36.790> itself<00:02:37.210> there<00:02:37.510> we<00:02:37.660> go<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.550> what<00:02:39.850> we

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
route itself there we go so what we

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.110 
route itself there we go so what we
could<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.420> choose<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.930> edit<00:02:41.380> route<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.400> if

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
could do is choose to edit route and if

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.360 
could do is choose to edit route and if
you<00:02:43.240> wanted<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:44.260> could<00:02:44.380> delete<00:02:44.770> some<00:02:45.340> of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
you wanted to you could delete some of

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.940 
you wanted to you could delete some of
these<00:02:45.610> lines<00:02:45.690> put<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.780> splines<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.530> their

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
these lines put in splines in their

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.110 
these lines put in splines in their
place<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.560> develop<00:02:50.560> your<00:02:51.010> harness<00:02:51.760> design

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
place and develop your harness design

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.740 
place and develop your harness design
that<00:02:52.600> way<00:02:52.840> if<00:02:53.260> you're<00:02:53.980> happy<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.600> way

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
that way if you're happy with the way

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.250 
that way if you're happy with the way
everything<00:02:55.990> looks<00:02:56.640> then<00:02:57.640> what<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.300> can<00:02:58.420> do<00:02:58.630> is

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
everything looks then what you can do is

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.010 
everything looks then what you can do is
simply<00:03:00.070> add<00:03:00.280> your<00:03:01.770> connectors<00:03:03.060> into<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:07.020> sub

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
simply add your connectors into your sub

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.190 
simply add your connectors into your sub
assembly<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.610> just<00:03:10.450> by<00:03:10.600> selecting<00:03:10.810> them

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
assembly like so just by selecting them

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.220 
assembly like so just by selecting them
and<00:03:11.260> dragging<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.739> dropping<00:03:11.920> them<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.230> they

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
and dragging and dropping them and they

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.890 
and dragging and dropping them and they
will<00:03:14.440> now<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.680> included<00:03:14.980> when<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.239> run<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
will now be included when you run the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.620 
will now be included when you run the
flattened<00:03:17.410> route<00:03:17.620> command<00:03:18.010> now<00:03:18.760> before<00:03:19.269> you

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
flattened route command now before you

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.740 
flattened route command now before you
do<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.110> one<00:03:20.739> important<00:03:21.310> step<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.690> you

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
do that one important step is that you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.229 
do that one important step is that you
do<00:03:23.140> need<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.790> edit<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.900> route<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:27.610> reason<00:03:28.000> for

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
do need to edit the route the reason for

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.380 
do need to edit the route the reason for
that<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.700> reforms<00:03:30.700> connections

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
that is that it reforms connections

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.150 
that is that it reforms connections
between<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.989> actual<00:03:32.260> connection<00:03:32.709> points<00:03:33.070> on

between the actual connection points on

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.360 
between the actual connection points on
the<00:03:33.250> connectors<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.959> lines<00:03:35.709> connecting

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
the connectors and the lines connecting

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.500 
the connectors and the lines connecting
to<00:03:36.670> them<00:03:37.260> once<00:03:38.260> that's<00:03:38.500> done<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:42.940> use

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
to them once that's done you can use

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.960 
to them once that's done you can use
standard<00:03:44.050> electrical<00:03:44.680> tools<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.280> choose<00:03:45.760> to

flatten<00:03:46.420> route<00:03:46.630> for<00:03:47.080> example<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.930> going<00:03:50.110> to

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
flatten route for example just going to

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.650
