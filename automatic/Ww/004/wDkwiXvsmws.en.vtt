a<00:00:59.070> lot<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> haven't<00:01:00.660> had<00:01:00.750> time<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
a lot more so I haven't had time to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
a lot more so I haven't had time to
really<00:01:01.320> play<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.620> much<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.359> know<00:01:03.480> this

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
than before my breath almost went out

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.890 
than before my breath almost went out
there<00:04:52.580> I<00:04:52.790> mean<00:04:52.940> stats<00:04:53.360> don't<00:04:53.600> really

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
there I mean stats don't really

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900 
there I mean stats don't really
determine<00:04:54.380> how<00:04:54.500> good<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.770> player<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:55.280> I'm

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
determine how good a player is I'm

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.060 
determine how good a player is I'm
before<00:04:56.479> you<00:04:56.570> could<00:04:56.720> dashboard<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.560> now<00:04:57.830> if

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
before you could dashboard and now if

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.830 
before you could dashboard and now if
you<00:04:58.220> dashboard<00:04:58.790> your<00:04:59.030> stats<00:04:59.330> will<00:04:59.540> still

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
you dashboard your stats will still

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.100 
you dashboard your stats will still
decrease<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:01.270> they<00:05:02.270> don't<00:05:02.450> really<00:05:02.570> determine

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
decrease and they don't really determine

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.170 
decrease and they don't really determine
how<00:05:03.440> good<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:03.770> player<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:04.250> because<00:05:04.669> you<00:05:04.880> can<00:05:05.060> be

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
how good a player is because you can be

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.719 
how good a player is because you can be
messing<00:05:05.570> around<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:05.900> pubs<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:07.550> could

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
messing around in pubs and you could

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.990 
messing around in pubs and you could
still<00:05:07.940> be<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.090> MLG<00:05:08.450> Pro<00:05:08.810> like<00:05:09.100> for<00:05:10.100> example<00:05:10.220> when

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
still be a MLG Pro like for example when

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.750 
still be a MLG Pro like for example when
assertion<00:05:11.419> is<00:05:11.510> store<00:05:11.720> round<00:05:11.930> is<00:05:12.110> over<00:05:12.260> I

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
assertion is store round is over I

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.610 
assertion is store round is over I
usually<00:05:13.760> always<00:05:13.970> shoot<00:05:14.630> in<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.810> air<00:05:14.930> like

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
usually always shoot in the air like

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.700 
usually always shoot in the air like
crazy<00:05:15.950> so<00:05:16.310> my<00:05:16.490> accuracy<00:05:16.970> decreases<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:17.900> does

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
crazy so my accuracy decreases and does

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.469 
crazy so my accuracy decreases and does
that<00:05:18.830> really<00:05:19.070> show<00:05:19.370> how<00:05:19.550> accurate<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.180> am<00:05:20.330> with

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
that really show how accurate I am with

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.409 
that really show how accurate I am with
the<00:05:20.600> gun<00:05:20.780> not<00:05:21.410> really<00:05:21.770> because<00:05:22.240> when<00:05:23.240> you

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
the gun not really because when you

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.850 
the gun not really because when you
shoot<00:05:23.630> up<00:05:23.780> in<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.020> air<00:05:24.139> your<00:05:24.350> accuracy<00:05:24.680> is

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
shoot up in the air your accuracy is

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.170 
shoot up in the air your accuracy is
going<00:05:25.039> to<00:05:25.100> decrease<00:05:25.400> it's<00:05:25.760> going<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.030> look

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
going to decrease it's going to look

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.940 
going to decrease it's going to look
like<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.570> miss<00:05:26.780> all<00:05:26.990> your<00:05:27.110> shots<00:05:27.350> when<00:05:27.680> you<00:05:27.800> in
