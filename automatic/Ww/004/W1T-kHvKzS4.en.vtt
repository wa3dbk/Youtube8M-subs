00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.720
 Today we show you how to make a healthy liquid stevia. 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.410
 Undoubtedly the stevia sweetener in the market 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.810
 and if we make it homemade much better we introduce the dry stevia that you can get 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.410
 in any herbalist, in a cauldron with water and heat it to a fire 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.820
 half for half an hour as if we had a giant infusion 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:46.050
 Mila is spinning from time to time 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:01:25.570
 After half an hour we filter it with the help of a strainer the color of the resulting infusion 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 It is very dark, similar to coffee 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.250
 we help ourselves with the spoon to press everything well 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.380
 We return to deposit the liquid in the big pileup, 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.990
 because what we want now is to reduce the liquid that evaporates to achieve 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.970
 stevia is reduced, we leave it to fire for about 2 hours. 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.390
 While Enrique goes around him from time to time, 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.189
 After some time stevia has already achieved the desired concentration, 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.079
 remember that the sweetening power of stevia is 200 times higher than that of sugar, 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.799
 so with a few drops it will be enough to sweeten it, we put it in a container and 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.270
 it can last us several months in the refrigerator, if you prefer it in powder instead of liquid 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:14.430
 we explain it to you in the video that is at the end of the credits 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:30.840
 and that's how it is, we hope you like it and HEALTH FOR ALL!
