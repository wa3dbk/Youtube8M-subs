00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
past few weeks that use air wraps which

past few weeks that use air wraps which
ironically<00:00:13.410> i've<00:00:13.769> found<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> better<00:00:14.219> number<00:00:14.370> of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
ironically i've found a better number of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
ironically i've found a better number of
them<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:16.460> i'm<00:00:17.690> kind<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> drink<00:00:19.020> playing<00:00:19.260> for

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
them and i'm kind of a drink playing for

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.890 
them and i'm kind of a drink playing for
right<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:19.710> especially<00:00:19.949> since<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.750> one

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
right now especially since this is one

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.330 
right now especially since this is one
of<00:00:21.930> those<00:00:22.050> moves<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.650> back<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> day<00:00:23.189> i

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
of those moves that back in the day i

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.009 
of those moves that back in the day i
thought<00:00:23.580> was<00:00:23.699> kind<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> useless<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:24.840> glad

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
thought was kind of useless so I'm glad

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.359 
thought was kind of useless so I'm glad
that<00:00:25.140> I'm<00:00:25.350> finding<00:00:25.650> stuff<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.980> goes<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.160> it

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that I'm finding stuff that goes with it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.470 
that I'm finding stuff that goes with it
down<00:00:27.529> yeah<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.760> start<00:00:29.910> off<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.390> to

down yeah so to start off we're going to
talk<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.869> doing<00:00:31.710> contact<00:00:32.309> point<00:00:32.579> moves

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
talk about doing contact point moves

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.080 
talk about doing contact point moves
that<00:00:33.239> involve<00:00:33.600> arrows<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

that involve arrows the first one is
actually<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.899> move<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:38.059> start<00:00:39.059> playing<00:00:39.329> with

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
actually a move that start playing with

at wildfire but I couldn't get to work

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.020 
at wildfire but I couldn't get to work

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
there and can figure out why the good

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.560 
there and can figure out why the good
news<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.780> figured<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.230> why<00:00:46.440> no

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
news is is that I figured out why no

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.840 
news is is that I figured out why no
movement<00:00:48.570> question<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.710> doing<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.460> same

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
movement question is doing that same

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
movement question is doing that same
flow<00:00:51.480> throw<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.870> contact<00:00:54.870> cradle<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
flow throw to the contact cradle that I

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
flow throw to the contact cradle that I
demonstrated<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.699> couple<00:00:57.000> weeks<00:00:57.120> ago<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
demonstrated a couple weeks ago that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
demonstrated a couple weeks ago that
Marvin<00:00:57.960> taught<00:00:58.140> me<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> burning<00:00:58.500> man<00:00:58.829> i<00:00:59.039> really

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
Marvin taught me of burning man i really

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.910 
Marvin taught me of burning man i really
wanted<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> find<00:01:00.570> something<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.199> cooler<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
wanted to find something a cooler way to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
wanted to find something a cooler way to
exit<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.539> away

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
exit out of this and now we go away

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.130 
exit out of this and now we go away
which<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.890> toss<00:01:05.519> out<00:01:05.760> boy<00:01:08.659> when<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.930> toss

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
which is that toss out boy when you toss

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.260 
which is that toss out boy when you toss
up<00:01:10.409> boy<00:01:10.970> into

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.300 

you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> catch<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.940> into<00:01:20.940> an<00:01:21.060> era<00:01:22.010> when<00:01:23.010> we<00:01:23.100> try

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you can catch it into an era when we try

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640 
you can catch it into an era when we try
this<00:01:23.370> a<00:01:23.550> wildfire<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.990> were<00:01:25.110> trying<00:01:25.260> it<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
this a wildfire we were trying it with a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.820 
this a wildfire we were trying it with a
boy<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.160> same<00:01:26.430> direction<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.680> were

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
boy in same direction and we were

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.720 
boy in same direction and we were
confused<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.460> hell<00:01:29.510> because<00:01:30.510> we<00:01:30.930> couldn't<00:01:31.260> get

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
confused as hell because we couldn't get

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.410 
confused as hell because we couldn't get
the<00:01:32.730> arab<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.420> take<00:01:34.340> they<00:01:35.340> kept<00:01:35.730> slipping<00:01:36.030> past

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the arab to take they kept slipping past

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.540 
the arab to take they kept slipping past
each<00:01:36.690> other<00:01:36.870> in<00:01:37.110> midair<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.340> couldn't

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
each other in midair and we couldn't

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.790 
each other in midair and we couldn't
figure<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.970> why<00:01:40.070> if<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:42.060> let<00:01:42.360> boy<00:01:43.290> establish

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
figure out why if we let boy establish

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.760 
figure out why if we let boy establish
itself<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.370> being<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.000> doable<00:01:45.650> but<00:01:46.650> we

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
itself for being it was doable but we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
itself for being it was doable but we
couldn't<00:01:47.070> actually<00:01:47.190> catch<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.820> weight<00:01:48.300> down

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
couldn't actually catch it weight down

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.940 
couldn't actually catch it weight down
and<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.800> know<00:01:49.980> why<00:01:51.170> when<00:01:52.220> oops<00:01:54.890> wouldn't<00:01:55.890> we

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and now I know why when oops wouldn't we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
and now I know why when oops wouldn't we
catch<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> boy<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.730> this<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.330> we<00:01:57.930> sling<00:01:58.230> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
catch the boy like this and we sling it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.780 
catch the boy like this and we sling it
off<00:01:58.470> regardless<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.220> direction<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.640> we

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
off regardless the direction that we

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.060 
off regardless the direction that we
sling<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.150> off<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.960> boy<00:02:01.200> has<00:02:01.500> direction<00:02:01.980> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
sling it off the boy has direction of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.530 
sling it off the boy has direction of
choices<00:02:02.340> down<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.210> that's<00:02:03.390> where

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
choices down because that's where

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.240 
choices down because that's where
gravity<00:02:03.720> is<00:02:03.900> telling<00:02:04.230> it<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> go<00:02:04.590> there's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
gravity is telling it to go there's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.000 
gravity is telling it to go there's
absolutely<00:02:05.490> no<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.200> for<00:02:07.200> us<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.290> make<00:02:07.530> boy<00:02:07.830> and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
absolutely no way for us to make boy and

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.780 
absolutely no way for us to make boy and
go<00:02:08.130> up<00:02:08.340> instead<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:09.770> must<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.920> throw<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.610> like

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
go up instead I must be throw it like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.010 
go up instead I must be throw it like
that

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
that

of the boys going up when this boy goes
down<00:02:59.030> it's<00:03:00.030> very<00:03:00.270> easy<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.840> be<00:03:01.050> caught<00:03:01.320> by<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
down it's very easy to be caught by the

down it's very easy to be caught by the
tether<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> unemployed<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.960> switching

tether of the unemployed and switching

tether of the unemployed and switching
to<00:03:04.470> an<00:03:04.560> Arab<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> we<00:03:06.180> toss<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:07.500> fetch<00:03:08.030> we<00:03:09.030> make

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
to an Arab so we toss we fetch we make

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.310 
to an Arab so we toss we fetch we make
sense<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:12.050> Ted<00:03:13.050> then<00:03:13.200> we're

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
sense just like that and Ted then we're

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.570 
sense just like that and Ted then we're
trying<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.830> into<00:03:14.100> an<00:03:14.190> air<00:03:14.400> around

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
trying to do this into an air around

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.790 
trying to do this into an air around
which<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:14.970> rather<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:16.110> orbital<00:03:16.560> which<00:03:16.650> is

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
which is rather in orbital which is

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.530 
which is rather in orbital which is
stowed<00:03:17.010> still<00:03:17.520> totally<00:03:17.700> doable<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:18.420> they

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
stowed still totally doable but they

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.970 
stowed still totally doable but they
don't<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.810> subway<00:03:19.260> on<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.590> Delta

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
don't have a subway on the Delta

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.590 
don't have a subway on the Delta
orbitals<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.610> this<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.060> solution<00:03:21.240> from

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
orbitals so this is the solution from

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.160 
orbitals so this is the solution from
time<00:03:21.870> bank<00:03:22.110> once<00:03:23.070> again<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:24.239> catch<00:03:24.450> your

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
time bank once again you catch your

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.070 
time bank once again you catch your
cradle<00:03:25.560> toss<00:03:26.720> Arab<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.560> fix<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:29.000> awesome<00:03:30.080> but

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
cradle toss Arab you fix it awesome but

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080 
cradle toss Arab you fix it awesome but
the<00:03:31.380> question<00:03:31.709> remains<00:03:32.010> are<00:03:32.670> there<00:03:32.970> any

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
the question remains are there any

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.449 
the question remains are there any
contact<00:03:33.570> moves<00:03:33.810> we're<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> Arab

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
contact moves we're in it to the Arab

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.310 
contact moves we're in it to the Arab
out<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.820> same<00:03:35.970> direction<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.840> fact<00:03:37.050> there

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
out of same direction and in fact there

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.130 
out of same direction and in fact there
are<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:38.150> simple<00:03:39.150> forum<00:03:39.540> transfer<00:03:40.340> will<00:03:41.340> yield

are a simple forum transfer will yield

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.120 
are a simple forum transfer will yield
exactly<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.230> kind<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.500> movement<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.890> want

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
exactly the kind of movement you want
