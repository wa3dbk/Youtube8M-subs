00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
recording so you folks have been asking

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.999 
recording so you folks have been asking
about<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.120> little<00:00:03.600> bee<00:00:03.689> vac<00:00:03.929> system<00:00:04.170> that

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
about how the little bee vac system that

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.800 
about how the little bee vac system that
I<00:00:05.040> put<00:00:05.339> together<00:00:05.480> cobbled<00:00:06.480> together<00:00:06.540> and

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
I put together cobbled together and

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.169 
I put together cobbled together and
works<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.799> realized<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.309> didn't<00:00:08.550> even<00:00:08.910> show

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
works and I realized I didn't even show

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.919 
works and I realized I didn't even show
picture<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.840> thing<00:00:10.370> so<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.599> trap

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
picture in the thing so this is the trap

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.129 
picture in the thing so this is the trap
this<00:00:13.740> goes<00:00:14.070> inside<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> bucket<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.020> lot<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this goes inside the bucket a lot of

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.550 
this goes inside the bucket a lot of
airspace<00:00:16.529> around<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.920> lid<00:00:20.210> here<00:00:21.380> this<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
airspace around it the lid here this is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.599 
airspace around it the lid here this is
where<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.740> bees<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.160> sucked<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.580> through

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
where the bees get sucked in through

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
where the bees get sucked in through
this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.779> course<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.230> air<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.650> goes<00:00:25.740> back

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
this is of course the air that goes back

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
this is of course the air that goes back
to<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.220> vacuum<00:00:29.779> there<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.109> valve

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
to the vacuum there would be a valve

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.810 
to the vacuum there would be a valve
here<00:00:31.500> except<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> suction<00:00:32.399> that's<00:00:32.489> fine

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
here except the suction that's fine

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
here except the suction that's fine
through<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.870> hole<00:00:34.110> even<00:00:34.559> though<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.860> hole

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
through that hole even though that hole

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.150 
through that hole even though that hole
is<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.340> over<00:00:41.899> this<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.530> attachment<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
is right over this with an attachment to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:54.650 
is right over this with an attachment to
it<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.230> it's<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.300> section<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> fine

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it this it's like so section is fine

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.170 
it this it's like so section is fine
even<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.940> go

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
even with that on and there you go

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.000 
even with that on and there you go
that's<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> bee<00:00:57.930> vac<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.379> course<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.859> being

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that's the bee vac of course this being

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
that's the bee vac of course this being
a<00:00:59.100> shot<00:00:59.280> back<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.789> also<00:00:59.940> attach

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
a shot back you can also attach

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.799 
a shot back you can also attach
attachments<00:01:01.170> now<00:01:01.949> there<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.789> changes<00:01:03.570> I'm

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
attachments now there are changes I'm

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.410 
attachments now there are changes I'm
going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.080> make<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.519> take<00:01:05.549> right<00:01:05.970> again<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
can show you how do I put this ended up

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.149 
can show you how do I put this ended up
using<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.010> rag<00:01:14.540> because<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> cap<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
using a rag because I don't have a cap I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
using a rag because I don't have a cap I
don't<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> plug<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.720> anything

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
don't have a plug I don't have anything

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
don't have a plug I don't have anything
number<00:01:19.710> two<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> fitting

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
number two there is actually a fitting

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.660 
number two there is actually a fitting
that<00:01:21.030> goes<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.950> but<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.250> needs<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> be

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that goes in here but it needs to be

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.690 
that goes in here but it needs to be
screwed<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.540> screw<00:01:24.810> stripped<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.130> in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
screwed on the screw stripped out so in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.580 
screwed on the screw stripped out so in
the<00:01:26.790> meantime<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.330> need<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.659> find<00:01:28.320> something

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the meantime we need to find something

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
the meantime we need to find something
else<00:01:28.890> might<00:01:29.670> duct<00:01:29.880> tape<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.570> we're

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
else might duct tape it on but we're

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.580 
else might duct tape it on but we're
making<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.110> new<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.670> because<00:01:33.470> getting<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
making a new one because getting the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.859 
making a new one because getting the
bees<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.479> you're<00:01:36.479> dealing<00:01:36.840> with

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
bees out of it you're dealing with

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.649 
bees out of it you're dealing with
what's<00:01:37.560> essentially<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.310> tilt<00:01:38.850> table<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
what's essentially a tilt table and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.730 
what's essentially a tilt table and
trying<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> ball<00:01:40.200> through<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> hole

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
trying to get a ball through the hole

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
trying to get a ball through the hole
only<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.520> case<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> ball<00:01:42.090> has<00:01:42.329> little

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
only in this case the ball has little

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.630 
only in this case the ball has little
hooked<00:01:42.720> feet<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.290> will<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> its<00:01:44.159> own<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
hooked feet a will of its own and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:55.219 
hooked feet a will of its own and
attitude<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:47.060> my<00:01:48.060> jet<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:49.399> wings<00:01:53.780> yeah<00:01:54.780> they

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
attitude and my jet and wings yeah they

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
attitude and my jet and wings yeah they
use<00:01:55.380> those<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.090> cling<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
use those to but because they cling to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.910 
use those to but because they cling to
the<00:01:57.750> sides<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.290> makes<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.680> difficult

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the sides it makes it really difficult

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160 
the sides it makes it really difficult
and<00:01:59.549> when<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.600> them<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.810> they're<00:02:01.020> not

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and when you get them out they're not

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.810 
and when you get them out they're not
necessarily<00:02:01.590> appreciative<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> effort

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
necessarily appreciative of the effort

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.600 
necessarily appreciative of the effort
have<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> been<00:02:03.390> banged<00:02:03.630> around<00:02:03.780> quite<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> bit

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
have you been banged around quite a bit

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
have you been banged around quite a bit
any<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.180> saw<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.450> other<00:02:06.659> the
