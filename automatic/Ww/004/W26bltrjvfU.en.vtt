biologist<00:00:06.640> with<00:00:06.790> Mississippi<00:00:07.390> NRCS<00:00:08.049> came<00:00:08.620> to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
biologist with Mississippi NRCS came to

biologist with Mississippi NRCS came to
talk<00:00:08.860> to<00:00:08.889> you<00:00:09.040> today<00:00:09.190> about<00:00:09.309> native<00:00:09.879> grasses

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
talk to you today about native grasses

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.090 
talk to you today about native grasses
behind<00:00:11.049> this<00:00:11.170> what<00:00:11.320> you'll<00:00:11.469> see<00:00:11.650> is<00:00:11.799> a<00:00:11.830> bunch

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
behind this what you'll see is a bunch

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.459 
behind this what you'll see is a bunch
of<00:00:12.309> native<00:00:13.090> flowers<00:00:13.629> that<00:00:13.990> have<00:00:14.049> been<00:00:14.199> planted

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
of native flowers that have been planted

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.980 
of native flowers that have been planted
for<00:00:14.920> pollinator<00:00:15.459> habitat<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.240> for<00:00:16.539> insect

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
for pollinator habitat and for insect

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.920 
for pollinator habitat and for insect
production<00:00:17.470> for<00:00:17.680> small<00:00:17.920> birds<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:19.600> the<00:00:19.630> right

production for small birds to the right

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.810 
production for small birds to the right
that<00:00:20.140> you'll<00:00:20.320> see<00:00:20.500> here<00:00:20.800> we<00:00:21.100> actually<00:00:21.250> have<00:00:21.550> a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
that you'll see here we actually have a

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.610 
that you'll see here we actually have a
standard<00:00:22.300> native<00:00:22.570> grasses<00:00:22.780> mostly<00:00:23.350> this<00:00:23.470> is

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
standard native grasses mostly this is

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.420 
standard native grasses mostly this is
broom<00:00:23.890> sedge

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
broom sedge

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.029 
broom sedge
but<00:00:24.820> it's<00:00:25.000> basically<00:00:25.570> from<00:00:25.810> a<00:00:25.930> result<00:00:26.320> of<00:00:26.530> just

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
but it's basically from a result of just

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.950 
but it's basically from a result of just
a<00:00:27.280> herbicide<00:00:27.850> application<00:00:28.480> this<00:00:28.690> is<00:00:28.810> what

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
a herbicide application this is what

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.600 
a herbicide application this is what
came<00:00:29.170> up<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:29.500> is<00:00:29.680> what<00:00:29.830> it<00:00:30.010> was<00:00:30.130> in<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.400> seed

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
came up this is what it was in the seed

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.060 
came up this is what it was in the seed
