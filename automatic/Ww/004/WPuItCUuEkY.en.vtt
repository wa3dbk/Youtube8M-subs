hunting<00:02:45.660> season<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:47.100> love<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> knife<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.330> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
hunting season I love the knife but I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.360 
hunting season I love the knife but I
found<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.560> blade<00:02:49.740> was<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> little<00:02:50.250> bit

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
found that the blade was a little bit

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.780 
found that the blade was a little bit
long<00:02:50.580> for<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.570> lot<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.900> day<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.770> day<00:02:52.980> camp<00:02:53.250> tasks

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
long for a lot of day to day camp tasks

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.360 
long for a lot of day to day camp tasks
and<00:02:53.970> especially<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.720> even<00:02:54.930> see<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.710> beautiful

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
and especially for even see a beautiful

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.100 
and especially for even see a beautiful
knife<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.730> probably<00:02:56.970> would<00:02:57.240> ed<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.990> was

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
knife I probably would ed see if it was

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
knife I probably would ed see if it was
hold<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.380> bit<00:02:58.530> smaller<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.190> know<00:02:59.640> they<00:02:59.850> make<00:03:00.000> a

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
hold a bit smaller I know they make a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.330 
hold a bit smaller I know they make a
woodland<00:03:00.450> special<00:03:00.960> but<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.800> figure<00:03:02.070> for<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
woodland special but I figure for the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.100 
woodland special but I figure for the
price<00:03:02.550> point<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.420> amount<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.660> money<00:03:03.720> had

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
price point and the amount of money had

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.610 
price point and the amount of money had
at<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.350> moment<00:03:04.740> I'd<00:03:05.370> go<00:03:05.550> for<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.820> cheaper

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
at the moment I'd go for a cheaper

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
me buying it look at that drop point

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.380 
me buying it look at that drop point
which<00:04:08.299> is<00:04:08.480> pretty<00:04:08.870> much<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.349> mirror<00:04:09.739> image

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
which is pretty much a mirror image

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.970 
which is pretty much a mirror image
really<00:04:11.920> now<00:04:12.920> either<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.489> eyes<00:04:13.700> ullah<00:04:14.980> drops

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
really now either the eyes ullah drops

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.699 
really now either the eyes ullah drops
