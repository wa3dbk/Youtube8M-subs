00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.760
 here 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.209
 very good guys here in a new video 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.369
 new 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.470
 the title I will give you my sincere 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.169
 review about black ops 3 by black ops 3 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.189
 the new game that we see now is of 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.510
 playstation 4 so I with that is me 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.430
 love it because we were always 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.710
 with the exclusivity of xbox and I do not 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.510
 never liked because I always have the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.790
 child is the beginning and it was like why 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 because that has it play that is better 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.449
 that xbox or 16 but good was left 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.160
 background a little white 2 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.200
 pretty entertaining vale is a nuclear 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 so in about 4 minutes worth was cut 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.620
 the intermediate and so far yes it is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 a pretty frantic and fast nuclear 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 in which I move the whole map so 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 it's good enough to leave it in the background 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.039
 so whatever comes up I commented on this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.690
 video about apart from saying that why 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.480
 has not uploaded video during these days 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.489
 because I had exams worth and having 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.830
 these exams because let's say the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.220
 finished already let's say I'm free in itself 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.780
 so what happens that I will try to have a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.479
 daily video when you can and at best 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.649
 in July I start with a daily video 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.929
 apart from all that I will comment on it in 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.650
 what is given to me because the title 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.350
 put something else 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.000
 I will comment in this video is that the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.570
 black ops 3 is a game that to me the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.750
 I really like when the trailer to me 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 I looked like gauche gauche because 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 tones I saw then between something yes 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.410
 I had some similar things and I say no 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 please do not call me a call of duty 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.490
 trailers can not be like ghosts then 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.760
 he saw me a gameplay and he says vale is ghost 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.440
 what happens then he gave me another 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.420
 gameplay and yes that was no longer voice in 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.310
 no time the front and that I saw myself 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.380
 maybe I know what the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 boy who was very bad the brightness 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.820
 it was very weird of the gameplay but 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.040
 then for example I saw other videos 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.869
 it's true that I love the game 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.610
 it's a pretty dynamic game 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.860
 fast pretty frenetic that is what 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.050
 I like it so when it comes out we go 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.100
 to give cane to all over that is for 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.470
 play 4 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.950
 I have play 4 so I will bring you almost 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.310
 everything exclusive that comes out is news 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.830
 whatever it is so that that in general 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.900
 of the game in my opinion I'm also 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 talking to a friend and such and we 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.280
 it seemed like it has a touch of thin a black 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.860
 ops 1 since in some sounds 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.319
 a weapon is white is one the movements 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.819
 similar to whites one but a little 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.800
 faster because white is one 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.630
 when you run to me my ass weighed 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.090
 I do not know why but I was heavy in the ass like that 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.459
 that in this game is faster with the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.940
 I'm jumping, this little guy we have 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.700
 an intermediate jump that changed a 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.170
 little movement but the truth 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.330
 is quite good and also say that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.090
 It also has some aspects of 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.110
 whites 2 I would like very much more than 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.880
 killed more bullets because so 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.280
 I have seen it is wrong with very few bullets 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.980
 and that I do not like because you already know 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.470
 what game reminds us so that by 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.460
 that part I do not like at all for the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.180
 other than 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:18.390
 I would also like us to see 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.239
 how do you say this the contrast the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.579
 bit saturation let's see in the game 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.129
 be like whites 2 what I mean 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.720
 that is more striking not so dark everything 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.280
 example in modern warfare test is a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.079
 game that I saw, I call it gray game 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.209
 because it's a game that you do not see anything of 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.310
 color almost worth it we're in the war 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.129
 but it calls me more attention 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.170
 a game with many lights with little things 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.260
 well so if you get a little bit more 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.299
 of light the light saturation to make it 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.849
 more colorful than it is depends only on the 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.760
 capturing and it depends on a lot of 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.349
 things would be much better as well 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.790
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.500
 my sincere opinion that it is going to be a 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.750
 piece of game that we are going to enjoy 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.840
 all and that the truth sorry for not 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.480
 have the videos during these days well 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 that I will try tomorrow to bring you a video or 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.560
 on Sunday to make you that one or the other 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.780
 direct so see you in the next 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.889
 subscribe video and if you're not up to the 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.889

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.510
