00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.609 
right
so<00:01:58.540> first<00:01:59.540> chord<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.259> we're<00:02:00.380> gonna<00:02:00.500> be

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
so first chord then we're gonna be

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.900 
so first chord then we're gonna be
stripping<00:02:00.830> towards<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.220> back<00:02:01.399> just<00:02:01.700> try<00:02:01.850> it

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
stripping towards the back just try it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.550 
stripping towards the back just try it
with<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> Stremme<00:02:02.300> right<00:02:02.450> now<00:02:02.630> at<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.350> bridge

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
with the Stremme right now at the bridge

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960 
with the Stremme right now at the bridge
no<00:02:03.770> matter<00:02:03.920> what<00:02:04.100> guitar<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.520> Les<00:02:04.759> Paul

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
no matter what guitar it is Les Paul

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.340 
no matter what guitar it is Les Paul
anything<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.570> can<00:02:05.690> still<00:02:05.869> get<00:02:05.990> this<00:02:06.080> tone

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
anything you can still get this tone

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.230 
anything you can still get this tone
okay<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.729> just<00:02:08.390> play<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.600> minor

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.180 

and<00:02:13.810> move<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.440> up<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.590> an<00:02:14.740> a-minor

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.380 

back<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.360> an<00:02:20.480> e-minor

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.540 

and<00:02:25.260> our<00:02:25.380> breakouts<00:02:25.710> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.100> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.520> a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and our breakouts going to be going to a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.570 
and our breakouts going to be going to a
D<00:02:26.880> major<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> Z

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.220 

and<00:02:34.090> back<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.420> our<00:02:34.450> E<00:02:34.600> minor<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.560> ending

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.050 

now<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.010> might<00:02:39.160> sound<00:02:39.400> really<00:02:39.489> simple<00:02:39.970> but

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
now this might sound really simple but

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.670 
now this might sound really simple but
when<00:02:40.239> actually<00:02:40.599> when<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:41.290> apply<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
when actually when we apply the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.020 
when actually when we apply the
strumming<00:02:42.430> pattern<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.760> we're<00:02:42.879> going<00:02:42.970> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
strumming pattern that we're going to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.190 
strumming pattern that we're going to
teach<00:02:43.150> today<00:02:43.390> they'll<00:02:43.569> sound<00:02:43.750> really<00:02:44.019> cool

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
teach today they'll sound really cool

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.559 
teach today they'll sound really cool
when<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:44.530> add<00:02:44.650> some<00:02:44.920> vibrato<00:02:45.310> later<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.360> here's

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
when we add some vibrato later so here's

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.360 
when we add some vibrato later so here's
how<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.050> sound<00:02:47.230> with<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> chords

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
how it's going to sound with the chords

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.830 
how it's going to sound with the chords
in<00:02:48.519> sequence<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.269> with<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.540> strumming

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
in sequence and with the strumming

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.270 
in sequence and with the strumming
pattern<00:02:49.870> we're<00:02:50.650> still<00:02:50.830> going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.010> leave<00:02:51.099> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
pattern we're still going to leave the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.800 
pattern we're still going to leave the
vibrato<00:02:51.610> out<00:02:51.910> for<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.180> right<00:02:52.269> now<00:02:52.330> so<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.660> can

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
vibrato out for you right now so you can

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.330 
vibrato out for you right now so you can
hear<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.080> chords<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.590> then<00:02:53.950> we'll<00:02:54.069> get<00:02:54.220> into

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
hear the chords and then we'll get into

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.600 
hear the chords and then we'll get into
that<00:02:54.580> technique

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
that technique

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:18.750 
that technique

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.970 
and all I'm pretty much doing in this in
this<00:03:21.610> example<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.360> doing<00:03:22.690> like<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.870> 1/2<00:03:23.650> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
this example is doing like a 1/2 and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.910 
this example is doing like a 1/2 and
then<00:03:24.670> feel<00:03:25.180> out<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.599> fill<00:03:25.959> out<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.170> weight<00:03:26.379> to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
then feel out the fill out the weight to

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.559 
then feel out the fill out the weight to
go<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.129> your<00:03:27.340> actual<00:03:27.640> strum<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.360> can<00:03:28.450> hear

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
go to your actual strum so you can hear

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.839 
go to your actual strum so you can hear
that<00:03:28.599> right<00:03:28.720> now<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.080> on<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.319> II<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:30.180> 1/2

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
that right now just on that II the 1/2

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.830 
that right now just on that II the 1/2
like<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.540> I'm<00:03:34.690> strumming<00:03:34.989> at<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.170> back

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
now for this example I wanted to just

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.930 
now for this example I wanted to just
strum<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.230> nice<00:03:53.530> open<00:03:54.070> deal<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:54.460> that<00:03:54.580> part<00:03:54.820> it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
strum a nice open deal on that part it

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.130 
strum a nice open deal on that part it
actually<00:03:55.210> will<00:03:55.330> kind<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.570> create<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> cool

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
actually will kind of create a cool

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:08.180 
actually will kind of create a cool
effect<00:03:56.460> yeah<00:03:57.490> in<00:03:57.640> this<00:03:57.850> example<00:04:00.450> into<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> sea

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.600

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
now add the vibrato to create a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.340 
now add the vibrato to create a
different<00:04:33.970> sound<00:04:34.210> check<00:04:34.480> it<00:04:34.600> out

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
so now once you get that down it's

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.110

really<00:04:59.100> neat<00:04:59.430> when<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.670> still<00:04:59.880> have<00:05:00.000> your

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
really neat when you still have your

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.730 
really neat when you still have your

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
vibrato on and you can do some little

vibrato on and you can do some little

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
pick offs or some little open sustain
