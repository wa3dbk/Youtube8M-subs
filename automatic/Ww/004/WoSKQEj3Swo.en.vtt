when you're done adding points to your
list<00:01:13.550> you<00:01:14.300> could<00:01:14.450> change<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.960> order<00:01:15.320> just<00:01:15.500> by

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
list you could change the order just by

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.920 
list you could change the order just by
touching<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.550> dragging<00:01:21.610> go<00:01:22.610> next<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:23.750> could

at the top here you can touch those we

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.220 
at the top here you can touch those we
can<00:01:40.400> edit<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.820> destinations<00:01:41.540> optimize

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
can edit the destinations optimize

delete trip or rename trip so let's just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.960 
delete trip or rename trip so let's just
try<00:01:45.230> optimize<00:01:45.890> see<00:01:46.190> if<00:01:46.280> it'll<00:01:46.430> find<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.760> better

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
try optimize see if it'll find a better

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.370 
try optimize see if it'll find a better
order<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:53.060> was<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> quick<00:01:53.480> look<00:01:53.810> at<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> trip

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
order that was a quick look at the trip
