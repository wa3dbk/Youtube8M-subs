00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
is not only 5.5 inches it's not really

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.140 
is not only 5.5 inches it's not really
fair<00:00:15.889> to<00:00:15.950> compare<00:00:16.370> with<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.580> little<00:00:16.850> smaller

sensor<00:00:17.630> galaxy<00:00:17.960> s6<00:00:18.199> but<00:00:18.439> of<00:00:18.529> course<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.220> is

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
sensor galaxy s6 but of course this is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.910 
sensor galaxy s6 but of course this is
the<00:00:20.150> main<00:00:20.300> competitor<00:00:20.840> I<00:00:20.869> would<00:00:21.140> say<00:00:21.349> here

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
the main competitor I would say here

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.310 
the main competitor I would say here
from<00:00:22.519> Korea<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.029> in<00:00:23.330> terms<00:00:23.539> of<00:00:23.689> size<00:00:23.929> of<00:00:24.080> course

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
from Korea so in terms of size of course

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.620 
from Korea so in terms of size of course
Asus<00:00:24.890> is<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.070> lot<00:00:25.220> bigger<00:00:25.429> because<00:00:25.609> of<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:25.970> 5.5

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
Asus is a lot bigger because of the 5.5

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.630 
Asus is a lot bigger because of the 5.5
inch<00:00:26.810> screen<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.650> big<00:00:27.980> camera<00:00:28.220> on<00:00:28.519> the

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
heart rate sensor which we are not sure

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.860 
heart rate sensor which we are not sure
that<00:00:49.489> if<00:00:49.789> we<00:00:49.940> need<00:00:50.090> but<00:00:50.329> we<00:00:50.449> also<00:00:50.570> have<00:00:50.840> a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
the Samsung because my brother and I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.390 
the Samsung because my brother and I
completely<00:01:14.210> fit<00:01:14.510> in<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> picture<00:01:14.990> while<00:01:15.980> on

completely fit in the picture while on

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.380 
completely fit in the picture while on
the<00:01:16.640> right<00:01:16.790> I'm<00:01:17.150> missing<00:01:17.750> half<00:01:18.140> my<00:01:18.170> shoulder

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
the right I'm missing half my shoulder

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.620 
the right I'm missing half my shoulder
and<00:01:20.390> speed<00:01:20.840> about<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.980> same<00:01:22.240> let's<00:01:23.240> turn<00:01:23.450> them

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
and speed about the same let's turn them

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.850 
and speed about the same let's turn them
around

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.310 

antennas<00:01:27.860> can<00:01:28.100> see<00:01:28.220> on<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.369> back<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:30.140> white

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
antennas can see on the back the white

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.080 
antennas can see on the back the white
angle<00:01:30.590> again<00:01:30.860> here<00:01:31.159> might<00:01:31.430> be<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.700> little<00:01:31.909> bit

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
angle again here might be a little bit

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.000 
angle again here might be a little bit
better<00:01:32.210> on<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.659> Samsung<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.560> two<00:01:33.710> colors

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
better on the Samsung and two colors

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.499 
better on the Samsung and two colors
also<00:01:34.280> not<00:01:35.060> as<00:01:35.240> dark<00:01:35.800> but<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.890> focus<00:01:37.509> also

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
also not as dark but the focus also

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.060 
also not as dark but the focus also
seems<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.110> be<00:01:39.170> really<00:01:39.350> quite<00:01:39.560> good<00:01:39.680> involved

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
seems to be really quite good involved

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.520 
seems to be really quite good involved
so<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.520> would<00:01:41.360> say<00:01:41.509> it's<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.690> tie<00:01:41.930> especially

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
so I would say it's a tie especially

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.980 
so I would say it's a tie especially
because<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:43.640> Aces<00:01:44.090> will<00:01:44.270> cost<00:01:44.420> probably<00:01:44.690> half

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
because the Aces will cost probably half

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.440 
because the Aces will cost probably half
as<00:01:45.200> much<00:01:45.350> as<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.800> Samsung<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.580> can<00:01:46.820> use<00:01:47.119> two

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
as much as the Samsung you can use two

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.570 
as much as the Samsung you can use two
SIM<00:01:47.659> cards<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.770> also<00:01:48.979> upgrade<00:01:49.280> your

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
SIM cards and you can also upgrade your

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.130 
SIM cards and you can also upgrade your
