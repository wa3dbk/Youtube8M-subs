noise usually my work relates in some

noise usually my work relates in some
way<00:00:16.800> or<00:00:16.859> another<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.369> nature<00:00:17.820> space<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.260> time

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.640 
way or another to nature space and time
and<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.310> wider<00:00:20.730> cosmos<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:22.109> been<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> really

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and the wider cosmos it's been a really

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.230 
and the wider cosmos it's been a really
interesting<00:00:22.920> process<00:00:23.460> working<00:00:24.180> with

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
interesting process working with

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
interesting process working with
Selfridges<00:00:24.900> windows<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.680> think<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> fact<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Selfridges windows I think the fact that

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
Selfridges windows I think the fact that
it<00:00:27.210> felt<00:00:27.510> tied<00:00:27.720> into<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.320> idea<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> no<00:00:29.010> noise

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it felt tied into this idea of no noise

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
it felt tied into this idea of no noise
really<00:00:30.119> helped<00:00:30.420> me<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.869> imagining

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
really helped me when I was imagining

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.740 
really helped me when I was imagining
and<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.340> proposals<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> initial<00:00:33.630> stage

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
and the proposals and the initial stage

and when it explodes it burns with the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.649 
and when it explodes it burns with the
luminosity<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.820> hundred<00:01:03.180> billion<00:01:03.420> suns

death of a star in the universe in the
third<00:01:26.600> space<00:01:26.899> I'm<00:01:27.259> showing<00:01:27.619> light<00:01:27.860> bulb<00:01:28.100> to

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
third space I'm showing light bulb to

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.490 
third space I'm showing light bulb to
simulate<00:01:28.460> moonlight<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.360> that's<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.289> work

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
simulate moonlight and that's the work

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.139 
simulate moonlight and that's the work
that's<00:01:30.829> been<00:01:31.159> included<00:01:31.610> in<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.789> Hayward's

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
that's been included in the Hayward's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.840 
that's been included in the Hayward's
light<00:01:32.329> show<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.899> simple<00:01:33.679> light<00:01:34.159> bulb<00:01:34.369> but<00:01:34.700> it

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
light show is a simple light bulb but it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.330 
light show is a simple light bulb but it
simulates<00:01:35.149> as<00:01:35.929> closely<00:01:36.229> as<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.619> could<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
simulates as closely as I could the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.219 
simulates as closely as I could the
light<00:01:37.549> of<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.849> Moon<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:39.080> an

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
light of the Moon so it's like an

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.999 
light of the Moon so it's like an
attempt<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.679> recreate<00:01:40.520> moonlight<00:01:41.090> on<00:01:41.270> earth

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
attempt to recreate moonlight on earth

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.399 
attempt to recreate moonlight on earth
in<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.880> next<00:01:44.030> one<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:44.479> it's<00:01:44.659> come<00:01:44.899> full<00:01:45.110> tilt

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
in the next one so it's come full tilt

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.949 
in the next one so it's come full tilt
elo<00:01:45.860> field<00:01:46.159> of<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.429> sky<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.000> that's<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.299> very

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
elo field of the sky and that's a very

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.600 
elo field of the sky and that's a very
big<00:01:48.170> iron<00:01:48.740> meteorite

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
big iron meteorite

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.580 
big iron meteorite
so<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.299> meteorite<00:01:50.750> was<00:01:50.929> traveling<00:01:51.470> around

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
so the meteorite was traveling around

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.449 
so the meteorite was traveling around
space<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.789> time<00:01:53.299> for<00:01:53.920> something<00:01:54.920> like<00:01:55.220> four

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
space and time for something like four

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.429 
space and time for something like four
and<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.610> half<00:01:55.640> billion<00:01:56.090> years<00:01:56.299> before<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.200> fell

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
and a half billion years before it fell

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.169 
and a half billion years before it fell
to<00:01:57.619> earth<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:57.979> then<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.159> was<00:01:58.429> laid<00:01:58.700> buried

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
to earth and then it was laid buried

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.449 
to earth and then it was laid buried
under<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.780> earth<00:01:59.899> for<00:02:00.319> thousands<00:02:01.099> of<00:02:01.189> years

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
under the earth for thousands of years

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.630 
under the earth for thousands of years
before<00:02:01.670> people<00:02:02.060> find<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:03.310> think<00:02:04.310> what's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
before people find it I think what's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.460 
before people find it I think what's
wonderful<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.689> many<00:02:05.929> people<00:02:06.319> are

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
wonderful is that so many people are

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.350 
wonderful is that so many people are
going<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.739> be<00:02:06.920> passing<00:02:07.220> through<00:02:08.090> those

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
going to be passing through those

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.090 
going to be passing through those
through<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.929> streets<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.560> maybe<00:02:09.890> not

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
through the streets and maybe not

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.710 
through the streets and maybe not
expecting<00:02:10.670> something<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.450> so

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
expecting something like this so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.559 
expecting something like this so
hopefully<00:02:12.319> being<00:02:13.280> able<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.850> get<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.239> really

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
hopefully being able to get up really

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.330 
hopefully being able to get up really
close<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> work<00:02:15.739> in<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> windows<00:02:16.310> that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
close to the work in the windows that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.620 
close to the work in the windows that
will<00:02:16.549> catch<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.970> lot<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.120> people's<00:02:17.480> attention

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
will catch a lot of people's attention

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.199 
will catch a lot of people's attention
that<00:02:18.170> would<00:02:18.290> would<00:02:18.709> maybe<00:02:18.950> not<00:02:19.160> normally<00:02:19.609> see

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
that would would maybe not normally see

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.490 
that would would maybe not normally see
this<00:02:20.420> kind<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.810> work

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
this kind of work

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.560 
this kind of work
