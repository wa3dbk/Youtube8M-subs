on<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> piston<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.900> our<00:01:07.170> engine<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.650> pressurize

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
on a piston in our engine we pressurize

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520 
on a piston in our engine we pressurize
the<00:01:08.490> air<00:01:08.640> first<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> apply<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the air first so when we apply it to the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.240 
the air first so when we apply it to the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
piston the piston is pushed I think this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
piston the piston is pushed I think this
kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> engine<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.360> doing<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.869> are

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
kind of engine what we are doing we are

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.710 
kind of engine what we are doing we are
bringing<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.830> air<00:01:17.070> with<00:01:17.580> high<00:01:18.119> pressure<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
bringing the air with high pressure and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.810 
bringing the air with high pressure and
if<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:19.890> into<00:01:20.070> account<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.490> fact<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
if you take into account the fact that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.280 
if you take into account the fact that
you<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> compress<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> air<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you need to compress the air and to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.990 
you need to compress the air and to
expand<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> into<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> engine<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
expand it into the engine this is a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.080 
expand it into the engine this is a
whole<00:01:24.180> system<00:01:24.360> totally<00:01:25.020> free<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.320> emission

whole system totally free of emission

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.240 
whole system totally free of emission
actually<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.600> air<00:01:27.780> car<00:01:28.080> does<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.680> emissions

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
actually the air car does have emissions

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.840 
actually the air car does have emissions
it's<00:01:30.240> ice-cold<00:01:30.799> completely<00:01:31.799> clean<00:01:32.130> highly
