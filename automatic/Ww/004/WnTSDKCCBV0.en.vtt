00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 I have a dream foul in the dream 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 the captain armchair crawl during the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.139
 rest of the team doing the work and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.119
 Who else would dream for me this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.160
 meet if not chris roberts im 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.480
 stars know what we see here is one 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
 advertising spot for a ship of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 constellation class for stars too 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.650
 Its supporters respect up to 275 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.380
 dollar costs only for this one ship 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.329
 ok, firstly, the absurdly expensive second 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 You can still use the constellation in the game 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.930
 not flying there will be my dream 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.570
 probably have to stay longer one 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 have well enough dreamed suffer and 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.360
 get out of the springs moment where are 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.120
 we're here 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 on board a constellation like this 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.270
 coincidence 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 how good that there are press accounts like that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.440
 we can look forward to the long-haul flyer 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 have a look at it together 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.980
 one on the parquet floor and the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.570
 recognizing tasteful art is that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.909
 but not the standards but 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 even the luxury version of the spaceship 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.409
 the so-called constellation phoenix 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.540
 but not only in pink mobile for 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.400
 space yuppies but can be like 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.530
 her less glamorous sisters 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.479
 neat arming here I take it 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.000
 sheltered from the place like daand hatch 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.070
 skywalker in frenzied folding from the outside 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 the phoenix with white lacquer shines it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.659
 is the iphone of the constellation 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.880
 Family can not look anymore though 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.740
 Stylish from ok and the equipment is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.070
 a little better the phoenix is ​​coming 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.590
 namely with mp 72 chemistry of the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.720
 hunter she carries at the rear when you 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.659
 It can be a constellation later 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 times with several friends or 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.329
 computer-controlled crew members though 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.399
 as I said, you can still fly them 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.439
 not just in the hangar 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 and where we are watching 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.280
 the phoenix has the fancier 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.979
 interior and shows with ship 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.810
 a stylish lounge area and still 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.909
 more art on the wall and thanks to the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 ceiling windows can be directly under 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.360
 the stars 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.640
 no idea playing cards or something 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.050
 So that was the girl variant of the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.990
 constellation, let's have a look 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.290
 the male to the constellation 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.260
 andromeda 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.340
 by the way, it only costs $ 225 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.870
 while the phoenix to 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.730
 recording time not mean 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.470
 purchase price has yes here already looks 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.600
 a bit rustic but above all 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.700
 has the andromeda where the phoenix 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.080
 their lounge has a large cargo hold 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.150
 the fact I have already my little 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.520
 hangar buggy parked now i can do that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.190
 freight on train departing in the buggy 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.170
 get in and loose out into the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.180
 hangar that should be so later 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.740
 times on foreign planets work 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.630
 but it is so far I can 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.070
 probably my grandchildren by the road 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.540
 watch his play 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.820
 Incidentally, the ships are parked in the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.580
 asteroid hangar chris roberts on 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.170
 which showed gamescom 2014 for the first time 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.000
 and at least an impression of it 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.190
 leaves as correct later times 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.690
 I could look at space stations 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.880
 Just get started at this point 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.110
 and walk around the stairs a bit 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.060
 over there leads up to the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.980
 Control center is still behind 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.959
 aquarium in the corner there you should later 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.270
 Visit the online universe at 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.570
 Foreign planets exotic fish as too 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.370
 if you can collect 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.840
 on this hologram clothes rack can 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.130
 I wear the clothes of my pilot 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.870
 change here hang a few more 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.030
 posters on the wall but good ending 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.950
 now with firefan the lift up there 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.950
 Take me up to the control center 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.750
 so we can do great 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.100
 not here, but it is 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.260
 a taste for it like that 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.630
 commando bridges on big carrier ships 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.180
 could look like 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:50.170
 well at least great and tried 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.910
 carrier ships of course park here 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.100
 In addition, there are still a few constellations 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.810
 other ships in hangar this kadlec 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.600
 we have just seen from above 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.280
 It costs a hefty $ 100 and had 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.230
 well hidden entrance around the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.570
 I have to enter the access ramp 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.430
 little button press the cat is 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.750
 a military ship sees the cargo bay 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.820
 also the same as in one 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.470
 troop transporter so there is still 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.510
 a few hidden buttons of this one 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.880
 here the door to the cockpit opens 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.560
 has his two armchairs in the cargo hold 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.730
 the katjes still a floor hatch the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.290
 publicly now but rather not 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.660
 but rather drive the chair to 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.390
 protected tower and how well that works 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.250
 that's why the buttons are beautiful and 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.590
 good but this printer feels 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.120
 still bad inaccurate but okay the game 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.130
 is not finished yet 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.240
 Ship models change regularly 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.240
 various details 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.680
 the conclusion of our tour is the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.900
 Venture the cheapest ship in this one 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.340
 hangar but still 60 dollars 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.380
 costs as much as one 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.330
 full price game all right I would 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.460
 do not buy but everyone as he likes 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.500
 the eventa serves primarily as 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.490
 faster and more powerful 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.319
 interceptor with ship still has it 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.880
 a small sleeping bunk I with nem 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.680
 button can open 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.849
 but he has a little way back 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.470
 sometimes it hooks in the 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.150
 ship models still strong sometimes 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.069
 sometimes firmly stuck by the 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.810
 I already mentioned Wand that street 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.310
 this still a long way to development 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.810
 in front of you and that too 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.360
 really on many corners and edges 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.919
 So notice until a venture or just 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.780
 a constellation actually too 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.090
 foreign worlds and in the far the 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.169
 online galaxis will be breaking up 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.479
 take a while 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.840
 dream of that one will probably still 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.840
 allowed 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.400
 more
