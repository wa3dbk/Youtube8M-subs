00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.670
 so it is made an income with hair 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.090
 sewn an income nor the hooks 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.090

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 finishing 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:50.360
 I'm here to show you the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.360
 color 1 which is an intense black well and so 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.539
 I have this corumbÃª that is a black more 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.289
 Natural 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.289
 comparing the two here 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:21.330
 has this color that the color 4 is a brown 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:25.540
 medium gift of chocolate 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.250
 6 color which is one tone down one more tone 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.710
 Of course, what he hid 14 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.840
 here you can compare the clearest color 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840
 dark blonde 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.960
 color 20 which is a clear error 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.110

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.110

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.200
 comparing color 20 to color 60 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.170
 Can you see that it made the deal 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:47.210
 20 is a darker tone than the force 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:47.210
 I always have an ax too. 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.370

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.690

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.420

 can be this or with the 6 613 you do 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.390

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:34.440
 the chicks you're going to stick here in 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:36.810
 wrong up and then it's going to 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.539

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:48.240
 What's goin on you too? 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:52.830
 roll and tie if you find the tape too 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.460
 Long can cut a piece and then you 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.370
 You may even have the one part of the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.440

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.440
 that more professional finish 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:18.889
 You get the horse abandoned him. 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.889
