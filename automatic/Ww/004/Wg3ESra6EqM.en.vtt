00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.310
 very good to all kids how about 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.100
 you are good today I bring you here a 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.620
 gameplay of black ops 2 but good this 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.809
 gameplay is to show you one of the 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.690
 four new maps that are in the new 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.900
 dlc the bird rising and good the truth is 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.090
 I played because I do not know 23 games 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.730
 this map I still do not have much idea of 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.350
 how is it going but I liked it a lot 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.830
 I liked it a lot, you have to say it 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.050
 It is not my favorite but I 4 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.679
 It's been nice to say also that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.899
 compared to the other tlc this seems to me 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.609
 very much much better or we are not going 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.800
 to fool us this one is pretty enough 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.760
 better in the video I do not know if what 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.710
 you have seen in the trailer of the delete 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.489
 they referred to this map to magma 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.920
 like I was coming out magma was killing you 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.199
 directly he was going alternating the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 magma levels of the map to its free 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.809
 will according to what will be based but I 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.789
 here has not seen a shit or like 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 you can see here in domain of is here 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.339
 and I do not know if I do not know if the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.799
 magma up or what the hell I played 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.750
 three maps and I have not seen such a shit 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.790
 that 's what I say an attention to this 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.190
 man 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.000
 that I decided to pass first and good what 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.310
 I told you I do not know the people who have 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.990
 I wish we purchased must 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.600
 leave in the comments that has 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.880
 seemed this this new dlc of the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.550
 supposedly 4 that they will go out and see 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.900
 to see us to see if they will improve it in the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.490
 third in the fourth I do not know what they're going to 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.700
 to do but well I'm pretty happy 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.500
 with this because you do not have the truth is 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.170
 that I like all maps there is no no 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 there is thus one in particular that says this is 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.409
 the black sheep not your shit you know 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.289
 how is for example the case of what I know 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.969
 drones for example the pattern and two others 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.259
 I do not like shit you know if I 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.819
 I say well I do not have no problem 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.930
 say it but in this DLT the truth that 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.760
 I like all the maps 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.530
 and there is a special that is called the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.050
 study I think it is but all cool or 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.060
 I like it, we like it a lot 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.800
 very big and has that yes it has 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
 enough areas where I do not know where 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.850
 hide have many areas where 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.400
 hide but play dominate the me 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.510
 I really like you, I do not know about you 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.760
 the new map pack will look 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.450
 but good good attention here that I am 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.360
 here in mode this is gambitero s mode 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.680
 jetta gambiteros mode that I stay there and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.849
 good as you see I'm taking the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.819
 most of the gusts in the and taking out 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.080
 capturing only you know one thing is 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.390
 one of these games that you put to give 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.920
 turns around the map and at the end you catch 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.810
 all the flags and you get all the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.849
 streaks 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.790
 these men who try to leave go 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.290
 make 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.260
 as you have seen we have been for a while 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.620
 of gameplay and noah 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.610
 we have not seen anything about the fact that 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.020
 mom come up I do not know if only 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.550
 focuses on the point should because good not 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.550
 we are not out there 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.920
 I do not know if I also tell you that only 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.870
 played as I told you three times either 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.850
 I've seen so great but good 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.490
 also tell you that they are playing here 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.200
 As it is the novelty, it is playing 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.930
 lots of people and some dogs of the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.310
 virgin you know or it costs me here now 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.840
 same kill people that you flip 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.000
 but well I guess we're all 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.500
 equal to not having been born with a 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.880
 superior ability to others to is a 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.280
 thing that and each one 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.800
 I know what I did when they eat it or good 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.200
 attention here that I keep capturing here 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.450
 quietly taking care here that I 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.820
 he was crouched they have left to gaza 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.410
 because if seeing the rockets falling and 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.690
 people seem to give a shit 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.520
 because they go out to her I do not know how to welcome 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.490
 snails is one thing that I do not understand not 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.440
 I understand very well, here we are going to see 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.490
 here my partner as you try 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.460
 how to try 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.540
 kill that has just just suffered a 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:59.000
 a cardiac arrest calculation I say there you 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.100
 you stay but this man is coming 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.070
 which bravest and tries to try 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.320
 kill the assaults this man is my fucking 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.850
 idol I think he's waiting 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.700
 come if I kill you but you stay you know 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.750
 what he left here the battle and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.150
 I'm going to save a love for sure because 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.459
 I came here 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.720
 a maicito running to try to kill us 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.680
 to the two things that went wrong and good 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.440
 is already ending 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.910
 well I think I taught it quite well 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.830
 for people who do not know that they do not have it 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.830
 because basically it goes around the ring 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.570
 here crouching again 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.620
 and good is going to end I would like it not 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.270
 insists that you tell me that you 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.580
 It seems 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.830
 and it's just me that I like the most 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.890
 than the previous one but the truth is that 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.380
 is very very handsome the truth is that no 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.090
 it's worth it, I'll mention it 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.460
 in case someone bought the first and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.170
 thinks it's going to be the same shit and not 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.030
 I know you do not buy this the times you are 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.920
 yes it's worth it at least for 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.689
 me then do not tell me the bastard who 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.339
 You said I'm a shit you know 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.699
 everyone has their tastes every time 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:08.649
 it's there I like it and up to here the 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:13.379
 gameplay I hope you liked it and 

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:13.379
 more kids until the next or bye
