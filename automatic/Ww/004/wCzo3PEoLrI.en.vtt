00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.080
 ah 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.720
 today we have the heating issue 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.990
 the heating is an attachment that 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.240
 use in modern that has been a 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.850
 revolution really 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.309
 imagine that before the bath could be 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.300
 moisten with the environment that they had already 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.300
 either because they knew 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.990
 or it would be very hot or there were many people 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.750
 in the precinct depends on him 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.730
 the environmental humidity increased and the cloth 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.070
 it got to get wet like the bands 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.630
 then when rolling the ball when the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.110
 ball towards a turn instead of that 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.450
 touch and open that would be a blow or 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.760
 rather a very subtle turn was a turn 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.679
 They got stuck little rough beat 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.000
 sometimes even jumping 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.309
 jumped to the ball 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.830
 now with the heating is really 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.190
 a delight to play and this is achieved 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.530
 through which the under the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.590
 stones under the slate is made 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 in a wood a surrounded in that surrounded 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 a micro resistor is inserted for 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.660
 that residence down the stones 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.370
 then the stone gets to heat 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.530
 up to 40 degrees 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.180
 increase the ambient humidity of such 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 way that the balls always remain 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.000
 glossy too 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.460
 added to that heating has been put 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.369
 to the rails the rails inside 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.069
 they have an air cushion and there it has 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.590
 inserted a micro resistor 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.929
 also that heats the rubber and that makes 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.729
 that gives a little more speed and a 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.600
 little better angle at the time of 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.689
 clean 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.729
 these heaters are connected by 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.340
 under the table and they have a thermostat 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.310
 that thermostat when it reaches 40 degrees 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.259
 it goes off and when it goes down again it 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.259
 re -ignites then maintains a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.929
 quality in the course of the table and in 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.150
 the exceptional game that is the theme of 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.770
 heating for hour 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.870
 we also have now a move of 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.520
 fantasy of more than we call to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.069
 deliver the most plays are the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.340
 more complicated strokes 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.499
 this carom is called the yoyo is a 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.569
 carambola also where hitting with 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:30.629
 the white ball taking the yellow ball 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.060
 in my ball comes back repeating band shot 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.239
 short returns on long band again 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.889
 short and carambola band with want 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.859
 thank our sponsors
