whatnot so I'm going to show how this
one<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.089> built<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.450> didn't<00:00:15.750> build<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:17.119> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
one was built I didn't build it but the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.109 
one was built I didn't build it but the
premise<00:00:20.119> is<00:00:22.340> pretty<00:00:23.340> easy<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.939> pretty

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
premise is pretty easy and pretty

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.029 
premise is pretty easy and pretty
straightforward

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

one<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.060> biggest<00:00:27.269> problems<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.160> people

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
one of the biggest problems that people

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.420 
one of the biggest problems that people
have<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.789> when<00:00:30.449> they<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.810> done<00:00:31.130> they<00:00:32.130> turn

have is when they get it done they turn

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
have is when they get it done they turn
their<00:00:32.910> steering<00:00:33.300> wheel<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> right<00:00:33.719> the

their steering wheel to the right the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.959 
their steering wheel to the right the
tractor<00:00:34.469> goes<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> left<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.910> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
simply is I'm going to use this as an

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.330 
simply is I'm going to use this as an
example<00:00:43.820> this<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.120> sitting<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:46.340> your

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
example this would be sitting on your

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
example this would be sitting on your
left<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:48.090> you're<00:00:48.450> sitting<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> tractor<00:00:49.140> on

allis-chalmers

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
allis-chalmers
towards<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> front<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.199> when<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> turn

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
towards the front and when you turn

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
towards the front and when you turn
right<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:57.000> pushes<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.960> way<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:59.660> excuse

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
right it pushes it this way to go excuse

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
right it pushes it this way to go excuse
me<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> turn<00:01:01.260> left<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.770> pushes<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.280> way

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
me when you turn left it pushes this way

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.240 
me when you turn left it pushes this way
to<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:02.699> left<00:01:02.930> when<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> turn<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.890> pulls

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
to go left when you turn right it pulls

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.690 
to go left when you turn right it pulls
this<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.159> well<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.520> has

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this way to go to the right well it has

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.530 
this way to go to the right well it has
to<00:01:08.880> maintain<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.430> order<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to maintain that and in order for it to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
to maintain that and in order for it to
maintain<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.979> stay<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
maintain that it has to stay in that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
maintain that it has to stay in that
orientation<00:01:15.470> even<00:01:16.470> though<00:01:16.560> you're<00:01:16.740> moving<00:01:17.070> it

orientation even though you're moving it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.190 
orientation even though you're moving it

where<00:02:15.160> they're<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.910> about<00:02:16.180> touching<00:02:16.540> here

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
where they're just about touching here

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.070 
where they're just about touching here
you<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.470> do<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:18.420> let's<00:02:19.420> get<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.870> where<00:02:20.020> you

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
you can do that let's get to where you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.280 
you can do that let's get to where you
see<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.410> light<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:22.690> see<00:02:22.720> all<00:02:23.080> they've

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
see the light you can see all they've

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.770 
see the light you can see all they've
done<00:02:23.320> is<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.770> welded<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.430> tee<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.420> bottom

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
done is just welded a tee to the bottom

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.730 
done is just welded a tee to the bottom
of<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.740> spindle<00:02:27.670> shaft<00:02:27.850> here<00:02:28.410> little<00:02:29.410> Tooty

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
of this spindle shaft here little Tooty

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.380 
of this spindle shaft here little Tooty
to<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.490> got<00:02:33.610> bolts<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.210> either

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
to it and then it's got bolts on either

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.130 
to it and then it's got bolts on either
side<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.900> hold<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.460> wheels<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.670> tires<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:37.180> so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
side to hold the wheels and tires on so

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.280 
side to hold the wheels and tires on so
but<00:02:39.100> how<00:02:39.490> do<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.970> go<00:02:40.120> right<00:02:40.900> when

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
but how do you get it to go right when

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.850 
but how do you get it to go right when
you<00:02:41.410> turn<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> steering<00:02:41.770> wheel<00:02:42.190> right<00:02:42.370> again

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
you turn the steering wheel right again

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.740 
you turn the steering wheel right again
I'm<00:02:44.860> gonna<00:02:45.040> use<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.610> as<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:47.110> example<00:02:48.600> kind<00:02:49.600> of

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
I'm gonna use this as a example kind of

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.730 
I'm gonna use this as a example kind of
like<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:50.050> drag<00:02:50.320> link<00:02:50.850> okay<00:02:52.470> instead<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.620> your

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
like your drag link okay instead of your

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.500 
like your drag link okay instead of your
drag<00:02:53.980> link<00:02:54.190> going<00:02:54.520> straight<00:02:54.880> along<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.150> side

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
drag link going straight along the side

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.210 
drag link going straight along the side
of<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.750> frame<00:02:56.040> I'll<00:02:57.040> show<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.340> here<00:02:59.220> instead

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
of the frame I'll show you here instead

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.770 
of the frame I'll show you here instead
of<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.430> going<00:03:00.550> right<00:03:01.060> along<00:03:01.180> side<00:03:01.330> of<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
of it going right along side of the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.740 
of it going right along side of the
frame<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:03.010> drag<00:03:03.280> link<00:03:03.520> is<00:03:03.730> actually<00:03:04.240> going<00:03:04.480> to

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
frame the drag link is actually going to

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
frame the drag link is actually going to
go<00:03:04.900> underneath<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:06.010> tractor<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.770> right

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
go underneath the tractor and right

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.740 
go underneath the tractor and right
underneath<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.430> tractor<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:13.450> going<00:03:13.660> to

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
underneath the tractor so it's going to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.480 
underneath the tractor so it's going to
move<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.200> same<00:03:14.470> way<00:03:14.500> no<00:03:14.920> matter<00:03:14.950> which<00:03:15.310> way

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
move the same way no matter which way

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.290 
move the same way no matter which way
you<00:03:15.550> turn<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:17.130> right<00:03:18.130> for<00:03:18.430> right<00:03:18.640> left<00:03:19.000> for

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
you turn it right for right left for

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.690 
you turn it right for right left for
left<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:20.320> gonna<00:03:20.470> push<00:03:20.860> for<00:03:21.310> one<00:03:21.460> direction

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
left it's gonna push for one direction

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.840 
left it's gonna push for one direction
pull<00:03:22.270> for<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.570> other<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:24.100> take<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.670> loose

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
pull for the other so you take it loose

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.270 
pull for the other so you take it loose
move<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.900> down<00:03:27.990> underneath<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.140> tractor<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
move it down underneath the tractor and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.890 
move it down underneath the tractor and
you<00:03:33.280> can<00:03:33.490> see<00:03:33.730> it's<00:03:34.090> bolded<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:40.720> your

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
you can see it's bolded here to your

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.140 
you can see it's bolded here to your
Pittman<00:03:41.800> armor<00:03:42.130> idler<00:03:42.459> arm<00:03:42.670> whatever<00:03:42.940> you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
Pittman armor idler arm whatever you

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.330 
Pittman armor idler arm whatever you
want<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.360> call<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.630> at<00:03:43.690> your<00:03:43.840> pitman<00:03:44.200> arm

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
want to call it at your pitman arm

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.640 
want to call it at your pitman arm
without<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.610> just<00:03:45.850> like<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:47.470> it's

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
without it just like that and it's

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.650 
without it just like that and it's
bolted<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.700> when<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.240> turn<00:03:49.540> right

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
bolted to it so that when you turn right

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.040 
bolted to it so that when you turn right
it's<00:03:52.660> going<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.020> pull<00:03:53.410> back<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:55.450> way<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:55.720> you

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
it's going to pull back this way so you

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.190 
it's going to pull back this way so you
will<00:03:56.320> go<00:03:56.530> right<00:03:57.209> which<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.450> correct<00:03:59.910> if<00:04:01.200> this

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
will go right which is correct if this

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.170 
will go right which is correct if this
piece<00:04:02.590> were<00:04:03.040> mounted<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:03.580> this<00:04:03.910> side<00:04:06.150> then<00:04:07.150> you

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
piece were mounted on this side then you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.449 
piece were mounted on this side then you
wouldn't<00:04:07.540> be<00:04:07.630> able<00:04:07.950> then<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.070> then<00:04:09.310> your

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
wouldn't be able then you then your

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.780 
wouldn't be able then you then your
steering<00:04:09.700> would<00:04:10.540> be<00:04:10.720> backwards<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.790> chances

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
steering would be backwards and chances

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.810 
steering would be backwards and chances
are<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.420> lot<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:13.930> people<00:04:14.200> that's<00:04:14.500> what<00:04:14.620> they<00:04:14.740> do

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
are a lot of people that's what they do

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.729 
are a lot of people that's what they do
because<00:04:15.820> it's<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.109> left<00:04:17.320> side<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.680> the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
because it's on the left side of the

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.680 
because it's on the left side of the
tractor<00:04:18.220> well<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.850> needs<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.180> stay<00:04:19.390> on<00:04:19.420> the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
tractor well it needs to stay on the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.420 
tractor well it needs to stay on the
left<00:04:19.870> side<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.350> spindle<00:04:21.030> not<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.180> case<00:04:23.430> it

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
left side of the spindle not the case it

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.370 
left side of the spindle not the case it
needs<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:25.000> pull<00:04:25.210> when<00:04:25.419> it's<00:04:25.570> supposed<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.900> pull

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
needs to pull when it's supposed to pull

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.000 
needs to pull when it's supposed to pull
when<00:04:26.680> it's<00:04:26.830> supposed<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.160> push<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.800> is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
when it's supposed to push so this is

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.920 
when it's supposed to push so this is
just<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.340> stop<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.300> won't<00:04:31.450> turn<00:04:31.660> too

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
just a stop so that it won't turn too

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.670 
just a stop so that it won't turn too
far<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:34.480> course<00:04:34.720> when<00:04:34.900> it<00:04:35.020> goes<00:04:35.200> full

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
far and of course when it goes full

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.820 
far and of course when it goes full
forward<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:37.060> bar<00:04:37.270> hits<00:04:37.570> when<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.380> come<00:04:38.560> full

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
forward the bar hits when you come full

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.390 
forward the bar hits when you come full
back<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:41.350> pitman<00:04:41.710> arm<00:04:41.800> hits

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
back the pitman arm hits

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.380 
back the pitman arm hits
okay<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:44.040> steering<00:04:45.040> arm<00:04:45.220> pit<00:04:45.850> Minard

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
okay so steering arm pit Minard

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
thread to the length that I need it it's

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.930 
thread to the length that I need it it's
going<00:06:29.590> to<00:06:29.680> be<00:06:29.800> underneath<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.190> tractor<00:06:30.610> and

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
going to be underneath the tractor and

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.730 
going to be underneath the tractor and
hidden<00:06:31.240> nobody's<00:06:31.600> going<00:06:31.810> to<00:06:31.840> see<00:06:32.080> it<00:06:32.110> paint<00:06:32.650> it

so<00:06:32.920> it<00:06:32.980> won't<00:06:33.130> rest<00:06:33.490> and<00:06:34.120> I<00:06:34.720> can<00:06:34.900> get<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.200> exact

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
so it won't rest and I can get the exact

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.830 
so it won't rest and I can get the exact
length<00:06:35.919> that<00:06:36.160> I<00:06:36.220> need<00:06:36.340> and<00:06:36.880> I<00:06:37.120> can<00:06:37.300> still<00:06:37.600> have

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
length that I need and I can still have

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.480 
length that I need and I can still have
my<00:06:37.870> adjustability<00:06:38.770> you

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
my adjustability you

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.100 
my adjustability you
the<00:06:39.580> problem<00:06:39.880> is<00:06:39.970> I<00:06:40.000> think<00:06:40.120> one<00:06:40.599> of<00:06:40.630> these<00:06:40.840> ends

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
the problem is I think one of these ends

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.330 
the problem is I think one of these ends
is<00:06:41.349> left<00:06:42.099> hand<00:06:42.370> thread<00:06:43.800> may<00:06:44.800> or<00:06:44.919> may<00:06:45.009> not<00:06:45.160> be

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
is left hand thread may or may not be

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:53.100 
is left hand thread may or may not be
