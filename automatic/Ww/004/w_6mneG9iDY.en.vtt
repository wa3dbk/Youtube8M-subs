it's<00:00:22.339> a<00:00:22.429> really<00:00:22.699> sparkly<00:00:23.330> light<00:00:23.599> silver<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:24.949> I

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
it's a really sparkly light silver so I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.620 
it's a really sparkly light silver so I
think<00:00:25.339> it'll<00:00:25.609> give<00:00:25.820> me<00:00:25.939> a<00:00:26.000> pretty<00:00:26.210> good<00:00:26.300> color

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
think it'll give me a pretty good color

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.800 
think it'll give me a pretty good color
I<00:00:26.900> didn't<00:00:27.679> find<00:00:28.460> any<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.089> were<00:00:29.210> loose<00:00:29.480> powder

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
I didn't find any that were loose powder

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.350 
I didn't find any that were loose powder
so<00:00:30.199> I'm<00:00:30.410> going<00:00:30.679> to<00:00:30.710> have<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.900> go<00:00:32.900> ahead<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.380> use

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
so I'm going to have to go ahead and use

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.029 
so I'm going to have to go ahead and use
the<00:00:35.360> compact<00:00:41.140> I'm<00:00:42.140> just<00:00:42.410> going<00:00:42.559> to<00:00:42.590> scrape<00:00:42.860> it

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
the compact I'm just going to scrape it

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.670 
the compact I'm just going to scrape it
out<00:00:43.129> with<00:00:43.309> a<00:00:43.340> knife<00:00:44.020> come<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.050> little<00:00:45.170> closer<00:00:45.530> so

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
out with a knife come a little closer so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.729 
out with a knife come a little closer so
you<00:00:45.829> can<00:00:46.010> actually<00:00:46.160> see<00:00:47.320> just<00:00:48.320> scrape<00:00:48.710> that

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
you can actually see just scrape that

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.740 
you can actually see just scrape that
right<00:00:49.250> on<00:00:49.520> out<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.760> there<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:56.239> could<00:00:56.449> use<00:00:56.600> your

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
right on out of there you could use your

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.560 
right on out of there you could use your
fingernail<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:57.440> suppose<00:00:58.039> or<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.340> small<00:00:58.760> spoon<00:00:59.210> -

but bamboo skier or an orange stick

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.300 
but bamboo skier or an orange stick
would<00:01:04.010> work<00:01:04.190> as<00:01:04.400> well<00:01:05.530> like<00:01:06.530> anything<00:01:06.800> to<00:01:07.190> get

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
would work as well like anything to get

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.560 
would work as well like anything to get
that<00:01:07.370> out<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:13.220> I've<00:01:13.520> got<00:01:13.700> my<00:01:13.820> eye<00:01:13.850> shadow<00:01:14.330> out

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570

to have you know just a ziploc bag those
work<00:01:31.010> great<00:01:31.340> -<00:01:31.810> there's<00:01:32.810> no<00:01:33.140> need<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.410> get

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
work great - there's no need to get

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.640 
work great - there's no need to get
anything<00:01:34.130> fancy<00:01:34.730> for<00:01:34.940> this<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:36.500> is

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
anything fancy for this and this is

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.990 
anything fancy for this and this is
going<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.920> make<00:01:37.070> plenty<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:40.460> I'm<00:01:40.610> just<00:01:40.790> going

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
going to make plenty so I'm just going

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.250 
going to make plenty so I'm just going
to<00:01:41.030> squeeze<00:01:41.480> some<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.590> there<00:01:44.260> until

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
to squeeze some of this in there until

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.530 
to squeeze some of this in there until
it's<00:01:45.650> hard<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.070> see<00:01:46.280> how<00:01:46.550> much<00:01:46.760> I'm<00:01:47.000> squeezing

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
it's hard to see how much I'm squeezing

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.710 
it's hard to see how much I'm squeezing
in<00:01:47.660> there<00:01:48.700> I'm<00:01:49.700> going<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.910> go<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.420> much

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
in there I'm going to go with that much

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.900 
in there I'm going to go with that much
I<00:01:53.410> really<00:01:54.410> just<00:01:54.650> want<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:54.980> work<00:01:55.160> it<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.730> see

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
I really just want to work it in and see

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:11.190 
I really just want to work it in and see
how<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.120> feels

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.630 

can<00:02:12.200> get<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.410> little<00:02:12.590> bit<00:02:12.860> stuck<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.370> there<00:02:13.519> this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
can get a little bit stuck in there this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.490 
can get a little bit stuck in there this
is<00:02:13.849> when<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> sandwich<00:02:14.480> grade<00:02:14.720> would<00:02:14.900> probably

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
is when a sandwich grade would probably

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.170 
is when a sandwich grade would probably
work<00:02:15.650> better<00:02:15.950> because<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.459> don't<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:16.819> quite

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
work better because you don't have quite

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:27.309 
work better because you don't have quite
that<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.680> point<00:02:19.209> there<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:21.640> get<00:02:22.640> into<00:02:26.319> suppose

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
that the point there to get into suppose

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.309 
that the point there to get into suppose
that's<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:27.799> tools<00:02:28.069> are<00:02:28.370> made<00:02:28.489> for<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
that's what tools are made for to

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.089 
that's what tools are made for to
probably<00:02:30.319> put<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.769> should<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.640> put<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
probably put a should have put the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.400 
probably put a should have put the
AL<00:02:34.099> aver<00:02:34.489> in<00:02:34.730> first<00:02:37.480> there<00:02:38.480> we<00:02:38.599> go<00:02:38.810> now<00:02:39.200> it's

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
AL aver in first there we go now it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.539 
AL aver in first there we go now it's
all<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.560> there<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.079> feels<00:02:42.380> pretty<00:02:42.500> good

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.069 

I'm<00:02:46.549> just<00:02:46.730> going<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.060> flip<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.569> around<00:02:47.720> a

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
I'm just going to flip it around a

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:58.979 
I'm just going to flip it around a
little<00:02:48.290> bit<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.599> it's<00:02:57.380> ready

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
little bit more and it's ready

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.069 
little bit more and it's ready
so<00:02:59.989> there's<00:03:00.620> gilding<00:03:01.250> paste<00:03:01.549> I<00:03:02.030> just<00:03:02.810> need<00:03:02.959> to

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
so there's gilding paste I just need to

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.080 
so there's gilding paste I just need to
pop<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.650> cone<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.840> ready<00:03:06.139> to<00:03:06.319> go

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
pop it in a cone and it's ready to go

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.240 
pop it in a cone and it's ready to go
it's<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.239> beautiful<00:03:08.450> light<00:03:09.350> pearlescent

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
it's that beautiful light pearlescent

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.759 
it's that beautiful light pearlescent
