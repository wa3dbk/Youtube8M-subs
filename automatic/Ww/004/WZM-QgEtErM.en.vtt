showing<00:01:56.259> up<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:57.369> bad<00:01:57.549> things<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.030> old<00:01:58.149> age<00:01:58.420> if

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.669 
at 90
he<00:02:03.880> was<00:02:04.030> as<00:02:04.179> good-looking<00:02:04.479> as<00:02:04.990> he'd<00:02:05.259> ever<00:02:05.409> been
