bicycles and they're about three or four
laps<00:02:59.999> into<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.480> about<00:03:00.689> four<00:03:00.959> cars<00:03:01.230> got<00:03:01.469> by<00:03:01.709> me

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
lucky and and we were marginally tight

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.800 
lucky and and we were marginally tight

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.160 
know for sure after they dropped the red
there<00:03:11.670> if<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.969> wasn't<00:03:12.389> too<00:03:12.540> tight<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.989> where<00:03:13.139> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
there if I wasn't too tight to where I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.959 
there if I wasn't too tight to where I
couldn't<00:03:13.469> maneuver<00:03:13.829> enough<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.370> race<00:03:14.579> but<00:03:14.790> as

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
couldn't maneuver enough to race but as

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.809 
couldn't maneuver enough to race but as
a<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:15.780> my<00:03:16.079> fuel<00:03:16.379> load<00:03:16.590> went<00:03:16.829> out<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.010> continued

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
a as my fuel load went out I continued

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.479 
a as my fuel load went out I continued
to<00:03:17.969> get<00:03:18.090> faster<00:03:18.629> and<00:03:18.719> faster<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.409> then<00:03:19.590> that's

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
to get faster and faster and then that's

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.599 
to get faster and faster and then that's
pretty<00:03:20.700> good<00:03:20.849> at<00:03:20.969> the<00:03:21.120> end<00:03:21.239> well<00:03:22.459> it's<00:03:23.459> a
