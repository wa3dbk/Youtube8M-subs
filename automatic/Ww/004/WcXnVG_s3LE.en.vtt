tedious to do and require patience and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.780 
tedious to do and require patience and
they<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.770> be<00:02:15.920> done<00:02:16.099> I'm<00:02:16.370> not<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.640> most

squeegee<00:02:24.700> help<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.819> squeegee<00:02:26.209> everything

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
squeegee help you squeegee everything

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.199 
squeegee help you squeegee everything
out<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.310> I'll<00:02:28.310> go<00:02:28.459> ahead<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.849> get<00:02:28.910> started

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
out so I'll go ahead and get started

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.440 
out so I'll go ahead and get started
with<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.900> we'll<00:02:30.739> go<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:31.040> there

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.000 

so<00:02:35.450> I've<00:02:35.599> separated<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.260> two<00:02:36.440> makes<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.950> a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
so I've separated the two makes it a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.240 
so I've separated the two makes it a
little<00:02:37.069> bit<00:02:37.220> easier<00:02:37.519> for<00:02:37.580> me<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:39.470> let's<00:02:40.069> go

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
little bit easier for me and let's go

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.610 
little bit easier for me and let's go
ahead<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.730> get<00:02:41.090> started

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.800

does make it a lot easier stick alright
so<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.390> prevent<00:03:03.870> fingerprints<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.800> sort<00:03:05.040> of

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
so to prevent fingerprints that sort of

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.720 
so to prevent fingerprints that sort of
thing<00:03:07.340> if<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.640> keep<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:09.030> wet<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.570> will<00:03:09.930> not

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
thing if you keep it wet it will not

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.910 
thing if you keep it wet it will not
show<00:03:11.730> fingerprints<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:13.080> works<00:03:13.560> out<00:03:13.770> pretty

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
show fingerprints it works out pretty

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.530 
show fingerprints it works out pretty
good

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:32.050 

okay<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:22.569> here's<00:03:30.430> picking<00:03:31.430> out<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.670> part<00:03:31.879> for

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
okay so here's picking out the part for

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.319 
okay so here's picking out the part for
the<00:03:32.120> lens<00:03:32.620> now<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:33.950> nice<00:03:34.129> and<00:03:34.370> wet<00:03:34.549> don't

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
the lens now this is nice and wet don't

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.210 
the lens now this is nice and wet don't
worry<00:03:35.629> about<00:03:36.019> getting<00:03:36.379> that<00:03:36.620> on<00:03:36.829> your<00:03:37.010> phone

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
worry about getting that on your phone

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.390 
worry about getting that on your phone
the<00:03:38.030> phones<00:03:38.299> pretty<00:03:38.750> well<00:03:38.989> sealed<00:03:39.349> worry<00:03:40.159> more

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
the phones pretty well sealed worry more

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.890 
the phones pretty well sealed worry more
about<00:03:40.430> lining<00:03:40.909> it<00:03:41.180> up<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.480> getting<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.810> all

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
about lining it up and getting it all

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:55.250 
about lining it up and getting it all
right

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.800 

so<00:03:56.260> now<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.740> on<00:03:56.890> there<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:58.390> start<00:03:58.660> to

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
so now it's on there you start to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.780 
so now it's on there you start to
squeegee<00:03:59.080> now<00:03:59.770> this<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.220> I'll<00:04:00.340> have<00:04:00.490> to<00:04:00.610> tell

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
squeegee now this is I'll have to tell

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.040 
squeegee now this is I'll have to tell
you<00:04:00.880> this<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.540> about<00:04:01.750> 10<00:04:01.990> times<00:04:02.170> easier<00:04:04.050> then

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
you this is about 10 times easier then

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.350 
you this is about 10 times easier then
doing<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.770> before<00:04:06.190> where<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.670> had<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.300> a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
doing it before where you had this on a

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.380 
doing it before where you had this on a
curved<00:04:07.660> surface<00:04:07.950> flat<00:04:08.950> surface<00:04:09.400> definitely

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
curved surface flat surface definitely

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.520 
curved surface flat surface definitely
makes<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.690> difference<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.290> want<00:04:11.470> to

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
makes a difference and you want to

squeegee these bubbles oh whoops
I'm<00:04:14.020> going<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.230> squeegee<00:04:14.410> these<00:04:14.680> bubbles<00:04:15.070> away

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
I'm going to squeegee these bubbles away

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.930 
I'm going to squeegee these bubbles away
from<00:04:16.090> anything<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:17.190> got<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:18.340> does<00:04:18.580> kind<00:04:18.790> of

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
from anything I got this does kind of

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.370 
from anything I got this does kind of
soak<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.300> up<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.450> little<00:04:19.510> bit<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:20.170> want<00:04:20.260> to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380

soak it up a little bit you want to
squeegee<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.830> bubbles<00:04:21.100> away<00:04:21.520> from<00:04:21.850> any<00:04:22.090> any

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
squeegee the bubbles away from any any

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.530 
squeegee the bubbles away from any any
port<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:23.830> not<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:24.640> much<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.820> concern<00:04:25.210> on<00:04:25.390> the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
port so not so much a concern on the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.450 
port so not so much a concern on the
backside<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.380> but<00:04:26.770> on<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.010> front<00:04:27.310> it

will be and any micro bubbles aren't

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.940 
will be and any micro bubbles aren't
gonna<00:04:30.820> be<00:04:31.000> too<00:04:31.240> much<00:04:31.420> of<00:04:31.480> an<00:04:31.690> issue<00:04:31.950> just

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950

there we'll push that help don't be
afraid<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.280> give<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.550> little<00:04:39.760> bit<00:04:39.850> of<00:04:39.940> force

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
afraid to give it a little bit of force

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.040 
afraid to give it a little bit of force

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
takes some time to set is the more time

takes some time to set is the more time
you<00:04:53.980> give<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.700> more<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.570> will<00:04:55.600> set<00:04:55.930> up

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
you give it the more it will set up

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:10.240 
you give it the more it will set up
there<00:04:57.790> we<00:04:57.880> go

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.879 

and<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.639> have<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.180> say<00:05:12.389> I've<00:05:12.540> done<00:05:12.720> about<00:05:12.889> seven

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
and I have to say I've done about seven

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.750 
and I have to say I've done about seven
to<00:05:14.100> ten<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.550> these<00:05:14.760> so<00:05:15.889> it<00:05:16.889> does<00:05:17.100> take<00:05:17.340> patience

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
to ten of these so it does take patience

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.540 
to ten of these so it does take patience
and<00:05:17.970> time<00:05:18.210> I'll<00:05:19.169> tell<00:05:19.410> you<00:05:19.590> what<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:20.040> is<00:05:20.190> way

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
and time I'll tell you what this is way

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.110 
and time I'll tell you what this is way
way<00:05:20.970> easier<00:05:21.000> than<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.900> iPhone<00:05:22.260> 3G<00:05:22.770> 3GS<00:05:23.220> so<00:05:24.000> if

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
way easier than the iPhone 3G 3GS so if

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.760 
way easier than the iPhone 3G 3GS so if
you<00:05:24.210> do<00:05:24.360> have<00:05:24.570> one<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.750> those<00:05:24.930> take<00:05:25.320> your<00:05:25.530> time

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
you do have one of those take your time

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.760 
you do have one of those take your time
on<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:26.130> corners<00:05:26.550> give<00:05:27.449> us<00:05:27.570> some<00:05:27.720> time<00:05:27.930> if<00:05:28.530> it's

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
on the corners give us some time if it's

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.520 
on the corners give us some time if it's
being<00:05:28.949> frustrating<00:05:29.699> walk<00:05:30.630> away<00:05:30.960> come<00:05:31.500> back

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
being frustrating walk away come back

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:42.700 
being frustrating walk away come back
and<00:05:32.040> you'll<00:05:32.729> be<00:05:32.880> able<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.240> fix<00:05:33.449> that<00:05:33.630> right<00:05:33.690> up

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:56.390 

right<00:05:43.710> there

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.370 

so<00:05:57.400> that's<00:05:57.580> basically<00:05:57.970> how<00:05:58.180> you<00:05:58.240> do<00:05:58.450> it<00:05:58.600> I'll

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
so that's basically how you do it I'll

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.409 
so that's basically how you do it I'll
wait<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.620> little<00:05:59.950> bit<00:06:00.310> let<00:06:00.880> it<00:06:01.000> sit<00:06:01.180> on<00:06:01.210> the

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
wait a little bit let it sit on the

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.860 
wait a little bit let it sit on the
front<00:06:01.600> I'll<00:06:02.290> do<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.560> sides<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.690> that'll<00:06:04.690> be

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
front I'll do the sides and that'll be

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.650 
front I'll do the sides and that'll be
about<00:06:05.169> it<00:06:05.410> okay<00:06:06.400> so<00:06:06.460> I<00:06:06.639> just<00:06:06.730> finished<00:06:07.300> up

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
about it okay so I just finished up

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.790 
about it okay so I just finished up
putting<00:06:08.080> the<00:06:08.290> final<00:06:08.590> touches<00:06:08.770> on<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.780> zag

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
putting the final touches on the zag

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.900 
putting the final touches on the zag
invisible<00:06:11.800> shield<00:06:12.010> for<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:12.250> iPhone<00:06:12.580> 4<00:06:12.880> I

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
invisible shield for the iPhone 4 I

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.310 
invisible shield for the iPhone 4 I
think<00:06:13.210> it's<00:06:13.330> turned<00:06:13.570> out<00:06:13.630> pretty<00:06:13.840> good<00:06:14.110> I'm

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
think it's turned out pretty good I'm

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.409 
think it's turned out pretty good I'm
still<00:06:14.620> waiting<00:06:14.919> for<00:06:14.950> it<00:06:15.070> to<00:06:15.160> dry<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:16.180> doesn't

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
still waiting for it to dry it doesn't

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.050 
still waiting for it to dry it doesn't
fully<00:06:16.600> settle<00:06:16.990> for<00:06:17.080> about<00:06:17.230> 24<00:06:17.590> hours<00:06:17.760> so<00:06:18.810> a<00:06:21.060> lot

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
fully settle for about 24 hours so a lot

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.820 
fully settle for about 24 hours so a lot
of<00:06:22.180> small<00:06:22.419> pieces<00:06:22.570> I<00:06:22.990> don't<00:06:23.470> know<00:06:23.530> if<00:06:23.620> you<00:06:23.710> can

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
of small pieces I don't know if you can

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.890 
of small pieces I don't know if you can
see<00:06:24.040> that<00:06:24.250> but<00:06:24.880> there's<00:06:25.030> lots<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.419> tiny<00:06:25.600> pieces

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
see that but there's lots of tiny pieces

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.969 
see that but there's lots of tiny pieces
on<00:06:26.169> top<00:06:26.669> yeah<00:06:27.669> you've<00:06:28.660> got<00:06:28.810> a<00:06:28.840> tiny<00:06:29.169> piece<00:06:29.530> here

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
on top yeah you've got a tiny piece here

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.740 
on top yeah you've got a tiny piece here
for<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.520> corner<00:06:30.850> little<00:06:31.360> ones<00:06:31.510> in<00:06:31.660> between

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
for the corner little ones in between

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.020 
for the corner little ones in between
the<00:06:32.080> buttons<00:06:33.389> you<00:06:34.389> can<00:06:34.450> see<00:06:34.780> it's<00:06:34.900> pretty

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
the buttons you can see it's pretty

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.430 
the buttons you can see it's pretty
pretty<00:06:37.030> intense<00:06:37.419> to<00:06:37.690> put<00:06:37.810> those<00:06:37.930> on<00:06:38.139> but<00:06:38.320> it's

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
pretty intense to put those on but it's

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.250 
pretty intense to put those on but it's
actually<00:06:38.950> a<00:06:38.979> lot<00:06:39.190> easier<00:06:39.250> than<00:06:39.760> the<00:06:39.850> 3GS<00:06:40.270> just

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
actually a lot easier than the 3GS just

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.040 
actually a lot easier than the 3GS just
because<00:06:42.150> there<00:06:43.150> you<00:06:43.210> don't<00:06:43.360> have<00:06:43.540> this<00:06:43.690> curved

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
because there you don't have this curved

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.900 
because there you don't have this curved
back<00:06:44.440> on<00:06:44.710> the<00:06:44.830> phone<00:06:45.070> and<00:06:45.280> that<00:06:45.340> really<00:06:45.760> made

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
back on the phone and that really made

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.250 
back on the phone and that really made
it<00:06:45.940> hard<00:06:46.210> if<00:06:46.360> you<00:06:46.450> can<00:06:46.570> see<00:06:46.750> I<00:06:46.780> did<00:06:47.020> a<00:06:47.080> pretty

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
it hard if you can see I did a pretty

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.290 
it hard if you can see I did a pretty
good<00:06:47.380> job<00:06:47.440> I<00:06:47.650> think<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.370> it's<00:06:48.639> not<00:06:48.820> even<00:06:48.970> dry

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
good job I think and it's not even dry

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.050 
good job I think and it's not even dry
yet<00:06:49.330> so<00:06:49.919> pretty<00:06:50.919> nice<00:06:51.130> I<00:06:51.490> know<00:06:51.760> you're

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
yet so pretty nice I know you're

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.719 
yet so pretty nice I know you're
supposed<00:06:52.210> to<00:06:52.450> turn<00:06:52.600> the<00:06:52.660> device<00:06:52.900> off<00:06:53.580> but<00:06:54.580> it's

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:54.729 
supposed to turn the device off but it's

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.270 
supposed to turn the device off but it's
on<00:06:54.880> because<00:06:55.270> I<00:06:55.360> didn't<00:06:55.600> use<00:06:56.130> wasn't<00:06:57.130> water

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
on because I didn't use wasn't water

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.980 
on because I didn't use wasn't water
everywhere<00:06:57.820> I'm<00:06:57.970> very<00:06:58.180> careful<00:06:58.389> with<00:06:58.720> doing

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
everywhere I'm very careful with doing

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.610 
everywhere I'm very careful with doing
that<00:06:59.139> and<00:06:59.740> I<00:07:00.370> used<00:07:01.270> a<00:07:01.660> decent<00:07:02.200> amount<00:07:02.440> of<00:07:02.500> the

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
that and I used a decent amount of the

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.390 
that and I used a decent amount of the
fluid<00:07:02.950> just<00:07:03.160> about<00:07:03.820> all<00:07:03.940> of<00:07:04.060> it<00:07:04.470> and<00:07:05.470> this<00:07:06.190> is

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
fluid just about all of it and this is

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.860 
fluid just about all of it and this is
the<00:07:06.430> aftermath<00:07:06.940> of<00:07:07.330> getting<00:07:07.570> the<00:07:07.690> little

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
the aftermath of getting the little

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.659 
the aftermath of getting the little
pieces<00:07:08.050> off<00:07:08.350> so<00:07:08.620> did<00:07:09.160> a<00:07:09.190> pretty<00:07:09.430> good<00:07:09.610> job

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
pieces off so did a pretty good job

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.880 
pieces off so did a pretty good job
