in<00:00:01.949> this<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.370> just<00:00:02.580> wanted<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.879> quickly<00:00:03.120> go

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
in this video just wanted to quickly go

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.960 
in this video just wanted to quickly go
over<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.870> fact<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.799> have<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> new<00:00:05.370> draw

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
over the fact that you have a new draw

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.990 
over the fact that you have a new draw
mode<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.899> now<00:00:07.230> compatible<00:00:08.040> with<00:00:08.880> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
mode that is now compatible with the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.350 
mode that is now compatible with the
post<00:00:09.240> tool<00:00:09.599> previously<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.950> 3d<00:00:11.460> spline<00:00:12.000> was

not<00:00:12.630> compatible<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.349> this<00:00:13.740> particular<00:00:14.009> tool

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
not compatible with this particular tool

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.090 
not compatible with this particular tool
and<00:00:14.759> now<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.170> intricate

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
and now you can make intricate

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.970 
and now you can make intricate
selections<00:00:17.699> around<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.140> circumference<00:00:19.710> or

drama<00:00:23.910> works<00:00:24.150> pretty<00:00:24.359> well<00:00:24.480> whenever<00:00:25.019> you're

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
drama works pretty well whenever you're

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.519 
drama works pretty well whenever you're
making<00:00:25.849> selections<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.480> single<00:00:28.080> side<00:00:28.349> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
making selections on a single side of

making selections on a single side of
the<00:00:28.650> object<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.599> whenever<00:00:30.599> you're<00:00:30.779> trying<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the object but whenever you're trying to

the object but whenever you're trying to
make<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> selection<00:00:31.740> around<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.820> area<00:00:33.149> that's

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
make a selection around an area that's

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.530 
make a selection around an area that's
occluded<00:00:34.170> by<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.559> object<00:00:35.070> itself<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:36.180> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
occluded by the object itself then it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440 
occluded by the object itself then it
becomes<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.350> problematic<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.300> always

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
becomes very problematic and it's always

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
becomes very problematic and it's always
a<00:00:39.600> good<00:00:39.780> idea<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.379> make<00:00:40.590> sure<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.070> have

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
a good idea to make sure that you have

you can make some very intricate
fall-off<00:01:14.430> curves<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.390> allows<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
fall-off curves and it allows you to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.679 
fall-off curves and it allows you to
make<00:01:16.170> some<00:01:16.320> very<00:01:16.560> interesting<00:01:17.060> shapes<00:01:18.060> from

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
make some very interesting shapes from

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.140 
make some very interesting shapes from
it<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.100> case<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.700> chose<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it but in this case I just chose a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.469 
it but in this case I just chose a
standard<00:01:21.780> s-curve<00:01:23.540> okay<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.299> little

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
standard s-curve okay and in your little

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.249 
standard s-curve okay and in your little
toggle<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.380> save<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:30.150> spline<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
toggle you can save your spline here you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.700 
toggle you can save your spline here you
can<00:01:31.380> also<00:01:31.579> save<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> load<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.079> from

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
can also save it and load it here from

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.620 
can also save it and load it here from
the<00:01:34.890> panel<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> I'll<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.850> hit<00:01:38.970> escape<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the panel so I'll just hit escape to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.670 
the panel so I'll just hit escape to
drop<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> spline<00:01:42.740> smooth<00:01:43.740> selection

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.680 

I<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.670> there<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.940> little<00:01:48.210> bit<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
I see that there was a little bit of a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.260 
I see that there was a little bit of a
spill<00:01:49.230> right<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.370> can<00:01:50.730> do<00:01:50.940> is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
spill right there so what I can do is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.320 
spill right there so what I can do is
just<00:01:51.950> clean<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.160> up<00:01:53.190> I'm<00:01:53.730> gonna<00:01:53.910> hide<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
just clean that up I'm gonna hide the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.050 
just clean that up I'm gonna hide the
gizmo<00:01:54.720> temporarily<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:56.520> gonna<00:01:56.760> hold<00:01:56.940> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
gizmo temporarily and I'm gonna hold the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.000 
gizmo temporarily and I'm gonna hold the
control<00:01:57.420> key<00:01:57.690> while<00:01:57.960> I'll<00:01:58.260> use<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.650> polygonal

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
control key while I'll use the polygonal

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:10.859 
control key while I'll use the polygonal
lasso<00:01:59.190> to<00:02:00.150> clean<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:01.140> artifact

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.229 

same<00:02:11.530> thing<00:02:11.770> here<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:14.640> could<00:02:15.640> obviously<00:02:15.849> tweak

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
same thing here I could obviously tweak

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.910 
same thing here I could obviously tweak
it<00:02:16.360> some<00:02:16.510> more<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:17.080> for<00:02:17.410> demonstration

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
it some more but for demonstration

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.640 
it some more but for demonstration
purposes<00:02:18.340> we'll<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.819> continue<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.500> yeah

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
purposes we'll just continue on so yeah

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.309 
purposes we'll just continue on so yeah
let's<00:02:20.920> go<00:02:21.069> ahead<00:02:21.220> now<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.819> unhide<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.930> gizmo

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
let's go ahead now and unhide the gizmo

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.860 
let's go ahead now and unhide the gizmo
and<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.400> reset<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.880> axis<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.480> straighten

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
and I can reset the axis to straighten

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.729 
and I can reset the axis to straighten
that<00:02:25.989> up<00:02:26.459> hold<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.640> shift<00:02:27.880> key<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.510> move<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
that up hold the shift key to move the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.000 
that up hold the shift key to move the
pivot<00:02:29.920> point<00:02:30.280> if<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.580> want<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.440> scale<00:02:35.980> it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
pivot point if I want so I can scale it

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.350 
pivot point if I want so I can scale it
globally<00:02:36.610> inward<00:02:40.560> maybe<00:02:41.560> scale<00:02:42.190> it

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
globally inward maybe scale it

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:51.559 
globally inward maybe scale it
vertically

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.259 

and<00:02:52.110> maybe<00:02:52.319> an<00:02:52.560> early<00:02:52.860> one<00:02:53.069> skin<00:02:55.939> even<00:02:56.939> move<00:02:57.150> it

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
and maybe an early one skin even move it

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.800 
and maybe an early one skin even move it
all<00:02:57.390> for

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.660 

I'll<00:03:02.080> clear<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.500> selection<00:03:02.680> where<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.310> hit

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
I'll clear the selection where I can hit

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.510 
I'll clear the selection where I can hit
ctrl<00:03:04.180> D<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.440> will<00:03:05.650> conclude<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.310> quick

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
ctrl D so that will conclude this quick

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.820 
ctrl D so that will conclude this quick
