00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
today I'm going to change out my rear

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.370 
today I'm going to change out my rear
brake<00:00:06.540> lights<00:00:06.890> I'm<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.220> be<00:00:08.309> putting<00:00:08.639> in

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
brake lights I'm going to be putting in

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.430 
brake lights I'm going to be putting in
the<00:00:10.380> COSO<00:00:10.889> afterburner<00:00:11.759> tail<00:00:12.570> lights<00:00:15.350> this<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the COSO afterburner tail lights this is

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.870 
the COSO afterburner tail lights this is
the<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.680> time<00:00:16.920> I've<00:00:17.070> ever<00:00:17.220> worked<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.609> this

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
the first time I've ever worked on this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.269 
the first time I've ever worked on this
so<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> am<00:00:18.570> an<00:00:18.750> amateur<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.650> seemed<00:00:20.220> like

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
so I am an amateur and this seemed like

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.269 
so I am an amateur and this seemed like
a<00:00:20.840> fairly<00:00:21.840> easy<00:00:22.189> modification<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:25.279> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
a fairly easy modification to do the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.870 
a fairly easy modification to do the
current<00:00:26.580> headlights<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:27.300> taillights<00:00:28.050> as

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
current headlights or taillights as

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.269 
current headlights or taillights as
everyone<00:00:29.880> knows<00:00:29.910> aren't<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> brightest<00:00:31.279> on

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
everyone knows aren't the brightest on

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.190 
everyone knows aren't the brightest on
the<00:00:32.460> road<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.420> thought<00:00:33.719> I'd<00:00:33.840> increase<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the road so I thought I'd increase a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.630 
the road so I thought I'd increase a
little<00:00:34.469> bit<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.649> safety<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.250> add<00:00:35.370> something

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
little bit of safety and add something

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.979 
little bit of safety and add something
pretty<00:00:35.940> cool<00:00:36.380> so<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:39.120> first<00:00:39.329> step<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.750> there's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
pretty cool so the first step is there's

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.330 
pretty cool so the first step is there's
only<00:00:40.140> three<00:00:40.860> screws<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.640> remove<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:43.129> we<00:00:44.129> have

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
only three screws to remove and we have

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.200 
only three screws to remove and we have
one<00:00:44.579> screw<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.950> have

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
one screw right here and then we have

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.290 
one screw right here and then we have
two<00:00:48.210> underneath<00:00:50.420> one<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
two underneath one is right there and

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.400 
two underneath one is right there and
one<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> other<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.079> removes

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
one on the other side and that removes

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.590 
one on the other side and that removes
the<00:00:55.649> housing<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.670> I'll<00:00:57.090> show<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.270> how<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> do

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the housing and I'll show you how I do

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
the housing and I'll show you how I do
it<00:00:58.760> easy

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it easy

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
it easy
just<00:01:02.510> toss<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> bin<00:01:04.019> hopefully<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> don't

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
just toss in the bin hopefully I don't

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
just toss in the bin hopefully I don't
lose<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:06.200> here<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.600> number<00:01:15.750> three

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
lose it here and one here number three

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.760 
lose it here and one here number three
so<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.460> housing<00:01:18.110> comes<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.290> real

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so right now this housing comes off real

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460 
so right now this housing comes off real
easy<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.909> sort<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.380> wiggle<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
easy so you just sort of wiggle it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.670 
easy so you just sort of wiggle it
there's<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.400> couple<00:01:23.970> light<00:01:24.360> Clips<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
there's a couple light Clips there and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
there's a couple light Clips there and
you<00:01:26.159> pull<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> out<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.930> there

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
you pull it out so now you can see there

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
you pull it out so now you can see there
are<00:01:32.299> two<00:01:33.299> electrical<00:01:33.990> clips<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.360> one<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
are two electrical clips and one is the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.780 
are two electrical clips and one is the
light<00:01:36.810> bulb<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:38.369> also<00:01:38.520> seem<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
light bulb and I also seem to have a

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
light bulb and I also seem to have a
school<00:01:41.790> event<00:01:41.939> living<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.200> maybe

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
school event living in there so maybe

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
school event living in there so maybe
it's<00:01:43.560> good<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> actually<00:01:44.509> take<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.630> part

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
it's good that I actually take this part

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.789 
it's good that I actually take this part
and<00:01:46.020> clean<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.829> bit

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.959 

so<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.579> remove<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.240> green<00:01:53.450> foot<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:55.579> move<00:01:55.759> the

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
so I remove the green foot and move the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.249 
so I remove the green foot and move the
brown<00:01:56.179> clip<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:58.399> then<00:01:58.640> next<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:01:59.929> going<00:02:00.200> to

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
brown clip and then next is I'm going to

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.969 
brown clip and then next is I'm going to
remove<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.770> light<00:02:00.950> bulb<00:02:01.329> which<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:02.860> twist<00:02:03.860> to

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
remove the light bulb which you twist to

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.330 
remove the light bulb which you twist to
counterclockwise<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.850> remove<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:09.340> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
counterclockwise and you remove it and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.490 
counterclockwise and you remove it and
there<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.120> have<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.049> difference<00:02:12.379> is

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
there you have it so the difference is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.979 
there you have it so the difference is
the<00:02:12.680> LED<00:02:13.099> is<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> self-contained<00:02:14.000> unit<00:02:14.390> with

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
the LED is a self-contained unit with

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.710 
the LED is a self-contained unit with
the<00:02:15.730> lighting<00:02:16.730> elements<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
the lighting elements in it so the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.479 
the lighting elements in it so the
original<00:02:18.790> original<00:02:19.790> equipment<00:02:20.540> manufacturer

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
original original equipment manufacturer

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.580 
original original equipment manufacturer
piece<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:22.700> have<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.879> remove<00:02:23.299> from<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.440> light

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
piece you have to remove from the light

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.069 
piece you have to remove from the light
housing<00:02:25.599> because<00:02:26.599> it's<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.989> be

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
housing because it's going to be

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.449 
housing because it's going to be
replaced<00:02:27.470> by<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.799> new<00:02:28.130> LED<00:02:28.760> unit<00:02:30.130> when<00:02:31.130> you

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
replaced by the new LED unit when you

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.259 
replaced by the new LED unit when you
remove<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.819> piece<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.980> as<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.069> can<00:02:34.190> see

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.610 

maybe<00:02:38.269> I<00:02:38.360> should<00:02:38.630> keep<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.989> scooter<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
maybe I should keep this scooter in the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.470 
maybe I should keep this scooter in the
garage<00:02:39.920> more<00:02:40.250> often<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:41.860> lot<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:43.040> ants<00:02:43.329> so<00:02:44.329> I'm

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
garage more often a lot of ants so I'm

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.539 
garage more often a lot of ants so I'm
going<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.690> actually<00:02:44.870> go<00:02:45.170> clean<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.650> off<00:02:45.920> and

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.920 

okay<00:02:49.549> now<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.819> have<00:02:50.739> cleaned<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.920> housing<00:02:52.930> and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
okay now I have cleaned the housing and

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.890 
okay now I have cleaned the housing and
you<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.440> see<00:02:54.620> here<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.090> empty<00:02:56.569> piece

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900
