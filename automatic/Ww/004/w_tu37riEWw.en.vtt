00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
think the hardest bit of guy to play is

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.770 
think the hardest bit of guy to play is
when<00:02:34.370> it's<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.580> he's<00:02:35.760> being<00:02:36.000> humiliated<00:02:36.330> by

when it's when he's being humiliated by
the<00:02:36.840> sheriff<00:02:37.290> because<00:02:38.000> his<00:02:39.000> guys<00:02:39.630> view<00:02:40.080> of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
the sheriff because his guys view of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.949 
the sheriff because his guys view of
himself<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:41.390> think<00:02:42.390> there's<00:02:42.540> quite<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> lot<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
himself I think there's quite a lot of

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.390 
himself I think there's quite a lot of
vanity<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.560> think<00:02:43.739> he<00:02:43.800> believes<00:02:44.130> that

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
vanity that I think he believes that

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.630 
vanity that I think he believes that
he's<00:02:44.520> something<00:02:45.769> quite<00:02:46.769> majestic<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.550> then

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
he's something quite majestic and then

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.370 
he's something quite majestic and then
when<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.880> sheriff<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.660> sort<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:48.989> stripping

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
