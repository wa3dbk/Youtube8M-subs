00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.870
 we will need sources 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.870
 to fight a child 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.680
 Gaps applied hours 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.140
 or an armchair or plastic container in a 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.830
 peroxide of 40 or 30 volumes powder 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.830
 Colorant 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.029
 and our dye that we are going to occupy in 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.669
 this case I'm using this peanut bread 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.070
 and nailing the fruit a comb for 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.360
 separate the hair 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.360
 and in this model 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.680
 well then let's start here 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.490
 I'm showing the dye that I'm going to 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 occupy in the pollen line of fanny and 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.100
 it is amplified 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.080
 Well here I show you that I have a list 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.790
 the bleaching mixture have to 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.670
 check the formula that comes in your 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.390
 package to prepare it and then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.030
 can apply, remember that the volume 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.339
 dow proxy pass varies as the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 proximity of the hair to the resistance 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.490
 to the neutral tone of your hair and then there 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.360
 to check if they resist in the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 discoloration do some tests before and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 see if it can be good here I'm 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.130
 applying a little product in this 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.830
 aluminum paper from the opaque side of paper 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.680
 aluminum and this is so good at the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.229
 Hair saturates the product well and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.170
 also fixate the paper and we are not 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.150
 mobile 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.020
 with the help of our little one we're going 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.079
 to put 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.789
 where we want to do the effect on 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.740
 This case is good because they smile the hair 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.100
 super short and let's make a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.049
 species a continuous species 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.259
 little ones so you can see them 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.619
 effects as well as mixed between your 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.620
 dark hair and little lights like in 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.290
 purple 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.410
 we will saturate the product well 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.960
 hair do not go to any loose ends 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.860
 because we can get our hair 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.010
 will be uneven and know ugly already 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.170
 is not going to be a father then it is strong that 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.170
 They saturate the hair very well 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.500
 and another little thing is that you should use a 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.330
 good product especially visits and 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.600
 two little things with the cameras for the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.300
 hair that are plastic me in this 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.090
 case had no plastic parts so 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.160
 little girls so I had to use these 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.490
 which are metal but preferably 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.140
 always use accessories that are 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.440
 plastic in the case of 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.440
 discolorations 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.239
 we close our packages and so we go 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.569
 to feel about I did some 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.420
 four hair curtains 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.379
 super small but to make it look 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.599
 as well as several puppies like this among 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.599
 two purple then 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.950
 then well we remember that we will be 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.010
 very good hair and let's talk to 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.670
 our little packages we can assure ourselves 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.050
 with tweezers so they do not go 9 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.330
 depending on good long pass of your 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.280
 little head is in your country in hair 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.770
 long not only in short hair 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.490
 and well, here we have our 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.410
 ready model with all the packets of 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.180
 the mini curtains that we are 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.720
 doing 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.540
 amen what remains is to wait 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.100
 the time of a fading 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.500
 Mary a lot depending on the hair and 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.930
 depending on whether color fast 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.970
 Well, that's saying that it really varied 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.350
 there is no specific time but you should not 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.050
 spend 50 minutes is already a maximum 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.170
 50 minutes 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.400
 subsequently good then we found a 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.069
 fatal 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.590
 a half clarification that I believe 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.230
 which suited us well for the type of dye 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.610
 that we are going to apply and here I am 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.250
 applying a dye 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.090
 as you can see if it shows a lot in 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.090
 the part of the rolls 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.320
 and in the same way because you have to get very 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.870
 well the hair so that everything small and 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.620
 well painted and we have to never wind 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.620
 I die for him 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.980
 I try to comb a little bit with the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.820
 brush so I'm not going to stay around 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.030
 an unpainted horse 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.370
 and remember to saturate very well and we go with 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.940
 a little message so that all the hair 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.120
 set in the product 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.950
 we are also going to let it rest and good 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.380
 Well this is the final result 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.110
 if they realize it, the hair 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.690
 dark camerÃ­n guaditoca of dark that 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.370
 I had gained weight and it is just 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.190
 effect that we want to achieve that is not 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.729
 saw as well as everything of color but it 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.889
 they saw some effective food 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.279
 apparently this good is happy with 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.770
 the result and then to us too 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:22.110
 we liked remember to subscribe and give them 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.949
 little hands up see you in the next 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.460
 video 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.460
 bye
