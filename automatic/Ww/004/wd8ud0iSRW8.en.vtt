the passing of the torch someone say
because<00:00:50.700> every<00:00:50.910> time<00:00:51.090> they've<00:00:51.390> been<00:00:51.420> mostly

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
because every time they've been mostly

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.310 
because every time they've been mostly
done<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.820> money<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> bank<00:00:54.180> winner<00:00:54.300> most<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
done a money in the bank winner most of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.510 
done a money in the bank winner most of
the<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.770> somebody<00:00:56.010> being<00:00:56.219> elevated

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the time it's somebody being elevated

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160 
the time it's somebody being elevated
from<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> mid<00:00:57.120> card<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> main<00:00:58.050> event

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
from the mid card up to the main event

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.450 
from the mid card up to the main event
so<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> don't<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.829> somebody<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> look<00:00:59.309> like

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so you don't want somebody to look like

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.849 
so you don't want somebody to look like
they're<00:00:59.609> losing<00:01:00.090> their<00:01:00.300> spot<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.859> so

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
they're losing their spot at all so

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.210 
they're losing their spot at all so
basically<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.470> way<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.040> going

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
basically the one way I have this going

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
basically the one way I have this going
down<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> has<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.850> happen<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> Survivor

just you know how they do it's a gun for
on<00:01:14.430> floor<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.850> it'd<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.060> better<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
on floor but it'd be better for a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.770 
on floor but it'd be better for a
five-on-five<00:01:15.840> match<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> basically<00:01:18.390> the

five-on-five match and basically the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
five-on-five match and basically the
team<00:01:18.990> raw<00:01:19.229> doesn't<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.890> anybody

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
team raw doesn't have to be anybody

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
team raw doesn't have to be anybody
except<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.030> has<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.390> basically<00:01:21.840> include

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
except for it has to basically include

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.320 
except for it has to basically include
Randy<00:01:22.710> Orton<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:23.759> means<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.119> wouldn't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
Randy Orton which means they wouldn't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.499 
Randy Orton which means they wouldn't
have<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:25.100> title<00:01:26.100> match<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> line<00:01:27.210> but

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
have a title match on the line but

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.890 
have a title match on the line but
that's<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> biggest<00:01:28.860> thing<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.119> they

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that's not the biggest thing that they

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 
that's not the biggest thing that they
come<00:01:31.049> down<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.350> would<00:01:31.470> probably<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:32.390> teamed

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
come down they would probably be teamed

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
come down they would probably be teamed
either<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.810> against<00:01:34.079> Nexus<00:01:34.470> hopefully<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
either to be against Nexus hopefully it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.560 
either to be against Nexus hopefully it
wouldn't<00:01:35.369> include<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.729> storyline<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> being

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
wouldn't include the storyline of being

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
wouldn't include the storyline of being
John<00:01:37.380> Cena<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
John Cena back because I think that's a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.210 
John Cena back because I think that's a
horrible<00:01:39.290> story<00:01:40.290> line<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.100> go

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
horrible story line that they would go

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
horrible story line that they would go
down<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.060> know<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> raw<00:01:42.360> guys<00:01:42.630> he'd

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
down that the you know the raw guys he'd

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.999 
down that the you know the raw guys he'd
be<00:01:42.899> trying<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> fight<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.439> could<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
be trying to fight you could see in a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.410 
be trying to fight you could see in a
release<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.369> his<00:01:44.490> contract<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.119> ain't<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
release from his contract that ain't the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.899 
release from his contract that ain't the
only<00:01:45.689> way<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.979> ending<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> good<00:01:47.729> way

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
only way I see this ending in a good way

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.539 
only way I see this ending in a good way
would<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.049> nexus<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> John<00:01:49.920> Cena<00:01:50.070> thing<00:01:50.399> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
would be a nexus and John Cena thing I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.740 
would be a nexus and John Cena thing I
think<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> Cena<00:01:51.149> needs<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
think that Cena needs to get to the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.310 
think that Cena needs to get to the
point<00:01:52.020> where<00:01:52.170> Cena<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.710> spacings<00:01:53.189> explodes

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
point where Cena to spacings explodes

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.350 
point where Cena to spacings explodes
sort<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> Incredible<00:01:56.009> Hulk<00:01:56.360> where

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
sort of like the Incredible Hulk where

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.130 
sort of like the Incredible Hulk where
he<00:01:57.630> actually<00:01:58.110> goes<00:01:58.380> off<00:01:58.619> against<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> Nexus

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
he actually goes off against the Nexus

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.750 
he actually goes off against the Nexus
he<00:02:00.200> also<00:02:00.350> goes<00:02:00.560> off<00:02:00.830> against<00:02:01.190> identity<00:02:01.340> guys

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
he also goes off against identity guys

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.210 
he also goes off against identity guys
which<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.390> know<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.540> be<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.110> YWCA<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.800> YouTube

the last pay-per-view when he hadn't

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.110 
the last pay-per-view when he hadn't
become<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.920> member<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.340> Nexus<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.850> lot<00:02:14.000> people

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
become a member of Nexus a lot people

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.750 
become a member of Nexus a lot people
wanted<00:02:14.480> him<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.660> become<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.410> heel<00:02:16.130> overnight

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
wanted him to become a heel overnight

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.510 
wanted him to become a heel overnight
and<00:02:17.750> just<00:02:18.230> show<00:02:18.590> up<00:02:18.709> on<00:02:18.830> Raw<00:02:19.040> but<00:02:19.280> basically

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
and just show up on Raw but basically

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.460 
and just show up on Raw but basically
he's<00:02:19.700> been<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.480> face<00:02:20.690> Cena<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.290> he<00:02:21.350> has

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
he's been the the face Cena and he has

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.980 
he's been the the face Cena and he has
to<00:02:21.620> do<00:02:21.740> what<00:02:21.860> he<00:02:21.890> has<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.130> do<00:02:22.370> but<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.610> think<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
to do what he has to do but I think the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.300 
to do what he has to do but I think the
were<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.110> general<00:02:24.410> manager<00:02:24.770> storyline

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
were the general manager storyline

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.250 
were the general manager storyline
saying<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.820> he<00:02:25.910> has<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.239> do<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.630> Nexus<00:02:27.050> says

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
saying that he has to do it Nexus says

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.770 
saying that he has to do it Nexus says
that<00:02:27.650> they<00:02:27.800> have<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.489> think<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:29.510> that's

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
that they have to do I think that that's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.380 
that they have to do I think that that's
sort<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.590> slowly<00:02:30.860> gonna<00:02:31.160> rot<00:02:31.550> John<00:02:32.060> Cena's

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
sort of slowly gonna rot John Cena's

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.240 
sort of slowly gonna rot John Cena's

like it was that much at all and

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.830 
like it was that much at all and
basically<00:03:22.340> he<00:03:22.700> would<00:03:22.820> just<00:03:23.000> be<00:03:23.150> out<00:03:23.329> inside

and<00:03:29.680> basically<00:03:30.680> Randy<00:03:31.280> Orton<00:03:31.519> would<00:03:31.640> go

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
and basically Randy Orton would go

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.050 
and basically Randy Orton would go
through<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.030> five<00:03:32.209> guys<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.950> look<00:03:34.549> like<00:03:34.670> stud
