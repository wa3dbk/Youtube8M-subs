machine that's East sixty one group had

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.840 
machine that's East sixty one group had
very<00:00:16.650> famous<00:00:17.100> developed<00:00:17.400> by<00:00:17.460> FEMA<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.730> when<00:00:20.730> do

very famous developed by FEMA so when do
you<00:00:20.939> need<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.750> change<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> group<00:00:22.230> gasket<00:00:22.740> well

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920

one<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> most<00:00:23.880> obvious<00:00:24.029> things<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
one of the most obvious things is if it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.019 
one of the most obvious things is if it
starts<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> leak<00:00:25.560> around<00:00:26.400> portafilter

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
starts to leak around portafilter

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.960 
starts to leak around portafilter
handbook<00:00:27.480> then<00:00:28.490> you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.789> time<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
handbook then you know it's time to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
handbook then you know it's time to
change<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.330> gasket<00:00:30.840> or<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.920> can

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
change the gasket or you can

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.250 
change the gasket or you can
preemptively<00:00:33.620> pull<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:36.260> have

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
preemptively pull it up like this I have

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.110 
preemptively pull it up like this I have
my<00:00:37.440> jacket<00:00:37.739> rolled<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.250> underneath<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.850> but

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
my jacket rolled up underneath this but

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.840 
my jacket rolled up underneath this but
use<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.989> towel<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.950> pillow<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.399> something

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
use a towel or a pillow or something

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.209 
use a towel or a pillow or something
like<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.600> want<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> use<00:00:43.219> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
like that because you want to use you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.709 
like that because you want to use you
want<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.239> easier<00:00:45.450> if

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
want to do this can be a lot easier if

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.760 
want to do this can be a lot easier if
you<00:00:45.809> had<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> machine<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.800> angle<00:00:48.680> you<00:00:49.680> will

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you had the machine at an angle you will

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.630 
you had the machine at an angle you will
notice<00:00:51.410> unlike<00:00:52.410> most<00:00:53.010> other<00:00:53.280> espresso

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
notice unlike most other espresso

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
notice unlike most other espresso
machines<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> screw<00:00:54.750> holding<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
machines that have a screw holding it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.849 
machines that have a screw holding it
into<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> group<00:00:56.340> head<00:00:56.550> or<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> fuser<00:00:57.859> East

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
into the group head or the fuser East

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.540 
into the group head or the fuser East
sixty<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.340> group<00:00:59.640> head<00:00:59.930> actually<00:01:00.930> uses<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
sixty one group head actually uses a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.090 
sixty one group head actually uses a
compression<00:01:02.550> fit<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.420> gasket<00:01:03.949> to<00:01:04.949> hold

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
compression fit on the gasket to hold

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.850 
compression fit on the gasket to hold
the<00:01:05.220> strain<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> take<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the strain it so you have to take the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.330 
the strain it so you have to take the
screen<00:01:08.100> off<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.610> well<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.890> rather<00:01:10.890> than<00:01:11.130> try<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
screen off as well so rather than try to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.600 
screen off as well so rather than try to
pry<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> gasket<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.479> oh<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:13.049> more<00:01:13.229> thing

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
pry the gasket out oh one more thing

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.920 
pry the gasket out oh one more thing
when<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.000> gas<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.360> use<00:01:15.450> changing

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
when you know the gas can use changing

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.830 
when you know the gas can use changing
if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> touch<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.740> finger<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.549> a

flatted screwdriver or something and if

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.960 
flatted screwdriver or something and if
it's<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.100> pliable

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it's not pliable

it's not pliable
if<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.210> can't<00:01:21.450> push<00:01:22.320> into<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> little

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
if you can't push into it with a little

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.499 
if you can't push into it with a little
bit<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.220> cushion<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.820> very<00:01:24.030> hard<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
bit of cushion if it's very hard and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
bit of cushion if it's very hard and
vulcanized<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.710> definitely<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.340> time

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
vulcanized you definitely know it's time

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.679 
vulcanized you definitely know it's time
to<00:01:26.820> replace<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
to replace it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.660 
to replace it
the<00:01:28.080> sooner<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> replace<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> better<00:01:29.250> if

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the sooner you replace it the better if

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.830 
the sooner you replace it the better if
you<00:01:29.759> leave<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.210> too<00:01:30.360> long<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> gonna

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you leave it in for too long it's gonna

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
you leave it in for too long it's gonna
get<00:01:30.960> very<00:01:31.229> very<00:01:31.470> hard<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.520> more<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
get very very hard and just be more and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.910 
get very very hard and just be more and
more<00:01:32.909> difficult<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.680> can

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
more difficult to get out and can

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.230 
more difficult to get out and can
actually<00:01:35.220> cause<00:01:35.400> some<00:01:35.430> corrosion<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
actually cause some corrosion in the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.410 
actually cause some corrosion in the
brass<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.400> need<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:39.210> this

brass so what you need for this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.469 
brass so what you need for this
particular<00:01:40.380> operation<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> wide

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
particular operation you want a wide

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.810 
particular operation you want a wide
flat<00:01:42.899> head<00:01:43.140> screwdriver<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.340> reason<00:01:44.640> being

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
flat head screwdriver the reason being

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.190 
flat head screwdriver the reason being
is<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.180> long<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.020> these

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is as long as you have one of these

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.569 
is as long as you have one of these
screens<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> old-style

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
screens if you have one of the old-style

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
screens if you have one of the old-style
ones<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.299> has<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.840> metal<00:01:49.439> circular

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
ones that has the little metal circular

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.380 
ones that has the little metal circular
thing<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.700> basically<00:01:51.149> have

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
thing in there then you basically have

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.539 
thing in there then you basically have
to<00:01:51.540> destroy<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> screen<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.530> order<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.369> take<00:01:53.490> a
