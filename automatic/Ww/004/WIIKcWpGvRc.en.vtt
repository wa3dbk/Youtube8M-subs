00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.850 

I<00:03:35.049> think<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.319> takes<00:03:36.920> effect<00:03:38.230> pretty<00:03:39.230> much<00:03:39.530> on

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
I think it takes effect pretty much on

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.110 
I think it takes effect pretty much on
the<00:03:40.780> home<00:03:41.780> screen<00:03:42.140> mostly<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:43.900> we<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.140> a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the home screen mostly and we have a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.880 
the home screen mostly and we have a
dialer<00:03:47.120> somewhere<00:03:47.569> around<00:03:47.659> here<00:03:50.739> see<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.829> is

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
dialer somewhere around here see this is

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.410 
dialer somewhere around here see this is
a<00:03:52.069> problem<00:03:52.430> when<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:52.670> don't<00:03:52.819> have<00:03:53.030> an<00:03:53.239> app

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
a problem when you don't have an app

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.569 
a problem when you don't have an app
drawer<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:54.140> be<00:03:54.349> quite<00:03:54.650> difficult<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.400> keep

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
drawer it can be quite difficult to keep

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.910 
drawer it can be quite difficult to keep
track<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:56.200> where<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.319> keep<00:03:57.620> things<00:03:59.560> but<00:04:00.560> is

track of where you keep things but is

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.380 
track of where you keep things but is
somewhere<00:04:01.549> around<00:04:01.670> here<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:03.640> just<00:04:04.640> can't<00:04:05.030> seem

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390

somewhere around here I just can't seem
to<00:04:05.420> see<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.310> there<00:04:07.310> we<00:04:07.459> go

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
to see it there we go

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.759
