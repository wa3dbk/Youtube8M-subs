00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.060 
probably find a lot ebay that's where I
found<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> different<00:01:28.590> finish<00:01:28.770> than

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
found it this is a different finish than

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.179 
found it this is a different finish than
my<00:01:29.220> regular<00:01:29.430> blush<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> satin

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
my regular blush this is this is a satin

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
my regular blush this is this is a satin
finish<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.520> my<00:01:32.759> regular<00:01:33.180> blushes<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> matte

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
finish and my regular blushes a matte

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.880 
finish and my regular blushes a matte
finish<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:36.030> takes<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.930> more<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
finish so it takes a little bit more to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.520 
finish so it takes a little bit more to
put<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> color<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.439> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
put on to get on there with a color so I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.480 
put on to get on there with a color so I
just<00:01:40.680> tap<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.159> little<00:01:41.369> bit<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
I do is I'm going to make my liner line

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.080 
I do is I'm going to make my liner line
much<00:02:53.940> thicker<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:55.739> do<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.700> mac

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
much thicker to do this is a mac

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:07.880 
much thicker to do this is a mac
fluidline

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.949 

and<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.730> me<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.210> really<00:03:09.569> like<00:03:10.020> winging<00:03:10.710> out

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
and for me I really like winging out

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.370 
and for me I really like winging out
that<00:03:12.959> liner<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.709> little<00:03:14.490> bit<00:03:14.670> more<00:03:14.940> for<00:03:15.380> night

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
that liner a little bit more for night

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.000 
that liner a little bit more for night
time<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.620> again<00:03:19.890> make<00:03:20.280> them<00:03:20.430> as<00:03:20.640> even<00:03:21.150> again

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
time and again make them as even again

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.860 
time and again make them as even again
so<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.130> next<00:03:23.280> step<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.640> usually<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.540> come<00:03:24.840> on

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
so the next step I usually do is come on

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.130 
so the next step I usually do is come on
my<00:03:25.170> lashes<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.910> night<00:03:27.090> time<00:03:27.330> i<00:03:27.660> use<00:03:27.930> my
