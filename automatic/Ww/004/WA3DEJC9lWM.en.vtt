00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
no it's hard to believe I've never been

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.700 
no it's hard to believe I've never been
a<00:01:52.560> girly<00:01:53.009> type<00:01:53.280> person<00:01:53.759> I've<00:01:54.689> never<00:01:54.960> had<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.500> lot

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
a girly type person I've never had a lot

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.389 
a girly type person I've never had a lot
of<00:01:55.970> friends<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.600> girls<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
of friends that are girls I was in a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.960 
of friends that are girls I was in a
male-dominated<00:02:00.560> career<00:02:01.700> friendships<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
male-dominated career friendships that I

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.289 
male-dominated career friendships that I
have<00:02:03.060> made<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:04.350> been<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.880> deepest

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
have made here have been the deepest

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.940 
have made here have been the deepest
friends<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.259> I've<00:02:07.429> had<00:02:08.429> yet<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.269> life<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
friends that I've had yet in my life and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.580 
friends that I've had yet in my life and
I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.450> reason<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.170> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
I think that the reason for that is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.120 
I think that the reason for that is
because<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:15.090> all<00:02:15.560> confident<00:02:16.560> we're

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
because we are all confident we're

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.199 
because we are all confident we're
confident<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> inside<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:20.209> we're

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
confident on the inside and we're

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.050 
confident on the inside and we're
confident<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.080> outside<00:02:22.620> none<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.760> us<00:02:23.790> are

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
confident on the outside none of us are

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.759 
confident on the outside none of us are
competing<00:02:24.569> against<00:02:24.959> each<00:02:25.049> other<00:02:25.290> because

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
competing against each other because

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.459 
competing against each other because
we're<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.430> same
