is cheaper and better and more

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.680 
is cheaper and better and more
megapixels<00:01:40.679> because<00:01:41.369> both<00:01:42.090> cameras<00:01:42.479> take

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
megapixels because both cameras take

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.440 
megapixels because both cameras take
incredible<00:01:43.080> photos<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:45.119> about<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
incredible photos it's more about the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.749 
incredible photos it's more about the
photographer<00:01:45.929> than<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> actual<00:01:46.530> camera<00:01:47.099> so

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
photographer than the actual camera so

camera this is the 24 to 10 5 l lens by
canon<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.599> is<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> lens<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.229> comes<00:02:04.440> with

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the 5d mark two and three as a kit lens

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
the 5d mark two and three as a kit lens
however<00:02:07.679> I<00:02:07.770> didn't<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.399> lens<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
however I didn't get this lens with the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.580 
however I didn't get this lens with the
camera<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.450> did<00:02:09.630> buy<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.840> separately<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
camera I did buy it separately about a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.800 
camera I did buy it separately about a
year<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.160> year<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.550> half<00:02:11.580> ago<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.239> it's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
year to a year and a half ago and it's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.700 
year to a year and a half ago and it's
been<00:02:12.900> an<00:02:13.110> incredible

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
been an incredible

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.650 
been an incredible
and<00:02:13.830> now<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.760> could<00:02:14.820> go<00:02:15.090> back<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.420> probably

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and now if I could go back I probably

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.470 
and now if I could go back I probably
would<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> 24<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> 70<00:02:17.370> instead<00:02:17.940> just

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
would get the 24 to 70 instead just

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
would get the 24 to 70 instead just
because<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.870> larger<00:02:19.260> aperture<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.770> f<00:02:19.980> 2.8

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
because of the larger aperture of f 2.8

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.150 
because of the larger aperture of f 2.8
compared<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.300> which<00:02:21.540> has<00:02:21.750> f4<00:02:22.440> I'd

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
compared to this which has f4 I'd

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.920 
compared to this which has f4 I'd
probably<00:02:23.490> find<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.880> more<00:02:24.030> useful<00:02:24.210> now<00:02:24.600> since

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
probably find it more useful now since

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.140 
probably find it more useful now since
i'm<00:02:25.110> more<00:02:25.290> into<00:02:25.530> photography<00:02:25.910> however<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
i'm more into photography however at the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.760 
i'm more into photography however at the
time<00:02:27.180> was<00:02:27.540> more<00:02:27.720> into<00:02:27.870> video<00:02:28.140> work<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.530> i<00:02:28.590> did

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
time was more into video work so i did

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.890 
time was more into video work so i did
go<00:02:28.980> for<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.280> image<00:02:29.580> stabilization<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
go for the image stabilization and the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.650 
go for the image stabilization and the
more<00:02:31.110> versatile<00:02:31.560> focal<00:02:32.040> range<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:33.330> i<00:02:33.390> still

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
more versatile focal range but i still

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.970 
more versatile focal range but i still
love<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.050> lens<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.530> still<00:02:34.800> probably

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
love this lens it's still probably

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.780 
love this lens it's still probably
mimosas<00:02:35.910> lens<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.570> i<00:02:36.990> think<00:02:37.260> i<00:02:37.320> paid<00:02:37.500> about

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
mimosas lens and i think i paid about

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.550 
mimosas lens and i think i paid about
1200<00:02:38.790> dollars<00:02:39.030> for<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.300> online<00:02:39.480> ok<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.380> now

complaints about this lens now moving on

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.050 
complaints about this lens now moving on
to<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.230> last<00:04:04.410> bit<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.680> equipment<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.340> use<00:04:05.400> and

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
to the last bit of equipment I use and

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.020 
to the last bit of equipment I use and
that<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.630> an<00:04:06.900> extension<00:04:07.290> tube<00:04:07.770> now<00:04:08.490> this<00:04:08.730> does

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
that is an extension tube now this does

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.140 
that is an extension tube now this does
is<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.540> put<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.870> between<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.770> lens<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.850> your

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
is you put it between the lens and your

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.940 
is you put it between the lens and your
camera<00:04:12.510> body<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.960> just<00:04:13.170> screws<00:04:13.470> into<00:04:13.680> place

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
camera body it just screws into place

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.980 
camera body it just screws into place
and<00:04:14.250> what<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.000> does<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.300> it<00:04:15.330> pretty<00:04:15.570> much<00:04:15.750> puts

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
and what it does is it pretty much puts

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.660 
and what it does is it pretty much puts
the<00:04:16.109> lens<00:04:16.290> further<00:04:16.620> away<00:04:16.739> from<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.220> sensor

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
the lens further away from the sensor

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.160 
the lens further away from the sensor
and<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.150> pretty<00:04:18.300> much<00:04:18.390> allows<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.960> to

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
and it pretty much allows you to

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.470 
and it pretty much allows you to
minimize<00:04:20.100> your<00:04:20.250> focusing<00:04:20.730> distance<00:04:21.210> to<00:04:21.360> get

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
minimize your focusing distance to get

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.110 
minimize your focusing distance to get
really<00:04:21.780> close<00:04:22.140> up<00:04:22.380> macro<00:04:22.620> shot<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.940> might

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
really close up macro shot and I might

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.850 
really close up macro shot and I might
put<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.330> few<00:04:24.570> examples<00:04:25.020> up<00:04:25.140> on<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.350> screen<00:04:25.590> now

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
put a few examples up on the screen now

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.680 
put a few examples up on the screen now
just<00:04:26.190> some<00:04:26.400> shots<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.850> like<00:04:27.000> water<00:04:27.270> droplets

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690
