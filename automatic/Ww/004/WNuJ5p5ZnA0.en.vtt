00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
example of another archetype we movement

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.640 
example of another archetype we movement
is<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:37.940> big<00:04:38.270> part<00:04:38.630> of<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.840> equation<00:04:39.170> when<00:04:39.560> we

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
is a big part of the equation when we

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.410 
is a big part of the equation when we
make<00:04:39.800> our<00:04:39.950> characters<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.490> Cal<00:04:40.790> Darius<00:04:41.180> is<00:04:41.270> our

shock trooper right and he has a lot of

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.060 
shock trooper right and he has a lot of
mobility<00:04:47.450> has<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.870> really<00:04:48.110> long<00:04:48.290> dash<00:04:48.650> he<00:04:48.980> has

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
mobility has a really long dash he has

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.680 
mobility has a really long dash he has
ability<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.640> double<00:04:50.030> jump<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.480> it's<00:04:50.570> actually

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
ability to double jump and it's actually

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.270 
ability to double jump and it's actually
a<00:04:50.870> directional<00:04:51.440> double<00:04:51.680> jump<00:04:51.890> just<00:04:52.160> like<00:04:52.250> a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
a directional double jump just like a

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.910 
a directional double jump just like a
Gundam<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:53.300> jump<00:04:53.690> up<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.020> then<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:54.200> can<00:04:54.350> you

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
Gundam you jump up and then you can you

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.560 
Gundam you jump up and then you can you
thrust<00:04:55.340> backwards<00:04:55.790> or<00:04:55.940> forwards<00:04:56.270> or<00:04:56.360> right<00:04:56.540> or

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
thrust backwards or forwards or right or

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.690 
thrust backwards or forwards or right or
left<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.110> it's<00:04:57.290> really<00:04:57.770> hard<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.130> pick<00:04:58.340> out<00:04:58.520> in

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
left so it's really hard to pick out in

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.820 
left so it's really hard to pick out in
the<00:04:58.790> firefight<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.510> then<00:05:00.020> his<00:05:00.230> big<00:05:00.470> altima

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
the firefight and then his big altima

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.830 
the firefight and then his big altima
tobillo<00:05:01.100> jetpack<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:02.030> sends<00:05:02.240> I'm<00:05:02.300> way<00:05:02.660> up

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
tobillo jetpack that sends I'm way up

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.780 
tobillo jetpack that sends I'm way up
into<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> air<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.500> then<00:05:03.620> crashing<00:05:04.250> down<00:05:04.430> for

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
into the air and then crashing down for

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.700 
into the air and then crashing down for
big<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.030> back<00:05:05.180> on<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.390> battlefield<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.200> you

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
big and back on the battlefield so you

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.410 
big and back on the battlefield so you
really<00:05:06.980> mix<00:05:07.190> all<00:05:07.430> of<00:05:07.460> those<00:05:07.670> ideas<00:05:07.940> together

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
really mix all of those ideas together

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.300 
really mix all of those ideas together
and<00:05:08.840> find<00:05:09.050> different<00:05:09.350> flavors<00:05:09.710> off<00:05:09.860> on<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.100> man

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
and find different flavors off on a man

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.680 
and find different flavors off on a man
where<00:05:10.550> we're<00:05:10.970> just<00:05:11.120> going<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.480> going<00:05:11.570> and

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
where we're just going and going and

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.330 
where we're just going and going and
going<00:05:11.780> with<00:05:12.020> new<00:05:12.170> ways<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.590> mix<00:05:13.100> up<00:05:13.250> these

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
going with new ways to mix up these

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.820 
going with new ways to mix up these
characters
