inch white it's bent across this way
four<00:01:04.030> inches<00:01:04.950> so<00:01:05.950> it's<00:01:06.130> 16<00:01:06.610> inches<00:01:07.030> overall<00:01:07.680> 4

inches<00:01:08.980> wide<00:01:09.190> here<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.880> then<00:01:10.720> it<00:01:10.930> will<00:01:11.140> make<00:01:11.320> a

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
inches wide here and then it will make a

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.350 
inches wide here and then it will make a
kind<00:01:12.940> of<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.150> triangular<00:01:13.900> shape<00:01:14.170> like<00:01:14.440> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
enough in here for the banding to go in

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.310 
enough in here for the banding to go in
alright<00:01:35.799> this<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:37.000> depth<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.570> slot<00:01:37.899> here

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
keep the wood from splitting out right

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.410 
keep the wood from splitting out right
here<00:01:59.289> where<00:01:59.469> your<00:01:59.649> screw<00:02:00.039> holes<00:02:00.280> are<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.299> this

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
here where your screw holes are so this

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.800 
here where your screw holes are so this
is<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.750> an<00:02:01.960> electrical<00:02:03.119> cut<00:02:04.119> EMT<00:02:04.630> electrical

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
is just an electrical cut EMT electrical

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.840 
is just an electrical cut EMT electrical
coupling<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:07.420> just<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.810> 3/4<00:02:08.380> inch<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.670> it

coupling and it's just a 3/4 inch and it
just<00:02:10.090> slides<00:02:10.300> over<00:02:10.539> here<00:02:10.899> but<00:02:11.050> whatever<00:02:11.230> size

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
just slides over here but whatever size

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.520 
just slides over here but whatever size
your<00:02:12.420> stuff<00:02:13.420> there<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.140> could<00:02:14.290> use

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
your stuff there is you could use

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.040 
your stuff there is you could use
radiator<00:02:15.370> clamp<00:02:15.700> or<00:02:15.910> something<00:02:16.210> but<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.870> got

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
radiator clamp or something but you got

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.660 
radiator clamp or something but you got
to<00:02:17.170> keep<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.530> wood<00:02:17.800> from<00:02:18.040> splitting<00:02:18.100> out

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
to keep that wood from splitting out

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.000 
to keep that wood from splitting out
right<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.090> that's<00:02:19.900> really<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.410> that's<00:02:20.560> for

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
see I've got holes drilled in the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.120 
see I've got holes drilled in the
banding<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.180> what<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.080> did<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.380> just<00:02:35.710> shoved<00:02:35.980> it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
banding here what I did I just shoved it

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.729 
banding here what I did I just shoved it
all<00:02:36.280> down<00:02:36.580> inside<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.090> here<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.690> kind<00:02:38.680> of

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
all down inside of here and kind of

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.350 
all down inside of here and kind of
clamped<00:02:39.129> it<00:02:39.250> down<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:39.790> drilled<00:02:40.239> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
clamped it down and I just drilled the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.270 
clamped it down and I just drilled the
holes<00:02:40.540> through<00:02:40.900> everything<00:02:41.140> so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
holes through everything so

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.360 
holes through everything so
I<00:02:42.310> knew<00:02:42.790> everything<00:02:43.060> would<00:02:43.360> match<00:02:43.540> up<00:02:43.870> well

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
I knew everything would match up well

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.590 
I knew everything would match up well
but<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:46.810> shove<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.110> down<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
but you just shove that down in the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.420 
but you just shove that down in the
handle<00:02:49.600> here<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:52.650> what<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.830> want<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:54.130> do<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
handle here and what you want to do is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.280 
handle here and what you want to do is
line<00:02:54.700> up<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.240> hole<00:02:55.540> right<00:02:56.530> here<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.260> just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
line up this hole right here and I just

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.630 
line up this hole right here and I just
took<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.740> piece<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.460> this<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.820> three<00:03:01.440> 3/16

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
took a piece of this this is three 3/16

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.210 
took a piece of this this is three 3/16
bolt<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.600> cut<00:03:04.840> off<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.050> chunk<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.010> so

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
bolt I just cut off a chunk of it so

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.060 
bolt I just cut off a chunk of it so
just<00:03:06.490> just<00:03:07.360> long<00:03:07.630> enough<00:03:07.960> so<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.860> same

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
just just long enough so it's the same

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.810 
just just long enough so it's the same
thicknesses<00:03:09.850> as<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.630> as<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:12.010> broom<00:03:12.430> handle

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
thicknesses as the as the broom handle

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.360 
thicknesses as the as the broom handle
and<00:03:13.030> then<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.960> just<00:03:14.200> line<00:03:14.440> up<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.800> hole<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.010> here

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
and then I just line up the hole in here

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.000 
and then I just line up the hole in here
shove<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.150> there<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.600> then<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.800> will

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
shove that in there and then that will

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.540 
shove that in there and then that will
be<00:03:18.510> contained<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.650> can't<00:03:20.920> go<00:03:21.100> anywhere

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
be contained so that can't go anywhere

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.210 
be contained so that can't go anywhere
when<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.420> shove<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:22.870> coupling<00:03:23.620> on<00:03:23.740> top<00:03:24.040> of

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
when I shove this coupling on top of

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.830 
when I shove this coupling on top of
there<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.960> then<00:03:25.960> this<00:03:26.770> hole<00:03:27.040> right<00:03:27.070> here<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
there and then this hole right here the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.520 
there and then this hole right here the
screw<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.350> comes<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:31.080> got<00:03:32.080> just<00:03:32.410> a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
screw that comes with this I got just a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.890 
screw that comes with this I got just a
little<00:03:32.740> bit<00:03:32.860> longer<00:03:33.130> one<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.670> goes<00:03:33.900> down

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
little bit longer one and it goes down

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.230 
little bit longer one and it goes down
into<00:03:35.320> there<00:03:35.500> good<00:03:35.770> ways<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.940> holds

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
into there good ways that holds

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.490 
into there good ways that holds
everything<00:03:37.360> together<00:03:37.660> that's<00:03:38.110> all<00:03:38.320> there<00:03:38.470> is

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
everything together that's all there is

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.150 
everything together that's all there is
to<00:03:38.740> it

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
to it

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.230 
to it
bend<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.090> out<00:03:40.240> like<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:41.820> slide<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:42.970> up<00:03:43.090> on

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
bend it out like that slide it up on

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:52.170 
bend it out like that slide it up on
there<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> little<00:03:43.690> bit<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.700> then<00:03:51.030> shove<00:03:52.030> our

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
there a little bit and then shove our

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.440 
there a little bit and then shove our
handle<00:03:52.570> in<00:03:52.720> there<00:03:53.730> shove<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.820> in<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.060> handle

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
handle in there shove it in the handle

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.449 
handle in there shove it in the handle
and<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:56.350> kind<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.650> wiggle<00:03:56.800> that<00:03:57.010> around<00:03:57.070> a

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
and just kind of wiggle that around a

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.420 
and just kind of wiggle that around a
little<00:03:57.810> there<00:03:58.810> we<00:03:58.959> are

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
little there we are

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.720 
little there we are
now<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.489> just<00:04:00.580> slide<00:04:01.800> this<00:04:02.800> thing<00:04:03.130> down<00:04:03.310> onto

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
now you just slide this thing down onto

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:19.909 
now you just slide this thing down onto
here<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:08.020> I'm<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.320> do<00:04:08.470> now<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:10.000> take<00:04:10.239> my

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.980 

so<00:04:20.919> there<00:04:21.160> we<00:04:21.310> are

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 
so there we are

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.450 
so there we are
that<00:04:22.990> thing<00:04:23.260> there<00:04:23.470> is<00:04:23.560> fastened<00:04:24.130> down<00:04:24.280> it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
that thing there is fastened down it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.230 
that thing there is fastened down it
can't<00:04:24.669> go<00:04:24.850> anywhere<00:04:25.030> now<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.020> just<00:04:26.140> kind<00:04:26.530> of

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
can't go anywhere now I just kind of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.100 
can't go anywhere now I just kind of
taken

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.190 

and<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.560> shape<00:04:35.800> isn't<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:36.310> critical<00:04:36.820> just

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
and the shape isn't that critical just

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.810 
and the shape isn't that critical just
something<00:04:38.200> like<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.590> right<00:04:38.800> there<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:42.490> there

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
something like that right there so there

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.640 
something like that right there so there
we<00:04:42.970> have<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:45.360> magic<00:04:46.360> easy<00:04:46.900> garden<00:04:47.470> hoe

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
we have it the magic easy garden hoe

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
we have it the magic easy garden hoe
