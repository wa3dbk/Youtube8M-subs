equally one of the things that shocked
us<00:01:10.960> more<00:01:11.260> I<00:01:11.290> think<00:01:11.620> was<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.040> positivity<00:01:12.430> they

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
us more I think was the positivity they

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.090 
us more I think was the positivity they
had<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:14.050> energy<00:01:14.380> ever<00:01:14.500> had<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
had and the energy ever had and the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:27.290 
had and the energy ever had and the
attitude<00:01:15.460> they<00:01:15.550> were<00:01:15.640> taking<00:01:15.940> towards<00:01:16.240> it

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.460 

yeah<00:01:28.300> I<00:01:28.450> think<00:01:28.509> it's<00:01:28.840> rare<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.290> get<00:01:29.410> to
