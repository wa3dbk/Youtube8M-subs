00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello everyone with you and want a few 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.650
 words to say that I already 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.179
 agreed about 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.449
 Wednesday for the fall of his orchids here recently 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.930
 went to the lab and agreed 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 so as not to cook next you spill it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.340
 immediately special such cones on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.750
 spin the same way in the lab doing 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.870
 special ones they themselves sterilize 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.200
 such some make of parchment 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.829
 papers and they give me these cones right away 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.309
 these packages 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.309
 pack so the floor work let's say 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.860
 it will be already made in principle possible 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.530
 self cook this medium 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.800
 difficult, in principle, nothing in it but 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.309
 the thing is, look for these all 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 components as far as I asked for 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.180
 these ones 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.979
 grams no one wants to sell it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.369
 first secondly in order to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.710
 cook at home yourself well, as 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.520
 minimum we need special scales because 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.549
 what is there for example agar-agar or not 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.140
 no agar agar I don't remember exactly which 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.000
 component which you need 00 4 grams y 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.119
 I have no such scales for example 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 at home measured 004 grams so honestly 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 telling me is much easier to agree 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.689
 that I will be prepared this Wednesday I only 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.260
 I will come and take it 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:51.950
 ready here and we will be further 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.540
 and sow independently at home because as in 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.430
 laboratory conditions 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.480
 Well, first of all it is very long 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.270
 process 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.220
 and as explained to me it will cost 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.280
 very very expensive because it 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.530
 have to shoot the lab brothers and 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.000
 how to rent here to pay for work 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 the person who will follow this 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.960
 everyone therefore it is really very 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.780
 expensive at home and think 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.610
 make it much easier if you 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.560
 have free time and desire and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:32.710
 opportunity then it can all be done 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:36.320
 at home in further videos I will 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:41.030
 little by little to tell us what's for 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.450
 this is necessary so far so far not 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.959
 running in we will do everything gradually 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.740
 step by step as far as to you 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.510
 I do accordingly I am with you with this 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.690
 I will share everything so not 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.989
 worry those who want from whom and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.450
 they will succeed because 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.170
 many people write that this is unreal 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.970
 This then this this but if already man 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.780
 sure that this is unreal well mean yes 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.420
 and honestly you shouldn't even try 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.989
 who wants who is as crazy as 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.000
 well then you will try everything together 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.459
 so far our seed box is still 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.440
 only matures 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.500
 that's why I gradually have a little 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.680
 little by little I prepare everything I need 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.680
 that's what 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:41.490
 I will keep you in the know who needs 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.040
 Wednesday if you do not have the opportunity and 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.850
 cook in principle it will be possible 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.750
 try to share at least with 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.260
