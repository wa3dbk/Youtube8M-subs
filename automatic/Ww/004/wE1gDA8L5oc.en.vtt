think it wouldn't have been good I ended

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.300 
think it wouldn't have been good I ended
up<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.130> down<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:42.170> almost<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.890> hard<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
up going down I almost it's hard to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.260 
up going down I almost it's hard to
think<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.970> guess<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> many<00:01:47.939> people

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
think about it guess I so many people

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.260 
think about it guess I so many people
who<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:48.810> through<00:01:48.840> prison<00:01:49.759> they<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.970> go<00:01:51.090> down

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
who go through prison they just go down

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.660 
who go through prison they just go down
that<00:01:51.299> route<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.110> mean<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.310> person

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that route I mean I think of one person

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
that route I mean I think of one person
in<00:01:53.729> particular<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.240> met<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.840> who<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.200> more

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
in particular I met there who was more

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
in particular I met there who was more
or<00:01:55.710> less<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.860> me<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.700> granted<00:01:57.060> him<00:01:57.119> five

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
or less like me and I granted him five

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.389 
or less like me and I granted him five
years<00:01:57.479> later<00:01:57.930> he<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> hardcore<00:01:58.680> criminal

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
years later he was a hardcore criminal

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.749 
years later he was a hardcore criminal
so<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.020> could<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.290> happened<00:02:01.759> Tim

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
so I think that could have happened Tim

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.090 
so I think that could have happened Tim
says<00:02:03.000> their<00:02:03.259> responsibility<00:02:04.259> he<00:02:04.590> learned<00:02:04.890> by

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
says their responsibility he learned by

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
says their responsibility he learned by
caring<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.670> animals<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.450> his<00:02:06.659> life<00:02:06.869> asserted

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
caring for animals all his life asserted

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.360 
caring for animals all his life asserted
itself<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.220> kept<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.789> from<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.090> similar<00:02:09.360> fate

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
itself and kept him from a similar fate

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.190 
itself and kept him from a similar fate
meanwhile<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.580> Peregrine<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.330> also<00:02:12.750> facing

meanwhile the Peregrine was also facing

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.670 
meanwhile the Peregrine was also facing
an<00:02:13.290> uncertain

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
an uncertain

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.520 
an uncertain
future<00:02:14.069> by<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.849> 1960s<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.989> species

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
