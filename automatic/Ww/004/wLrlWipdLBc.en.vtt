00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.379 

we<00:00:01.170> have<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.370> number<00:00:02.370> screen<00:00:02.790> at<00:00:03.120> around

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
we have a number screen at around

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.720 
we have a number screen at around
nesting<00:00:03.750> number<00:00:03.990> system<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.430> one<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.609> the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
nesting number system this is one of the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.610 
nesting number system this is one of the
prototype<00:00:06.150> screens<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.629> actually<00:00:07.020> got

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
prototype screens that actually got

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.339 
prototype screens that actually got
underexposed<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.090> got<00:00:09.210> locked<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.900> and

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
underexposed and so it got locked in and

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.160 
underexposed and so it got locked in and
this<00:00:11.040> will<00:00:11.219> happen<00:00:11.429> often<00:00:11.880> when<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.840> under

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this will happen often when you under

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
this will happen often when you under
expose<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> screen<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> then<00:00:14.250> put<00:00:14.460> chemical

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
expose the screen and then put chemical

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.490 
expose the screen and then put chemical
on<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.299> or<00:00:15.450> throw<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.719> into<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> tank

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
on it or throw it into the tank

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
on it or throw it into the tank
pretty<00:00:17.070> much<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.430> locked<00:00:17.789> right<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.240> so

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
pretty much this is locked right now so

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.460 
pretty much this is locked right now so
that's<00:00:18.570> not<00:00:18.690> coming<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.289> what<00:00:19.380> we're

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
that's not coming out so what we're

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.590 
that's not coming out so what we're
going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.619> try<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.279> Don's<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
going to try to do is Don's going to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.259 
going to try to do is Don's going to
throw<00:00:21.750> some<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.109> emulsion<00:00:23.269> remover

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
throw some of that emulsion remover

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.380 
throw some of that emulsion remover
paste<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.760> we'll<00:00:26.939> let<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.090> soak<00:00:27.330> for

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
paste on that and we'll let it soak for

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.730 
paste on that and we'll let it soak for
five<00:00:27.689> minutes<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.080> we'll<00:00:28.199> see<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.590> can

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
five minutes and we'll see if that can

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.220 
five minutes and we'll see if that can
blast<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.390> you're<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.720> squirting<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
blast it out so you're just squirting it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.340 
blast it out so you're just squirting it
on<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> then<00:00:32.660> rubbing<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.989> getting

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
on there and then rubbing it in getting

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
on there and then rubbing it in getting
it<00:00:35.390> dissolved<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.630> both<00:00:36.809> sides<00:00:38.750> let<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it dissolved in on both sides let it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:54.910 
it dissolved in on both sides let it
soak<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.469> real<00:00:40.680> good

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.010 

and<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.160> will<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.730> strong<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.450> over<00:00:57.810> here

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and we will see how strong the over here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.390 
and we will see how strong the over here
okay<00:01:00.470> come<00:01:01.470> back<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.740> a<00:01:01.800> couple<00:01:01.830> minutes<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.840 

let<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.470> sit<00:01:10.800> for<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.040> couple<00:01:11.070> minutes

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
