you<00:01:01.550> could<00:01:01.969> do<00:01:02.149> this<00:01:02.359> one<00:01:02.809> of<00:01:02.839> two<00:01:02.989> ways<00:01:03.199> you

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
you could do this one of two ways you

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.330 
you could do this one of two ways you
could<00:01:04.460> take<00:01:04.820> some<00:01:05.120> extra<00:01:05.479> time<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.080> leave<00:01:06.500> you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
that give it that extra bit of detail so

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.060 
that give it that extra bit of detail so
you<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.930> color<00:01:12.079> around<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.710> leave<00:01:12.920> it

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369

and<00:01:55.219> just<00:01:55.429> adding<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.969> lighter<00:01:56.179> first<00:01:56.570> adding

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
and just adding the lighter first adding

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.870 
and just adding the lighter first adding
a<00:01:57.530> little<00:01:57.649> bit<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> darker<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:58.729> just

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
a little bit the darker and then just

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.130 
a little bit the darker and then just
kind<00:01:58.969> of<00:01:59.060> blending<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.479> again<00:01:59.689> with<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> lighter

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
kind of blending it again with a lighter

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.590 
kind of blending it again with a lighter
really<00:02:00.649> really<00:02:00.920> easy<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:02.119> just<00:02:02.329> gives<00:02:02.509> it

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
really really easy and it just gives it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.810 
really really easy and it just gives it
a<00:02:02.689> completely<00:02:03.259> different<00:02:03.679> look<00:02:03.859> than<00:02:03.920> just

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
a completely different look than just

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.690 
a completely different look than just
stamping<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.840> images<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.530> color<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.070> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
stamping the images in color and the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.300 
stamping the images in color and the
nice<00:02:07.850> thing<00:02:07.880> about<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.960> hybrid<00:02:09.320> inks<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.770> they

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
nice thing about the hybrid inks is they

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.399 
nice thing about the hybrid inks is they
don't<00:02:10.429> bleed<00:02:10.880> with<00:02:11.450> Copic<00:02:11.840> markers<00:02:12.200> they

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
don't bleed with Copic markers they

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.050 
don't bleed with Copic markers they
don't<00:02:12.560> smear<00:02:12.890> or<00:02:13.069> smudge<00:02:13.099> anything<00:02:13.879> like<00:02:14.030> that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
don't smear or smudge anything like that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.270 
don't smear or smudge anything like that
so<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:14.989> can<00:02:15.290> see<00:02:15.409> I<00:02:15.440> can<00:02:15.590> color<00:02:15.860> over<00:02:16.159> them

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
so you can see I can color over them

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.410 
so you can see I can color over them
quite<00:02:16.640> well<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.120> I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
quite well and I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.270 
quite well and I
can<00:02:17.569> even<00:02:17.780> blend<00:02:17.990> over<00:02:18.349> them<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:19.130> don't

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
can even blend over them and you don't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.640 
can even blend over them and you don't
have<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.640> ink<00:02:19.819> like<00:02:20.000> losing<00:02:20.660> out<00:02:20.810> anywhere<00:02:21.230> or

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
have the ink like losing out anywhere or

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.220 
have the ink like losing out anywhere or
smearing<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.880> really<00:02:23.420> fun<00:02:23.780> some<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
smearing so really fun some of the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.620 
smearing so really fun some of the
techniques<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.709> can<00:02:24.770> do<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.130> these<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.940> once

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
techniques you can do with these so once

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.320 
techniques you can do with these so once
i<00:02:26.810> was<00:02:26.959> done<00:02:27.099> coloring<00:02:28.099> in<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.760> stems<00:02:29.090> and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
i was done coloring in the stems and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.600 
i was done coloring in the stems and
leaves<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.810> flowers<00:02:30.260> i<00:02:30.530> added<00:02:30.890> dissenters

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
leaves and flowers i added dissenters

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.640 
leaves and flowers i added dissenters
which<00:02:32.180> there's<00:02:32.630> two<00:02:32.810> little<00:02:32.959> stamps<00:02:33.440> in<00:02:33.530> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
which there's two little stamps in this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.010 
which there's two little stamps in this
set<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.160> ink<00:02:34.459> those<00:02:34.640> up<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.239> craft

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
set and I ink those up with just craft

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.640 
set and I ink those up with just craft
hybrid<00:02:36.470> ink<00:02:36.650> stand<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.030> then<00:02:38.209> i<00:02:38.239> use<00:02:38.650> 11e

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
hybrid ink stand that and then i use 11e

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.580 
hybrid ink stand that and then i use 11e
13<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:40.850> e<00:02:41.060> 15<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.959> add<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> little<00:02:42.440> bit

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
13 and then e 15 to add a little bit

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.580 
13 and then e 15 to add a little bit
more<00:02:42.860> depth<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.780> then<00:02:44.900> i<00:02:44.930> decided<00:02:45.260> i

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
more depth to it and then i decided i

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.059 
more depth to it and then i decided i
wanted<00:02:46.400> um<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.300> little<00:02:48.050> bit<00:02:48.260> more<00:02:48.500> going<00:02:48.860> on<00:02:49.010> in

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
wanted um a little bit more going on in

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.100 
wanted um a little bit more going on in
the<00:02:49.400> background<00:02:49.670> but<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.330> didn't<00:02:50.630> want<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.900> kind

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
the background but I didn't want to kind

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.170 
the background but I didn't want to kind
of<00:02:51.170> take<00:02:51.380> center<00:02:51.739> stage<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.760> what<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.940> ended<00:02:52.970> up

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
of take center stage so what I ended up

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.509 
of take center stage so what I ended up
doing<00:02:53.239> was<00:02:53.540> taking<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.230> big<00:02:54.410> romantic<00:02:54.890> script

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
doing was taking the big romantic script

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.490 
doing was taking the big romantic script
background<00:02:56.239> stamp<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.780> i<00:02:56.810> inked<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.110> up<00:02:57.260> with

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
background stamp and i inked it up with

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.860 
background stamp and i inked it up with
the<00:02:57.680> snow<00:02:57.860> cone<00:02:58.130> hybrid<00:02:58.459> ink<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.750> is

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the snow cone hybrid ink and this is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.420 
the snow cone hybrid ink and this is
where<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.110> nice<00:03:00.290> thing<00:03:00.650> came<00:03:00.890> in<00:03:00.920> with<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
where the nice thing came in with the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.890 
where the nice thing came in with the
Copic<00:03:01.760> markers<00:03:02.090> because<00:03:02.299> they've<00:03:02.660> kind<00:03:02.870> of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
Copic markers because they've kind of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.690 
Copic markers because they've kind of
blood<00:03:03.140> into<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.560> cardstock<00:03:03.920> as<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.340> could<00:03:04.489> see

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
blood into the cardstock as I could see

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.370 
blood into the cardstock as I could see
where<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:04.940> was<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.420> only<00:03:05.600> applied<00:03:05.930> pressure

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
where it was so I only applied pressure

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.590 
where it was so I only applied pressure
around<00:03:07.010> all<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.549> flowers<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> didn't<00:03:08.239> mind<00:03:08.390> if

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
around all the flowers I didn't mind if

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.840 
around all the flowers I didn't mind if
some<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.959> stamp<00:03:09.200> got<00:03:09.380> over<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.709> but<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.730> I

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
some of the stamp got over it but and I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.850 
some of the stamp got over it but and I
wasn't<00:03:11.209> using<00:03:11.510> very<00:03:11.840> heavy<00:03:12.080> pressure<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:12.739> you

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
wasn't using very heavy pressure so you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.660 
wasn't using very heavy pressure so you
can<00:03:13.040> barely<00:03:13.580> see<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.959> stamped<00:03:15.670> background

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
can barely see the stamped background

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.670 
can barely see the stamped background
but<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.630> gives<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.200> little<00:03:18.500> extra

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
but it just gives that that little extra

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.280 
but it just gives that that little extra
something<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.970> once<00:03:20.120> i<00:03:20.180> was<00:03:20.269> done<00:03:20.330> that<00:03:20.690> i<00:03:20.900> stay

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
something so once i was done that i stay

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.960 
something so once i was done that i stay
on<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.440> sentiment<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.040> then<00:03:22.400> i<00:03:22.459> decided<00:03:22.730> i

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
on the sentiment and then i decided i

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.490 
on the sentiment and then i decided i
want<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.239> add<00:03:23.299> some<00:03:23.510> shimmer<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.109> i<00:03:24.140> turned<00:03:24.440> on

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
want to add some shimmer so i turned on

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.530 
want to add some shimmer so i turned on
my<00:03:24.560> overhead<00:03:25.010> lights<00:03:25.220> because<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.760> helps

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
my overhead lights because that helps

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.729 
my overhead lights because that helps
pick<00:03:26.870> up<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.140> shimmer<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.470> lot<00:03:27.620> more

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
pick up the shimmer a lot more

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.530 
pick up the shimmer a lot more
especially<00:03:28.070> on<00:03:28.340> camera<00:03:28.760> because<00:03:28.880> it's<00:03:29.150> always

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
especially on camera because it's always

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.229 
especially on camera because it's always
so<00:03:29.720> hard<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:30.170> show<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.769> wink<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.070> Stella<00:03:31.370> but<00:03:32.209> I

something<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.430> little<00:05:11.550> bit<00:05:11.730> more<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.420> just

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
something a little bit more so I just

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.350 
something a little bit more so I just
grabbed<00:05:12.960> my<00:05:13.140> brown<00:05:13.470> wink<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.830> Stella<00:05:14.070> and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
grabbed my brown wink of Stella and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.310 
grabbed my brown wink of Stella and
scribbled<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.540> on<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.140> flower

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
scribbled that on to you the flower

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.040 
scribbled that on to you the flower
center<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.040> it<00:05:17.250> just<00:05:17.610> made<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.090> all<00:05:18.270> pop<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:18.780> was

really happy with a plus of course

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.040 
really happy with a plus of course
because<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.700> extra<00:05:21.030> shimmer<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:22.020> I

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
because of that extra shimmer so I

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.470 
because of that extra shimmer so I
didn't<00:05:22.560> realize<00:05:22.980> I<00:05:23.400> wasn't<00:05:24.090> looking<00:05:24.360> at<00:05:24.450> my

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
didn't realize I wasn't looking at my

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.910 
didn't realize I wasn't looking at my
camera<00:05:24.840> when<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.020> finished<00:05:25.350> off<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.500> card<00:05:25.830> that

camera when I finished off the card that
I<00:05:26.130> was<00:05:26.370> zoomed<00:05:26.640> in<00:05:26.790> way<00:05:26.910> too<00:05:26.970> close<00:05:27.300> for<00:05:27.360> the

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
I was zoomed in way too close for the

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.230 
I was zoomed in way too close for the
rest<00:05:28.380> of<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.590> card<00:05:28.830> but<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.730> just<00:05:29.910> grabbed<00:05:30.120> my

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
rest of the card but I just grabbed my

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.060 
rest of the card but I just grabbed my
little<00:05:30.480> shipping<00:05:30.900> box<00:05:31.110> again<00:05:31.380> opened<00:05:31.830> up<00:05:31.920> the

the<00:05:35.220> paintbrush<00:05:35.580> to<00:05:35.880> kind<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.090> splatter<00:05:36.480> along

the<00:05:36.990> inside<00:05:37.140> and<00:05:37.650> then<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.280> just<00:05:38.550> cut<00:05:38.700> down

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
the inside and then I just cut down

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.240
