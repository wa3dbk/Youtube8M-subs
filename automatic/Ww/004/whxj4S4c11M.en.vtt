 funny you will see just one 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.579
 had gone on a raid between youtuber 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.009

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.390
 bios zizian madness a subscriber with bios 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.950

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.509
 know absolutely more and you will see 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.850
 we were on the beginning of the raid and there 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.469
 I took a huge bullshit 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.119
 you'll see it was really epic 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.429
 so it was on ps4 of course so 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.539
 so-called on ps4 there would be a lot 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.369
 fewer bugs 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.689
 there I absolutely did not understand this 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.429
 that happened to send I was on 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.819
 the mythical platform gto galerne my 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.619
 goal 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.119
 on this video so on this gameplay 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.009
 rather been farting the minotaurs 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.289
 quantis ponies and you go part 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.369
 something happened to me sick so for 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.569
 the first time I thought he was good 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.549
 there may be a bug so here is the 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.909
 see I pull my request for galern bim 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.950
 sam suicide but what the fake like on 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.599
 could say that has happened I do not 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.560
 absolutely know what's what 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.880
 you want to offer this video 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.259
 because it really was pretty epic 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.369
 it was really great fun all 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.149
 world did not care about my mouth it was 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.709
 really epic 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.539
 I said to myself good here there is maybe 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.039
 had a little bug and so that's so 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.389
 finished you'll see I'm going 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.430
 try to stay I'll try to 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.620
 shoot a gala ball to see if that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.359
 if if that if it makes them etc 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.350
 and then everything goes well so 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.579
 now I said to myself we're good 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.650
 able to continue this raid is 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.600
 quietly we will be able to advance on 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.260
 will be able to finish this this step 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.569
 quite simply 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.430
 and in the end not going to be a second 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.209
 a praetorian who goes spawn and bim 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.130
 rebelote 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.040
 I go to suicide with my gala 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.930
 so why I do not know absolutely 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.280
 me definitely it was really great 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.660
 epic pity that I could not recover 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.920
 the voices so I know we can 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.329
 to do but I do not know absolutely 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.280
 how to use this ps4 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.620
