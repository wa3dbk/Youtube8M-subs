00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.430
 hello how are you all welcome to this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.619
 video in which I'm going to teach the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.830
 users of ceta 1 compact to install 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.840
 A custom recovery for your phone in 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 this case we are going to install a google 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.630
 recovery which will come integrated 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 both the club recovery and the tw rp 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.790
 recovery at the same time and we will be able to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.510
 to choose 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.460
 the refor and what else is good for us 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.610
 this is going to need some small 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 records 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.410
 I'm going to leave you a sic of the archives 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.690
 so you can unzip it 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.470
 I'll leave the download link in 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.980
 the description of this video and also 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.480
 We are going to need our cell phone 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.880
 that in our cell phone are activated 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.550
 the development options as we do 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.950
 this good was already explained to them in another 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.680
 of my videos specifically in the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.530
 root video the routing the z1 compact is 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.420
 should leave here the same so that they 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.460
 serve as a guide but good the way 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.070
 have developer options in 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.390
 our device is very easy 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.960
 we're just going to go to the settings of the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 phone 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.780
 about the last phone and we're going to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.780
 to go 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.220
 where it says the compilation number and 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.440
 we're going to have to play there seven times 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.650
 followed until it leaves us a little 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.270
 message that we are already developers 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.150
 then let's go back to the menu 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.650
 main settings of the phone and the 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.650
 last one is going to put us 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.300
 already enable development options in 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.980
 this section we are going to enter we are going to 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.390
 activate it 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.390
 and we are going to look 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.600
 an option that says debug usb 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.320
 then in this option of depression usb 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 we are going to mark and we return well once 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.930
 done this we will also need to have 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.390
 installed the program are ips companion 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.600
 in our computer also the form 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.510
 to get this program I mentioned it 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.520
 in the good routing video this 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.710
 program is to have the drivers of 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.560
 our cell phone and how are we going to 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.250
 install let's connect our 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.620
 phone to the computer and at the moment 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.380
 to connect we will leave a 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.510
 notification on our phone that 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.730
 he says install software let's play 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.250
 there in that notification and 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.010
 automatically our computer we 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.610
 the installer of the sony ps will come out 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.340
 So, it will only be a couple of clicks on 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.140
 next and next and the program already 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.050
 is going to be installing our computer 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.600
 and once we have installed are ipc 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.180
 colleagues we will have the drivers that 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.620
 will be the first requirement and good too 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.230
 the other requirement was to activate the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.660
 debug usb from the options 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.810
 development also already I have 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.620
 explained now once these two are done 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.940
 steps we will open the downloaded files 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.940
 or decompressed 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.990
 and they will find a folder 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.290
 call z one he got the recovery 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.450
 we are going to open it and it will show us a 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.730
 file called install let's do 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.500
 double click there to find us 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.670
 this interface where there are five 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.310
 options 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.459
 the first one is for devices rute a 2 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.080
 with the super zoom application and the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.810
 second is also for devices 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.390
 surrounded but with the super application 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.860
 fuser and the third are for devices 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.020
 without root 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.600
 I have tested particularly the first and 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.900
 the second the third one I could not tell 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.510
 if it works as well I since 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.000
 i have android i always know it can be 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.370
 the recovery is needed root 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.840
 so that's why I first root it and can 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.150
 try the third option if you do not have a 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.310
 rooted device but if they do not want 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.920
 risk you can router first your 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.989
 phone from the video that I have 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.680
 mentioned before I have for router 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.150
 z1 compo I'm going to leave it here and 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.580
 well let's suppose we have 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.950
 our device rooted with the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.740
 super application let's go to write the 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.740
 option 1 and we give in enter 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.790
 once this is done the program is going to 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.910
 start doing your job is going to start 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.560
 to root and it's very likely that in 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.770
 our phone shows us a 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.800
 notification to confirm the process 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.290
 a notification similar to this so 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.860
 we will just have to accept and the 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.139
 process will continue 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.250
 it's going to be a matter of seconds for 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:05.590
 the program install the dual recovery on 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:09.190
 our phone and at the end 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.960
 our phone is going to restart and we 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.050
 will ask for a key to exit 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.030
 press a key and we go out and once 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.030
 that has reset our phone 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.169
 we are going to meet with a new 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.210
 application this application 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.210
 it's going to be called n de r 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.520
 and it serves us basically 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.020
 to be able to choose the global moon 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.210
 recovery or the cw erp 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.900
 to choose one of these two custom 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.349
 recovery according to our preferences 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.560
 well we're just going to select 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.780
 one of those two 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.260
 and as you can see also below we have 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.290
 options 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:03.230
 to enter recovery mode or also 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:06.130
 using the shortcut button d 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.080
 turn on the volume button up 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.390
 we can enter our custom 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.340
 record and well that was everything I hope 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.280
