00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello I introduce myself my name is 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.389
 Gregory optician in Paris and today 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.889
 I will give you some tips and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.280
 tips for maintaining your 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.809
 glasses 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.519
 already we will wonder why he is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.440
 important to maintain his glasses while 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.660
 just that will allow to lengthen the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.750
 lifetime of your glasses and it's going 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.910
 to keep a calm vision 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.380
 and good vision so I'm going to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 give some quick tips to 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 daily to already properly maintain your 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.410
 glasses to handle them well so 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.610
 first tip when you wear 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.850
 glasses I advise you to them 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.380
 remove to tomorrow and never to a hand 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 because when we remove them with one hand we 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.020
 risk of forcing a lot on the branch 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 your glasses 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.739
 what was going to happen forms and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 quite quickly second little advice 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.690
 you must avoid wearing glasses 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.829
 on the head as many people do 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 people were so we should avoid 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.750
 just wear them here because avnet 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.120
 will tend to distort and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 keep your shape from your head 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.410
 or simply is discarded so after 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.600
 what follows is that you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 are you slipping on your nose so 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.200
 I'll show you how well 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 clean his glasses so two 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 solutions are available to you either you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.270
 use a maintenance product from 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.310
 glasses that you will find at 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 your optician or nam in the supermarket 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.960
 so it's products that go 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.970
 clean and disinfect your glasses and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 you can also clean your 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.080
 glasses under a trickle of warm water 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 never too hot with a little bit 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.180
 soapy water to degrease 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.470
 so to properly clean your glasses 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.979
 it is initially a question of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.079
 take 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:40.140
 we will put product on each side 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:42.720
 green and we do not hesitate to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.909
 clean with your fingers as it is 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.759
 wet that the glass is moistened on 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.049
 risk of scratching them and after he 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.420
 should take a cloth that is 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.430
 so sweet so generally you take 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.350
 no kleenex or sopalin take a 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.299
 handkerchief a soft cloth and one 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 cleans the green when you leave 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.399
 usually from outside to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399
 interior 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.390
 but what is very important is 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.450
 to use this product 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.940
 one was dusty and clean 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.020
 on a t-shirt we risk doing some 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.910
 micro and sure they're going to be 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.800
 irreversible and which will be added to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.810
 As time what will 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.750
 make the green almost opaque 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.690
 other little fighting board that is 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.990
 important you must never ask 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.340
 glasses in the greens and that's it 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.270
 often sees because it only takes them 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.980
 move a little 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.110
 the greens are in contact directly 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.180
 with the table and by friction force 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.190
 they go they will eventually get scratched have 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.739
 always put his glasses on the branches 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.600
 closed like these here like that one 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.070
 risk not scratching them so you 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.750
 now have some tips 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.190
 which will allow to extend the duration 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.330
 of your ray and vittel glasses 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.330
 exchanged too often
