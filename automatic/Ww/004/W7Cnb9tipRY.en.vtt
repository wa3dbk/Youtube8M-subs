00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello imagine creatures more 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.220
 are the owner of the hallway queue 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.290
 14 meters and no matter how you order 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.650
 not space what kind of furniture are you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.480
 put in this area so she was 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.920
 most comfortable beautiful and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.960
 roomy and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.930
 the revival did not hinder the free 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.439
 moving along this big 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.599
 space what we did here 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.750
 presenting another job and so 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:37.219
 we got a huge closet 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:43.140
 it is 5 sections three sections single 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 the first second and also two sections on 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:54.210
 mirrored center with four swing 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.149
 door material we chose deuter color 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 called oak bardolino 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.270
 when you're in trouble with customers 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.160
 the owner of this apartment they are not clearly 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.010
 outlined what they want they 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.720
 provided me with a sketch in the city of color then 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.369
 there is it completely and creative work 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.909
 apartment owner 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.799
 my only performance was made this 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.110
 work was taken into account and absolutely everything 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.590
 wishes 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.090
 data of people namely in this compartment we 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:31.799
 besides the occasion made a special niche 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:34.259
 for vacuum cleaner one more special time 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.380
 Ironing room is very 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.299
 handy thing because I know myself 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.939
 she is forever somewhere hiding hiding behind 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.690
 Doors and perpetual uncomfortable places in Odessa 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.340
 at the limit specifically in a single 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.250
 place to sing and you understand bubnovsky 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.340
 stand with other men these are the ones 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.680
 which closer we build a loop cup to us 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.740
 need only push and set movement 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.740
 nothing else is needed in this compartment 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.930
 we wake up made three important elements 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.100
 on the system 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.300
 tandem is all the same as from soft all 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.180
 very comfortable and practical I am friends and not 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.720
 proponent violence and murder on the very 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.140
 business 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.350
 one shot we threw a bunch in the back a 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.000
 I'll tell you exactly what hares we killed in 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.520
 first you made a beautiful home and closet 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 who will serve the master for a long time 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.870
 apartments will please the eye 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.040
 this is the first moment the second moment we 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.150
 hid switchboards which before 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.709
 ugly just spoil 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.510
 from the bottom because now you want next to 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.160
 we all have access is easier then 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
 there can be open and see what 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.450
 Automatically if cut down or replace 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.060
 any manipulations to do that is everything 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.270
 I can not walk sealed can absolutely 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.910
 quietly enjoy further we got 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.390
 huge space depth of 330 meters 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.070
 that's enough to accommodate 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.620
 huge amount of luggage 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.570
 here we have pants that is in one 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.459
 mirror compartment in the second exactly such 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.930
 same 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.239
 outerwear can be enough here 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.160
 will place also here small 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.209
 compartment with a bar with three shelves 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.660
 Another very important point when 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.519
 designing will say saved about 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.570
 3000 rubles 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:42.660
 this order why we made the wardrobe 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.239
 by more rational calculations that 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.720
 less material was spent on 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.440
 actually here carrying three columns 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.739
 central right and left 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.760
 here at these sections of the side walls 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.099
 own no they are played connects 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:08.610
 these sections are our three with these 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:11.280
 here's a pancake curtain so blow up or 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.510
 less material and saved a day too 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.109
 plus is very important mom 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.389
 take into account the height of the handles that is to close 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.180
 so that the customer was comfortable under his height 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.410
 lest he come up with no hand 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.139
 nor leaned down 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.020
 exactly the pen where you need it too 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.850
 very comfortable, well, I probably 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.919
 I repeat very often I tell these 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.000
 loops if we are not satisfied with you 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.060
 closing speed too slow yes 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.760
 we can disable 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:49.320
 pushing a couple of our closers and 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.510
 get faster acceleration but it 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.100
 already let the owners of this apartment themselves 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.740
 will again have 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.740
 these things as they end it 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.600
 everything works in the training video which 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.080
 will run out of time while I talk about 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.270
 Large Russian wardrobe category which 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.180
 there is an option near the premises 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.180
 hall we now all this while
