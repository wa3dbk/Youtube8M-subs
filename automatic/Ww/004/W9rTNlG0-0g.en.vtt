00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.470
 ended the fight they raise our hands 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.899
 now what do we do 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.340
 welcome to three minutes of boxing in 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.769
 this chapter I want to give you some 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.119
 tips on how to take a victory but 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.590
 he is not talking about any drink 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.410
 alcoholic ok 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.330
 first of all it is very important that 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.820
 our triumphs do not make us proud 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.130
 and as they say in Mexico we created the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.119
 divine heron 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.039
 we need to know how to take a victory 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.689
 humbly I like to thank 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.730
 my coach as soon as they finish the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.730
 combat and also to my corner by the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.680
 support and his instructions is also 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.450
 good to thank the opponent and his 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.490
 corner letting them know it was a good 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.710
 personal confrontation to me not me 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.180
 like to jump for joy scream and do 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.250
 all a scandal for winning 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.110
 just smile and be happy with 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.030
 the victory over there say that if you jump 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.620
 of joy and you make a whole scandal for 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.270
 have won in a certain way you are 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.390
 showing that you did not even expect 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.460
 win and that sometimes makes the other 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.590
 corner think that the fight was stolen 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.390
 so that's why it's better not to do so much 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.970
 scandal at least is what I think 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.829
 but now if you're in a fight 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.500
 world championship and you win then there are 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:11.369
 that other situation and in that case I think 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.570
 which is more like a celebration than 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.700
 then must differentiate the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.549
 two something that I found very useful for 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.380
 that the ego does not rise is to remember 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.960
 that there will always always be someone 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.330
 better than you or just like you can earn 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.850
 that way we can always think of 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.770
 improve day by day whether you win or 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.570
 lose for me is very important 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.700
 review the video when I go back to 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.770
 home because I am my biggest critic 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.689
 then in that way I see what I did 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.039
 well what I did wrong and also if I'm 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.500
 according to the decision of the judges 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.880
 and if I do not agree if I think 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.740
 that my grain opponent 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.960
 I take it as a defeat even though I have 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.780
 named the winner 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.390
 and also if they ask me how I was 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.100
 I always always answer them with 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.220
 honesty I tell you the truth you know that 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 for the truth I win it but I feel that 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.759
 I lost it for this and these reasons 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.560
 there are also times that you win the fight 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.780
 but inside you know that he was very 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.340
 closed and that you could go to any 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.110
 side then I think it's very 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.429
 important also to know how to recognize these 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.899
 Situations never stay 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.610
 completely satisfied with having 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.160
 won that will always help you 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.840
 improve that yes at least that leganÃ©s to 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.840
 someone much better than you and the rockies 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.790
 in the first round 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.069
 Now I think that the most important thing 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.720
 how to take a victory or multiple is 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.720
 do not trust us very much and let that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.560
 Confidence turns into arrogance 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.569
 we have to keep training with the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.670
 same intensity sometimes even harder 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.830
 to keep winning we also have to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.690
 thank our coach to the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.849
 that were in our corner to 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.120
 our sparring partners to 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.410
 our family friends any 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.390

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.299
