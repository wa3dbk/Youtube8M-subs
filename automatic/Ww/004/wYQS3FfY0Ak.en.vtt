00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.210

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.280
 the law should only prohibit harmful actions to society 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.530
 what is not prohibited by law 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.110

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 nobody should be forced to me 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.210

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.559
 if it offers resistance 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.970
 the law should not impose other penalties than those 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.290
 which are obviously necessary and no one should be punished except by virtue of a 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.120
 law enacted prior to the offense
