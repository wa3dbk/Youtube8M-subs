00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.259
 and now all beautiful and beautiful we are 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.990
 here in another language if this time is a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 informative video in the last photo 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.690
 before 2.00 tucked many people 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.490
 He said that what I said was not true 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.990
 a while ago they were going to go to 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.789
 take a long time but well you see in the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.009
 dates on which we are and went out on 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.599
 November the year at which he has 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.089
 It's quite long and good, this is the 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.980
 last photo started before and well you say 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.199
 Well, here are a couple of three or 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.339
 four cuts of images that good 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.710
 could represent different levels 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.780
 but good I've been thinking a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.930
 little bit more and I said well and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.430
 because down below the levels 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.130
 we usually have six types of 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.600
 from background the patron of ground is 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.880
 can you say that's how it is in the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.950
 creator mode and all choose 6 types there 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.780
 one that is like squares other than 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.610
 is hexagons and good is another put the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.590
 screen and you can see it but here 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.800
 it seems that they are totally new 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.620
 so I thought that maybe it would be 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.330
 they will be able to customize is to say that you 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.280
 for example you do a part and the level 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.840
 it goes repeating as we can see in the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.670
 middle level in the middle to the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.430
 left of c's looks like mario's 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.990
 bros we can see how it goes repeating 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.790
 at all times the same as in the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.290
 right in also in the blue then 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.399
 then maybe they could do that 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.720
 that is repeating the truth is that 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.550
 I would be very fat and give a few touches 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.810
 perfect then we can also observe 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.640
 that there are three new funds three new 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.740
 funds as I'm telling you of levels 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.020
 in the first we had the first one towards 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.660
 the left that is this orange 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 this violet sorry that good also 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.860
 It will put color but good is a 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.229
 bottom more then to the right we have the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.450
 de mario bros and the classic of supermario 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.330
 word that has been in a lot of games 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.799
 of mario because here we have it we do not know 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.700
 if this will be simply by the photo 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.840
 this gives us the little 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.570
 but good since it has come in two 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.930
 images because they will not fit him and 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 Well, there we have the three funds 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.490
 then we also have at the end 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.229
 to one that is in plan this space and already 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.729
 it is but good thing his is not known very 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.670
 well what will be 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.129
 and good, we continue with our video 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.259
 informative because the first thing we can 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.390
 see besides the background and the ground 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.180
 changed we could observe that there is a 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.310
 species of new bug as it is said in 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.420
 these shits that are going to put the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.950
 dragons is in the middle before there were the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.980
 photos that happened to us before they were 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.720
 super mario bros because there was no 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.750
 nothing there and now we have a kind of 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.610
 of why it is what they are called in the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.650
 dances a kind of doll 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.970
 now almost black resemblance and good 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.500
 because there we have it, we do not know what 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.530
 it may mean we do not know what is 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.300
 but there it is and then also to the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.850
 right of this photo 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.680
 we would have new blocks worth nothing more 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.540
 everything to the best that can mean a 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.880
 three of that darker part of the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.740
 blue blocks but nothing more and then to 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.770
 the right also we would all have 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.380
 Well, rather new blocks and then 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.000
 nothing else the most important thing I wanted that 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.880
 you could see is that they are going to be able 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.709
 change the ground because if not the truth 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.630
 I do not think they put four 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.800
 new funds that you open that you do not have 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.050
 nothing to see because suddenly it is in 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.850
 plan we are playing with happy ones and 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.709
 suddenly we put some colors 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.780
 Well, I do not know very well, maybe the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.580
 you put it perfectly this is not a 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.110
 My opinion that I am saying but 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.990
 how good and it is most likely that 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.390
 I think so well I hope that you 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.459
 liked the video and our next goodbye and 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.450
 also there is little left for netflix nights I know 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.450
 to be attentive
