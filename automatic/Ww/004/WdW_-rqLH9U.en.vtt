00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.010
 here we are, everyone is ready 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.970
 to make a tasty recipe is 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.180
 quite fast 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.750
 the ingredients are of course 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.700
 perfect raw ham beautiful hail 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.129
 which we will need later for 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.590
 wrap it in slices of bread that I 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.520
 already the state previously peppercorns 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.239
 lemon cream low-fat yogurt 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.089
 not even greens are another ingredient 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.280
 which I have previously crushed 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.479
 so I'll take it and put it in mine 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.940
 bowl as you see we have chosen the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.010
 green apples because the green apple is the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.970
 he aims a little more acid so he gets married 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.520
 well with more firm lemon we add 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.000
 lemon juice in a way that the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.430
 apple color is not lost 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.159
 take a spoon, add the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.680
 cream I in itself re with few quantities 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.470
 in a way that after I just love I hand to 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.380
 but no 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.800
 we add low-fat yogurt so it is also 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.560
 quite dietetic as a recipe 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:50.360
 we amalgamate into everything must come precisely 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.360
 all homogeneous we adjust the salt 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.400
 here we are already ready to implant 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.310
 we take our plate 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.330
 viadana but our slices as I said 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.520
 first toasted and you can pick any 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:14.030
 as a round cylinder shape as a prefect 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.560
 I call myself a quantity of musso 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.980
 this is also a certain note perhaps 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.820
 for the summer that is very fast fresh 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.920
 take our slices of ham 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.320
 raw maybe you want them maybe 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.170
 a little hail so that we succeed 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.830
 maybe he does n't know what to do with a cannolo 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.830
 like that 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.680
 a bit of pepper that gives a flavor 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.480
 especially also in terms of aesthetics 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.780
 since we eat often and willingly 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.200
 with the eyes 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.200
 let 's take the file 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.250
 let's make some slices a little thicker 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.760
 then saw that the apple changes 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.050
 color in a hurry if we put ourselves 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.430
 a little lemon juice 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.610
 the color remains unchanged will serve 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.620
 just right to garnish ours 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.620
 flat and with another touch of freshness 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.819
 the last touch 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.819
 here is ready
