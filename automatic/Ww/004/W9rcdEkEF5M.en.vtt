I tested it at home and I actually get

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.080 
I tested it at home and I actually get
better<00:01:37.780> performance<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.520> new<00:01:39.729> wireless

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
better performance with the new wireless

the<00:01:47.799> antenna<00:01:48.219> internet<00:01:49.030> access<00:01:49.539> was<00:01:49.929> very

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
the antenna internet access was very

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.380 
the antenna internet access was very
intermittent<00:01:50.859> when<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.520> plugged<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.939> antenna

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
intermittent when I plugged the antenna

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.160 
intermittent when I plugged the antenna
in<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.869> get<00:01:53.229> three<00:01:53.799> bars<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.219> service<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.719> I<00:01:55.899> get
