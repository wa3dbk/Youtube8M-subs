00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.629 
you're outdoors cloudy or daylight so
I'm<00:02:13.469> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.650> assume<00:02:13.980> we're<00:02:14.159> taking<00:02:14.430> a

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:14.639 
I'm going to assume we're taking a

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.680 
I'm going to assume we're taking a
picture<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.480> nice

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
picture of a nice

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.240 
picture of a nice
landscape<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.770> I'm<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.070> go<00:02:17.160> with

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
landscape so I'm going to go with

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.860 
landscape so I'm going to go with
daylight<00:02:18.530> click<00:02:19.530> set<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.820> escape<00:02:21.390> the

function menu in this mode the ISO is

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.800 
function menu in this mode the ISO is
set<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.530> automatic<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:27.090> don't<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.420> any

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
set to automatic and we don't have any

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.410 
set to automatic and we don't have any
other<00:02:27.870> option<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:28.980> fine<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
other option but that's fine and the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420 
other option but that's fine and the
flash<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.900> turned<00:02:31.140> off<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.710> this<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.130> what<00:02:32.400> I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
flash is turned off and this is what I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830 
flash is turned off and this is what I
would<00:02:32.550> highly<00:02:32.850> recommend<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.450> leaving<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
would highly recommend is leaving the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
would highly recommend is leaving the
flash<00:02:34.050> off<00:02:34.350> because<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.340> find<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.820> if<00:02:35.940> you

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
flash off because I find that if you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.170 
flash off because I find that if you
turn<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> flash<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:37.760> stitching<00:02:38.760> them<00:02:38.910> later

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
turn the flash on stitching them later

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.380 
turn the flash on stitching them later
on<00:02:39.530> you'll<00:02:40.530> be<00:02:40.740> able<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.220> every<00:02:41.580> time<00:02:41.820> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
on you'll be able to see every time the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.880 
on you'll be able to see every time the
flash<00:02:42.630> was<00:02:42.810> taken<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.200> won't<00:02:43.320> be<00:02:43.440> very

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
flash was taken it won't be very

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.190 
flash was taken it won't be very
consistent<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.580> smooth<00:02:44.940> lighting<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:45.570> try

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
consistent and smooth lighting so try

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.460 
consistent and smooth lighting so try
and<00:02:46.380> deal<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.800> flash<00:02:47.040> being<00:02:47.310> turned<00:02:47.580> off

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
and deal with the flash being turned off

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.590 
and deal with the flash being turned off
now<00:02:49.470> when<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.340> set<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.480> need

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
series with the first image it doesn't

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.770 
series with the first image it doesn't
have<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.050> be<00:03:22.430> exact<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:24.330> don't<00:03:24.510> want<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> go

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
have to be exact you don't want to go

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.800 
have to be exact you don't want to go
over<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.160> certainly<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.940> like

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
over but you can certainly have it like

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.380 
over but you can certainly have it like
this<00:03:28.020> for<00:03:28.290> example<00:03:28.830> where<00:03:29.400> yes<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.120> see<00:03:30.270> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
this for example where yes I can see the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.390 
this for example where yes I can see the
nose<00:03:30.600> here<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.350> dog<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.800> can<00:03:31.950> also<00:03:32.100> see

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
nose here of the dog but I can also see

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.000 
nose here of the dog but I can also see
it<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.239> that's<00:03:33.420> fine<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:34.620> doesn't<00:03:34.830> have

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
it here and that's fine it doesn't have

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.180 
it here and that's fine it doesn't have
to<00:03:35.130> be<00:03:35.270> extremely<00:03:36.270> precise<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.980> more

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
to be extremely precise but the more

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.430 
to be extremely precise but the more
accurate<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.730> guess<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.150> better<00:03:39.300> or<00:03:40.020> when<00:03:40.290> you

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
accurate I guess the better or when you

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.199 
accurate I guess the better or when you
take<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.160> pictures<00:03:41.459> later<00:03:41.670> into<00:03:42.180> the

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
take the pictures later into the

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.170 
take the pictures later into the
computer<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.920> can<00:03:44.370> take<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.580> second

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
computer so you can take a second

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.150 
computer so you can take a second
picture<00:03:45.530> go<00:03:46.530> ahead<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.739> press<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.920> shutter

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160

button<00:03:47.280> down<00:03:47.550> again<00:03:48.330> half<00:03:49.050> way<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.500> then<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
button down again half way and then the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.449 
button down again half way and then the
rest<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.850> way<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.269> take<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.480> shot<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
rest of the way to take that shot and

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.610 
rest of the way to take that shot and
then<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.610> second<00:03:53.940> picture<00:03:54.090> will<00:03:54.810> move<00:03:55.200> over

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
