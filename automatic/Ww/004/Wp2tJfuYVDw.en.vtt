a normal socket and the square end on
your<00:00:19.050> socket<00:00:19.670> now<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.150> should<00:00:21.330> use<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
your socket now you should use a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.790 
your socket now you should use a
breakaway<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.140> because<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> will<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.680> on

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800

to get a little cup like this just to
inspect<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.440> oil<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.520> make<00:00:53.789> sure<00:00:53.910> there's<00:00:54.090> no

because if there is it means as other
problems<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.440> want<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> take<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.739> little

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
problems in so you want to take a little

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.600 
problems in so you want to take a little
sample<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> oil<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:04.680> put<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
sample of the oil and then put the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:16.179 
sample of the oil and then put the
remainders<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> big<00:01:07.830> bucket

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.370 

now<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.490> pretty<00:01:17.700> messy<00:01:18.000> job<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.170> try<00:01:19.350> not

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
now this is pretty messy job so try not

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.090 
now this is pretty messy job so try not
to<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.829> hands<00:01:20.100> dirty<00:01:21.200> but<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.830> easier

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to get your hands dirty but it's easier

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.899 
to get your hands dirty but it's easier
said<00:01:23.250> than<00:01:23.430> done

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.100 

now<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.119> leave<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.420> aside<00:01:28.310> just<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:30.110> oil

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
now just leave this aside just to oil

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
now just leave this aside just to oil
the<00:01:31.200> metal<00:01:31.409> shavings<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.039> fall<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.149> if<00:01:33.299> there

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the metal shavings to fall out if there

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
the metal shavings to fall out if there
is<00:01:33.479> any<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.610> there's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
is any and then you can see if there's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.539 
is any and then you can see if there's
any<00:01:36.119> impurities<00:01:36.929> or<00:01:37.170> any<00:01:37.830> other<00:01:38.070> problems

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
any impurities or any other problems

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:46.270 
any impurities or any other problems
that<00:01:38.610> could<00:01:39.119> happen<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.229> depth<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:43.460> yeah

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
that could happen in your depth and yeah

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.240 
that could happen in your depth and yeah
now<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.810> drain<00:01:48.810> plug<00:01:48.959> on<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.440> diff<00:01:49.709> has

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
now the drain plug on your diff has

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160 
now the drain plug on your diff has
usually<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.580> little<00:01:50.759> magnet<00:01:51.209> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.360> end<00:01:51.600> which

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
usually a little magnet on the end which

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
usually a little magnet on the end which
picks<00:01:52.440> up<00:01:52.560> any<00:01:52.740> metal<00:01:53.069> particles<00:01:53.369> or<00:01:53.940> any

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
picks up any metal particles or any

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.440 
picks up any metal particles or any
other<00:01:54.690> things<00:01:54.959> in<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.170> diff<00:01:55.459> so<00:01:56.459> hopefully

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
other things in your diff so hopefully

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.020 
other things in your diff so hopefully
you<00:01:57.539> can<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:57.990> guys<00:01:58.580> if<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.729> put<00:01:59.909> into

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you can see this guys if you put into

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.820 
you can see this guys if you put into
the<00:02:00.209> Sun<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.690> bit<00:02:00.810> proceed<00:02:01.319> better<00:02:01.590> but

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
the Sun little bit proceed better but

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.910 
the Sun little bit proceed better but
there<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.459> actually<00:02:02.640> metal<00:02:03.179> shavings<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:04.080> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there is actually metal shavings on the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.029 
there is actually metal shavings on the
end<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.280> death<00:02:05.490> plug<00:02:06.649> drain<00:02:07.649> plug<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
end of the death plug drain plug so

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.009 
end of the death plug drain plug so
yeah<00:02:10.429> that's<00:02:10.670> not<00:02:10.789> too<00:02:10.849> good<00:02:11.200> that's<00:02:12.200> bad<00:02:12.670> yeah

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
yeah that's not too good that's bad yeah

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.539 
yeah that's not too good that's bad yeah
so<00:02:15.019> there<00:02:15.200> obviously<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.709> some<00:02:16.099> sort<00:02:16.430> of

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
so there obviously is some sort of

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.720 
so there obviously is some sort of
problem<00:02:17.360> happening<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:17.989> because<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:19.159> was

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
problem happening now because this was

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.089 
problem happening now because this was
running<00:02:20.120> with<00:02:20.239> low<00:02:20.989> oil<00:02:21.019> for<00:02:21.530> quite<00:02:21.709> some<00:02:21.890> time

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
running with low oil for quite some time

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.600 
running with low oil for quite some time
it<00:02:22.340> could<00:02:22.549> just<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.939> due<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.769> things<00:02:24.769> you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it could just be due to that things you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.430 
it could just be due to that things you
know<00:02:25.700> wearing<00:02:25.970> fast<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.989> there<00:02:27.110> should<00:02:27.260> be

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
know wearing fast and there should be

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.460 
know wearing fast and there should be
because<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.190> oil<00:02:29.319> hopefully<00:02:30.319> when<00:02:30.440> we

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
because of that of oil hopefully when we

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.819 
because of that of oil hopefully when we
fill<00:02:30.650> up<00:02:30.769> with<00:02:30.860> new<00:02:31.040> oil<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.430> hits<00:02:32.209> survives

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
fill up with new oil it hits survives

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.140 
fill up with new oil it hits survives
another<00:02:34.450> couple<00:02:35.450> years<00:02:35.690> but<00:02:35.900> um<00:02:36.280> yeah<00:02:37.280> that's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
another couple years but um yeah that's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.780 
another couple years but um yeah that's
that's<00:02:38.420> not<00:02:38.659> a<00:02:38.720> good<00:02:38.780> sign<00:02:39.109> so<00:02:39.700> that's<00:02:40.700> what

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
that's not a good sign so that's what

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.430 
that's not a good sign so that's what
you<00:02:40.849> want<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.030> look<00:02:41.150> out<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:41.480> metal<00:02:42.290> shavings

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
you want to look out for metal shavings

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.470 
you want to look out for metal shavings
are<00:02:42.799> bad<00:02:48.280> okay<00:02:49.280> what<00:02:49.609> you<00:02:49.670> want<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.879> do<00:02:50.000> now<00:02:50.209> is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
are bad okay what you want to do now is

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.930 
are bad okay what you want to do now is
just<00:02:50.900> clean<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:53.000> vaults<00:02:53.359> now<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:55.489> just<00:02:55.700> clean

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
just clean the vaults now we just clean

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.430 
just clean the vaults now we just clean
this<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.269> parts<00:02:56.569> well<00:02:56.750> sure<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.079> if<00:02:57.319> you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
this in the parts well sure but if you

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.960 
this in the parts well sure but if you
don't<00:02:57.620> have<00:02:57.709> one<00:02:57.859> of<00:02:57.889> those<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.310> can<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.459> use

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
don't have one of those you can just use

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.229 
don't have one of those you can just use
degrees<00:02:59.239> or<00:03:00.700> anything<00:03:01.700> really

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
degrees or anything really

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.449 
degrees or anything really
diesel<00:03:03.200> or<00:03:03.290> kerosene<00:03:03.680> will<00:03:03.920> probably<00:03:04.190> work<00:03:04.280> as

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
diesel or kerosene will probably work as

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.860 
diesel or kerosene will probably work as
well<00:03:06.159> that<00:03:07.159> just<00:03:07.340> cleans<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:07.730> up<00:03:07.819> so<00:03:08.180> when<00:03:08.690> you

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
well that just cleans it up so when you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.440 
well that just cleans it up so when you
re<00:03:09.019> inspect<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.620> later<00:03:09.859> on<00:03:10.129> you<00:03:10.909> can<00:03:11.060> see<00:03:11.329> if

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
re inspect it later on you can see if

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.189 
re inspect it later on you can see if
there's<00:03:11.629> any<00:03:11.810> more<00:03:12.349> build-up<00:03:13.959> with<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.079> new

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:15.199 
there's any more build-up with the new

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.170 
there's any more build-up with the new
defile<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.739> there<00:03:15.919> I<00:03:16.129> mean<00:03:16.639> this<00:03:16.760> cars<00:03:17.000> done

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
defile in there I mean this cars done

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.800 
defile in there I mean this cars done
100,000<00:03:17.930> kilometres<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:20.530> lot<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.560> thrashing

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
100,000 kilometres so a lot of thrashing

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.390 
100,000 kilometres so a lot of thrashing
so<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:24.109> little<00:03:24.440> bit<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:24.680> metal<00:03:25.250> shavings

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
so a little bit of metal shavings

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.530 
so a little bit of metal shavings
hopefully<00:03:26.090> isn't<00:03:26.269> too<00:03:26.780> bad<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.459> mean<00:03:28.849> it<00:03:29.180> is

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
hopefully isn't too bad but I mean it is

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.319 
hopefully isn't too bad but I mean it is
a<00:03:29.569> bit<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.840> concern<00:03:30.199> so<00:03:30.970> cleaning<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> plug

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
a bit of a concern so cleaning the plug

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.650 
a bit of a concern so cleaning the plug
then<00:03:32.959> rechecking<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.799> can<00:03:33.949> see<00:03:34.160> if<00:03:34.310> it's

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
then rechecking it you can see if it's

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.869 
then rechecking it you can see if it's
having<00:03:35.660> more<00:03:35.810> shavings<00:03:36.579> anything<00:03:37.579> else<00:03:37.730> is

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
having more shavings anything else is

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.289 
having more shavings anything else is
wearing<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:39.260> can<00:03:39.379> sort<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.620> see<00:03:40.310> how<00:03:40.970> fast

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
wearing so you can sort of see how fast

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.210 
wearing so you can sort of see how fast
he's<00:03:41.599> wearing<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.139> if<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.739> need<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.889> do<00:03:43.040> any

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
he's wearing and if you need to do any

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.220 
he's wearing and if you need to do any
more<00:03:43.510> things<00:03:44.510> after<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:46.629> okay<00:03:47.629> on<00:03:47.900> the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
more things after that okay on the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.520 
more things after that okay on the
limited-slip<00:03:49.150> deer<00:03:50.150> oil<00:03:50.389> you<00:03:50.720> get<00:03:51.019> from<00:03:51.379> the

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
limited-slip deer oil you get from the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.020 
limited-slip deer oil you get from the
store<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:53.090> has<00:03:53.449> a<00:03:53.480> specific<00:03:54.639> function<00:03:55.639> you

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
store it has a specific function you

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.759 
store it has a specific function you
don't<00:03:56.209> actually<00:03:56.359> need<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.629> funnel<00:03:57.079> to<00:03:57.230> fill<00:03:57.650> up

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
don't actually need a funnel to fill up

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.979 
don't actually need a funnel to fill up
your<00:03:57.799> diff<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:59.209> it's<00:03:59.629> a<00:03:59.720> bit<00:03:59.870> confusing

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
your diff so it's a bit confusing

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.930 
your diff so it's a bit confusing
because<00:04:00.409> only<00:04:00.680> include<00:04:01.099> one<00:04:01.129> feature<00:04:01.639> on<00:04:01.849> the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
because only include one feature on the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.879 
because only include one feature on the
bottle<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:02.599> we're<00:04:03.139> just<00:04:03.290> going<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.530> explain<00:04:03.769> it

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
bottle so we're just going to explain it

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.339 
bottle so we're just going to explain it
to<00:04:03.919> you<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:05.269> we<00:04:05.389> have<00:04:05.419> to<00:04:05.569> do<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.139> have<00:04:06.260> to

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
to you so we have to do is you have to

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.119 
to you so we have to do is you have to
pull<00:04:06.590> up<00:04:06.620> these<00:04:07.629> times<00:04:08.629> get<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> bit<00:04:09.019> a<00:04:09.049> lot<00:04:09.290> you

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
pull up these times get a bit a lot you

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.589 
pull up these times get a bit a lot you
have<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> pull<00:04:10.549> up<00:04:10.699> these<00:04:10.909> little<00:04:11.120> things<00:04:11.479> here

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
have to pull up these little things here

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:20.530 
have to pull up these little things here
so<00:04:12.079> it's<00:04:12.889> like<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:14.440> sort<00:04:15.440> of<00:04:15.590> like<00:04:15.829> so

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.420 

once<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.680> have<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:23.070> pull

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
once you have that you just have to pull

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.480 
once you have that you just have to pull
it<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.580> joint<00:04:26.970> onto<00:04:27.270> there<00:04:27.450> like<00:04:27.660> so

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
it and that is joint onto there like so

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.000 
it and that is joint onto there like so
now<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.760> pull<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> top<00:04:30.300> off<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:31.770> comes

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
now just pull the top off and it comes

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.500 
now just pull the top off and it comes
up<00:04:32.190> with<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.430> pod<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.940> have<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.150> pull<00:04:33.300> pretty

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
up with a pod you have to pull pretty

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.620 
up with a pod you have to pull pretty
hard<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.160> it's<00:04:35.160> just<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> tube<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.000> then<00:04:36.510> you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
hard and it's just the tube and then you

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:54.280 
hard and it's just the tube and then you
can<00:04:36.780> fill<00:04:36.990> up<00:04:37.110> your<00:04:37.290> gift<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:38.450> so

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.410 

because<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.160> actual<00:04:55.370> fill<00:04:55.700> hole<00:04:55.940> is<00:04:56.120> in<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.300> bit

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
because the actual fill hole is in a bit

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.950 
because the actual fill hole is in a bit
of<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.600> weird<00:04:56.990> spot<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.910> can't<00:04:59.150> really<00:04:59.630> get<00:04:59.900> a

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
of a weird spot you can't really get a

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.860 
of a weird spot you can't really get a
funnel<00:05:00.350> in<00:05:00.560> there<00:05:00.740> without<00:05:01.270> making<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.600> sort<00:05:02.840> of

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
funnel in there without making a sort of

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.590 
funnel in there without making a sort of
adapter<00:05:03.350> for<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:04.150> this<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.330> why<00:05:05.450> they

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
adapter for it so this is why they

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:15.060 
adapter for it so this is why they
include<00:05:05.900> this<00:05:06.020> on<00:05:06.170> the<00:05:06.260> bottle

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
differ in it it'll probably take about

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.660 
differ in it it'll probably take about
ten<00:05:33.130> minutes<00:05:33.160> or<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:33.790> just<00:05:34.030> holding<00:05:34.750> it<00:05:34.930> so

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
process but you'll get there eventually
