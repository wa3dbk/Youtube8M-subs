00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.910 
board and we use silicon film paper
silicon<00:01:12.970> release<00:01:13.970> paper<00:01:14.360> as<00:01:14.659> adhesive<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:17.920> we

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
silicon release paper as adhesive and we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.250 
silicon release paper as adhesive and we
cut<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.490> silicone<00:01:19.970> paper<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.690> size<00:01:20.720> of

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
cut the silicone paper to the size of

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
board if you like and we'll eye with the

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.880 
board if you like and we'll eye with the
silicon<00:01:35.229> side<00:01:36.229> facing<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.119> paper<00:01:38.920> with<00:01:39.920> iron

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
silicon side facing the paper with iron

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.850 
silicon side facing the paper with iron
iron<00:01:42.940> so<00:01:43.940> you<00:01:44.510> will<00:01:44.659> have<00:01:44.810> Adel<00:01:45.409> film<00:01:46.570> adhesive

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
iron so you will have Adel film adhesive

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.969 
iron so you will have Adel film adhesive
on<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.220> paper

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
on the paper

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.780

we<00:01:51.979> don't<00:01:52.159> use<00:01:52.340> paste<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:53.960> all<00:01:54.140> trying

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
we don't use paste so it's all trying

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.300 
we don't use paste so it's all trying

the<00:03:58.820> absorbency<00:04:00.190> kind<00:04:01.190> of<00:04:01.330> make<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.510> say<00:04:03.110> my

the absorbency kind of make it say my

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.760 
the absorbency kind of make it say my
size<00:04:03.770> because<00:04:04.580> we<00:04:04.610> don't<00:04:05.210> we<00:04:05.540> do<00:04:05.690> not<00:04:05.720> use<00:04:06.080> wet

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770

so<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.630> paper<00:04:12.050> was<00:04:12.350> still<00:04:13.090> absorbent<00:04:14.710> semi

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
so the paper was still absorbent semi

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.360 
so the paper was still absorbent semi
absorbent<00:04:16.370> it's<00:04:16.850> good<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:18.340> use<00:04:19.340> for

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
absorbent it's good to use for

absorbent it's good to use for
watercolor<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.920> would<00:04:21.920> use<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.880> peeling<00:04:23.390> off

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250
