00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
another variation of doing a single arm

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.230 
another variation of doing a single arm

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
having to hold the bars be a lot more

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.430 
having to hold the bars be a lot more
difficult<00:04:57.300> than<00:04:57.419> holding<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.960> dumb<00:04:58.200> though

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
difficult than holding the dumb though

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.409 
difficult than holding the dumb though
because<00:04:58.919> it's<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.280> lot<00:04:59.490> longer<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.150> you're

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
because it's a lot longer so you're

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.960 
because it's a lot longer so you're
really<00:05:00.870> gonna<00:05:01.139> stabilize<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.370> ball<00:05:02.610> all<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
way up and all the way down squeezing

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.770 
way up and all the way down squeezing
that<00:05:05.370> bar<00:05:05.610> super<00:05:05.970> tight<00:05:06.210> you're<00:05:06.660> gonna

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
that bar super tight you're gonna

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.420 
that bar super tight you're gonna
stimulate<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.320> lot<00:05:07.470> more<00:05:07.620> muscle<00:05:07.950> fiber<00:05:08.160> so

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
stimulate a lot more muscle fiber so

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.100 
stimulate a lot more muscle fiber so
give<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.760> shot<00:05:08.850> and<00:05:09.540> don't<00:05:09.840> worry<00:05:10.020> about

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
give that a shot and don't worry about

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.420
