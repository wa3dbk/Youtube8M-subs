performance so one of the first elements

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.970 
performance so one of the first elements
that<00:00:17.230> we<00:00:17.380> need<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.650> look<00:00:17.800> at<00:00:18.010> is<00:00:19.290> is<00:00:20.290> the<00:00:20.680> group

thing you should do is just pitch a note
vieni<00:00:30.610> notice<00:00:31.120> you<00:00:31.990> know<00:00:32.259> that's<00:00:32.500> comfortable

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
for everybody and all sing that to the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.389 
for everybody and all sing that to the
same<00:00:35.710> sound<00:00:36.250> whether<00:00:37.030> that's<00:00:37.300> R<00:00:37.510> or<00:00:38.050> LA<00:00:38.530> make

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
same sound whether that's R or LA make

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.009 
same sound whether that's R or LA make
sure<00:00:39.550> everybody<00:00:39.879> seen<00:00:40.149> in<00:00:40.359> time<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:40.929> you're

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
sure everybody seen in time and you're

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.369 
sure everybody seen in time and you're
getting<00:00:41.109> a<00:00:41.289> nice<00:00:41.440> mix<00:00:42.370> on<00:00:42.640> that<00:00:43.269> now<00:00:43.960> it's<00:00:44.170> also

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
getting a nice mix on that now it's also

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.349 
getting a nice mix on that now it's also
worth<00:00:44.710> remembering<00:00:45.070> that<00:00:45.370> people<00:00:46.239> with

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
worth remembering that people with

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.569 
worth remembering that people with
higher<00:00:46.629> voices<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.499> your<00:00:47.710> your<00:00:48.010> Sopranos

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
higher voices so your your Sopranos

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.130 
higher voices so your your Sopranos
perhaps<00:00:49.710> people<00:00:50.710> tend<00:00:50.949> to<00:00:51.100> arrange<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.480> choir

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
perhaps people tend to arrange a choir

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.639 
perhaps people tend to arrange a choir
in<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:54.159> nice<00:00:54.339> visual<00:00:54.879> way<00:00:55.319> remember<00:00:56.319> the<00:00:56.409> higher

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
in a nice visual way remember the higher

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.520 
in a nice visual way remember the higher
frequencies<00:00:57.370> carry<00:00:57.879> much<00:00:58.749> much<00:00:59.050> better<00:00:59.319> than

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
frequencies carry much much better than

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.349 
frequencies carry much much better than
lower<00:00:59.920> frequencies<00:01:00.729> so<00:01:00.909> you<00:01:00.999> might<00:01:01.149> want<00:01:01.329> to

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
lower frequencies so you might want to

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.350 
lower frequencies so you might want to
put<00:01:01.569> the<00:01:01.839> higher<00:01:02.620> voices<00:01:03.129> more<00:01:03.819> towards<00:01:04.210> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
put the higher voices more towards the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.240 
put the higher voices more towards the
back<00:01:04.570> or<00:01:04.840> towards<00:01:05.200> the<00:01:05.410> side<00:01:05.650> of<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.980> group

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
back or towards the side of the group

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.160 
back or towards the side of the group
because<00:01:06.910> they're<00:01:07.180> going<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.420> cut<00:01:07.630> through<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
because they're going to cut through and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.560 
because they're going to cut through and
the<00:01:08.230> people<00:01:08.560> with<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.740> lower<00:01:08.950> voices<00:01:09.570> perhaps

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
the people with the lower voices perhaps

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.020 
the people with the lower voices perhaps
you'll<00:01:11.020> want<00:01:11.080> that<00:01:11.440> that<00:01:11.740> extra<00:01:12.280> volume<00:01:12.430> push

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
you'll want that that extra volume push

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.940 
you'll want that that extra volume push
from<00:01:13.510> them<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.930> be<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.080> bit<00:01:14.260> closer<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.830> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
from them to be a bit closer to the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.760 
from them to be a bit closer to the
audience<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:17.140> bear<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.380> mind<00:01:17.650> the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
audience so do bear in mind the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.280 
audience so do bear in mind the
positioning<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.730> voices<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.480> as<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.110> do

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
positioning of the voices and as you do

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.750 
positioning of the voices and as you do
that<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.650> don't<00:01:20.740> just<00:01:21.010> do<00:01:21.160> it<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.550> looks

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
that and don't just do it so it looks

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.640 
that and don't just do it so it looks
good<00:01:21.970> think<00:01:22.240> about<00:01:22.360> how<00:01:22.810> it's<00:01:22.990> going<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.380> sound

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
good think about how it's going to sound

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.870 
good think about how it's going to sound
as<00:01:24.070> well<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:25.600> once<00:01:26.080> you've<00:01:26.290> got<00:01:26.500> on<00:01:26.710> one<00:01:27.460> sound

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
as well so once you've got on one sound

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.940 
as well so once you've got on one sound
that<00:01:28.240> everybody<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.690> singing<00:01:29.020> hopefully<00:01:29.830> in

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
that everybody is singing hopefully in

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.130 
that everybody is singing hopefully in
tune<00:01:30.190> with<00:01:30.340> each<00:01:30.520> other<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.030> together<00:01:31.270> then

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
tune with each other and together then

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.840 
tune with each other and together then
start<00:01:32.350> playing<00:01:32.770> with<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.130> volumes<00:01:33.580> of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
start playing with the volumes of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.990 
start playing with the volumes of
different<00:01:33.970> voices<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.560> I've<00:01:36.160> seen<00:01:36.490> one<00:01:36.730> note

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
different voices so I've seen one note

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.160 
different voices so I've seen one note
hold<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.410> then<00:01:39.220> as<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:40.060> conductor<00:01:40.750> just

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
hold it and then as a conductor just

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.920 
hold it and then as a conductor just
stand<00:01:41.470> at<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.650> front<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.420> point<00:01:43.420> at<00:01:43.570> people

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
stand at the front and point at people

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.570 
stand at the front and point at people
and<00:01:44.170> lift<00:01:44.470> your<00:01:44.650> hand<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.070> raise<00:01:45.220> your<00:01:45.370> hand

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
and lift your hand and raise your hand

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.160 
and lift your hand and raise your hand
to<00:01:45.700> get<00:01:45.850> them<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.090> be<00:01:46.210> either<00:01:46.390> be<00:01:46.510> louder<00:01:46.810> or

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
to get them to be either be louder or

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.930 
to get them to be either be louder or
quieter<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:48.160> if<00:01:48.370> they're<00:01:48.520> running<00:01:48.640> out<00:01:48.880> of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
quieter and if they're running out of

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.400 
quieter and if they're running out of
breath<00:01:49.210> through<00:01:49.510> this<00:01:49.660> process<00:01:50.110> then<00:01:50.320> they

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
breath through this process then they

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.410 
breath through this process then they
just<00:01:50.590> stop<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.340> start<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.670> note<00:01:51.880> again<00:01:52.210> so

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
just stop and start the note again so

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.450 
just stop and start the note again so
you've<00:01:52.540> got<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.660> constant<00:01:53.230> sound<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:54.310> can

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
you've got a constant sound and you can

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.700 
you've got a constant sound and you can
start<00:01:54.700> playing<00:01:54.790> with<00:01:55.120> people's<00:01:55.450> voices

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
start playing with people's voices

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.600 
start playing with people's voices
there's<00:01:56.710> bound<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.010> be<00:01:57.070> one<00:01:57.190> or<00:01:57.460> two<00:01:57.490> people

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
there's bound to be one or two people

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.790 
there's bound to be one or two people
that<00:01:58.090> just<00:01:58.360> kind<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.690> really<00:01:59.320> crack<00:01:59.560> out<00:01:59.770> a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
that just kind of really crack out a

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.270 
that just kind of really crack out a
massively<00:02:00.430> loud<00:02:00.910> sound<00:02:01.360> which<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.080> great<00:02:02.280> but

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
massively loud sound which is great but

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.640 
massively loud sound which is great but
it<00:02:03.430> might<00:02:03.670> just<00:02:04.000> be<00:02:04.090> kind<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.540> pushing<00:02:05.020> pushing

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
it might just be kind of pushing pushing

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.350 
it might just be kind of pushing pushing
the<00:02:05.890> sound<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.250> little<00:02:06.340> bit<00:02:06.580> too<00:02:06.760> far<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.180> might

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
the sound a little bit too far you might

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.630 
the sound a little bit too far you might
need<00:02:07.510> in<00:02:07.660> to<00:02:07.840> quieten<00:02:08.229> down<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.829> also<00:02:09.280> by

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
need in to quieten down and also by

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.770 
need in to quieten down and also by
conducting<00:02:10.149> at<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.329> front<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.659> might

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
conducting at the front you might

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.970 
conducting at the front you might
encourage<00:02:11.140> those<00:02:11.349> they're<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.769> bit

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
encourage those they're a little bit

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.340 
encourage those they're a little bit
quieter<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:13.299> to<00:02:13.450> raise<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.840> volume<00:02:13.959> and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
quieter just to raise the volume and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.920 
quieter just to raise the volume and
to<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.130> good<00:02:15.820> blend<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> rest<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
to be a good blend with the rest of the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.470 
to be a good blend with the rest of the
group<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> once<00:02:18.490> you've<00:02:18.670> got<00:02:18.820> your<00:02:18.850> blend<00:02:19.270> and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
group so once you've got your blend and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.090 
group so once you've got your blend and
everybody<00:02:19.810> knows<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.320> kind<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.680> volumes

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
everybody knows that the kind of volumes

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.950 
everybody knows that the kind of volumes
that<00:02:21.280> work<00:02:21.550> best<00:02:21.850> with<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> group<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.840> it's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
that work best with a group and it's

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.810 
that work best with a group and it's
worth<00:02:23.110> spending<00:02:23.410> quite<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.100> considerable

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
worth spending quite a considerable

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.090 
worth spending quite a considerable
amount<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.150> time<00:02:25.210> on<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:26.710> start

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
amount of time on that then start

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.940 
amount of time on that then start
thinking<00:02:27.520> about<00:02:27.640> how<00:02:28.480> your<00:02:28.750> voice<00:02:28.990> how<00:02:29.770> your

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
thinking about how your voice how your

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.220 
thinking about how your voice how your
voices<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.880> start<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.420> sound<00:02:31.690> good<00:02:31.960> together

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
voices can start to sound good together

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.370 
voices can start to sound good together
in<00:02:32.590> terms<00:02:32.740> of<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> timing<00:02:33.570> now<00:02:34.570> when<00:02:35.260> you've

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
in terms of the timing now when you've

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.320 
in terms of the timing now when you've
got<00:02:35.470> multiple<00:02:35.680> voices<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.700> chance<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:37.120> people

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
got multiple voices the chance of people

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.930 
got multiple voices the chance of people
hitting<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.530> notes<00:02:38.800> really<00:02:39.640> really

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
hitting the notes really really

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.450 
hitting the notes really really
accurately<00:02:40.570> in<00:02:40.780> terms<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.170> timing<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:42.070> quite

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
accurately in terms of timing is quite

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.620 
accurately in terms of timing is quite
remote<00:02:42.820> there's<00:02:43.060> always<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> be<00:02:43.540> a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
remote there's always going to be a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.870 
remote there's always going to be a
little<00:02:43.960> bit<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.290> them<00:02:44.590> sort<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.010> cross<00:02:45.700> over

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
little bit of them sort of cross over

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.670 
little bit of them sort of cross over
one<00:02:46.180> person<00:02:46.420> starting<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.110> fraction<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.590> a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
one person starting a fraction of a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.230 
one person starting a fraction of a
second<00:02:48.100> sooner<00:02:48.490> than<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.850> other<00:02:49.000> or

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
second sooner than the other or

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.110 
second sooner than the other or
finishing<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.190> practice<00:02:51.190> getting<00:02:51.430> tighter<00:02:51.850> in

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
finishing so practice getting tighter in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.610 
finishing so practice getting tighter in
that<00:02:52.300> sense<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:52.810> pick<00:02:52.990> a<00:02:53.020> song<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.530> you're

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
that sense so pick a song that you're

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.420 
that sense so pick a song that you're
working<00:02:53.860> with<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:55.140> actually<00:02:56.140> use<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.770> rhythm

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
working with and actually use the rhythm

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.300 
working with and actually use the rhythm
exercise<00:02:57.940> which<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.630> explained<00:02:59.020> in<00:02:59.290> one<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
exercise which I explained in one of the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.870 
exercise which I explained in one of the
previous<00:03:00.490> videos<00:03:01.060> which<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.690> bib<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:03.190> get

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
previous videos which is bib so get

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.030 
previous videos which is bib so get
people<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.360> replace<00:03:04.600> every<00:03:05.230> notes<00:03:05.620> that<00:03:05.920> they

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
people to replace every notes that they

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.570 
people to replace every notes that they
sing<00:03:06.340> every<00:03:06.790> syllable<00:03:07.180> with<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> sound<00:03:08.260> bib<00:03:08.680> and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
sing every syllable with a sound bib and

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.830 
sing every syllable with a sound bib and
when<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.820> do<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.180> with<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> group<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
when you do that with a group and a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.890 
when you do that with a group and a
choir<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:12.190> notice<00:03:12.580> straightaway<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.720> there

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
choir you notice straightaway if there

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.690 
choir you notice straightaway if there
are<00:03:13.990> any<00:03:14.140> timing<00:03:14.440> issues<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.100> if<00:03:15.190> people<00:03:15.400> are

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
are any timing issues and if people are

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700 
are any timing issues and if people are
suddenly<00:03:15.940> sort<00:03:16.330> of<00:03:16.390> singing<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.870> out<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.440> time

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
suddenly sort of singing it out of time

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.040 
suddenly sort of singing it out of time
from<00:03:17.950> each<00:03:18.130> other<00:03:18.400> or<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.540> not<00:03:19.720> quite

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
from each other or you know not quite

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.810 
from each other or you know not quite
coming<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.710> right<00:03:20.890> places<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.490> makes<00:03:21.700> it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
coming in the right places it makes it

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.240 
coming in the right places it makes it
all<00:03:21.940> very<00:03:22.120> clinical<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.230> very<00:03:23.440> easy<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:24.010> read

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
all very clinical and very easy to read

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.990 
all very clinical and very easy to read
and<00:03:24.490> pick<00:03:25.210> up<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.450> mistakes<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:27.550> other<00:03:27.670> thing

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
and pick up the mistakes the other thing

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.810 
and pick up the mistakes the other thing
that<00:03:28.030> helps<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.750> choir<00:03:29.530> blend<00:03:30.130> with<00:03:30.430> each<00:03:30.550> other

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
that helps a choir blend with each other

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.290 
that helps a choir blend with each other
is<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.720> sense<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.320> vibration<00:03:33.070> now<00:03:33.670> we're<00:03:33.970> making

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
is a sense of vibration now we're making

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.800 
is a sense of vibration now we're making
a<00:03:34.390> sound<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.530> sound<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.280> vibration<00:03:37.270> of

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
a sound and that sound is a vibration of

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.810 
a sound and that sound is a vibration of
air<00:03:37.990> so<00:03:38.380> collectively<00:03:38.980> we're<00:03:39.310> just<00:03:39.490> making

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
air so collectively we're just making

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.150 
air so collectively we're just making
one<00:03:39.850> big<00:03:40.360> vibration<00:03:41.140> as<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.320> group<00:03:41.620> or<00:03:42.010> as<00:03:42.040> a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
one big vibration as a group or as a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.600 
one big vibration as a group or as a
choir<00:03:42.540> now<00:03:43.540> our<00:03:44.050> ears<00:03:44.680> aren't<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.370> only

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
choir now our ears aren't the only

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.720 
choir now our ears aren't the only
things<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.840> pick<00:03:47.200> up<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:48.130> sound<00:03:48.490> and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
things that can pick up that sound and

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.820 
things that can pick up that sound and
that<00:03:48.850> vibration<00:03:49.060> we<00:03:49.960> can<00:03:50.110> pick<00:03:50.320> that<00:03:50.440> up<00:03:50.500> from

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
that vibration we can pick that up from

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.370 
that vibration we can pick that up from
each<00:03:51.040> other<00:03:51.280> as<00:03:51.490> well<00:03:51.730> in<00:03:52.060> terms<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.570> feeling

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
each other as well in terms of feeling

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.440 
each other as well in terms of feeling
so<00:03:54.310> encourage<00:03:55.150> your<00:03:55.870> group<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:57.490> stand<00:03:58.090> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
so encourage your group to stand and

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.870 
so encourage your group to stand and
place<00:03:59.080> their<00:03:59.410> hands<00:03:59.980> on<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.400> top<00:04:00.610> of<00:04:00.760> each

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
place their hands on the top of each

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.410 
place their hands on the top of each
other's<00:04:01.240> backs<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.310> literally<00:04:03.310> like<00:04:03.490> this<00:04:03.820> on

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
other's backs so literally like this on

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.470 
other's backs so literally like this on
each<00:04:04.780> other<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:05.320> as<00:04:06.190> they<00:04:06.460> sing<00:04:06.850> they<00:04:07.180> should

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
each other and as they sing they should

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.570 
each other and as they sing they should
be<00:04:07.630> looking<00:04:08.050> for<00:04:08.320> vibration<00:04:08.710> they<00:04:09.130> can<00:04:09.280> feel

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
be looking for vibration they can feel

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.020 
be looking for vibration they can feel
in<00:04:09.760> their<00:04:09.940> hand<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:11.470> as<00:04:12.250> I'm<00:04:12.430> talking<00:04:12.610> now<00:04:13.000> I

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
in their hand so as I'm talking now I

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.300 
in their hand so as I'm talking now I
can<00:04:13.330> feel<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.570> slight<00:04:13.900> vibration<00:04:14.110> there<00:04:14.770> so

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
can feel a slight vibration there so

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.620 
can feel a slight vibration there so
they're<00:04:15.460> feeling<00:04:15.640> they<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.030> each<00:04:16.180> other<00:04:16.450> so

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
they're feeling they on each other so

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.729 
they're feeling they on each other so
they'll<00:04:16.870> be<00:04:16.960> standing<00:04:17.410> there<00:04:17.560> with<00:04:17.680> their

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
they'll be standing there with their

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.460 
they'll be standing there with their
arms<00:04:17.799> out<00:04:18.220> on<00:04:18.670> each<00:04:19.000> other's<00:04:19.330> backs<00:04:20.049> now

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
arms out on each other's backs now

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.909 
arms out on each other's backs now
seeing<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.609> this<00:04:21.760> way<00:04:22.000> helps<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.720> ears<00:04:23.050> to

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
seeing in this way helps the ears to

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.950 
seeing in this way helps the ears to
kind<00:04:24.400> of<00:04:24.460> pick<00:04:24.729> up<00:04:24.910> what's<00:04:25.180> happening<00:04:25.270> but

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
kind of pick up what's happening but

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.870 
kind of pick up what's happening but
also<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:26.440> can<00:04:26.680> feel<00:04:27.070> the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
also you can feel the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.900 
also you can feel the
peaches<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.740> you're<00:04:29.740> soon<00:04:30.010> see<00:04:30.340> when<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.730> do

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
peaches and you're soon see when you do

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.030 
peaches and you're soon see when you do
this<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.420> people<00:04:31.750> become<00:04:32.290> slightly<00:04:32.830> more

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
this that people become slightly more

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.680 
this that people become slightly more
blended<00:04:33.640> because<00:04:33.850> they're<00:04:34.060> very<00:04:34.210> conscious

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
blended because they're very conscious

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.780 
blended because they're very conscious
then<00:04:35.140> of<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.800> vibrations<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.520> they're

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
then of the vibrations that they're

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.730 
then of the vibrations that they're
following<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.480> it<00:04:37.750> begins<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.290> sound<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.710> bit

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
following and it begins to sound a bit

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.180 
following and it begins to sound a bit
more<00:04:39.100> like<00:04:39.340> one<00:04:40.120> unit<00:04:40.570> as<00:04:41.050> opposed<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.650> lots<00:04:42.010> of

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
more like one unit as opposed to lots of

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.530 
more like one unit as opposed to lots of
solo<00:04:42.670> singers<00:04:43.150> all<00:04:43.480> trying<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.260> sing<00:04:44.470> at<00:04:44.590> once

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
solo singers all trying to sing at once

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.300 
solo singers all trying to sing at once
so<00:04:46.540> make<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.900> very<00:04:47.200> very<00:04:47.290> clear<00:04:47.500> as<00:04:47.950> well<00:04:48.100> to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
so make that very very clear as well to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.250 
so make that very very clear as well to
a<00:04:48.670> group<00:04:48.970> or<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.210> choir<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.540> we're<00:04:49.930> looking

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
a group or a choir that we're looking

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.180 
a group or a choir that we're looking
for<00:04:50.590> an<00:04:50.860> overall<00:04:51.400> sound<00:04:52.300> which<00:04:53.200> is<00:04:53.230> one<00:04:53.800> sound

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
for an overall sound which is one sound

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.540 
for an overall sound which is one sound
we're<00:04:55.030> not<00:04:55.180> looking<00:04:55.630> for<00:04:55.780> five<00:04:56.770> fantastic

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
we're not looking for five fantastic

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.760 
we're not looking for five fantastic

with the volumes play with the timing
and<00:05:07.750> begin<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.560> feel<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.860> vibrations<00:05:09.700> of<00:05:09.790> each

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
and begin to feel the vibrations of each

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.920 
and begin to feel the vibrations of each
other<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:11.140> actually<00:05:11.740> get<00:05:11.920> a<00:05:12.100> closer<00:05:12.490> a
