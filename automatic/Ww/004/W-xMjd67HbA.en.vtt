that's<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.220> work<00:03:07.280> with<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.910> could<00:03:08.600> work

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
that's going to work with it could work

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.440 
that's going to work with it could work
well<00:03:09.190> I'll<00:03:10.190> regardless<00:03:10.670> without<00:03:11.120> me<00:03:11.300> the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
ageless I don't know watch so like bendy

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.780 
ageless I don't know watch so like bendy
without<00:03:14.600> me<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.840> ageless<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.410> definitely<00:03:16.340> at

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
without me the ageless is definitely at

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.410 
without me the ageless is definitely at
fifty<00:03:17.269> cents<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.840> mean<00:03:18.850> at<00:03:19.850> fifty<00:03:20.150> cents<00:03:20.360> you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
fifty cents I mean at fifty cents you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.729 
fifty cents I mean at fifty cents you
can<00:03:20.450> buy<00:03:20.630> like<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.959> many<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.290> them<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.680> I'm

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
can buy like this many of them so I'm

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.020 
can buy like this many of them so I'm
guessing<00:03:21.950> it's<00:03:22.250> like<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> quarter<00:03:22.880> apiece
