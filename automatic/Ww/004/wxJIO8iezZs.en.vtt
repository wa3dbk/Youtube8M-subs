00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 asus zenfone 5 in my hands version for 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 there is no Chinese market 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.660
 googleplay and other google services but 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.759
 anyway the phone is interesting so i 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.590
 I will show it and tell about him what is in it 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.719
 so interesting well first of all 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.460
 asus is no longer any Chinese brand 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.949
 which came tomorrow tomorrow 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.250
 disappear this asus in the second it costs 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.920
 intel processor in the third phone costs 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.890
 very good in my opinion screen and angles 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.599
 review excellent brightness due to the eye on 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 the sun, too, everything is clearly visible 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.550
 his only flaw is he won't get out 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.980
 despite the fact that he is just and wait i'm not 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 I see points I have repeatedly said 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 I can show you closer 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 points can and see but the picture 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 very smooth and very so saturated in 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.160
 overall screen is cool yet this screen 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.920
 there is 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.870
 what is the name of the oleophobic coating then 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.340
 there is a finger that slides very well 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 unfortunately most chinese 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.770
 manufacturer brands do not use it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 cover or use cheap protective 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.979
 so there is no such buzz here 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.280
 very nice so well just fly on 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.470
 surfaces and there is still the possibility 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 work glove I can here over 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 nail does not produce electricity 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.009
 more precisely conducts but very, very bad 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.780
 here it will work special 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.119
 the mode must be turned on in normal mode 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.770
 does not work and if not they might think that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.590
 If you can work with gloves, you can 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.390
 work with anything here is a piece of paper on touch 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.740
 does not conduct electricity wiki not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.930
 working there that doesn't work doesn't work 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.110
 all that does not have its own capacity but 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.750
 look a piece of paper is thick enough 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.189
 I put it and you see it starts like this 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.070
 work that is even through this 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.170
 paper is a loss of capacity on the screen and 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.390
 if you put in here that's the finger 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.380
 see it works that is enough 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 fat stick out 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.390
 it will also work from the pros 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.579
 nice look to me here it is 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.240
 lower iridescent for example like 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.890
 buttons are also made the same 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.689
 generally nice appearance on my 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.880
 a glance and periodically comes out updating 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.599
 while it was tested it came out in my opinion two 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.120
 updates 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.380
 That's all that personally interested me in 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.380
 this phone is possible for you too 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.470
 interested in the rest of the screen 5 inches 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.430
 1280 to 720 resolution under the screen 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.519
 touch buttons 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.530
 back home and last run 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.440
 applications as you see here buttons 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.930
 there is no menu on top here 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.300
 sensors speaker speaker indicator 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.890
 event and camera all night for 2 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.170
 megapixel camera shoots bad 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.239
 I will not show the power button 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.730
 volume button 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.140
 both are located on the top right of the connector 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.739
 for headset connection 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.090
 bottom microusb and connector supports ttg 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.209
 and mic appearance like i already 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.640
 said i like don't like back 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.590
 surface she's some kind of brand camera 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.890
 here it is 8 megapixels me not 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.569
 impressed with the flash and but it's like 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.799
 such a big speaker probably some 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.980
 might think about actually dynamite 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.109
 settles down here it's just for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.640
 symmetry let's say so me and 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.650
 liked the battery life 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.600
 I did not conduct my standard tests but 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.380
 I can say that for days of work is not 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.090
 enough 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.280
 the back cover can be removed under it 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.930
 see a slightly removable battery 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.390
 more than 2000 milliampere hours 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.450
 two SIM slots for both micro and 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.609
 sdi support karshchik up to 6 4 gigabytes 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.109
 own drive 8 gigabyte 1 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.410
 gigabytes of ram and 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.480
 Intel z2560 dual core processor with 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.269
 16 gigahertz test frequency 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.780
 defined as a quad so all 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.420
 closed and even this cap here specifically 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.370
 this phone is not very easily removed 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.019
 I used special make-up 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.709
 plastic fixture for 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.750
 opening 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.620
 here look a little plastic covered 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.530
 so be careful 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.420
 And h can spoil the phone is not so 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.150
 the phone will look beautiful 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.629
 dsm2 sit and networks gps bluetooth white 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.269
 pine 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.989
 what else is there all this has everything works 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.260
 without complaints 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.150
 tests antutu version 5 1 gives out almost 23 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.879
 thousand points by modern standards 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.530
 honestly not enough on flavor 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.390
 more than 60 frames per second 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.030
 the phone is running android 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.699

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.650
 a lot of own applications that 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.220
 here it is possible firstly antivirus and 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.930
 antispam 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.180

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.820
 there is a lot of all that useful 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.229
 including a lot of chinese not or 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.630
 applications did not even understand what to do 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.070
 because all clean robots are understandable 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.199

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.850
 Chinese is no longer supplied 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.050
 except the phone itself 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.750

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.889
 so we are not interested and all this 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.430
 Here in such a box with 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.780

 photo quality is average macro good but 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.740
