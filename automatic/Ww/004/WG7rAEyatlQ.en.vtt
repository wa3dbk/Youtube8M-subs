let's<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:47.969> shoot<00:00:48.270> 4k<00:00:48.629> at<00:00:49.079> 24<00:00:49.620> frames<00:00:49.800> per

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
let's just shoot 4k at 24 frames per

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
let's just shoot 4k at 24 frames per
second<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:52.020> 23

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
second so I think it was I don't know 23

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.619 
second so I think it was I don't know 23
whatever<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.610> point<00:00:53.940> 9<00:00:54.149> something

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
whatever that is not point 9 something

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.010 
whatever that is not point 9 something
something<00:00:55.050> 24<00:00:55.920> frame<00:00:56.129> per<00:00:56.160> second<00:00:56.640> video<00:00:57.020> why

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
something 24 frame per second video why

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.020 
something 24 frame per second video why
did<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.289> choose<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.129> setting<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.850> rather

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
did I choose that setting and rather

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360 
did I choose that setting and rather
than<00:01:00.210> 30<00:01:00.629> frames<00:01:01.140> per<00:01:01.379> second<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
than 30 frames per second well because I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
than 30 frames per second well because I
kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.670> wanted<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.090> how<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.300> looks

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
kind of wanted to see how it looks

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.219 
kind of wanted to see how it looks
cinematic<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.060> since<00:01:06.060> most<00:01:06.360> movie<00:01:06.780> still<00:01:07.049> are

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
cinematic and since most movie still are

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
cinematic and since most movie still are
shot<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.680> 24<00:01:08.040> frames<00:01:08.220> per<00:01:08.580> second<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> wanted<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
shot in 24 frames per second I wanted to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.620 
shot in 24 frames per second I wanted to
see<00:01:09.479> how<00:01:09.689> did<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:09.990> plus<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> know

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
see how did it look plus you know I know

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
see how did it look plus you know I know
what<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> GoPro<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.799> you're<00:01:14.040> shooting<00:01:14.400> at<00:01:14.490> 24

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
what the GoPro if you're shooting at 24

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
what the GoPro if you're shooting at 24
frames<00:01:15.299> per<00:01:15.420> second<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.920> data<00:01:17.250> goes

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
frames per second then more data goes

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
frames per second then more data goes
into<00:01:18.030> each<00:01:18.180> frame<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> does<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.619> you're

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
into each frame than it does if you're

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.679 
into each frame than it does if you're
shooting<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.220> 30<00:01:20.549> frames<00:01:20.729> per<00:01:20.970> second<00:01:21.479> right

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
shooting at 30 frames per second right

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.719 
shooting at 30 frames per second right
it<00:01:21.930> actually<00:01:22.350> shoots<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.009> think<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> pretty

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it actually shoots I think the pretty

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
it actually shoots I think the pretty
sure<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.970> GoPro<00:01:24.299> does<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:25.320> stay<00:01:25.710> steady

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
sure the GoPro does and they stay steady

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
sure the GoPro does and they stay steady
rate<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.090> let's<00:01:27.390> say<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.780> 60<00:01:28.320> MiG's<00:01:28.860> per

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
rate like let's say it's 60 MiG's per

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.859 
rate like let's say it's 60 MiG's per
second<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.640> didn't<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> taking<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.509> 60

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
second I didn't want it taking that 60

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
second I didn't want it taking that 60
MiG's<00:01:31.049> per<00:01:31.170> second<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.770> cutting<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.729> into

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
MiG's per second and cutting it up into

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
MiG's per second and cutting it up into
smaller<00:01:33.659> chunks<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.470> each<00:01:34.590> frame<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.040> be

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
smaller chunks I want each frame to be

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
smaller chunks I want each frame to be
really<00:01:35.369> good<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.840> don't

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
really good now I don't know I don't

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
really good now I don't know I don't
know<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> data<00:01:37.619> rates<00:01:37.950> I've<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.369> really

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
know what the data rates I've not really

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
know what the data rates I've not really
gone<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.850> done<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.290> check<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
gone and done a check and see what the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.550

to edit some of the easiest edit video

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.960 
to edit some of the easiest edit video
and<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.840> felt<00:02:25.350> like<00:02:25.470> as<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.800> was<00:02:25.890> going<00:02:26.040> through<00:02:26.190> I

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
and I felt like as I was going through I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.510 
and I felt like as I was going through I
could<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.900> very<00:02:28.140> several<00:02:28.709> things<00:02:28.950> with<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
could do very several things with the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.610 
could do very several things with the
video<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:30.420> start<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.989> look<00:02:31.140> artificial

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
video and not start to look artificial

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.780 
video and not start to look artificial
and<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:32.850> not<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> say<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.569> totally

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
and I it's not to say that it's totally

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.120 
and I it's not to say that it's totally
unproblematic<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.060> mean<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.569> there<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:38.010> were

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
unproblematic I mean that there we were

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.830 
unproblematic I mean that there we were
in<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.340> get<00:02:38.520> some<00:02:38.670> sort<00:02:38.819> of<00:02:38.940> auto<00:02:39.239> mode<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
in I get some sort of auto mode the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.360 
in I get some sort of auto mode the
white<00:02:40.020> balance<00:02:40.290> was<00:02:40.590> changing<00:02:41.010> from<00:02:41.100> time<00:02:41.160> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
white balance was changing from time to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.120 
white balance was changing from time to
time<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.760> did<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.090> slice<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.660> dice

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
time so you did have to slice and dice

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.800 
time so you did have to slice and dice
and<00:02:44.130> do<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> little<00:02:44.430> bit<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.790> color<00:02:45.090> adjustment

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
and do a little bit of color adjustment

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.600 
and do a little bit of color adjustment
for<00:02:45.989> each<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:47.040> guess<00:02:48.110> bit<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.610> significant

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
for each I guess bit of significant

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.070 
for each I guess bit of significant
change<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.300> light<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:52.200> was<00:02:53.130> coming<00:02:53.220> into<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
change in light that was coming into the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.570 
change in light that was coming into the
into<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.200> camera<00:02:55.590> but<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
into the camera but you have to do that

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.880 
into the camera but you have to do that
with<00:02:56.670> almost<00:02:56.940> any<00:02:57.239> camera<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.530> set<00:02:58.769> to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
with almost any camera that is set to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.990 
with almost any camera that is set to
auto<00:02:59.040> white<00:02:59.370> balance

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
auto white balance

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.080 
auto white balance
I<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:01.200> cut<00:03:01.470> those<00:03:01.709> put<00:03:02.130> cross<00:03:02.370> dissolves

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
I just cut those put cross dissolves

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.120 
I just cut those put cross dissolves
into<00:03:03.360> them<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.050> they<00:03:04.170> didn't<00:03:04.500> happen<00:03:04.860> too

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
into them so that they didn't happen too

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.910 
into them so that they didn't happen too
quickly<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.319> thought<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.620> turned<00:03:07.769> out

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
quickly and and I thought it turned out

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.900 
quickly and and I thought it turned out
smashingly<00:03:08.850> good<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.560> steel<00:03:11.280> frames<00:03:11.670> I've

smashingly good the steel frames I've
taken<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.450> sharing<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:12.840> Facebook<00:03:13.220> some<00:03:14.220> of
