kick<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:18.380> in<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:19.590> opinion<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
kick and in my opinion is really the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.730 
kick and in my opinion is really the
best<00:00:20.570> proficiency<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.960> weapon<00:00:22.380> because

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
best proficiency for this weapon because

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.490 
best proficiency for this weapon because
this<00:00:22.949> rippln<00:00:23.250> really<00:00:23.609> has<00:00:23.820> an<00:00:24.510> inconsistent

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
this rippln really has an inconsistent

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.349 
this rippln really has an inconsistent
recoil<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.970> kick<00:00:27.539> tends<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.760> do<00:00:29.760> make

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
recoil so kick tends to you know do make

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.089 
recoil so kick tends to you know do make
that<00:00:30.599> better<00:00:30.810> obviously<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.009> just

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that better obviously because it's just

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.690 
that better obviously because it's just
kick<00:00:32.700> huh<00:00:33.180> yeah<00:00:34.050> captain<00:00:34.469> obvious<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.219> did<00:00:35.460> not

24 or five depending on the killstreak

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.180 
24 or five depending on the killstreak
your<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.370> package<00:04:52.060> so<00:04:52.270> are<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.539> using<00:04:53.190> but

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
your the package so are you using but

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.500 
your the package so are you using but
yeah<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:56.430> what<00:04:57.430> happens<00:04:57.759> with<00:04:57.880> a<00:04:57.940> specialist

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
yeah so what happens with a specialist

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.469 
yeah so what happens with a specialist
package<00:04:58.900> is<00:04:59.110> that<00:04:59.289> you<00:04:59.500> often<00:04:59.949> unlock<00:05:00.610> you

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
package is that you often unlock you

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.379 
package is that you often unlock you
often<00:05:01.870> but<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.139> always<00:05:02.590> unlock<00:05:03.550> hardline<00:05:04.090> and

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
often but you always unlock hardline and

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.260 
often but you always unlock hardline and
if<00:05:05.139> you<00:05:05.289> get<00:05:05.440> assists<00:05:06.130> with<00:05:06.400> art<00:05:06.639> line<00:05:06.910> like

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
if you get assists with art line like

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.390 
if you get assists with art line like
two<00:05:07.479> assists<00:05:08.020> are<00:05:08.139> going<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.530> count<00:05:08.740> as<00:05:08.979> a<00:05:09.010> kill

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
two assists are going to count as a kill

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.120 
two assists are going to count as a kill
towards<00:05:09.880> your<00:05:10.000> kill<00:05:10.300> streak<00:05:10.600> so<00:05:11.289> basically<00:05:12.010> I

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
towards your kill streak so basically I

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.710 
towards your kill streak so basically I
could<00:05:12.430> get<00:05:12.610> like<00:05:12.820> 22<00:05:13.330> kills<00:05:13.630> but<00:05:14.560> because<00:05:15.160> of

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
could get like 22 kills but because of

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.420 
could get like 22 kills but because of
hardline<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:16.750> could<00:05:17.050> actually<00:05:17.199> unlock<00:05:17.800> my<00:05:18.010> Moab

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
hardline I could actually unlock my Moab

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.950 
hardline I could actually unlock my Moab
so<00:05:19.349> hard<00:05:20.349> line<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.650> kind<00:05:20.860> of<00:05:20.949> useful<00:05:21.190> for<00:05:21.669> that

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
so hard line is kind of useful for that

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.650 
so hard line is kind of useful for that
also<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.770> specialist<00:05:24.639> package<00:05:25.090> is<00:05:25.240> fun<00:05:25.479> to

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
also the specialist package is fun to

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.420 
also the specialist package is fun to
use<00:05:25.840> because<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.349> can<00:05:26.500> actually<00:05:26.530> keep<00:05:27.070> a<00:05:27.220> hold

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
use because you can actually keep a hold

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.850 
use because you can actually keep a hold
of<00:05:27.759> your<00:05:27.970> score<00:05:28.330> if<00:05:28.539> you<00:05:28.720> want<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:29.590> know<00:05:29.680> I

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
of your score if you want to you know I

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.890 
of your score if you want to you know I
know<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:30.070> said<00:05:30.400> it's<00:05:30.580> not<00:05:30.729> you<00:05:31.389> know<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.720> best
