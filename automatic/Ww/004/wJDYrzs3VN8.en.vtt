you're<00:01:55.549> going<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.880> fold<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:57.020> top<00:01:57.349> down<00:01:57.709> into<00:01:58.670> a

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
you're going to fold the top down into a

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.889 
you're going to fold the top down into a
triangle<00:01:59.720> you're<00:02:00.319> folding<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.979> top<00:02:01.220> edge

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
triangle you're folding the top edge

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.469 
triangle you're folding the top edge
along<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:02.959> center<00:02:03.560> line<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.630> folding<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:07.479> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
along the center line and folding it the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.059 
along the center line and folding it the
next<00:02:08.840> step

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
next step

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.209 
next step
you<00:02:10.549> can<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.969> just<00:02:11.569> open<00:02:12.049> it<00:02:12.140> back<00:02:12.319> up<00:02:12.379> and

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.219 
you can see just open it back up and

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.369 
you can see just open it back up and
this<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.579> little<00:02:13.790> tricky<00:02:14.120> pulled<00:02:14.810> down<00:02:15.079> on

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
this is a little tricky pulled down on

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.099 
this is a little tricky pulled down on
the<00:02:15.469> center<00:02:16.459> point<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.359> squish<00:02:17.719> in<00:02:17.930> on

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
the center point and you squish in on

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.920 
the center point and you squish in on
the<00:02:18.260> sides<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.730> you'll<00:02:19.939> see<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:20.510> folds

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
the sides and you'll see that it folds

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.039 
the sides and you'll see that it folds
down<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.980> create<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.639> little<00:02:23.150> triangle<00:02:23.719> shape

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
down to create a little triangle shape

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.869 
down to create a little triangle shape
see<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.469> three<00:02:24.739> more<00:02:24.889> times<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.370> if<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.639> seems

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
see this three more times so if it seems

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.089 
see this three more times so if it seems
confusing<00:02:26.389> watch<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.500> other<00:02:27.590> three<00:02:27.859> times

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
confusing watch the other three times

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.770 
confusing watch the other three times
and<00:02:28.340> then<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.549> can<00:02:28.730> rewind<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.239> see<00:02:29.599> how<00:02:29.719> to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
and then you can rewind and see how to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.750 
and then you can rewind and see how to
do<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.409> when<00:02:30.739> you've<00:02:30.859> got<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.159> flat<00:02:31.430> you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
do it and when you've got it flat you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.610 
do it and when you've got it flat you
can<00:02:31.909> fold<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.209> little<00:02:32.420> triangle<00:02:32.870> back<00:02:32.989> up<00:02:33.170> so

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
can fold the little triangle back up so

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.819 
can fold the little triangle back up so
once<00:02:33.799> again<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.909> start<00:02:35.209> by<00:02:35.389> folding<00:02:35.659> the<00:02:36.530> left

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
once again you start by folding the left

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.330 
once again you start by folding the left
side<00:02:37.159> in<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.989> center<00:02:39.349> line<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.159> right

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
side in to the center line and the right

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.550 
side in to the center line and the right
side<00:02:40.579> into<00:02:40.939> the<00:02:41.060> center<00:02:41.359> line<00:02:41.569> make<00:02:42.349> these

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
side into the center line make these

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.199 
side into the center line make these
creases<00:02:42.829> nice<00:02:43.159> and<00:02:43.400> sharp<00:02:43.609> because<00:02:43.939> sharp

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
creases nice and sharp because sharp

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.349 
creases nice and sharp because sharp
creases<00:02:44.480> help<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.200> next<00:02:45.379> part<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.829> this<00:02:45.980> stage

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
creases help the next part of this stage

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.110 
creases help the next part of this stage
then<00:02:47.359> open<00:02:47.689> it<00:02:47.780> up<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.049> little<00:02:48.079> hold<00:02:49.040> down<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
then open it up a little hold down and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.849 
then open it up a little hold down and
squish<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.900> if<00:02:51.079> you<00:02:51.169> pull<00:02:51.439> down<00:02:51.620> and

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
squish it and if you pull down and

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.289 
squish it and if you pull down and
squish<00:02:52.129> it<00:02:52.159> at<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.459> same<00:02:52.669> time<00:02:52.909> you'll<00:02:53.120> see<00:02:53.180> it

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
squish it at the same time you'll see it

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.720 
squish it at the same time you'll see it
folds<00:02:53.840> right<00:02:54.019> down<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:55.189> then<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.519> want<00:02:55.699> to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
folds right down and then you want to

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.399 
folds right down and then you want to
fold<00:02:55.969> up<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.209> little<00:02:56.599> triangle<00:02:56.840> piece<00:02:57.230> that

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
fold up that little triangle piece that

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.379 
fold up that little triangle piece that
you<00:02:57.500> created<00:02:57.859> on<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.159> bottom<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.150> we're<00:02:59.299> gonna

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
you created on the bottom so we're gonna

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.979 
you created on the bottom so we're gonna
do<00:02:59.629> it<00:02:59.750> again<00:02:59.949> find<00:03:00.949> another<00:03:01.219> spot<00:03:01.719> I'll<00:03:02.719> fold

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
do it again find another spot I'll fold

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.699 
do it again find another spot I'll fold
down<00:03:03.199> the<00:03:03.409> side<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.819> center<00:03:05.180> line<00:03:05.709> fold

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
down the side to the center line fold

down the other side to the center line

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.319 
down the other side to the center line
then<00:03:09.980> you're<00:03:10.099> gonna<00:03:10.189> open<00:03:10.459> up<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.939> folds<00:03:11.299> that

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
then you're gonna open up the folds that

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.899 
then you're gonna open up the folds that
you<00:03:11.510> made<00:03:11.750> pull<00:03:12.620> gently<00:03:12.799> down<00:03:13.189> on<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.549> center

you made pull gently down on the center
you<00:03:14.349> squish<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.560> engine<00:03:16.069> it<00:03:17.000> just<00:03:17.239> flops<00:03:17.629> over

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
you squish the engine it just flops over

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.349 
you squish the engine it just flops over
and<00:03:18.379> folds<00:03:18.739> down<00:03:18.859> flat<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.879> then<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.120> put<00:03:20.329> a
