this<00:00:10.730> whitewater<00:00:11.240> climb<00:00:11.600> is<00:00:11.870> great<00:00:12.230> for

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
this whitewater climb is great for

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.620 
this whitewater climb is great for

turn this is an example of the basic
whitewater<00:00:20.600> climb<00:00:29.859> once<00:00:30.859> you've<00:00:31.130> mastered

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
whitewater climb once you've mastered

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.880 
whitewater climb once you've mastered
the<00:00:31.789> basic<00:00:32.180> whitewater<00:00:32.629> climb<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.559> can<00:00:33.739> then

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
the basic whitewater climb you can then

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.680 
the basic whitewater climb you can then
develop<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:34.430> turn<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:34.940> more<00:00:35.210> advanced

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
develop the turn to a more advanced

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.200 
develop the turn to a more advanced
level<00:00:35.809> by<00:00:36.559> adding<00:00:36.710> an<00:00:36.979> extra<00:00:37.100> turn<00:00:37.519> throw<00:00:37.909> at

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
level by adding an extra turn throw at
