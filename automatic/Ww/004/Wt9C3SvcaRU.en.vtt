00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.519
 good good I'm from books to read 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 and today what I bring you is a rap bird is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.089
 say where will I summarize the readings 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 of the month of April and in total have been 6 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.720
 so it's going to be a video I hope short 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.789
 the first novel I read was flower ay 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.710
 ulises the illuminated adventures of Kate 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.960
 and Camilo is published by the publisher 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 great journey and the truth is that as 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 all editions of youth novels 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 in juvenile plane adults and not juveniles 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.300
 It is full of illustrations and 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 Very nice details, however, it has 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.380
 it seemed that the novel was not the great 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.239
 yes, it is true that they are quick 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.129
 and yes it is true that it hooks you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.899
 slightly because it 's a story 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.579
 curious but I think he's missing a little 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.559
 of depth the truth and besides me 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
 I think the fact of having a squirrel 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.910
 it is worth having superpowers not 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 uses as much as I would have 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.180
 used but good that 's more 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.920
 subjective and nothing that from now on 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.090
 when I talk to you about books I'm not going to 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.949
 say some stars that I have put 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.750
 because I 'm going to put it here because if 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 no, it's like I repeat myself a thousand times 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.660
 here back floral is is the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.010
 new book by Alberto Espinoza 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.080
 published by the integral 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.490
 except it is the blue world loves your chaos and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.440
 I honestly did not know what to expect 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.420
 because the truth is that he is an author who 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.920
 I like it a lot but that it is true 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.860
 that there are certain things that are repeated 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.980
 a lot but with the blue world loves your chaos 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.420
 Alberto Espinoza has changed a lot 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.920
 with respect to his other novels he has created 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.050
 what is a story a little bit of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.460
 magical realism also to see a 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.860
 magical realism but you have that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 feeling like something there mysterious and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.430
 mystic I do not think it's pretty 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.320
 quite accomplished and in general it 's a 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.360
 novel as well as all of espinoza 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 that are read fast and that I just gave 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.260
 mind that I've been saying to see 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.479
 but Albert is said not because it is what 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.430
 they told me in the comments a lot 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.110
 Catalan people are worth it because it's alberto vale 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.940
 albert thorny then nothing that that in 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.850
 this novel I think albert albert 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.100
 thorny yes that changes his style a bit 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.050
 and it changes a bit because the things that go 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 doing so far and the story itself 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.100
 It is quite interesting enough 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.110
 Interestingly, honestly, I do not know 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.400
 I was waiting after I finally read I'm going to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.930
 Gray mobile tradition by David Levitte 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.580
 sun and jong item published by cloud of 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.500
 ink here in Spain apart from that the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.399
 cover is a little what has been 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 ugly 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.220
 worth the story is spectacular either or 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.290
 I did not like the part of John Green or 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.269
 it seemed to me a part without max is its 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.980
 character simply as I told you in the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.390
 tag of the hated is worth saying with 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.340
 diego I leave it where there is talk a 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.900
 little that I do not like the character of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 john grip but the weak character of 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.689
 view is amazing and the whole story 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.909
 that ride with tiny cooper is great 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.049
 or is it really the issues that the 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.120
 silver otherwise 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.220
 that is, it's great, I'll leave you 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.019
 all the reviews here below because 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.030
 is it worth seeing me as well as more 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.549
 quiet reading the chs ok ok but 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.849
 we go that ultra recommended and ximo ultra 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.950
 Commented rate later relay harry 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.480
 potter and the philosopher's stone of jk 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.220
 rowling published by salamandra in 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.510
 Spain 'center to fight challenges that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.189
 I'm doing with my boyfriend I had to 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.689
 reread a book so I decided it was 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.150
 the best time to read harry 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.500
 potter besides I started a project 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.329
 here in the channel that I leave you there 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.250
 also in case you want to see where 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.470
 I was counting a bit a phase of 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.819
 rereading talking about different things 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.829
 every day so I'm not going to tell you 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.819
 absolutely nothing of harry potter os 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.609
 I leave the video with the review 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.079
 Well, if you want the opinion, you can see it 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.749
 but come on, it's harry potter, it's worth 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.340
 be as good a king as the king told me 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:23.109
 I had liked it so much because I had to far 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.299
 me closer of weak of vision is a book 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.969
 that on several occasions I have commented that 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.010
 I would not have bought it for its price 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.750
 normal because I bought it in an offer 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.250
 but I think that in the end I would have 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.010
 finishing buying because it is so 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.810
 well also mark several things and in 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.639
 general would have marked more what happens 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.469
 is that I do not always have at hand my 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.879
 possible then they are not all 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.980
 marked but in general with my closer 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.750
 fulfills the function and is to present us 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.879
 from another point of view the life of 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.500
 tiny cooper told by him and told of 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.790
 a very special way because the 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.439
 novel is written as if it were the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.120
 script of the play and without hitting 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.859
 account you go deep into your life and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.359
 you know almost all the details 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.879
 rugged of his life and I think it's a 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.530
 very interesting way to talk to us about 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.129
 that character still and everything I think to live 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.400
 life 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.230
 I would need more books or more pages or 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.609
 more novels of these in ebook for 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.379
 talk about technical but because it is a 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.699
 character that can give a lot of himself 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.069
 and with this book the truth is that 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.690
 they see is confirmed as one of my 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.759
 favorite authors and look that I have not read 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.239
 so many of his books but his way of 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.009
 to write 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.479
 incredible and what I'm going to try to do is 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.120
 read a levi book every month 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.340
 sanz so I can read them all from a 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.810
 mode with fast last in April I read 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.979
 Berlin's dream is given to them and Javier 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.139
 pelegrin that is the anaya prize of 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.630
 This year's juvenile literature is about 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.210
 altars that I like a lot and that have 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.650
 written a novel a little bit loose in 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.349
 comparison with the other things that I 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.319
 I read you but I think that the fact 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.180
 treat obsessive-compulsive disorder 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.860
 from a point to see from two points of 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.509
 view is worth it because it goes from a girl who 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.039
 compulsive disorders has psycho and 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.780
 of the boy who falls in love with her and 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.280
 then let's say your relationship and we have 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.199
 interspersed chapters of one and the other 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.639
 therefore we are living the 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.349
 obsessive-compulsive disorder from the 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.580
 point of view of who suffers them and 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.710
 from the point of view of who 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.349
 suffers in another way because it really is 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.150
 something that we say costs to coexist with 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.889
 it because from the first moment she 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.110
 he does not want to tell him then he sees 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.060
 weird things but not knowing that she 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.710
 causes clear anxiety not to tell you in 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.449
 so that is quite complicated is 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.550
 a complicated situation and that the truth 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.810
 is that in a hundred and a few pages I think 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.240
 not 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.130
 to the importance that I have I would have 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.240
 given more pages on how good yes it is 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.310
 true that it is a novel of these that 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.930
 you take from the read in one afternoon and point and 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.730
 it has no more background but I think it is 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.220
 an issue that could have been addressed in a 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.630
 strongest mode but let me do this 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.800
 ok and this has been all for today I hope 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.150
 that you liked the video I remember you 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.680

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.460

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.110
 You can watch previous videos or videos 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.370

 stay and you like my videos
