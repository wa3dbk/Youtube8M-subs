understand be able to bounce back from

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.240 
understand be able to bounce back from
them<00:01:53.819> because<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.360> another<00:01:55.250> hopefully

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
them because we have another hopefully

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
them because we have another hopefully
another<00:01:56.460> great<00:01:56.759> season<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.330> being<00:01:57.869> able<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.140> be

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
another great season of being able to be

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.169 
another great season of being able to be
all<00:01:58.380> together<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.460> add<00:01:59.610> some<00:01:59.789> other<00:01:59.970> great

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
all together and add some other great

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.870 
all together and add some other great
pieces<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> puzzle<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.800> not<00:02:02.729> be

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
pieces to the to the puzzle and not be

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.490

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
able to have to go through those boxes

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
able to have to go through those boxes
again<00:02:05.429> because<00:02:06.000> we've<00:02:06.179> learned<00:02:06.420> from<00:02:06.600> them

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
again because we've learned from them

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.389 
again because we've learned from them
already<00:02:06.990> because<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.800> can't<00:02:08.009> take<00:02:08.220> them<00:02:08.369> back

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
already because you can't take them back

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.859 
already because you can't take them back
you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.940> only<00:02:09.060> learn<00:02:09.300> from<00:02:09.360> them<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.720> not

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you can only learn from them and not

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.090 
you can only learn from them and not
allow<00:02:10.080> them<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> happen<00:02:10.410> again<00:02:10.799> so<00:02:11.009> that's

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
allow them to happen again so that's

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.190 
allow them to happen again so that's
what<00:02:11.340> we<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> lot<00:02:13.049> of

our coaches trust us enough as a
defensive<00:02:38.459> line<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.910> move<00:02:39.090> around<00:02:39.239> have<00:02:40.200> a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
defensive line to move around have a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.080 
defensive line to move around have a
bunch<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.709> packages<00:02:41.459> where<00:02:41.640> we're<00:02:41.790> pretty

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
bunch of packages where we're pretty

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.310 
bunch of packages where we're pretty
much<00:02:42.269> interchangeable<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:43.019> all<00:02:43.170> our

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
much interchangeable in all our

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.080 
much interchangeable in all our
positions<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:43.950> really<00:02:44.579> there's<00:02:44.760> there's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
positions and really there's there's

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.699 
positions and really there's there's
sometimes<00:02:45.420> we're<00:02:45.810> we're<00:02:46.170> standing<00:02:46.500> up<00:02:46.560> like

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
sometimes we're we're standing up like

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.920 
sometimes we're we're standing up like
like<00:02:47.010> linebacker<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.480> never<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
like linebacker so you never have that

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.229 
like linebacker so you never have that
trust<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:49.410> our<00:02:49.620> coaches<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.579> have<00:02:51.060> that

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
trust from our coaches and and have that

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.599 
trust from our coaches and and have that
leeway<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.690> allows<00:02:52.019> teams<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.650> always<00:02:53.430> be

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
leeway it allows teams to always be

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.270 
leeway it allows teams to always be
guessing<00:02:53.850> what<00:02:54.150> we're<00:02:54.299> going<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.510> do

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
guessing what we're going to do

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.949 
guessing what we're going to do
which<00:02:55.610> gives<00:02:55.850> us<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.090> advantage<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
which gives us that advantage of the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.740 
which gives us that advantage of the
element<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.680> what's<00:02:58.069> coming<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.569> being

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
element of what's coming in and being

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.480 
element of what's coming in and being
able<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.140> have<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.350> on<00:03:00.590> our<00:03:00.709> side<00:03:00.980> instead<00:03:01.370> of

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
able to have that on our side instead of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.790 
able to have that on our side instead of
being<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.819> one<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.810> one<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.080> A<00:03:03.260> three<00:03:03.290> and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
being in one and a one and A three and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.910 
being in one and a one and A three and
then<00:03:03.980> a5<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.940> a7<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:05.690> being<00:03:06.590> able<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.830> be

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
then a5 and a7 and being able to be

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.650 
then a5 and a7 and being able to be
really<00:03:07.160> telegraphic<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.300> great<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.630> be

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
really telegraphic so it's great to be

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
really telegraphic so it's great to be
in<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.930> situation<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.770> have<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.550> trust

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
in that situation and have that trust

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.220 
in that situation and have that trust
from<00:03:10.850> our<00:03:11.030> coaches<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.420> we<00:03:11.540> can<00:03:11.690> continue<00:03:11.870> to

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
from our coaches and we can continue to

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.199 
from our coaches and we can continue to
feed<00:03:12.470> off<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.069> make<00:03:13.190> plays<00:03:13.370> but<00:03:13.970> if<00:03:14.090> you

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
feed off that and make plays but if you
