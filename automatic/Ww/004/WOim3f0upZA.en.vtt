anything like that and from my
experience<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.560> worked<00:00:31.769> quite<00:00:32.340> seamlessly

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
experience it worked quite seamlessly

thing<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.870> kind<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> weird<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.739> had<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
thing that kind of weird I had to

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.970 
thing that kind of weird I had to
restart<00:00:51.329> my<00:00:51.420> computer<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the Mac air it takes about 15 seconds so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
the Mac air it takes about 15 seconds so
it's<00:00:57.480> no<00:00:57.600> big<00:00:57.809> deal<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> restart<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it's no big deal so when you restart it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.910 
it's no big deal so when you restart it
software<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.090> installed<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.680> the

PlayBook is connected to the Mac and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.190 
PlayBook is connected to the Mac and
it's<00:01:05.189> seen<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.610> an<00:01:05.760> external<00:01:06.270> device<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.170> let's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it's seen as an external device so let's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
it's seen as an external device so let's
take<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> network<00:01:08.670> settings<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
take a look at the network settings on

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.770 
take a look at the network settings on
the<00:01:09.810> Mac<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.640> there<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.119> rim<00:01:12.420> device

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the Mac and there it is the rim device

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.380 
the Mac and there it is the rim device
so<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.860> written<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> plug<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
so what written when you plug in the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990 
so what written when you plug in the
device<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> PlayBook<00:01:16.860> through<00:01:17.729> your

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
device with the PlayBook through your

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.200 
device with the PlayBook through your
USB<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.229> PlayBook<00:01:19.619> gives<00:01:19.890> itself<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.520> IP

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
USB the PlayBook gives itself a IP

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.200 
USB the PlayBook gives itself a IP
address<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.280> allows<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.060> basically

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
address and this allows you to basically

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
address and this allows you to basically
move<00:01:24.720> files<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.619> forth<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.159> Mac

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
easy pretty intuitive so here in a

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.580 

so<00:01:58.050> unlike<00:01:58.440> using<00:01:59.040> an<00:01:59.250> iPod<00:01:59.670> where<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:01.320> have

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so unlike using an iPod where you have

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.990 
so unlike using an iPod where you have
more<00:02:02.220> or<00:02:02.280> less<00:02:02.370> have<00:02:02.730> to<00:02:02.850> use<00:02:04.550> well<00:02:05.550> at<00:02:05.790> least

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
more or less have to use well at least

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.160 
more or less have to use well at least
