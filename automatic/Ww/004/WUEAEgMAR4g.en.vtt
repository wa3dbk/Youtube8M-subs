00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220 

the<00:00:00.420> thing<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.199> due<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:02.959> friction<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.200> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
the thing I due to friction of the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.099 
the thing I due to friction of the
travel<00:00:04.920> power<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.420> and<00:00:06.420> I'll<00:00:06.540> do<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.899> all<00:00:07.080> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
travel power on and I'll do that all the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:17.630 
travel power on and I'll do that all the
way<00:00:07.230> around<00:00:13.429> and<00:00:14.429> then<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:15.299> need<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:17.520> other

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
way around and then I need the other

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.730 
way around and then I need the other
thing<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.140> touchable

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
thing you can use like this touchable

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.910 
thing you can use like this touchable
it's<00:00:20.520> hard<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.890> be

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it's hard to get out here is just to be

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.859 
it's hard to get out here is just to be
great<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.340> next<00:00:23.550> you're<00:00:23.760> like<00:00:23.939> deal<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
great but next you're like deal with the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.580 
great but next you're like deal with the
nursery<00:00:25.230> um<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.180> buy<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.990> knee<00:00:28.260> socks

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
nursery um you can buy like knee socks

nursery um you can buy like knee socks
and<00:00:29.099> cut<00:00:29.369> off<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> toes<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.439> work

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and cut off the toes and that they work

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
and cut off the toes and that they work
just<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:32.070> effectively<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.630> are

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
just as effectively so there are

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.220 
just as effectively so there are
abilities<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.590> them<00:00:35.750> but<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> material

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
abilities for them but with the material

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.490 
abilities for them but with the material

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
you get the effort random changes of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.020 
you get the effort random changes of
that<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> only<00:01:18.860> but<00:01:19.860> there's<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.250> ways<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that the only but there's two ways of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.440 
that the only but there's two ways of
doing<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.820> lot<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> its

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
doing this and it's just a lot of its

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.819 
doing this and it's just a lot of its
preference<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.110> how<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.380> cut<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:27.829> mostly

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
preference on how you cut it and mostly

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
preference on how you cut it and mostly
I<00:01:28.979> tens<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.329> long<00:01:30.509> enough<00:01:33.020> I'll<00:01:34.020> put

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I tens then if it's long enough I'll put

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.880 
I tens then if it's long enough I'll put
this<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.070> roll<00:01:35.310> them<00:01:36.229> back<00:01:37.229> like

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
this on and you just roll them back like

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.499 
this on and you just roll them back like
this<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.670> tape<00:01:38.909> duct<00:01:39.180> tape

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this and then I would tape duct tape

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.530 
this and then I would tape duct tape
either<00:01:40.350> way<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.880> some<00:01:42.060> reason<00:01:42.450> like

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
either way if it some reason like

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.060 
either way if it some reason like
sometimes<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:43.229> sure<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.710> end<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.890> using

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
sometimes I'm sure and I end up using

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.940 
sometimes I'm sure and I end up using
the<00:01:44.250> short<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.479> i<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:48.740> just<00:01:49.740> put

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the short one then i will just just put

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.150 
the short one then i will just just put
it<00:01:50.070> here

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:01.940 

and<00:01:53.160> fold<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.880> duct<00:02:00.120> tape<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.950> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and fold it down and duct tape that and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.250 
and fold it down and duct tape that and
then<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.280> very<00:02:02.640> helpful<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.750> say

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
then this is very helpful like you I say

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.750 
then this is very helpful like you I say
this<00:02:04.440> particular<00:02:04.800> horse<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.370> whenever<00:02:05.490> I
