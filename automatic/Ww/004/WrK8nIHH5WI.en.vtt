00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
maybe this will bring enough resources

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
maybe this will bring enough resources
back<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> team<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.990> keep<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
going so that was probably the biggest

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.800 
going so that was probably the biggest
sort<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> moment<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.280> me<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> worst

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
sort of moment I think for me the worst

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.069 
sort of moment I think for me the worst
moments<00:01:22.259> were<00:01:22.380> calling<00:01:23.009> Dean<00:01:23.219> after<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.850> race

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
moments were calling Dean after the race

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.569

every other year in in some ways you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.540 
every other year in in some ways you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
know I was sort of hoping at the

know I was sort of hoping at the
beginning<00:02:14.850> well<00:02:15.090> maybe<00:02:15.300> we'll<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.750> something

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
beginning well maybe we'll get something

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.520 
beginning well maybe we'll get something
in<00:02:16.260> it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
in it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.710 
in it
just<00:02:16.740> we<00:02:16.890> know<00:02:17.100> we've<00:02:17.340> got<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:18.030> budget<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.569> can

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
just we know we've got the budget we can

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.230

I've<00:02:21.420> always<00:02:21.720> enjoyed<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.160> pressure<00:02:23.430> of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I've always enjoyed the pressure of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.440 
I've always enjoyed the pressure of
having<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.950> take<00:02:26.030> what<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
having to take what you have and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.000 
having to take what you have and
maximize<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.000> through<00:02:30.000> strategy<00:02:31.010> through

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
maximize it and through strategy through

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.070 
maximize it and through strategy through
thinking<00:02:32.490> through<00:02:32.910> driving<00:02:33.270> aggressively

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
thinking through driving aggressively

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.010 
thinking through driving aggressively
knowing<00:02:34.980> when<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> back<00:02:35.610> off<00:02:35.880> but<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.750> still

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
knowing when to back off but but still

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.809 
knowing when to back off but but still
drive<00:02:37.260> aggressively<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.340> still<00:02:38.580> win

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
drive aggressively so you can still win

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.650 
drive aggressively so you can still win
and<00:02:39.060> perform<00:02:39.989> well<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.520> that's<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:41.760> been<00:02:42.090> my

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
and perform well so that's just been my

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.140 
and perform well so that's just been my
career<00:02:42.959> basically<00:02:43.860> I'd<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> little

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
career basically I'd like it a little

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.880 
career basically I'd like it a little
easier<00:02:45.510> sometimes<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.560> know<00:02:46.680> that's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
easier sometimes but you know that's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.290 
easier sometimes but you know that's
that's<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.580> way<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:48.150> first<00:02:49.019> met<00:02:49.260> Dean

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.990 
being able to work with the teams and
figuring<00:03:54.329> out<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:56.250> know<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.489> this<00:03:56.700> year

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
figuring out you know like this year

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.160 
figuring out you know like this year
like<00:03:57.209> we<00:03:57.510> were<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:57.900> through<00:03:58.109> a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
like we were going through a

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.229 
like we were going through a
championship<00:03:58.739> run<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.850> number<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.180> the

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
championship run and a number of the

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.140 
championship run and a number of the
guys<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.930> know<00:04:01.579> hadn't<00:04:02.579> been<00:04:02.730> through<00:04:03.000> that

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
guys you know hadn't been through that

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.210 
guys you know hadn't been through that
and<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.600> there's<00:04:04.320> ways<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.920> try<00:04:05.190> and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
and so there's ways that you try and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.949 
and so there's ways that you try and
work<00:04:05.519> with<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.850> team<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.420> keep<00:04:06.660> everyone

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
work with the team and keep everyone

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.960 
work with the team and keep everyone
focused<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.850> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
focused and and that and that and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.520 
focused and and that and that and
sometimes<00:04:09.359> it's<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.989> couple<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.320> words

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
sometimes it's just a couple of words

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.830 
sometimes it's just a couple of words
and<00:04:10.739> other<00:04:10.890> times<00:04:11.160> it's<00:04:11.489> it's<00:04:12.030> more<00:04:12.390> big

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
and other times it's it's more big

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.289 
and other times it's it's more big
strategy<00:04:13.200> stuff<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.040> big<00:04:14.280> picture<00:04:14.519> stuff<00:04:14.940> so

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
strategy stuff and big picture stuff so

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.560 
strategy stuff and big picture stuff so
I<00:04:15.590> think<00:04:16.590> that's<00:04:16.950> where<00:04:17.220> I've<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:18.000> learned

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
I think that's where I've really learned

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.800 
I think that's where I've really learned
the<00:04:18.690> most<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.890> know<00:04:20.269> how<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.329> work<00:04:21.600> with

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the most it's you know how to work with

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.510 
the most it's you know how to work with
the<00:04:21.930> team<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.380> how<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.620> do<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.280> get<00:04:23.460> to

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
the team and how to do that to get to

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.980 
the team and how to do that to get to
that<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:24.599> know<00:04:24.720> get<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.169> goal<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.409> think

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
that you know get to that goal I think

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.409 
that you know get to that goal I think
I<00:04:26.020> learned<00:04:26.400> learned<00:04:27.400> quite<00:04:27.729> a<00:04:27.789> bit<00:04:27.880> about<00:04:28.240> that

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
I learned learned quite a bit about that

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.050 
I learned learned quite a bit about that
this<00:04:28.720> year
