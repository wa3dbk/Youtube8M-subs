cubes in that picture I mean kind of a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
cubes in that picture I mean kind of a
little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.469> may<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.969> know

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
little bit right there may be but I know

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.250 
little bit right there may be but I know
anything<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.250> fastest<00:00:53.250> time

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
anything like so fastest time

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.020 
anything like so fastest time
blindfolded<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.410> also<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> picture<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
blindfolded I also got a picture of that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.740 
blindfolded I also got a picture of that
cube<00:00:57.710> my<00:00:58.710> camera<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.129> focus<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.699> go<00:00:59.820> um

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
cube my camera will focus there we go um

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
cube my camera will focus there we go um
and<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.199> was<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:02.070> records<00:01:02.460> been<00:01:02.609> broken

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and that was that records been broken

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.620 
and that was that records been broken
just<00:01:03.510> aren't<00:01:04.110> ya<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.920> mean<00:01:05.400> no<00:01:06.030> Arthas<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
just aren't ya so I mean no Arthas has a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.940 
just aren't ya so I mean no Arthas has a
better<00:01:06.840> official<00:01:07.260> time<00:01:07.439> than<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> oops

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
better official time than that oops

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.520 
better official time than that oops
cameras<00:01:08.549> moving<00:01:08.900> nobody<00:01:09.900> else<00:01:10.049> has<00:01:10.200> done<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
cameras moving nobody else has done that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.250 
cameras moving nobody else has done that
in<00:01:10.650> their<00:01:10.770> video<00:01:10.950> yet<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.610> his<00:01:12.150> fastest<00:01:12.869> time

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
in their video yet so his fastest time

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.399 
in their video yet so his fastest time
to<00:01:13.590> solve<00:01:13.890> five<00:01:14.640> Keys<00:01:14.970> one-handed<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.900> didn't

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to solve five Keys one-handed I didn't

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.719 
to solve five Keys one-handed I didn't
know<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> record<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.460> got

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
know that was a record but I also got

know that was a record but I also got
the<00:01:17.820> picture<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.450> cube<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.369> was

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the picture of that cube and that was

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.020 
the picture of that cube and that was
one<00:01:20.670> minute<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> 52<00:01:21.330> seconds<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
one minute and 52 seconds this is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.490 
one minute and 52 seconds this is
fastest<00:01:24.450> seven<00:01:24.720> by<00:01:24.780> seven<00:01:24.810> self<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
fastest seven by seven self now I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.249 
fastest seven by seven self now I
actually<00:01:25.770> met<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.909> guy<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> subway<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.480 
Christmas so that is awesome and then we
got<00:01:35.869> most<00:01:36.869> cube<00:01:37.140> solved<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.560> 24<00:01:37.979> hours<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
got most cube solved in 24 hours and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.719 
got most cube solved in 24 hours and
actually<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.659> recline<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.560> broke<00:01:41.189> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
actually I recline back broke this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.960 
actually I recline back broke this
record<00:01:42.210> since<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.439> book<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.790> they

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
record since this book was out so they

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
record since this book was out so they
really<00:01:45.210> should<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.450> done<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> reprint<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
really should have done a reprint of the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.960 
really should have done a reprint of the
book<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.100> could<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> picture<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.790> him

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
book so we could get a picture of him

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.990 
book so we could get a picture of him
and<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:49.290> 54.6<00:01:50.220> millimeter<00:01:50.549> Frank<00:01:50.820> she

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and the 54.6 millimeter Frank she

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.310 
and the 54.6 millimeter Frank she
because<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.329> don't<00:01:51.479> know<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.810> cube<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
because I don't know what that cube is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
because I don't know what that cube is
but<00:01:52.979> anyway<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> received<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.210> picture<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
but anyway I received a picture of that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
but anyway I received a picture of that
cube<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.470> Christmas<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
cube for Christmas and then here is the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
cube for Christmas and then here is the
largest<00:01:57.479> number<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> cubes<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.530> it's

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
largest number of cubes that I got it's

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.380 
largest number of cubes that I got it's
a<00:01:59.399> lot<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.149> cubes<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.500> uh<00:02:01.530> most

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
a lot of cubes here this is uh most

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.060 
a lot of cubes here this is uh most
blindfold<00:02:03.390> selves<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:03.960> did<00:02:04.200> forget<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> put

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
blindfold selves they did forget to put

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.670 
blindfold selves they did forget to put
in<00:02:05.219> one<00:02:05.759> hour<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.840> can't<00:02:07.380> removed

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
in one hour on here I can't removed

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.280 
in one hour on here I can't removed
again<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.750> that's<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.899> me<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.709> ok<00:02:11.280> so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
again and that's on me not on you ok so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.150 
again and that's on me not on you ok so
got<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.740> 53<00:02:15.160> minutes<00:02:15.459> 26<00:02:16.090> 529<00:02:16.690> cubes

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
got that in 53 minutes 26 529 cubes

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.199 
got that in 53 minutes 26 529 cubes
that's<00:02:18.160> been<00:02:18.430> broken<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.940> lot<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.470> such<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
that's been broken a lot and such so and

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.710 
that's been broken a lot and such so and
so<00:02:26.490> most<00:02:27.490> solves<00:02:27.850> on<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> unicycle<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.690> a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
so most solves on a unicycle this is a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.000 
so most solves on a unicycle this is a
record<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.140> would<00:02:29.260> actually<00:02:29.350> like<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> break

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
record I would actually like to break

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.390 
record I would actually like to break
but<00:02:30.340> anyway<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.850> got<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.209> picture<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:33.190> guy

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
but anyway I got the picture of that guy

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.500 
but anyway I got the picture of that guy
with<00:02:33.550> his<00:02:33.700> two<00:02:34.480> cubes<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.220> got<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.510> fastest

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
with his two cubes and we got a fastest

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.270 
with his two cubes and we got a fastest
time<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> solve<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.440> simultaneously

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
time to solve to simultaneously

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.430 
time to solve to simultaneously
underwater<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.959> got<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> picture<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
underwater and so I got a picture of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.020 
underwater and so I got a picture of
those<00:02:41.650> two<00:02:41.830> cubes<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.220> want<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.459> zoom<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:42.819> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
those two cubes I want to zoom in to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.240 
those two cubes I want to zoom in to
close<00:02:43.300> on<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.319> got<00:02:44.470> fastest<00:02:45.040> feed

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
close on that and we got fastest feed

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.370 
close on that and we got fastest feed
time<00:02:45.550> which<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.180> actually<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.870> really<00:02:47.080> old

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
time which is actually a really old

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.440 
time which is actually a really old
record<00:02:47.739> from<00:02:47.890> 2009<00:02:48.610> they<00:02:48.760> really<00:02:49.060> should<00:02:49.360> have

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
record from 2009 they really should have

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.750 
record from 2009 they really should have
had<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.750> new<00:02:49.870> one<00:02:50.019> in<00:02:50.200> here<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:51.220> anyway<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.550> got

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
had the new one in here but anyway I got

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.240 
had the new one in here but anyway I got
a<00:02:51.790> picture<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.750> guy's<00:02:53.350> feet<00:02:53.620> with<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
a picture of that guy's feet with the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.990 
a picture of that guy's feet with the
cube<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.300> that's<00:02:55.810> all<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.350> cubes<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.890> got<00:02:57.100> there

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
cube so that's all the cubes I got there

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.790 
cube so that's all the cubes I got there
and<00:02:58.209> then<00:02:58.780> up<00:02:59.050> here<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:01.330> got<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.200> more<00:03:02.380> another

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
and then up here I got some more another

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.610 
and then up here I got some more another
cube<00:03:03.220> which<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.269> three<00:03:04.750> by<00:03:04.870> three<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.290> it's

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
cube which is a three by three and it's

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.820 
cube which is a three by three and it's
a<00:03:06.090> picture<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.690> fastest<00:03:08.140> robot<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.620> solve

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
a picture of the fastest robot to solve

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.530 
a picture of the fastest robot to solve
a<00:03:08.920> cube<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:13.120> fastest

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
a cube and so that is a the fastest

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.030 
a cube and so that is a the fastest
robot<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.900> solve<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.170> cube<00:03:14.319> this<00:03:14.650> has<00:03:14.860> also

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
robot to solve the cube this has also

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800 
robot to solve the cube this has also
been<00:03:15.280> broken<00:03:15.610> since<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.630> got<00:03:16.780> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
been broken since then and I got a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.539 
been broken since then and I got a
little<00:03:16.959> thing<00:03:17.170> about<00:03:17.470> Matt's<00:03:17.709> lock<00:03:17.980> down<00:03:18.250> here

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
little thing about Matt's lock down here

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.810 
little thing about Matt's lock down here
so<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.420> also<00:03:20.110> got<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.620> little<00:03:20.950> print<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.519> Matt's

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
so I also got a little print of Matt's

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.880 
so I also got a little print of Matt's
fault<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.269> Christmas<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.320> is<00:03:23.470> all<00:03:23.709> of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
fault for Christmas so that is all of

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.130 
fault for Christmas so that is all of
the<00:03:24.010> cubes<00:03:24.280> i<00:03:24.430> got<00:03:24.579> for<00:03:24.790> christmas<00:03:25.049> thank<00:03:26.049> you

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
the cubes i got for christmas thank you

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.319 
the cubes i got for christmas thank you
so<00:03:26.440> very<00:03:26.470> much<00:03:26.769> for<00:03:26.950> watching<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.120> my
