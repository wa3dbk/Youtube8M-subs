00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
say that here which probably means him

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.219 
say that here which probably means him

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.100 
says but they do sell ah ha ha ha ha so
that<00:02:13.340> probably<00:02:13.880> now<00:02:14.600> I'm<00:02:14.630> not<00:02:14.810> gonna<00:02:14.930> say

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
that probably now I'm not gonna say

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.500 
that probably now I'm not gonna say
probably<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.769> maybe<00:02:16.150> confirms<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.299> we

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
probably that maybe confirms that we

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.590 
probably that maybe confirms that we
have<00:02:17.750> some<00:02:18.019> kind<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.440> undead<00:02:18.890> nightmare<00:02:19.600> dlc

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600

have some kind of undead nightmare dlc
for<00:02:21.410> GTA<00:02:21.680> 5<00:02:22.310> which<00:02:22.610> they<00:02:22.940> need<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:23.570> don't<00:02:23.900> know

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
for GTA 5 which they need I don't know

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.710 
for GTA 5 which they need I don't know
why<00:02:24.290> they<00:02:24.470> didn't<00:02:24.769> try<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:24.980> in<00:02:25.130> GTA<00:02:25.430> four<00:02:25.730> but

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
why they didn't try it in GTA four but

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.560 
why they didn't try it in GTA four but
that<00:02:26.989> that's<00:02:27.230> what<00:02:27.530> they<00:02:27.680> need<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.250> GTA<00:02:29.000> 5<00:02:29.299> so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
that that's what they need in GTA 5 so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.650 
that that's what they need in GTA 5 so
that<00:02:29.600> might<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.769> might<00:02:31.400> be<00:02:31.639> confirming<00:02:32.209> a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
that might be just might be confirming a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.379 
that might be just might be confirming a
undead<00:02:33.560> nightmare<00:02:33.799> dlc<00:02:34.489> for<00:02:35.090> grand<00:02:35.329> theft

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
auto 5 and y'all know

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.320 
auto 5 and y'all know
grand<00:02:36.930> theft<00:02:36.990> auto<00:02:37.260> 5<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.830> basically<00:02:38.640> GTA<00:02:39.030> 4

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
grand theft auto 5 is basically GTA 4

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.020 
grand theft auto 5 is basically GTA 4
all<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.750> three<00:02:39.960> episodes<00:02:40.560> will<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.550> episode

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
all the three episodes will to episode

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.510 
all the three episodes will to episode
24<00:02:42.390> not<00:02:42.510> counting<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.960> main<00:02:43.290> campaign<00:02:43.710> it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
24 not counting the main campaign it's

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.010 
24 not counting the main campaign it's
going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.630> going<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> be

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
going to be that but it's going to be

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.660 
going to be that but it's going to be
one<00:02:46.320> game<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.040> basically<00:02:47.220> three

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
one game so it's basically three

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.610 
one game so it's basically three
different<00:02:47.700> characters<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:49.170> game<00:02:49.410> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
different characters in one game and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.320 
different characters in one game and
these<00:02:49.830> three<00:02:50.100> characters<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.760> controlled

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
these three characters can be controlled

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.690 
these three characters can be controlled
so<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> way<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.770> think<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.250> as<00:02:53.400> it's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
so that's the way I think of it as it's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.850 
so that's the way I think of it as it's
three<00:02:54.060> different<00:02:54.180> stories<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.020> one<00:02:55.290> game<00:02:55.620> in

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
three different stories in one game in

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.580 
three different stories in one game in
which<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.150> basically<00:02:57.360> GTA<00:02:57.900> 4<00:02:58.260> and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
which it is so it's basically GTA 4 and

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.210 
which it is so it's basically GTA 4 and
the<00:02:59.490> DLCs<00:03:00.030> combined<00:03:00.720> into<00:03:01.290> one<00:03:01.320> game<00:03:01.950> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the DLCs combined into one game and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.360 
the DLCs combined into one game and
that's<00:03:02.340> Griffith<00:03:02.850> out<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.150> 5<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.470> DLC<00:03:05.100> that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
that's Griffith out of 5 so the DLC that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220 
that's Griffith out of 5 so the DLC that
they<00:03:05.520> bring<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.060> grand<00:03:06.270> theft<00:03:06.330> auto<00:03:06.630> 5<00:03:06.960> is

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
they bring for grand theft auto 5 is

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.170 
they bring for grand theft auto 5 is
either<00:03:07.380> gonna<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.800> another<00:03:08.130> stories<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:09.000> new
