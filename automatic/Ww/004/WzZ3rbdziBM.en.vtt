you know
20th<00:01:52.350> unsigned<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:52.979> always<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.250> good<00:01:53.370> idea<00:01:53.400> to

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
20th unsigned it's always a good idea to

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.510 
20th unsigned it's always a good idea to
try<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> start<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> first<00:01:55.070> see<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> were<00:01:56.340> run

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
try to start it first see if it were run

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.910 
try to start it first see if it were run
well<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> case<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.380> didn't<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.799> hook

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
well in this case I didn't have to hook

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.190 
well in this case I didn't have to hook
to<00:01:59.130> save<00:01:59.880> myself<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.300> lot<00:02:00.330> of<00:02:00.479> grief

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
to save myself a lot of grief

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.890 
to save myself a lot of grief
hopefully<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:02.890> just<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:03.189> face<00:02:03.580> uh<00:02:03.720> some<00:02:04.720> water

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
hopefully it's just a face uh some water

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.559 
hopefully it's just a face uh some water
in<00:02:05.229> space<00:02:06.270> clear<00:02:07.270> echoed<00:02:07.689> but<00:02:08.319> some

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.660 

so<00:02:10.719> my<00:02:10.840> gas<00:02:11.079> line<00:02:11.379> antifreeze<00:02:11.829> crap<00:02:12.159> it<00:02:12.430> gets

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
so my gas line antifreeze crap it gets

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.039 
so my gas line antifreeze crap it gets
water<00:02:12.909> out<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.390> be<00:02:13.480> done<00:02:13.629> with<00:02:13.689> it

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
water out and be done with it

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.510 
water out and be done with it
kiha

nicely

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
nicely

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:03.570 
nicely
you<00:03:56.709> can<00:03:56.889> backfire<00:03:57.370> off<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.700> man<00:03:57.879> but<00:03:58.180> anyway

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.800 

it's<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:04.720> what<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.410> but

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
it's it is what it is but

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.930 
it's it is what it is but
it<00:04:07.349> toads<00:04:07.709> pretty<00:04:08.040> good<00:04:08.250> except<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.730> fact

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
it toads pretty good except the fact

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.949 
it toads pretty good except the fact
that<00:04:09.030> couldn't<00:04:09.270> really<00:04:09.330> give<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.660> hold<00:04:09.810> on

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
that couldn't really give it hold on

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.449 
that couldn't really give it hold on
throttle<00:04:10.380> it's<00:04:10.500> torquey<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.950> bowls<00:04:11.160> pretty

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
throttle it's torquey it bowls pretty

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.790 
throttle it's torquey it bowls pretty
good<00:04:11.670> so<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.180> have<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.720> give<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> credit<00:04:13.140> no<00:04:13.440> truck

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
good so I have to give a credit no truck

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.680 
good so I have to give a credit no truck
pull<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.400> really<00:04:14.790> really<00:04:15.090> good<00:04:15.300> so

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
pull it's really really good so

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.900 
pull it's really really good so
whichever<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.919> monkeys<00:04:17.340> winds<00:04:17.760> up

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
whichever one of you monkeys winds up

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.190 
whichever one of you monkeys winds up
with<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.180> when<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.359> pull<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.630> wheel<00:04:18.780> lift<00:04:19.049> off

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
with it when I pull the wheel lift off

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.310 
with it when I pull the wheel lift off
of<00:04:19.230> it<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.739> know<00:04:20.639> I'm<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.359> fixed<00:04:21.780> carburetor

of it you know I'm a fixed carburetor

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.690 
of it you know I'm a fixed carburetor
and<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.590> guess<00:04:22.770> I'll<00:04:22.950> put<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.220> exhaust<00:04:23.430> system

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
and I guess I'll put the exhaust system

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.220 
and I guess I'll put the exhaust system
back<00:04:24.030> on

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
back on

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.110

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
probably a smart thing to do except over

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.090 
probably a smart thing to do except over
both<00:04:27.300> month<00:04:27.600> wears<00:04:27.810> off
