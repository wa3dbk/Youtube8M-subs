match<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.629> factor<00:00:54.989> they've<00:00:55.260> blown

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
match for the one factor they've blown

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.950 
match for the one factor they've blown
up<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> streak<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> fact<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.809> where

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
up the streak to the fact that where

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.479 
up the streak to the fact that where
it's<00:00:58.109> 20<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.530> 0<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:58.890> make<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> streets

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it's 20 and 0 and they make the streets

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's 20 and 0 and they make the streets
seem<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.539> match<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:01.230> important

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
seem like that match is more important

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939 
seem like that match is more important
than<00:01:01.829> any<00:01:02.039> sort<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:03.170> championship<00:01:04.170> match<00:01:04.409> or

than any sort of a championship match or
anything<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.820> almost<00:01:05.939> make<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
anything like that they almost make it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
anything like that they almost make it
seem<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.130> know

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
know fell through um I don't think

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.559 
know fell through um I don't think
energy<00:04:13.370> years<00:04:13.519> it'll<00:04:13.669> let<00:04:13.849> anybody<00:04:14.150> down<00:04:14.359> by

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
energy years it'll let anybody down by

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.420 
energy years it'll let anybody down by
that<00:04:14.720> but<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:14.930> think<00:04:15.019> Undertaker<00:04:15.859> was<00:04:16.099> mostly

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
that but I think Undertaker was mostly

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.979 
that but I think Undertaker was mostly
just<00:04:16.669> there<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.180> he<00:04:17.479> doesn't<00:04:17.810> live<00:04:17.959> in

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
just there and he doesn't live in

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.659 
just there and he doesn't live in
Nashville<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:19.310> know<00:04:19.400> hard<00:04:19.579> to

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
Nashville so it is you know hard to

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.190 
Nashville so it is you know hard to
think<00:04:19.849> that<00:04:20.000> he<00:04:20.120> wouldn't<00:04:20.449> be<00:04:20.599> going<00:04:20.630> there

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
think that he wouldn't be going there

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.040 
think that he wouldn't be going there
for<00:04:22.070> WB<00:04:22.610> event<00:04:22.940> but<00:04:23.090> i<00:04:23.150> think<00:04:23.360> he<00:04:23.450> was<00:04:23.659> there

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
for WB event but i think he was there

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.380 
for WB event but i think he was there
just<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:25.099> be<00:04:25.219> at<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.640> same<00:04:25.849> place<00:04:26.030> he<00:04:26.270> can

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
just to be at the same place he can

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.830 
just to be at the same place he can
touch

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229

know WrestleMania season and
WrestleMania<00:05:48.740> be<00:05:48.860> better<00:05:49.099> when<00:05:50.000> he<00:05:50.090> is<00:05:50.270> there

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
WrestleMania be better when he is there

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.560 
WrestleMania be better when he is there
so<00:05:51.410> I'm<00:05:51.950> hoping<00:05:52.280> forward<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.760> but<00:05:53.300> I'm<00:05:53.419> not

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
so I'm hoping forward to but I'm not

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.700 
so I'm hoping forward to but I'm not
betting<00:05:53.810> against<00:05:54.110> that<00:05:54.260> I'm<00:05:54.380> betting<00:05:54.590> we're

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
betting against that I'm betting we're

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.090 
betting against that I'm betting we're
gonna<00:05:54.830> see<00:05:55.070> him<00:05:55.160> at<00:05:55.280> WrestleMania<00:05:55.760> 29
