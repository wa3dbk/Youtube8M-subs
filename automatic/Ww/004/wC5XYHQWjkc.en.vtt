lot of people come to me like the video
get<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> design<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> kind<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.450> ya<00:00:33.899> get<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
get the design and kind of ya get the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.959 
get the design and kind of ya get the
the<00:00:35.489> elevator<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.250> people<00:00:38.460> who

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the elevator out there and to people who

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.470 
the elevator out there and to people who
was<00:00:39.570> wondering<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.200> didn't<00:00:40.559> copy<00:00:40.829> jail<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:42.329> was

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
was wondering I didn't copy jail it was

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.180 
was wondering I didn't copy jail it was
actually<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> design<00:00:44.040> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
actually just my way of the design you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.389 
actually just my way of the design you
can't<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.610> say<00:00:44.879> he<00:00:45.149> invented<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:46.289> idea<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
can't really say he invented the idea of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
can't really say he invented the idea of
having<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.820> pressure<00:00:48.059> plate<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.510> top<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.899> off

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
having a pressure plate on top it off

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.490 
having a pressure plate on top it off
offense<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.610> made<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.059> more<00:00:52.020> redstone

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
offense I just made a more redstone

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.740 
offense I just made a more redstone
light<00:00:52.949> design<00:00:53.430> an<00:00:53.610> easier<00:00:54.000> designed<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> make

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
light design an easier designed to make

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840 
light design an easier designed to make
but<00:00:55.050> his<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.500> course<00:00:56.250> different<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.730> many

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but his is of course different in many

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.790 
but his is of course different in many
ways<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.719> first<00:00:57.960> thing<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.530> want<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
ways so the first thing that I want to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
ways so the first thing that I want to
say<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> reason<00:00:59.670> why<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.000> design

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
say that is the reason why this design

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.889 
say that is the reason why this design
is<00:01:00.629> better<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.800> another<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:02.430> than<00:01:02.699> jl<00:01:03.420> says<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is better in another way than jl says is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.750 
is better in another way than jl says is
that<00:01:04.350> when<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> throw<00:01:05.159> an<00:01:05.280> ender<00:01:05.549> pearl

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that when you throw an ender pearl

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
that when you throw an ender pearl
through<00:01:06.060> water<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.659> loses<00:01:07.020> its<00:01:07.380> momentum

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
through water it loses its momentum

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.350 
through water it loses its momentum
which<00:01:08.070> means<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> can't<00:01:08.700> throw<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.150> high

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
which means you can't throw it as high

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
which means you can't throw it as high
as<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.470> throwing<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.010> pure

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
as if you're just throwing it at pure

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.600 
as if you're just throwing it at pure
air<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.350> some<00:01:13.350> people<00:01:13.619> ask<00:01:13.799> me<00:01:13.950> how<00:01:14.070> high<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
air and some people ask me how high can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.120 
air and some people ask me how high can
you<00:01:14.850> make<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.240> elevator<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> dance<00:01:16.890> what

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you make this elevator and dance what

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
you make this elevator and dance what
that<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.670> high<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.390> throw<00:01:18.659> an

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that is as high as you can throw an

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
that is as high as you can throw an
ender<00:01:19.200> pearl<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> highest<00:01:21.119> one

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
ender pearl this one is the highest one

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
ender pearl this one is the highest one
you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.479> make<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.930> 30<00:01:22.229> blocks<00:01:22.560> high<00:01:23.040> up

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you can make and it's 30 blocks high up

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
you can make and it's 30 blocks high up
to<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.150> pressure<00:01:24.689> plates<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> whips<00:01:25.530> are

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to this pressure plates and whips are

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.980 
to this pressure plates and whips are
broke<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
broke it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.370 
broke it
in<00:01:28.299> this<00:01:29.299> pressure<00:01:29.570> plate<00:01:29.810> has<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.170> be<00:01:30.259> you

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
in this pressure plate has to be you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.649 
in this pressure plate has to be you
30th<00:01:30.799> block<00:01:31.100> from<00:01:31.759> when<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.090> stand<00:01:32.390> right

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
30th block from when you stand right

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.860 
30th block from when you stand right
here

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.660 

and<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.770> one<00:01:36.920> thing<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.250> have<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.460> remember

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
and the one thing you have to remember

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.780 
and the one thing you have to remember
is<00:01:38.150> when<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.780> throw<00:01:38.990> an<00:01:39.080> ender<00:01:39.290> pearl<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:40.610> all

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
is when you throw an ender pearl it all

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.120 
is when you throw an ender pearl it all
the<00:01:40.970> matters<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.300> how<00:01:41.690> far<00:01:42.170> you've<00:01:42.440> thrown<00:01:42.860> it

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
the matters of how far you've thrown it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.630 
the matters of how far you've thrown it
or<00:01:43.340> how<00:01:43.550> high<00:01:44.000> your<00:01:44.210> phone<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.860> harder<00:01:46.610> to

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
or how high your phone it is harder to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.760 
or how high your phone it is harder to
aim<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.240> sometimes<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.810> might<00:01:47.960> fail<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:48.620> it

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
aim and sometimes you might fail if it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.010 
aim and sometimes you might fail if it
is<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.130> high<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.850> can<00:01:50.060> either<00:01:50.240> hit<00:01:50.690> this

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
is to this high you can either hit this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.020 
is to this high you can either hit this
or<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:51.410> can<00:01:51.530> hit<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.340> way<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.850> will

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
or you can hit on a way so you will

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.580 
or you can hit on a way so you will
actually<00:01:53.300> fall<00:01:53.510> down<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:53.960> die<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.140> your<00:01:54.380> death

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
actually fall down and die to your death

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.280 
actually fall down and die to your death
unless<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.100> have<00:01:55.250> feather<00:01:55.520> falling<00:01:55.790> boots

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
unless you have feather falling boots

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.750 
unless you have feather falling boots
you<00:01:57.290> actually<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:57.950> need<00:01:58.100> all<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.640> this

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
you actually don't need all of this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.270 
you actually don't need all of this
glass<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.330> had<00:01:59.570> here<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.080> was<00:02:00.200> just<00:02:00.410> something<00:02:00.650> I

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
glass I had here it was just something I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.010 
glass I had here it was just something I
added<00:02:01.850> for<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.090> looks<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.510> it<00:02:03.310> then<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.810> yeah

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
added for the looks of it then but yeah

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.470 
added for the looks of it then but yeah
you<00:02:06.500> can<00:02:06.530> make<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:06.980> up<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.280> 30<00:02:07.550> blocks<00:02:07.790> tall<00:02:08.240> a

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
you can make it up to 30 blocks tall a

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.090 
you can make it up to 30 blocks tall a
cool<00:02:08.810> tip<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.050> got<00:02:09.320> from<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.590> use<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.800> that

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
cool tip I got from a use of that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.950 
cool tip I got from a use of that
commented<00:02:10.490> on<00:02:10.610> my<00:02:10.670> last<00:02:10.970> year<00:02:11.240> with<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.750> if

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
commented on my last year with that if

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.780 
commented on my last year with that if
you're<00:02:12.380> actually<00:02:12.530> using<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.070> ghost<00:02:13.400> on<00:02:13.580> land

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
you're actually using the ghost on land

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.810 
you're actually using the ghost on land
as<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.210> part<00:02:14.780> that's<00:02:15.020> pushing<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.820> you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
as the part that's pushing you out you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.550 
as the part that's pushing you out you
can<00:02:16.940> actually<00:02:17.240> save<00:02:17.510> one<00:02:17.900> piece<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.320> redstone

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
can actually save one piece of redstone

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.110 
can actually save one piece of redstone
like<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:21.070> whoops<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.430> now<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.700> glitches<00:02:22.910> out

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
like that whoops and now it glitches out

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.660 
like that whoops and now it glitches out
that's<00:02:23.510> happened<00:02:23.870> sometime<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:25.490> reason

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's happened sometime and the reason

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.310 
that's happened sometime and the reason
for<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.060> when<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.450> power<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.960> piece<00:02:27.170> of

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
for this is when you power this piece of

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.930 
for this is when you power this piece of
redstone<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.830> actually<00:02:28.130> Powell<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.580> lamp

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
redstone you actually Powell this lamp

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.820 
redstone you actually Powell this lamp
which<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.660> also<00:02:29.870> sending<00:02:30.290> power<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
which is also sending power to the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.480 
which is also sending power to the
piston

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.670 

if<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:36.330> try<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.810> change<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.320> list<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
if you now try to change the list to a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.290 
if you now try to change the list to a
solid<00:02:38.100> block<00:02:38.190> that's<00:02:38.490> not<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> closed<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.120> lab

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
solid block that's not a closed in lab

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.400 
solid block that's not a closed in lab
it<00:02:39.690> doesn't<00:02:40.170> work<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.480> not<00:02:43.050> using<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
it doesn't work so if you not using the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.930 
it doesn't work so if you not using the
girls<00:02:43.620> room<00:02:43.740> lamp<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.160> will<00:02:44.280> need<00:02:44.430> two<00:02:44.670> pieces

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
girls room lamp you will need two pieces

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.500 
girls room lamp you will need two pieces
of<00:02:45.150> redstone<00:02:45.740> so<00:02:46.740> depending<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.610> what<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
of redstone so depending on what you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.240 
of redstone so depending on what you
want<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.720> use<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:49.230> course<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.590> glowstone<00:02:49.950> land

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
want to use of course a glowstone land

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.730 
want to use of course a glowstone land
is<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.520> lot<00:02:50.820> more<00:02:51.090> expensive<00:02:51.420> than<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.080> redstone

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
is a lot more expensive than a redstone

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.880 
is a lot more expensive than a redstone
torch<00:02:52.970> or<00:02:53.970> red<00:02:54.540> piece<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.960> richland<00:02:55.350> dust<00:02:55.590> so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
torch or red piece of richland dust so

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.090 
torch or red piece of richland dust so
it<00:02:56.070> all<00:02:56.190> matters<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.760> how<00:02:57.350> what<00:02:58.350> resource<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
it all matters on how what resource you

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.440 
it all matters on how what resource you
want<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.340> use<00:02:59.490> it<00:02:59.610> but<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.880> is<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.120> lightest

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
want to use it but this is the lightest

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.080 
want to use it but this is the lightest
the<00:03:01.290> sign<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.190> case<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.400> should<00:03:02.670> couldn't

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the sign so in case you should couldn't

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.080 
the sign so in case you should couldn't
