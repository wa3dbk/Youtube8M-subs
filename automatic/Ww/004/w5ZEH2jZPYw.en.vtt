00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 tripoli first field is cookies this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.369
 electricity stoves 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.809
 why do you need this cookie when you have it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.780
 earn you can sell it on 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.540
 different in-store improvements here 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.270
 here I do not know here such here such here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.129
 various improvements and plus on the construction 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.719
 different things that will naturally 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 give you more in cookies 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.110
 let's say I can buy a cursor 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.750
 cursor deer cursor to when you click on 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.280
 the cursor appears you a major communication 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.350
 here is this little cursor who 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 every second clicked for me they 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.019
 I'm staying here with the clique gets all the same 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.760
 cookies radioman seconds each of these 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.830
 cursors clicking here too it is also two 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.720
 books record cookies weave a cursor 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.210
 maybe for as many as you like 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.130
 then the next solution is there i can 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.700
 build this grandmothers who are different 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.100
 bake cookies i can put the farms 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.759
 different factories 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.290
 mines and mines and with cookies the plane from 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.509
 alchemy lab cookies with 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.080
 the reason the portal of the cookies in the car 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.030
 time with cookies and condenser 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.909
 antimatter anti-matter lines not present 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.130
 regrets don't know what's all 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.560
 this is displayed in response to the central 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.470
 minute with such a grandmother for here 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.130
 from depicted by the way pointing at Lena 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.950
 notice how many shelves they are 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.569
 produce for exactly 1 tip and 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.460
 that's burning about how much is here at all 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:59.140
 building either in this case grandmothers 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.580
 availability in total with 8 st1 grandmothers and 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.899
 how much they make cookies each 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.080
 second 666 million will not be heard 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.600
 there are no thousands and thousands and how many of them 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.420
 fired tass not fired already 142,000 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.670
 cookies can sell here i can and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.400
 produce 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.380
 Well, that does not make sense to sell it all 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.410
 did it useless too with you here 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.370
 here is the first factory 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.880
 ore say mine airplanes more precisely 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.060
 rocket science labs portal and even 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.910
 and time machines understand this one more and 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.870
 same mother listed 3d models too 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.700
 year shorter and in these improvements they are to us 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.459
 give an increase some advantages there 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.890
 let's say I do not know this is an improvement and 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.090
 it improves twice 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.890
 every every portal we get 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.430
 a cookie then two improves 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.750
 efficiency 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.200
 portals but also in various improvements and between 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.209
 by the way they become more expensive about deer olicity 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.980
 sometimes dice different deer appear either 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.350
 moreover, cookies do not click on residents 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.239
 which us our treasury cookies 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.019
 replenished by a very large enormous 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.840
 how much 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.280
 cosmos the number of their treatments so 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.410
 do it then not to yawn 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.600
 about the bonus for going ahead let's say 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.070
 such a better few write millions 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.459
 cookies give peace plus 5 percent 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.530
 increments all total cookies 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.540
 let's say now that's where i'm big 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.030
 cookies on business with hands now cookies 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.920
 it is generally a treasury cookie per second 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.720
 every second I get 4s gender 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.790
 million cookies if I add in five 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.799
 percent 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.569
 already four million six hundred sixty 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:48.310
 five thousand reasons when seconds 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:50.319
 the cursor is added here checks pieces too 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.060
 to fun actually after all and soups and 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.689
 do not appear all of the circles 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.590
 so go cookies well yes to school 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:02.200
 care of my life damn and there is still 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.220
 in the lower left corner there are still different 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.889
 which jokes you buy 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.150
 can get new kind of improvement 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:14.650
 that is, new and better open 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.959
 some extra unique 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.280
 cheap improvement one appears 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.500
 which helps you a lot to advance 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.710
 next let's say so raising your 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.599
 the level of the general well and basically everything here 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.039
 This is the essence and I understand that this game is she 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.800
 infinite and whether it can be played 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.190
 play like a bowl of whatever 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.080
 Kuzi 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.479
 already built on opportunity and everything 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.220
 the initiator of intimate hotel building is possible and 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.979
 the end will be again from well 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.690
 Achivku received . 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.380
 all built everything you can release with 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.630
 every new 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.880
 things that you build then settle 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.979
 often quite famous thousand miles a 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.900
 more precisely the time machine is now 54 million 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.490
 us every improvement when you have to give birth 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.430
 building is transport but let's say 1 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.620
 billion onemillion gives cookies 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.400
 about to condenser antimatter 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.580
 anti-matter about deer got nine hundred 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.650
 twenty eight million for ali deer 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.430
 buy with shorter here's the point 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.290
 I can run endlessly 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.330
 these cookies build build costs 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.040
 carelessness those who know him may have 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.400
 some end logical they already 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.880
 at the same time I listen to the radio there 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.950
 doing some work 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.530
 listen to this news and in general 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.940
 We play this game so to speak in short 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.810
 Killing is really very cool 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:51.260
 about cookies 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.670
 Well, it's time for us to turn it off 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.410
 dangerous for the psyche 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.870
 thank you all very much for your attention 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.090
 Andrew himself and try to play the look and
