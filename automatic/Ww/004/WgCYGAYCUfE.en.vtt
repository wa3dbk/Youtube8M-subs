00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello people I tell you today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.040
 little tutorial on how to get the fastest 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 and most effective in the pearls gets 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.690
 points xp and it carries no harm 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.650
 I have to talk to just 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.949
 put 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.350
 so that you are in the moment you have to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.300
 always stone with exactly this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.140
 fair high therefore four high towers believe 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.010
 to be hit by the powerful 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.810
 but you yourself can beat element 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.810
 can take a look 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.739
 not bad also need to have many 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.739
 guests use 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 Of course you can exaggerate, I do 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 but not me now because I have the video 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:11.659
 you want to have a short on everyone 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.659
 I will turn goes to die 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.259
 do not back up 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.420
 The last one is still to die 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:59.129
 there you already see four points and 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.649
 a lot to be changed so then you have to 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:03.319
 to come down again 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.399
 you do not see any harm from it 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.119
 and you collect everything 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.379
 that is clear and then come at the end 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.150
 take a look how many countries 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.250
 perelman I did I even here ever 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:20.390
 16er stack and 2 that is also shoes off 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.390
 yes that was it already 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.350
 well we do not even now only 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.050
 so for the trick you should always so 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.810
 You always have to use this endstand 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.070
 you should always be a diamond 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.570
 Here the quiet bad goes to 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.980
 quickly broken then you should and what 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.720
 I also say something about it 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.860
 it must happen that I in nrw 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.340
 teleported to the blog where you are right now 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.720
 stands 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.270
 that's all there is to it 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.200
 say so in vain is the trick good 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.430
