00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.980 

we're<00:00:13.790> machine<00:00:14.790> stripping<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.390> moment<00:00:15.810> so

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
we're machine stripping at the moment so

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.510 
we're machine stripping at the moment so
I<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.500> keep<00:00:16.650> my<00:00:16.710> arm<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.160> machines

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I have to keep my arm what machines

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.109 
I have to keep my arm what machines
doing<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:18.000> Casey<00:00:18.980> gets<00:00:19.980> near<00:00:20.189> any<00:00:20.339> significant

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
doing in Casey gets near any significant

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.580 
doing in Casey gets near any significant

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.800 

the<00:00:29.400> skill<00:00:29.670> involved<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.210> using<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the skill involved in using one of the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.220 
the skill involved in using one of the
machines<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.320> amazing<00:00:32.930> because<00:00:33.930> they've<00:00:34.080> got

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
machines is amazing because they've got

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.370 
machines is amazing because they've got
the<00:00:34.880> machine<00:00:35.880> into<00:00:36.180> archaeology<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.080> around

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the machine into archaeology and around

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.690 
the machine into archaeology and around
archaeology<00:00:37.980> without<00:00:38.220> actually<00:00:38.550> knowing

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
archaeology without actually knowing

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910 
archaeology without actually knowing
what<00:00:38.940> they're<00:00:39.090> looking<00:00:39.330> at<00:00:39.510> follow<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> series

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
what they're looking at follow a series

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.270 
what they're looking at follow a series
of<00:00:41.010> instructions<00:00:42.110> but<00:00:43.110> also<00:00:43.290> manage<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
of instructions but also manage the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.610 
of instructions but also manage the
material<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> machining<00:00:45.330> away<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.470> they

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
material the machining away so they

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
material the machining away so they
don't<00:00:46.770> block<00:00:47.100> themselves<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:47.940> run<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.270> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
don't block themselves in or run out of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
don't block themselves in or run out of
space<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> machine<00:00:52.770> driver<00:00:53.070> spends<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.580> lot<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
space the machine driver spends a lot of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.600 
space the machine driver spends a lot of
its<00:00:53.910> time<00:00:54.059> making<00:00:54.420> sure<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.660> machines<00:00:54.989> level

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
its time making sure the machines level

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.100 
its time making sure the machines level
so<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.790> moment<00:00:56.970> it's<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.660> clearing

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
so at the moment it's just clearing

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.350 
so at the moment it's just clearing
roads<00:00:58.230> tracks<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.769> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> stand<00:00:59.360> because

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
roads tracks are going to stand because

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.150 
roads tracks are going to stand because
the<00:01:00.420> machine<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:00.840> rotate<00:01:01.260> around<00:01:01.410> 360

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the machine will rotate around 360

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.850 
the machine will rotate around 360
degrees<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> arm<00:01:03.360> will<00:01:03.540> move<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:04.649> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
degrees and the arm will move up and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.999 
degrees and the arm will move up and
down<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:06.060> Machine<00:01:06.560> can't<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.800> anything

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
down and the Machine can't do anything

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.639 
down and the Machine can't do anything
other<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> level<00:01:08.940> itself<00:01:09.649> so

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
other than that the level itself so

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:11.780 
other than that the level itself so
they'll<00:01:10.830> spend<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> great<00:01:11.399> deal<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.610> time

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
they'll spend a great deal of time

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.040 
they'll spend a great deal of time
making<00:01:12.149> sure<00:01:12.180> they're<00:01:12.390> perfectly<00:01:12.780> flat

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
making sure they're perfectly flat

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.690 
making sure they're perfectly flat
before<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.680> start<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.100> pulling<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
before they start actually pulling the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.560 
before they start actually pulling the
soil<00:01:14.940> back

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.020 

a<00:01:22.720> big<00:01:23.720> area<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.140> we're<00:01:24.229> working<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.820> it<00:01:25.820> was

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
a big area that we're working in it was

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.890 
a big area that we're working in it was
cleared<00:01:26.300> in<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.510> 1930s<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:28.540> possibly<00:01:29.540> again

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
cleared in the 1930s and possibly again

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.620 
cleared in the 1930s and possibly again
in<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.140> 1950s<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.700> seems<00:01:31.970> they've<00:01:32.180> machined<00:01:32.510> a

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
in the 1950s it seems they've machined a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.960 
in the 1950s it seems they've machined a
great<00:01:32.840> big<00:01:33.050> Terrace<00:01:33.500> flat<00:01:34.190> terrace<00:01:34.610> into<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
great big Terrace flat terrace into the

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.120 
great big Terrace flat terrace into the
air<00:01:35.090> view<00:01:35.240> across<00:01:35.510> where<00:01:35.810> they're<00:01:35.960> looking

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
air view across where they're looking

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.260 
air view across where they're looking
before<00:01:37.130> they<00:01:37.400> built<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.640> Territorial<00:01:38.119> Army

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
before they built the Territorial Army

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.510 
before they built the Territorial Army
structures<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.080> were<00:01:39.170> here<00:01:39.350> before<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.400> I

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
structures that were here before and I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:52.640 
structures that were here before and I
think<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:41.240> was<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.390> 1950s

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.320 

just<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.370> bit<00:01:53.550> like<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.190> in<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:57.150> process

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
just a little bit like so in the process

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.180 
just a little bit like so in the process
of<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.870> machine<00:01:58.200> strip<00:01:58.620> over<00:01:59.490> 50<00:01:59.820> years<00:01:59.850> ago

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
of that machine strip over 50 years ago

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.630 
of that machine strip over 50 years ago
they've<00:02:02.190> actually<00:02:02.840> disturbed<00:02:03.840> or<00:02:04.640> completely

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
they've actually disturbed or completely

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.760 
they've actually disturbed or completely
removed<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.390> huge<00:02:06.990> amount<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.380> archaeology<00:02:08.040> the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
removed a huge amount of archaeology the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.740 
removed a huge amount of archaeology the
job<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.920> we've<00:02:11.100> got<00:02:11.340> today<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.480> try<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
job that we've got today is to try and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.010 
job that we've got today is to try and
strip<00:02:13.110> off<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:14.400> north<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> disturbance<00:02:15.270> so

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
strip off in north of the disturbance so

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.680 
strip off in north of the disturbance so
we<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.650> archaeology<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:18.330> try<00:02:18.660> not

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
we can see that archaeology but try not

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.900 
we can see that archaeology but try not
to<00:02:19.020> destroy<00:02:19.770> too<00:02:20.010> much<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> archaeology

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to destroy too much of the archaeology

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.140 
to destroy too much of the archaeology
in<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> process<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.020> quite<00:02:22.440> difficult

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
in the process it is quite difficult

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.520 
in the process it is quite difficult
just<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.210> little<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:25.280> now<00:02:26.870> I've<00:02:27.870> got

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
just a little bit there now I've got

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.460 
just a little bit there now I've got
another<00:02:29.490> person<00:02:29.940> helping<00:02:30.300> me<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.930> we're<00:02:31.230> going

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
another person helping me as we're going

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.890 
another person helping me as we're going
long<00:02:31.910> because<00:02:32.910> as<00:02:33.090> you'll<00:02:33.240> see<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.600> machine

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
long because as you'll see the machine

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.880 
long because as you'll see the machine
will<00:02:34.080> leave<00:02:34.290> bits<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.340> soil<00:02:35.580> behind<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:37.650> either

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
will leave bits of soil behind on either

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.380 
will leave bits of soil behind on either
side<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> book<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.790> if<00:02:38.910> pulling<00:02:39.209> back

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.820 
side of the book it as if pulling back
it's<00:02:39.660> not<00:02:39.840> possible<00:02:40.080> for<00:02:40.350> him<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.800> a

it's not possible for him to do a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.280 
it's not possible for him to do a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it as flat as possible now the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.860 
it as flat as possible now the
archaeology<00:02:47.520> isn't<00:02:47.730> necessarily<00:02:48.150> flat<00:02:48.600> on

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
archaeology isn't necessarily flat on

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.420 
archaeology isn't necessarily flat on
the<00:02:49.170> some<00:02:49.350> places<00:02:49.590> where<00:02:49.890> we've<00:02:50.010> already<00:02:50.130> seen

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the some places where we've already seen

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.060 
the some places where we've already seen
that<00:02:50.610> things<00:02:50.850> have<00:02:51.000> been<00:02:51.120> pushed<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.690> deeper

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
that things have been pushed in deeper

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.890 
that things have been pushed in deeper
probably<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.190> 1950s<00:02:53.820> when<00:02:54.720> they've<00:02:54.870> been

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
probably in the 1950s when they've been

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.100 
probably in the 1950s when they've been
disturbing<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.709> whole<00:02:55.860> area<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.720> bits<00:02:57.930> in

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
disturbing the whole area so the bits in

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.040 
disturbing the whole area so the bits in
between<00:02:58.200> we<00:02:58.709> shovel<00:02:59.130> away<00:02:59.250> straight<00:02:59.880> away<00:03:00.180> and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
between we shovel away straight away and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.290 
between we shovel away straight away and
it<00:03:01.290> stops<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.709> rain<00:03:01.920> turning<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.790> into<00:03:02.940> mud

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
it stops the rain turning it into mud

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.720 
it stops the rain turning it into mud
and<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.600> stops<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.220> basically<00:03:05.220> washing<00:03:05.610> into

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
and it stops it basically washing into

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.949 
and it stops it basically washing into
the<00:03:05.910> features<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.269> we're<00:03:06.480> more<00:03:06.720> concerned

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the features that we're more concerned

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.110 
the features that we're more concerned
with<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.489> carry<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.030> this

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
with so I'm going to carry on in this

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.990 
with so I'm going to carry on in this
whole<00:03:09.360> area<00:03:09.860> taking<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.430> join<00:03:11.640> up<00:03:11.790> with<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
whole area taking it to join up with the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.090 
whole area taking it to join up with the
h1<00:03:12.480> excavations<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.380> we've<00:03:13.890> nearly

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
h1 excavations that we've nearly

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.699 
h1 excavations that we've nearly
completed<00:03:14.640> already<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.470> ideally<00:03:16.470> we're

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
completed already and ideally we're

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.140 
completed already and ideally we're
going<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.920> have<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> lovely<00:03:17.400> series<00:03:18.060> of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
going to have a lovely series of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.600 
going to have a lovely series of
archaeological<00:03:18.690> deposits<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.200> go<00:03:19.440> from<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
archaeological deposits that go from the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.120 
archaeological deposits that go from the
medieval<00:03:20.790> period<00:03:21.170> where<00:03:22.170> I'm<00:03:22.320> stood<00:03:22.650> all<00:03:22.890> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
medieval period where I'm stood all the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.620 
medieval period where I'm stood all the
way<00:03:23.220> back<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.580> Roman<00:03:23.940> period<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.420> far

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
way back to the Roman period in the far

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.590 
way back to the Roman period in the far
corner<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.700> I'll<00:03:26.850> carry<00:03:27.090> on<00:03:27.239> watching<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
corner so I'll carry on watching the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.150 
corner so I'll carry on watching the
machine<00:03:30.170> picking<00:03:31.170> out<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.440> odd<00:03:31.530> finds<00:03:31.860> and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
machine picking out the odd finds and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.009 
machine picking out the odd finds and
then<00:03:32.190> making<00:03:32.880> sure<00:03:33.209> we<00:03:33.360> get<00:03:33.510> enough<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
then making sure we get enough of the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:46.160 
then making sure we get enough of the
disturbance<00:03:34.530> out<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.830> way

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.200 

Oh
