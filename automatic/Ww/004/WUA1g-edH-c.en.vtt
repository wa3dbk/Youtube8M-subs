there now from a dead empty charge you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
there now from a dead empty charge you
would<00:01:19.049> take<00:01:19.170> about<00:01:19.380> 20<00:01:19.680> days<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.280> solar

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
would take about 20 days for that solar

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.420 
would take about 20 days for that solar
cell<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> charge<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.830> but<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.950> never<00:01:23.130> run<00:01:23.280> an

empty<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.119> only<00:01:24.270> use<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> trommel<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.049> or

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
empty and we only use the trommel one or

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.109 
empty and we only use the trommel one or
two<00:01:25.229> times<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.560> month<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.460> able<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> sift

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
two times a month so we are able to sift

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
can we use it in this instance to sift

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
can we use it in this instance to sift
compost<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.880> garden<00:01:36.299> usage<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.049> making

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
a really nice potting mix you can also

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
a really nice potting mix you can also
use<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> sift<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.920> wood<00:01:41.310> chips<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
use it to sift out wood chips so the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.609 
use it to sift out wood chips so the
fines<00:01:42.299> will<00:01:42.540> come<00:01:42.720> through<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> fall<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
fines will come through and fall out the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.170 
fines will come through and fall out the
bottom<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> compost<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.909> here

bottom just like the compost is here
those<00:01:45.990> fines<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.409> make<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> fantastic<00:01:46.860> worm

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
those fines would make a fantastic worm

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.389
