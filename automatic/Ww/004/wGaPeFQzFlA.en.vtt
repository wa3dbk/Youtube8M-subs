'babu-bhaiya pledge like it messes them

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.630 
'babu-bhaiya pledge like it messes them
up<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:48.990> as<00:03:49.110> much<00:03:49.230> it's<00:03:49.770> debatable<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.459> mean

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
up just as much it's debatable I mean

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.520 
up just as much it's debatable I mean
the<00:03:50.970> rest<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.750> peace<00:03:51.900> answer<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.380> lot<00:03:52.500> more

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
the rest in peace answer is a lot more

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.500 
the rest in peace answer is a lot more
permanent<00:03:53.040> obviously<00:03:53.520> even<00:03:54.330> though<00:03:54.420> you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
permanent obviously even though you

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.330 
permanent obviously even though you
can't<00:03:54.660> get<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.840> off<00:03:54.900> lager<00:03:55.290> bolos<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.250> lot

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
can't get it off lager bolos it's a lot

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.620 
can't get it off lager bolos it's a lot
more<00:03:56.400> important<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:56.940> keep<00:03:57.060> your<00:03:57.090> manner<00:03:57.330> open

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
more important to keep your manner open

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.960 
more important to keep your manner open
so<00:03:58.320> that's<00:03:58.860> one<00:03:59.070> that's<00:03:59.310> one<00:03:59.430> possible<00:03:59.910> reason

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
so that's one that's one possible reason

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.070 
so that's one that's one possible reason
which<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.360> can<00:04:00.480> also<00:04:00.570> switch<00:04:00.810> into<00:04:01.020> a

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
which you can also switch into a

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.620 
which you can also switch into a
lingering<00:04:01.380> souls<00:04:01.680> today<00:04:02.010> absolutely<00:04:02.630> against

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
lingering souls today absolutely against

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.170 
lingering souls today absolutely against
so<00:04:04.230> basically<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.070> was<00:04:05.190> at<00:04:05.550> first<00:04:05.790> when<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.030> built

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
so basically I was at first when I built

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.310 
so basically I was at first when I built
this<00:04:06.239> deck<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.480> was<00:04:06.600> afraid<00:04:06.720> against<00:04:06.959> zombies

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
this deck I was afraid against zombies

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.390 
this deck I was afraid against zombies
that's<00:04:07.470> why<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.650> had<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.890> pillars<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.280> so

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
that's why I had the pillars and so
