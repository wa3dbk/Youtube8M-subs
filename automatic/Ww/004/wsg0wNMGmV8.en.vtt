00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
earlier and is finally maybe taking its

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.850 
earlier and is finally maybe taking its
toll<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:25.660> he'll<00:01:25.810> take<00:01:26.020> that<00:01:26.259> car<00:01:26.470> behind<00:01:26.649> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
toll so he'll take that car behind the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.770 
toll so he'll take that car behind the
wall<00:01:27.009> but<00:01:27.340> Montoya<00:01:27.940> is<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.210> perfect<00:01:28.720> example
