00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.020
 and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.699
 very good to all guys and girls and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.070
 welcome here once more to the channel 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.050
 I bring you a new video of gta 5 in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.800
 this time I bring you a video to see 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.750
 the story mode video in mode 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.150
 online if we are in the mode once 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.520
 history we are going to go to game and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.620
 we have to search we have to load them 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.329
 to repeat mission forgiveness and we have to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.250
 look for a mission that is called someone 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.399
 said yoga I already did it at the time 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.260
 when it happens to me in history but good 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.450
 if you have not passed it then you do the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.579
 mission you give to that if you select and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.949
 well, your hard drive or the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.929
 pendrive or where you have say 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.870
 saved the history mode data 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.740
 and we do the yoga movements 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.720
 and everything that will be asking us 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.390
 and well I have left you this kinematics 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.610
 which is the best of all of the mission that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.950
 come on let's michael who is with his 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.380
 son who has just drugged her with a 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.780
 soothing for horses or something and 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.940
 Well, it's there, everything is crazy. 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.930
 of the car he takes the car his son is pirated 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.780
 and good is the party party gap finally 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.990
 michael then there as you see and drag it 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.360
 something something that is not seen and then 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.510
 it's a very funny scene it does the same 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.720
 very funny because you are going to see it as a 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.030
 kind of I do not know of tribe of monkeys not os 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.070
 could you say that they appear here now 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.020
 same as you are going to see a tribe of monkeys 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.610
 who are there dancing are doing 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.070
 a party around michael and for 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.560
 that the ipod plays a new fade is 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.050
 saying where am I what the fuck is 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.610
 happening here the monkeys appear there 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.400
 dancing doing huanca huanca 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.890
 and immediately after that the UFO that you 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.560
 I commented that we are going to see it inside the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.340
 module line as it goes up and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.430
 the sweet not well at this time when 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.100
 closes let's say the UFO we have to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.649
 give the start and once we give it to be 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.870
 in the pause menu we will go to departure 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.150
 and we will load again the game that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.880
 we had before it's worth me as I only have 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.980
 one that was previously loaded as 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.990
 we load the game, it will return us 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.220
 to the story mode and once we're in a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.690
 history mode then we enter a 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.880
 session forward in a session by 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.290
 invitation does not matter when we enter 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.459
 an online session 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.870
 once we are here in a session 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.950
 online then we go for a 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.020
 helicopter and we leave a mark 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.629
 the location that I'm going to let you 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.310
 because that's where the UFO comes out 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.890
 you have to go with the helicopter and go up 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.540
 up it is almost as 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.700
 As you can see in the middle of the map, 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.860
 we put a marquita there to know more 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.349
 or less where do we have to go with the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.959
 helicopter up that is the brand 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.790
 ok that's the location so 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.989
 we're going there with the helicopter 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.000
 to all host this I will pass a 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.970
 little quick so you do not get 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.379
 very heavy , you know that always 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 I usually accelerate these pieces so that 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.269
 see how I get here so you can see 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.849
 it works but so you do not get too 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.319
 heavy is worth here as you see then I already 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.840
 I'm approaching the brand and once 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.370
 approaching the brand is simply 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.590
 climb up goes up and up 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.239
 go up you have to go up pretty much like that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.180
 Do not worry if you do not see it 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.370
 but good once we have gone up a lot 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.769
 much much much there as you are seeing 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.799
 comes out the UFO that you just saw in the 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.989
 Kinematic comes out quite the ichea do 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.130
 say because we can see everything 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.460
 there is in 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.290
 inside the UFO and a data then 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.560
 very curious is what I liked the most 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.510
 I think it 's now when I go inside 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.970
 a little bit inside of what is 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.600
 the luxury within the UFO looks like the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.820
 the typical lights are rotating this way 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.160
 green color there is also a central light 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.200
 which is also green and good 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.080
 so you can see let's say the conduit 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.760
 where they put michael 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.340
 you can bring everything you want 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.560
 ok do not hit us or anything you put 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.210
 inside the textures so no no os 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.330
 worry now I'm going to put myself 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.910
 so you can see that you do not crash or anything 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.180
 you can not enter perfectly and see 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.640
 everything that has maximum detail does not 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.440
 you can be there watching it calmly 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.660
 that the helicopter is not going to crash 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.460
 Nothing like that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.530
 so good guys nothing more than 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.020
 tell you I hope you liked this 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.610
 video I hope you enjoy this UFO 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.100
 you already put me in the comments what do you 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.960
 it seems if you have some curious information 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.070
 that you have seen, then you can 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.050
 put in the comments 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.390
 pass it on to your friends so that everything 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.790
 the world can see this UFO if not yet 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.890
 the glitch knows him and nothing else 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.620
 You already know how I like to help a lot 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.090
 subscribe to the channel nothing more kids 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.480
 have a good time and even the 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.080
 next 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.080
 bye
