00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.719 
and it would take a really long and just
a<00:01:44.979> tough<00:01:45.189> process<00:01:45.430> in<00:01:45.759> general<00:01:46.469> but<00:01:47.469> here<00:01:47.860> I

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
a tough process in general but here I

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.060 
a tough process in general but here I
just<00:01:49.119> talked<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.540> dr.<00:01:49.659> shed<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.530> kids<00:01:50.799> as

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
just talked to dr. shed and the kids as

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.289 
just talked to dr. shed and the kids as
soon<00:01:51.310> as<00:01:51.399> he<00:01:51.490> saw<00:01:51.640> me<00:01:51.670> he<00:01:51.850> knew<00:01:52.060> what<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
soon as he saw me he knew what the

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.390 
soon as he saw me he knew what the
problem<00:01:52.450> was

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
problem was

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.310 
problem was
to<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.120> tell<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.600> my<00:01:54.750> facial<00:01:55.140> feature

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
to do just tell them my facial feature

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.930 
to do just tell them my facial feature
where<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> issue<00:01:56.760> was<00:01:57.620> so<00:01:58.760> yeah<00:01:59.760> without

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
where the issue was so yeah without

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.240 
where the issue was so yeah without
insurance<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.870> still<00:02:01.020> cheaper<00:02:01.620> than<00:02:02.010> it<00:02:02.100> was

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
insurance is still cheaper than it was

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.420 
insurance is still cheaper than it was
in<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.580> United<00:02:02.880> States<00:02:03.120> with<00:02:03.450> insurance<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
in the United States with insurance so I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.380 
in the United States with insurance so I
thought<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:05.790> was<00:02:06.590> definitely<00:02:07.590> gonna<00:02:07.710> perk

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
thought that was definitely gonna perk

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.480 
thought that was definitely gonna perk
the<00:02:09.390> overall<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> mean<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.710> really<00:02:10.890> great

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
the overall I mean it was really great

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.520 
the overall I mean it was really great
now<00:02:12.300> top<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.720> another<00:02:12.870> reason<00:02:13.170> why<00:02:13.500> I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
now top of that another reason why I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.080 
now top of that another reason why I
didn't<00:02:14.010> feel<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.550> could<00:02:14.580> actually<00:02:14.820> get

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
didn't feel like I could actually get

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.550 
didn't feel like I could actually get
the<00:02:15.210> surgery<00:02:15.510> done<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.870> time<00:02:16.050> online<00:02:16.290> is

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the surgery done in time online is

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440 
the surgery done in time online is
because<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.340> did<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> lot<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.760> research<00:02:17.970> about<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
because I did a lot of research about a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.720 
because I did a lot of research about a
jaw<00:02:18.750> surgery<00:02:19.020> for<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> year<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.580> is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
jaw surgery for a year because this is

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.550 
jaw surgery for a year because this is
only<00:02:20.850> going<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> do<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> long<00:02:21.900> time<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
only going to do for a long time and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
only going to do for a long time and

thing they get braces first for one to

thing they get braces first for one to
two<00:02:29.340> years<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.270> teeth<00:02:30.420> are<00:02:30.570> aligned

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
two years and so your teeth are aligned

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.990 
two years and so your teeth are aligned
the<00:02:31.560> ones<00:02:31.770> who<00:02:31.890> take<00:02:32.040> better<00:02:32.220> line<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.850> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the ones who take better line then you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.940 
the ones who take better line then you
can<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.450> surgery<00:02:33.690> done<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.650> that's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
can get this surgery done and that's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.150 
can get this surgery done and that's
just<00:02:35.400> how<00:02:36.060> it's<00:02:36.240> been<00:02:36.750> done<00:02:37.050> but<00:02:37.860> when<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.070> came

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
just how it's been done but when I came

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.220 
just how it's been done but when I came
here<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.880> was<00:02:39.000> surprised<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.720> know<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.870> that's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
here I was surprised to know that that's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.650 
here I was surprised to know that that's
not<00:02:40.680> how<00:02:40.800> they<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.190> at<00:02:41.970> trying<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.420> call<00:02:42.570> as

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
not how they do it at trying to call as

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.110 
not how they do it at trying to call as
many<00:02:42.840> they<00:02:43.050> actually<00:02:43.459> do<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.580> surgery<00:02:44.940> first

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
many they actually do the surgery first

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.180 
many they actually do the surgery first
method<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.080> what<00:02:46.230> they<00:02:46.320> do<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.800> come<00:02:47.040> in

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
method so what they do is you come in

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.699 
method so what they do is you come in
and<00:02:47.550> put<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.910> braces<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:48.480> but<00:02:49.230> only<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.650> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and put your braces on but only for a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.590 
and put your braces on but only for a
week<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.130> then<00:02:50.250> when<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.670> come<00:02:50.850> back<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
week and then when you come back the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.540 
week and then when you come back the
following<00:02:51.810> week<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.800> me<00:02:52.920> at<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> surgery

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
following week that's me at the surgery

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.640 
following week that's me at the surgery
and<00:02:53.760> then<00:02:54.150> once<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.990> surgery<00:02:55.230> done

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
and then once you have the surgery done

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.390 
and then once you have the surgery done
then<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:57.120> braces<00:02:57.560> make<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.800> line<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.250> teeth

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
then the braces make a line of teeth

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.670 
then the braces make a line of teeth
make<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.790> straight<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:00.810> kind<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
make it straight so it's kind of the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.509 
make it straight so it's kind of the
reverse<00:03:02.100> process<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.150> surgeon<00:03:04.519> first

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
reverse process for the surgeon first

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.340 
reverse process for the surgeon first
first<00:03:06.390> crush<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.050> Joel<00:03:08.840> okay<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
first crush you Joel okay well the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.350 
first crush you Joel okay well the
process<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.190> here<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.880> lot

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
process that they do here is a lot

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.620 
process that they do here is a lot
quicker<00:03:12.690> than<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.530> normal<00:03:13.860> method<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:15.450> mean

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
quicker than the normal method I mean

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.210 
quicker than the normal method I mean
the<00:03:15.720> surgery<00:03:15.959> first<00:03:16.230> method<00:03:16.590> works<00:03:16.769> for<00:03:17.070> me

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
the surgery first method works for me

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.790 
the surgery first method works for me
and<00:03:18.000> I'm<00:03:18.180> happy<00:03:18.360> with<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.690> results<00:03:19.170> right<00:03:19.769> now

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
and I'm happy with the results right now

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.080 
and I'm happy with the results right now
I'm<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.070> I've<00:03:20.340> shown<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.580> fueling<00:03:20.940> process

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
I'm just I've shown a fueling process

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.449 
I'm just I've shown a fueling process
begin<00:03:21.720> fitting<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> other<00:03:22.440> overall<00:03:23.280> it's

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
begin fitting is the other overall it's

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.620 
begin fitting is the other overall it's
been<00:03:23.640> good<00:03:24.620> okay
