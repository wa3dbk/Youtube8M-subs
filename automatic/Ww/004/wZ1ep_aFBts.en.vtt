00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
is there's actually table legs here so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.030 
is there's actually table legs here so
if<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:39.200> same<00:00:40.200> thing<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.770> side

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
if we do that same thing on this side

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.060 
if we do that same thing on this side
then<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.050> comes<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.940> like<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.270> okay<00:00:46.079> then

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
then this comes out like so okay then

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.600 
then this comes out like so okay then
what<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.210> take<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:51.410> and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
what we can do is we can take this and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.900 
what we can do is we can take this and
latch<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.910> into<00:00:54.770> these<00:00:55.770> latches<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.430> here

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
latch them into these latches right here

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.869 
latch them into these latches right here
and<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.930> creates<00:00:58.350> a<00:01:00.260> table<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.850> a

and it creates a table so you can have a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.399 
and it creates a table so you can have a
workspace<00:01:04.129> there<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:06.600> pull<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> top

left<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.370> right<00:02:35.930> moving<00:02:36.930> around<00:02:37.079> to<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> back

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
left and right moving around to the back

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.430 
left and right moving around to the back
of<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> rack<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:41.540> we<00:02:42.540> have<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.989> firm<00:02:43.260> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
of the rack we have we have a firm and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.670 
of the rack we have we have a firm and
power<00:02:43.590> conditioner<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> space<00:02:46.260> to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
power conditioner and then a space to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.990 
power conditioner and then a space to
store<00:02:47.400> our<00:02:47.670> mic<00:02:48.660> cables<00:02:49.109> is<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.700> little

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
store our mic cables is in this little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.750 
store our mic cables is in this little
rack<00:02:51.799> shelf<00:02:52.799> right<00:02:53.069> here<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.549> we'll<00:02:53.640> leave

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
rack shelf right here so we'll leave

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.630 
rack shelf right here so we'll leave
that<00:02:53.819> off<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.190> our<00:02:56.400> power

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
that off for now and so our power

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.520 
that off for now and so our power
connection<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.510> actually<00:02:57.870> right<00:02:58.019> down<00:02:58.049> here

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
connection is actually right down here

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.099 
connection is actually right down here
it's<00:02:59.340> called<00:02:59.519> power<00:02:59.760> con<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.810> kind<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:00.989> like

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
it's called power con it's kind of like

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.860 
it's called power con it's kind of like
a<00:03:01.140> speakon<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.159> its<00:03:02.670> power<00:03:02.879> so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
a speakon just it's its power so

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.210 
a speakon just it's its power so
basically<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.849> insert<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.750> turn<00:03:07.500> just

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
basically we just insert and turn just

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.770 
basically we just insert and turn just
like<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.400> normal<00:03:08.790> speak<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.150> connector<00:03:09.599> and

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
like a normal speak on connector and

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.140 
like a normal speak on connector and
then<00:03:10.349> we<00:03:10.890> go<00:03:11.010> ahead<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.280> plug<00:03:11.609> this<00:03:11.670> into<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
then we go ahead and plug this into a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.979 
then we go ahead and plug this into a
electrical<00:03:15.150> circuit<00:03:17.599> now<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.660> nice<00:03:18.959> thing

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
electrical circuit now the nice thing

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.030 
electrical circuit now the nice thing
about<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.980> power<00:03:20.250> plug<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.959> has<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.530> green

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
about this power plug it has a green

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.150 
about this power plug it has a green
light<00:03:23.069> right<00:03:23.609> here<00:03:23.669> that<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.329> see<00:03:24.359> if

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
light right here that you can see if

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.809 
light right here that you can see if
this<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.430> red<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:28.260> says<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.099> ground

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
this is red it says that the the ground

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.619 
this is red it says that the the ground
is<00:03:30.299> bad<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.440> don't<00:03:32.010> use<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.459> circuit<00:03:32.910> also<00:03:33.329> if

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
is bad so don't use that circuit also if

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.089 
is bad so don't use that circuit also if
it<00:03:33.750> doesn't<00:03:34.049> light<00:03:34.230> up<00:03:34.260> you'll<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:34.859> that

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
it doesn't light up you'll know that

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.729 
it doesn't light up you'll know that
there's<00:03:35.250> no<00:03:35.430> power<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:37.049> that's<00:03:37.470> good<00:03:37.709> for

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
there's no power so that's good for

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.280 
there's no power so that's good for
quick<00:03:38.430> troubleshooting<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.930> once<00:03:40.139> that's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
quick troubleshooting so once that's

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.500 
quick troubleshooting so once that's
connected<00:03:40.829> in<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.160> AC<00:03:41.340> power<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:42.120> will<00:03:42.299> want

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
connected in the AC power we will want

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.699 
connected in the AC power we will want
to<00:03:42.690> switch<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.230> back<00:03:43.500> Fuhrman<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:45.500> okay<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
to switch the back Fuhrman on okay and

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.460 
to switch the back Fuhrman on okay and
so<00:03:47.400> then<00:03:47.609> we<00:03:48.150> will<00:03:48.329> go<00:03:48.510> around<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.440> front

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
so then we will go around to the front

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.250 
so then we will go around to the front
and<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.669> is<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.030> one<00:03:51.180> that's<00:03:51.329> powering<00:03:52.139> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
and this is the one that's powering the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.740 
and this is the one that's powering the
sound<00:03:52.470> board<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.760> amps<00:03:54.090> below<00:03:54.419> all<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
sound board and the amps below all the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.089 
sound board and the amps below all the
rest<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.199> the<00:03:55.290> stuff<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.650> plugged<00:03:55.859> into<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
rest of the stuff is plugged into the

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.170 
rest of the stuff is plugged into the
back<00:03:56.280> Fuhrman

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
back Fuhrman

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.580 
back Fuhrman
but<00:03:57.449> this<00:03:57.599> is<00:03:57.750> also<00:03:57.900> plugged<00:03:58.349> into<00:03:58.500> that

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
but this is also plugged into that

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.349 
but this is also plugged into that
Fermin<00:03:59.040> as<00:03:59.160> well<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.579> we<00:03:59.699> can<00:03:59.819> turn<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.150> on

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
Fermin as well so we can turn this on

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.039 
Fermin as well so we can turn this on
and<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.290> entire<00:04:01.650> system<00:04:01.949> will<00:04:02.190> now<00:04:02.280> turn<00:04:02.579> on

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
and the entire system will now turn on

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.909 
and the entire system will now turn on
so<00:04:04.049> we<00:04:04.169> have<00:04:04.290> our<00:04:04.410> board<00:04:04.650> on<00:04:06.769> phantom<00:04:07.769> power

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
so we have our board on phantom power

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.979 
so we have our board on phantom power
buttons<00:04:08.280> up<00:04:08.430> here<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.389> if<00:04:09.480> you're<00:04:09.629> using<00:04:09.810> any

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
buttons up here so if you're using any

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.839 
buttons up here so if you're using any
condenser<00:04:10.500> mics<00:04:10.680> make<00:04:10.859> sure<00:04:10.980> that's<00:04:11.099> switched

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
condenser mics make sure that's switched

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.589 
condenser mics make sure that's switched
on<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:13.019> now<00:04:13.139> everything<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.709> turned<00:04:13.949> on<00:04:14.599> around

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
on so now everything is turned on around

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.620 
on so now everything is turned on around
on<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.410> back<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:17.039> where<00:04:17.489> we<00:04:17.699> will<00:04:17.849> plug<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.359> our

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
on the back is where we will plug in our

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.259 
on the back is where we will plug in our
speaker<00:04:19.139> cables<00:04:19.560> for<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.979> speakers<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.640> have

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
speaker cables for the speakers I have

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.460 
speaker cables for the speakers I have
both<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.810> speed

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
on each thing and to turn this off so

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.400 
on each thing and to turn this off so
you<00:04:28.260> don't<00:04:28.410> hear<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> fans<00:04:29.390> so<00:04:30.390> on<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> Left<00:04:31.080> I

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
you don't hear the fans so on the Left I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.680 
you don't hear the fans so on the Left I
have<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:31.920> speak<00:04:32.160> on<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.940> quarter<00:04:33.270> inch<00:04:33.450> on
