00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello very good here we are again 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 with the letters to do the following 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.660
 book game 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.990
 from vicente that I notice cardboard 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.539
 fundamental and as you can see is a game that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.360
 is done with pieces of cards that 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.750
 are they are a split letter by the 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.070
 half by then all the letters 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.100
 they have their partner 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.920
 Well, we're not going to do the game 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.300
 the game consists of everything going to be a 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.430
 viewer 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.870
 then we are going to give you the package of 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.720
 letters to a viewer that we're going to say 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.690
 that mix as much as you want and so many times 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.160
 want you can even cut and complete 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.160
 as many times as you want 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.359
 once you have done this 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.660
 we are going to tell him to tell another 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.670
 spectator who takes a little pile 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.979
 then there will be two spectators each 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.799
 one with a lot to all this the magician 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.240
 you can talk without cream is rotated or not 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.210
 I see it 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.810
 to make even more impression if it fits 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.450
 and we tell him to count how many letters 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.520
 has each one that is going to be your number 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.210
 of luck but do not say it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.080
 they keep for them and that's it 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.000
 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 the first player 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.550
 he has 13 because he is going to be his new 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 luck 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 the other 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.430
 viewer has 11 possesses that is going to be 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.229
 your lucky number which they have 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 what to remember can mix 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.920
 individually their packets 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.450
 perfectly join them we say that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 put the packages together and go back to 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.200
 others want and once you have 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.630
 finished that they do not return it and now 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.900
 we say look let's go 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.670
 saying letters one in one of one in 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.610
 one and you are looking at the letters that 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 they are and when each one arrives its number 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.729
 first we only make a spectator and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.430
 We tell you when your number arrives 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.780
 stay with the letter that is but 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.720
 that does not say anything simply that the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:18.709
 memorize then we take 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:22.720
 8 9 10 11 12 and 13 to these of the deck not 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.570
 obviously you have no idea what number 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.210
 to think to the viewer of the letters that 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.800
 he had and he does not know what letter he is and 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.750
 Nor will simply see the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.970
 is teaching until the viewer 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.490
 reaches what is in this case is the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.710
 number 13 on 8 of clubs and follows 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.900
 teaching letters you can continue until 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.540
 the viewer stops him or follow him until the 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.550
 final no problem imagine that for 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.440
 the provider says to go or we continue 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.560
 equality and now we are going to do 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.230
 exactly the same with the next 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.180
 spectator let's say we're going to 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.730
 go teaching letters and that they give me and that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.910
 memorize your letter according to the number that 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:09.700
 says he has in this case in 11 1 2 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:12.069
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.470
 as you can see it is again on 8 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.890
 clubs you have already seen the secret the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.910
 which is what we follow to all this now what 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.849
 we are seeing then what we are applying 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.269
 but the magician is not taught until 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.080
 that ends once the age ends 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.040
 can mix again and there is the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.370
 packet of letters to the first 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.530
 viewer and asks him to look for his letter 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.760
 the 8 of clubs and do not teach it that 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.129
 let her 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.620
 gives the packet again to the next 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.920
 viewer and you rotate your letter and you do not 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.910
 I looked at her 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.340
 so now that we have recapitulated 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.290
 a packet of letters cut by the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.170
 half are mixed 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.079
 given to a viewer the viewer is the 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.689
 which re-mixes short cuts 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.170
 recontra cuts another viewer tells you 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.689
 that I take a little pile and that the 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.030
 count it is impossible that the magician will 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.040
 know what number of letters each had 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.560
 one and it 's impossible to know what is letter 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.139
 obviously they will choose what the magician 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.359
 if you know and this already the one who makes the game 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.000
 you can present it as you want is that 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.320
 both have had a perfect 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.780
 synchronization because the two have 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.330
 chosen the same letter 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.080
 this game to say that it is a game for 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.180
 my taste a very powerful game 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.610
 I have done so I did too 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.580
 as the book says with giant letter of 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.610
 the jumbo charts 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.909
 and I also have another game that is with the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.169
 same system the same theme but with 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:49.969
 cardboard with letters written with notes and 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.620
 way I present it as a mentalismo 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:55.939
 It is a game that can give a lot of play 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.050
 I hope you liked it and until the 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.050
 next chao
