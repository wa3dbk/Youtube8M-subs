00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
pretty much helped a little and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.969 
pretty much helped a little and
firestorm<00:04:28.600> just<00:04:28.930> blasting<00:04:29.350> once<00:04:29.590> that's<00:04:29.860> all

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
firestorm just blasting once that's all

firestorm just blasting once that's all
he<00:04:30.220> did<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.460> think<00:04:30.729> firestorm<00:04:31.150> coulda<00:04:31.330> did<00:04:31.449> a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
he did I think firestorm coulda did a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.060 
he did I think firestorm coulda did a
little<00:04:31.630> bit<00:04:31.750> more<00:04:31.990> if<00:04:32.110> he<00:04:32.260> had<00:04:32.440> more<00:04:32.710> action

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
little bit more if he had more action

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.650 
little bit more if he had more action
with<00:04:33.220> him<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:33.610> would<00:04:33.820> have<00:04:33.940> been<00:04:33.970> much<00:04:34.330> much

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
with him this would have been much much

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.540 
with him this would have been much much
much<00:04:35.020> interesting<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.770> see<00:04:35.919> although<00:04:36.130> use<00:04:36.520> a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
much interesting you see although use a

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.029 
much interesting you see although use a
combo<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.240> get<00:04:37.389> all<00:04:37.570> three<00:04:37.960> while<00:04:38.530> working

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
combo to get all three while working

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.040
