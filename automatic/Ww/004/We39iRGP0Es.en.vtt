00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 hello girls the pdo aniene today will be on 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.099
 illuminating in stick of the uai with 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.559
 the number 101 and the iconology are 35 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.009
 number 102 and the price of 6 euros 90 the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.540
 number 100 I think is more on the white 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.760
 this is the number 101 as you can 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.939
 see more of a cold color on the rose 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.539
 while the number 102 is a little warmer 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.940
 because it's a little more fishing in general 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.899
 so the number 101 doesn't like me because 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.570
 although a complexion girl 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.120
 however clear a pink undertone I find 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.460
 that is a little too kind effect 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 disc pad while number 102 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 cross and beautiful on everything and all 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 Complexion types therefore for girls 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 yes it is very clear and if girls more 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 dark just yet a different holiday 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.430
 long I have not caught a little but not too much 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.260
 so it is alright both the girl with 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 pink undertone is a girl like a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.659
 lower tone, on the other hand, warmer and let's say 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.280
 which can be applied both before and after 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.689
 having put the foundation and after being there 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.840
 touched up by our makeup 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.580
 let's stop after you see it fade well 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.280
 so as not to create dead ends we say 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.740
 that the nice thing about the illuminant is that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.350
 you don't always see you see only when 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.850
 a light strikes in a certain way the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 our face so for example when me 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.509
 see here so far ahead and do not see 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.820
 but nothing if I'm moving see 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.570
 which creates this beautiful effect 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.579
 so this is the nice thing 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.009
 of the illuminating fact that it is not one 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.320
 what immediately visible but which for example 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.360
 in the evening when you go out with with 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.720
 of the certain lights you can notice precisely 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.310
 this was this light that emanates it can 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.310
 obviously use in several places 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.649
 then above the lip 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.829
 not all around but obviously not 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.490
 let's highlight maps if you have the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.040
 wide nose you can especially that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.969
 part of near the tip for a while 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 reflected another thing you can do is 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.520
 use it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.400
 a way a little more bold like that not 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.470
 give it a little shade and then after it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.170
 do before putting on a color and then 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.849
 put your foundation on it 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:24.209
 so for example I take a little 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:27.540
 foundation pats him on this 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.120
 so the effect will not be so obvious but 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.319
 you will have as a brightness that comes from 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.620
 under 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.299
 because you see it's not so excessive though 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.459
 so I like it so much 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.680
 affection use the illuminant first 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.030
 so my motto for this product 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.970
 he is the drumbeat and the scholar dead 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.260
 because obviously the number 102 101 does not 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.239
 I evaluate it but simply because it does not 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.489
 use for at the center cones dott because it is a 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.040
 beautiful product a fantastic color 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.989
 easy to blend lasting about 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.630
 six hours don't measure all day though 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.160
 it lasts quite a while and we say it's perfect 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.980
 for girls what with the skin 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.299
 dry or normal because it remains 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.190
 especially that summer comes from a 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.900
 extra light touch if you have skin 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.549
 instead of the inside and a little fatter 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.019
 be careful at most given some 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.269
 figures on other areas to avoid 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.859
 too shiny and I don't recommend it to anyone 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.799
 however it raises very dilated because 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.510
 otherwise obviously also the canvas 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.579
 attention in the areas maybe especially 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.600
 of the cheeks 9 you don't want to attract it 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.209
 because we have expanded policy 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.209
 especially here hello beauties
