00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi how about my name is giovanna 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 Cardenas or in which promaster and you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.429
 I invite us to make this new together 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.290
 design inspired by the concept kit was 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.369
 once the natural nail is prepared 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.480
 we are going to apply protein ball on the tip 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.779
 reminding you that what we are going to do 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.350
 now it is a designs with which pro in 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.470
 natural nail 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.560
 then in the next step previously 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.560
 agitated ours the care probase 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 we will apply 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.700
 starting at the center line 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.360
 our base after 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.360
 we enter the previous nail 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.760
 and we're going to do laterals 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.030
 we teach points 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.670
 It is important that when we apply base 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 let's be careful not to stick to the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.409
 Cuticle skin covering perfectly 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.409
 the whole uribe plate 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.680
 side and the new point 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.520
 after 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.800
 let's put the lamp to heal by 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.060
 30 seconds 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.149
 past the lamp curing time 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.040
 Now let's start doing what will 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.970
 to be our color application in 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.670
 this case I will use re 222 and pulpul 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.950
 m in this concept we will be able to see 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.560
 color variants that we are going to handle 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.299
 as follows for this we are going to 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.020
 make an application first of all 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.310
 basic 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.590
 starting with the color 92 22 of equal 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.109
 way starting from the center 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.220
 very careful not to hit the area 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:58.970
 cuticle 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.430
 in this first stage of color 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.480
 so you have one more application 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.000
 uniform 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.800
 and that they do not get to be balls 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.080
 in case it sticks a little 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.080
 we only clean with our brush 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.830
 do 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.470
 after with soccer m 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.560
 again the center and then 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.560
 towards the sides sliding the brush 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.030
 at a 45 degree angle so that the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.780
 color can be uniform 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.209
 very floated 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.569
 and reaching all the ends of the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.150
 Water 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.349
 let's go and put in the new lamp 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.349
 account 30 seconds 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.300
 He spent the time curing lamps 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.120
 we apply the second layer of color in 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.820
 this second layer we have to take as 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.860
 objective that the color remains 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.860
 perfectly applied uniform 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.310
 and the color very sharp without leaving any 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.810
 transparency in the same way 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.840
 coming as close to the area as 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.360
 cuticle 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.360
 taking care not to touch the cuticle area 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.370
 let's see the second layer 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.370
 of the purple color 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.840
 in the same way 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.849
 let's see 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.270
 we cover the entire union perfectly 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.190
 natural 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.190
 and we sealed the tip 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.700
 and again the lamp for 30 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.879
 seconds 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.239
 we remove the lamp and we're going to start 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.910
 to make a small decoration in this 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.090
 I want to show you how we can 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.400
 a basic concept get a second 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.160
 decoration but in this case let's see 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.420
 the first one for it we're just going to 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.720
 need a big punch and I'm going to 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.400
 use 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.940
 another color your garzon 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.859
 I'm going to use the biggest part of 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.280
 punch I will take 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.759
 I'm going to apply my punch to 90 degrees and 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.300
 I'm going to do it by placing a point in the 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.300
 center 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.480
 of show 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.440
 in this way 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.830
 only by placing it there 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.990
 and I'm going to put 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.410
 30 seconds 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.040
 once the curing time of 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.290
 the lamp 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.810
 this time at the end of our 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.010
 design we could here after this 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.220
 apply what would be our pro lakers 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.290
 coat 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.110
 so that our design that des of the 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.530
 next way and how can you see the 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.690
 design is already finished this could be 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.180
 only one corner but if we 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.460
 we would like to do a little more elaborate 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.290
 this design we can do the following 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.550
 with the same color play are I'm going to take 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.550
 with the same punch 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:36.229
 I'm going to place another point making it a 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.229
 little bigger and we're going to be doing 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.270
 scales of moles as we are going to do 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.870
 then next I'm going to recharge a 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.410
 little less so that that mole is a 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.729
 little smaller then I make a last 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.039
 in this central line 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.770
 then with the other side of our 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:00.700
 pulse in the smallest part I will 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:04.120
 start making some other points 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.860
 in an indistinct way, taking care that 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.729
 the world is not very close together with the 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.889
 central line so they can distinguish 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.889
 and that moles can not hit 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.040
 in this way 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.909
 and we put the lamp for 30 seconds 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.360
 once spent time jury 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.950
 the lamp now we finish our 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.980
 design if I could observe 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.790
 from a simple scheme we can draw a 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.970
 scheme a little more elaborate everything is 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.129
 according to the concepts or the styles 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.069
 that your customers ask you 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:57.380
 the important thing is a simple design 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:07:00.050
 you can explode and take out some more 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.990
 can modify or change the colors 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.810
 of this says 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.100
 or in the same way move the colors in 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.100
 different types of fumes 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.440
 we apply with the same way that 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.440
 we have done with the previous colors 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.350
 also sealing the tip perfectly 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.669
 and we put to cure again 30 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.669
 seconds in lamp 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:28.390
 we remove from the lamp 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.970
 we clean 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.630
 with the help of a coton clean air and 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.630
 if he did not care 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.860
 the initial oxygen 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.110
 and then 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.289
 I 'll show you now what it's going to be 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.240
 our complete design on this occasion 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:53.060
 you can see that we handle 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.159
 different schemes changing the 

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.039
 colors of position following the same 

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:59.990
 advice once we finish our 

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.669
 concept remember to apply oil with 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:05.270
 aroma of your preference or that of your 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:08.199
 client and thus finish our scheme 

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.199
 of work
