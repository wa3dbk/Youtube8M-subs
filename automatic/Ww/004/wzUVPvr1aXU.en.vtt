00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
pliers and a multimeter which is not

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.290 
pliers and a multimeter which is not
essential<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> first<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.300> we

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
essential so first of all we get the we

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
essential so first of all we get the we
get<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> tray<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.520> one<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> springs

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
get the tray and one of the springs

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.229 
get the tray and one of the springs
needs<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:55.020> fully<00:00:55.559> extended<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.940> pull<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
needs to be fully extended so we pull it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.380 
needs to be fully extended so we pull it
all<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> way<00:00:57.660> down<00:00:57.770> unravel<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.000> as<00:01:00.000> far<00:01:00.359> as

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
all the way down unravel it as far as

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
all the way down unravel it as far as
possible<00:01:02.840> okay<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.110> once<00:01:04.439> we've<00:01:04.589> done<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
possible okay and once we've done that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:14.600 
possible okay and once we've done that
we<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.280> straighten<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> end<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:10.490> like<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:13.610> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
we to straighten the end out like so and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.020 
we to straighten the end out like so and
we'll<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.850> fitting<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.420> through<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.380> end

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
we'll be fitting that through the end

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.870 
we'll be fitting that through the end
straight<00:01:18.030> through<00:01:18.479> there<00:01:18.780> okay<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> basically

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
straight through there okay so basically

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.190 
straight through there okay so basically
that<00:01:21.570> creates<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.670> circuit<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.020> what

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that creates a circuit and now what

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.600 
that creates a circuit and now what
we're<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> need<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.460> some

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
we're going to need to do get some

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
we're going to need to do get some
solder<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:33.229> just<00:01:34.229> heat<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:36.750> end

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
solder and we will just heat up this end

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.770 
solder and we will just heat up this end
here

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.530 

and<00:01:44.950> just<00:01:45.950> create<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.430> bit<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.760> connection<00:01:47.060> on

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
and just create a bit of a connection on

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.900 
and just create a bit of a connection on
there<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.890> what<00:01:55.010> we<00:01:55.130> need<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.370> do<00:01:55.490> there<00:01:55.700> really

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
there so what we need to do there really

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.100 
there so what we need to do there really
is<00:01:56.300> just<00:01:58.240> make<00:01:59.240> sure<00:01:59.510> it<00:02:00.080> doesn't<00:02:00.260> move

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
is just make sure it doesn't move

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.630 
is just make sure it doesn't move
anymore

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
anymore

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.510 
anymore
okay<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:04.760> we've<00:02:04.880> created<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.360> collection<00:02:06.520> where

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
okay so we've created a collection where

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.219 
okay so we've created a collection where
you<00:02:07.610> pop<00:02:07.820> him<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.539> batteries<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.050> right

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
you pop him the batteries of the right

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.830 
you pop him the batteries of the right
way<00:02:09.380> around<00:02:09.440> now<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.800> if<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.010> fill<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.250> right

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
way around now and if you fill it right

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.460 
way around now and if you fill it right
you<00:02:14.840> just<00:02:14.959> turn<00:02:15.260> your<00:02:15.380> multimeter<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:17.350> run<00:02:18.350> if

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
you just turn your multimeter on run if

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.360 
you just turn your multimeter on run if
you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.620> see<00:02:18.800> over<00:02:19.040> there<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:24.010> creates<00:02:25.010> four

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
you can see over there that creates four

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.010 
you can see over there that creates four
point<00:02:25.760> two<00:02:25.970> seven<00:02:26.180> volts<00:02:26.510> which<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.690> more<00:02:26.900> or

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
point two seven volts which is more or

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.080 
point two seven volts which is more or
less<00:02:27.080> 5<00:02:27.410> volts<00:02:27.860> 4.5<00:02:28.580> volts

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
less 5 volts 4.5 volts

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.729 
less 5 volts 4.5 volts
these<00:02:29.720> batteries<00:02:30.020> little<00:02:30.230> bit<00:02:30.320> dead<00:02:30.500> that's

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
these batteries little bit dead that's

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.860 
these batteries little bit dead that's
white<00:02:30.920> showing<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.400> little<00:02:31.610> bit<00:02:31.730> less<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.810> if

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
white showing a little bit less so if

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.410 
white showing a little bit less so if
you<00:02:32.930> can<00:02:33.050> see<00:02:33.290> over<00:02:33.590> there<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.120> fold<00:02:35.330> a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
you can see over there you can fold a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.330 
you can see over there you can fold a
bit<00:02:37.930> 4.27<00:02:39.489> not<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.940> old<00:02:41.060> battery<00:02:41.890> was<00:02:42.890> giving

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
bit 4.27 not the old battery was giving

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.490 
bit 4.27 not the old battery was giving
me<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.880> block<00:02:49.060> 3.7<00:02:50.060> volts<00:02:50.090> which<00:02:50.989> means<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.380> was

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
me a block 3.7 volts which means it was

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.050 
me a block 3.7 volts which means it was
a<00:02:52.030> almost<00:02:53.030> dead<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.540> honest<00:02:53.750> fear<00:02:55.060> let's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
a almost dead to be honest fear let's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.660 
a almost dead to be honest fear let's
have<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> look<00:02:59.230> it's<00:03:00.230> not<00:03:00.410> really<00:03:00.620> give<00:03:00.769> me<00:03:00.890> much

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
have a look it's not really give me much

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.880 
have a look it's not really give me much
reading<00:03:02.260> can't<00:03:03.260> really<00:03:03.440> but<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.650> can<00:03:03.769> buy

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
reading can't really but you can buy

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.340 
reading can't really but you can buy
these<00:03:04.070> batteries<00:03:04.489> very<00:03:04.850> expensive<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
these batteries very expensive the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.710 
these batteries very expensive the
carrier<00:03:06.709> here<00:03:06.920> was<00:03:07.280> only<00:03:07.519> one<00:03:07.700> pound<00:03:07.910> which<00:03:08.630> is

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
carrier here was only one pound which is

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.690 
carrier here was only one pound which is
probably<00:03:08.930> about<00:03:09.019> eight<00:03:09.290> 70<00:03:09.769> 70<00:03:10.250> cents<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
probably about eight 70 70 cents in the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.360 
probably about eight 70 70 cents in the
US<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.440> makes<00:03:12.829> sense<00:03:12.950> really<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:14.060> convert

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
US so it makes sense really to convert

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.930 
US so it makes sense really to convert
and<00:03:16.370> convert<00:03:17.000> them<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.329> triple<00:03:17.630> A's<00:03:18.940> so

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
and convert them to the triple A's so

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.440 
and convert them to the triple A's so
then<00:03:20.180> if<00:03:20.269> we<00:03:20.360> just<00:03:20.480> open<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.840> back<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:23.030> if<00:03:23.360> you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
then if we just open the back and if you

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.630 
then if we just open the back and if you
have<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.690> same<00:03:23.840> connections<00:03:24.350> here<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:25.549> just

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
have the same connections here it's just

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.020 
have the same connections here it's just
a<00:03:25.850> case<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.060> popping<00:03:26.959> em<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.640> may<00:03:28.760> need<00:03:28.880> to

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
a case of popping em on you may need to

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.940 
a case of popping em on you may need to
trim<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.480> sides<00:03:29.660> down<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:30.380> they<00:03:30.470> can<00:03:30.620> sit<00:03:30.799> next

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
trim the sides down so they can sit next

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.789 
trim the sides down so they can sit next
to<00:03:31.130> each<00:03:31.280> other<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:33.200> if<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.440> haven't<00:03:33.680> got

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
to each other and if you haven't got

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.550 
to each other and if you haven't got
these<00:03:33.920> just<00:03:34.220> snip<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.519> wires<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:36.320> white

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
these just snip the wires and the white

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.500 
these just snip the wires and the white
goes<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.100> positive<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:37.940> black<00:03:38.150> goes<00:03:38.360> to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
goes to positive and the black goes to

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.380 
goes to positive and the black goes to
negative<00:03:38.660> just<00:03:39.590> solder<00:03:39.920> them<00:03:40.040> on<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.220> top<00:03:40.430> now

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
negative just solder them on the top now

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.330 
negative just solder them on the top now
a<00:03:41.420> way<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.780> check<00:03:42.200> if<00:03:42.410> it's<00:03:42.560> working<00:03:42.799> we<00:03:43.160> just

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
a way to check if it's working we just

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.600 
a way to check if it's working we just
connect<00:03:43.610> one<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.860> extend<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> camera<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:48.610> if

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
connect one to extend the camera and if

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.660 
connect one to extend the camera and if
we<00:03:49.700> cover<00:03:49.879> this<00:03:50.120> here

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.240 

move<00:03:53.300> away<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:54.110> only<00:03:54.200> makes<00:03:54.500> one<00:03:54.709> click<00:03:54.980> which

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
move away it only makes one click which

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.089 
move away it only makes one click which
means<00:03:55.550> it's<00:03:56.330> not<00:03:56.510> working<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.110> connect<00:03:57.950> both

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
means it's not working so connect both

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.080 
means it's not working so connect both
batteries<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:59.840> terminals<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.760> camera

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
batteries of terminals the camera

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.880 
batteries of terminals the camera
won't<00:04:03.020> recover<00:04:04.750> one<00:04:05.750> click<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:06.500> if<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.650> move<00:04:06.830> a

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
won't recover one click and if I move a

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.090 
won't recover one click and if I move a
hand<00:04:07.069> away<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:08.530> there's<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.620> second<00:04:09.950> click

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
hand away and there's the second click

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.250 
hand away and there's the second click
so<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.640> first<00:04:10.850> is<00:04:10.970> our<00:04:11.060> opening<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.870> second

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
so the first is our opening the second

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.949 
so the first is our opening the second
was<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.680> closing<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:13.760> now<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:13.970> know<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.840> it's

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
was it closing so now we know that it's

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.449 
was it closing so now we know that it's
working<00:04:15.140> perfectly<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:17.090> may<00:04:17.329> need<00:04:17.600> to

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
working perfectly and you may need to

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.920 
working perfectly and you may need to
snip<00:04:19.459> out<00:04:19.639> a<00:04:19.669> bit<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.030> plastic<00:04:20.419> in<00:04:20.540> here<00:04:20.750> or

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
snip out a bit of the plastic in here or

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.710 
snip out a bit of the plastic in here or
remove<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.709> battery<00:04:22.340> guard<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.850> may<00:04:23.510> need<00:04:23.660> to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
remove the battery guard and may need to

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.990 
remove the battery guard and may need to
modify<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.260> slightly<00:04:24.530> to<00:04:24.889> fit<00:04:25.040> in<00:04:25.250> but<00:04:25.850> now

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
modify this slightly to fit in but now

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000 
modify this slightly to fit in but now
