00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and we've talked so much about and it's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
of the glass vortex 5.4 is the same and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.709

liquid heat from the yellow bottle this

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.399 
liquid heat from the yellow bottle this
stove<00:01:14.060> came<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> gasification<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.049> little<00:01:16.290> bit

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
stove came to gasification a little bit

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.320 
stove came to gasification a little bit
on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> slow<00:01:16.770> side<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.180> was

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
on the slow side and I think it was

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.990 
on the slow side and I think it was
because<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.100> perfect<00:01:20.340> step<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
because of the not so perfect step of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240 
because of the not so perfect step of
the<00:01:21.240> inner<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> outer<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.130> the

the secondary air holes you normally

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.640 
the secondary air holes you normally
can't<00:02:46.760> see<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.329> wood<00:02:47.569> gas<00:02:47.810> being<00:02:48.139> pushed<00:02:48.409> out

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
can't see the wood gas being pushed out

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.990 
can't see the wood gas being pushed out
of<00:02:48.859> the<00:02:49.450> bottom<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:51.530> primary<00:02:52.340> airports

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000

of the bottom of the primary airports
that's<00:02:53.540> why<00:02:53.720> I'm<00:02:53.870> using<00:02:54.049> smoke<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:55.370> allow<00:02:56.060> us

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
that's why I'm using smoke to allow us

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.009 
that's why I'm using smoke to allow us
to<00:02:56.480> trace<00:02:56.780> those<00:02:57.379> air<00:02:57.739> flows<00:02:58.750> you've<00:02:59.750> probably

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
to trace those air flows you've probably

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.039 
to trace those air flows you've probably
noticed<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.680> different<00:03:01.040> clips<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.669> video

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
noticed in different clips on this video

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.690 
noticed in different clips on this video
that<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.169> quality<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.709> video<00:03:03.980> changes

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
that the quality of the video changes

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.179 
that the quality of the video changes
quite<00:03:05.659> significantly<00:03:06.290> I've<00:03:06.709> had<00:03:06.980> some<00:03:07.159> major

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
quite significantly I've had some major

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.000 
quite significantly I've had some major
problems<00:03:07.969> with<00:03:08.329> cameras<00:03:09.169> over<00:03:09.469> the<00:03:09.620> last<00:03:09.769> few

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
problems with cameras over the last few

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.490 
problems with cameras over the last few
weeks<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:11.209> that's<00:03:11.629> why<00:03:11.840> it's<00:03:12.019> taking<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.319> long

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
weeks and that's why it's taking so long

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.629 
weeks and that's why it's taking so long
for<00:03:12.680> me<00:03:12.919> to<00:03:13.040> actually<00:03:13.219> get<00:03:13.609> this<00:03:13.790> video<00:03:14.030> done

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
of the stove gets and then how much it's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.819 
of the stove gets and then how much it's
reduced<00:03:32.479> when<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:32.959> introduce<00:03:33.409> the<00:03:33.590> flame

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
reduced when you introduce the flame

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.390

punk stick from the stove you'll see

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:30.659 
punk stick from the stove you'll see
that<00:06:28.669> everything<00:06:29.149> that<00:06:29.479> was<00:06:29.599> below<00:06:29.990> the<00:06:30.020> flame

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
that everything that was below the flame

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.379 
that everything that was below the flame
is<00:06:31.669> not<00:06:31.789> burnt<00:06:32.529> if<00:06:33.529> this<00:06:34.490> was<00:06:34.669> not<00:06:34.819> true

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
is not burnt if this was not true

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.420 
is not burnt if this was not true
paralysis<00:06:36.050> that<00:06:36.469> would<00:06:36.709> have<00:06:36.830> all<00:06:36.979> been<00:06:37.009> burnt

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
paralysis that would have all been burnt

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.930 
paralysis that would have all been burnt
all<00:06:37.639> the<00:06:37.699> way<00:06:37.940> to<00:06:38.000> the

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.450 

this<00:06:41.940> next<00:06:42.240> clip<00:06:42.990> will<00:06:43.319> show<00:06:43.349> that<00:06:44.250> if<00:06:44.340> you

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
this next clip will show that if you

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.749 
this next clip will show that if you
burn<00:06:44.669> enough<00:06:45.150> of<00:06:45.419> the<00:06:45.930> wood<00:06:46.889> gas<00:06:47.160> coming<00:06:47.520> out

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
burn enough of the wood gas coming out

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.360 
burn enough of the wood gas coming out
of<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.210> primary<00:06:48.870> air<00:06:49.169> holes<00:06:49.530> you<00:06:50.220> can

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
of the primary air holes you can

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.370 
of the primary air holes you can
actually<00:06:50.610> extinguish<00:06:51.539> the<00:06:51.810> flame<00:06:52.080> at<00:06:52.410> the<00:06:52.590> top

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
actually extinguish the flame at the top

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.629 
actually extinguish the flame at the top
so<00:06:55.380> here<00:06:55.620> you'll<00:06:55.860> see<00:06:56.099> that<00:06:56.250> the<00:06:56.400> flame

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
so here you'll see that the flame

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.930 
so here you'll see that the flame
underneath<00:06:57.509> is<00:06:57.750> burning<00:06:58.110> bright<00:06:58.259> and<00:06:58.940> burning

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
underneath is burning bright and burning

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.909 
underneath is burning bright and burning
a<00:07:00.000> lot<00:07:00.120> of<00:07:00.180> the<00:07:00.509> wood<00:07:00.750> gas<00:07:00.960> and<00:07:01.259> this<00:07:01.410> in<00:07:01.710> the
