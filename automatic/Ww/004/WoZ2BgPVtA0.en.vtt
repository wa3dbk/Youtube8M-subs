00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and Emma was too small for that so we

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.899 
and Emma was too small for that so we
required<00:01:18.900> something<00:01:19.229> light<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> small<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
so that's where we we had this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.640 
so that's where we we had this
stratasys<00:01:27.210> 3d<00:01:27.659> printing<00:01:28.020> machine<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
stratasys 3d printing machine and I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
stratasys 3d printing machine and I
thought<00:01:28.920> well<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.579> could<00:01:29.610> print<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.299> for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
thought well we could print it out for

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
thought well we could print it out for
her<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.020> he<00:01:31.500> did<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.670> weight

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
her and he did it and the weight

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
her and he did it and the weight
difference<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> significant<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
difference is significant and for a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
difference is significant and for a
child<00:01:35.520> who<00:01:35.670> only<00:01:35.729> weighs<00:01:36.060> 25<00:01:36.570> pounds<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:37.229> makes

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
child who only weighs 25 pounds it makes

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.330 
child who only weighs 25 pounds it makes
a<00:01:37.650> big<00:01:37.829> difference

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a big difference

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.580 
a big difference
Whitney<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> Tareq<00:01:39.810> put<00:01:39.990> their<00:01:40.200> minds

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Whitney and Tareq put their minds

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.460 
Whitney and Tareq put their minds

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
without the 3d printer we would not be

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
without the 3d printer we would not be
in<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:02.010> position<00:02:02.220> we're<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.120> these

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that can go with them this is one of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.470 
that can go with them this is one of
those<00:02:09.500> industries<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:11.450> matches<00:02:12.450> perfectly

with 3d printing additive manufacturing
because<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.950> need<00:02:17.160> custom<00:02:17.640> everything

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
because we need custom everything

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.440 
because we need custom everything
I<00:02:18.240> think<00:02:18.660> 3d<00:02:19.140> scanning<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.310> printing

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
I think 3d scanning and printing

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.600 
I think 3d scanning and printing

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
program and print out another one and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.780 
program and print out another one and
it's<00:02:53.760> back<00:02:53.940> together<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:54.660> working

when she started to express herself we

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.580 
when she started to express herself we
would<00:03:00.580> go<00:03:00.700> upstairs<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.540> we<00:03:01.780> would<00:03:01.900> say<00:03:02.140> Emma

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
off of her on this one occasion to make

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.190 
off of her on this one occasion to make
some<00:03:11.980> adjustments<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.879> as<00:03:13.629> we<00:03:13.930> took<00:03:14.049> it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
some adjustments to it and as we took it

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.449 
some adjustments to it and as we took it
off<00:03:14.319> she<00:03:14.709> cried<00:03:15.190> out<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.640> want<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.780> we

off she cried out I want that and we

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.949 
off she cried out I want that and we
didn't<00:03:18.459> think<00:03:18.640> all<00:03:18.819> that<00:03:19.000> much<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.540> but

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
didn't think all that much of it but

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.619 
didn't think all that much of it but
when<00:03:20.620> mom<00:03:21.069> started<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.549> cry<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:24.569> people<00:03:25.569> we

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
and she kind of takes a moment to

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.740 
and she kind of takes a moment to
