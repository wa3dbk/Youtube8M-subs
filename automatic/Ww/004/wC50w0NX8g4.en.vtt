00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's a dream it makes it so much easier

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.360 
it's a dream it makes it so much easier
when<00:00:57.989> you've<00:00:58.140> got<00:00:58.260> players<00:00:58.530> around<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.039> who

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
when you've got players around you who

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.029 
when you've got players around you who
bust<00:01:00.090> their<00:01:00.300> butts<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> ball<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
bust their butts to get the ball and to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.319 
bust their butts to get the ball and to
do<00:01:02.190> their<00:01:02.340> best<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> beat<00:01:02.940> their<00:01:03.090> players

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
do their best and to beat their players

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.500 
do their best and to beat their players
it<00:01:03.570> makes<00:01:03.750> life<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.049> lot<00:01:04.140> easier<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.530> them

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.260 

I<00:01:08.540> think<00:01:09.050> you<00:01:09.860> train<00:01:10.160> harder<00:01:10.730> than<00:01:11.030> what<00:01:11.180> you

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
I think you train harder than what you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.180 
I think you train harder than what you
would<00:01:11.360> face<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.930> game<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.440> should<00:01:12.920> give<00:01:13.100> you

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
would face in a game it should give you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.950 
would face in a game it should give you
a<00:01:13.220> lot<00:01:13.430> of<00:01:13.460> confidence<00:01:13.940> when<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.540> are<00:01:14.690> in<00:01:14.870> a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
a lot of confidence when you are in a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.470 
a lot of confidence when you are in a
game<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.350> particularly<00:01:15.910> when<00:01:16.910> it<00:01:17.060> does<00:01:17.240> get

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
game and particularly when it does get

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.270 
game and particularly when it does get
down<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.900> those<00:01:18.050> sort<00:01:18.380> of<00:01:18.440> crunch<00:01:18.740> moments

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
down to those sort of crunch moments

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.450 
down to those sort of crunch moments
which<00:01:19.460> for<00:01:19.730> some<00:01:19.910> reason<00:01:19.960> continue<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.050> happen

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
which for some reason continue to happen

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.010 
which for some reason continue to happen
for<00:01:22.460> us<00:01:22.520> on<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.850> international<00:01:23.450> level<00:01:23.480> you

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
haven't taken any shortcuts and you can

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.300 
haven't taken any shortcuts and you can
really<00:01:29.390> back<00:01:29.600> yourself<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:30.350> going<00:01:30.920> out<00:01:31.100> there

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
really back yourself in going out there

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.880 
really back yourself in going out there
and<00:01:31.460> delivering<00:01:32.170> I'm<00:01:33.170> not<00:01:33.410> gonna<00:01:33.590> fail<00:01:33.830> I

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
and delivering I'm not gonna fail I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.890 
and delivering I'm not gonna fail I
can't<00:01:34.370> fail<00:01:34.760> that<00:01:35.450> feeling<00:01:35.900> is<00:01:36.020> worse<00:01:36.320> than

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
can't fail that feeling is worse than

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.660 
can't fail that feeling is worse than
you<00:01:38.900> know<00:01:39.050> dying<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.590> completing<00:01:40.490> something

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
you know dying and completing something

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.160 
you know dying and completing something
so<00:01:41.710> that's<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.520> mentality<00:01:43.880> keeps<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.960> I'm

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170
