00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
live and touchable I've had some

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.200 
live and touchable I've had some
troubles<00:02:04.680> where<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> opened<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.549> touchable<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
troubles where I opened up touchable and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.639 
troubles where I opened up touchable and
then<00:02:06.390> turn<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.780> network<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.409> didn't

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
then turn on my network and it didn't

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
then turn on my network and it didn't
quite<00:02:07.770> work<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:08.220> well<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:08.970> things

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
quite work out well so if you do things

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.119 
quite work out well so if you do things
in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.569> order<00:02:09.629> you'll<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.649> fine
