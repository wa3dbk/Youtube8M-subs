00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
organic if you start thinking that way I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.690 
organic if you start thinking that way I
believe<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.950> don't<00:02:10.190> really<00:02:10.280> need<00:02:10.520> to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
worry about how many calories does this

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.190 
worry about how many calories does this
have<00:02:16.490> because<00:02:16.880> your<00:02:17.300> body<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.660> gonna<00:02:17.840> process

have because your body is gonna process

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.470 
have because your body is gonna process
so<00:02:18.620> much<00:02:18.740> more<00:02:18.920> efficiently<00:02:19.310> once<00:02:19.640> it's<00:02:19.850> clean

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
so much more efficiently once it's clean

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.350 
so much more efficiently once it's clean
and<00:02:20.720> once<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.590> don't<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:22.550> all<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.790> process

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
and once you don't have all that process

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.840 
and once you don't have all that process
chemicals<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.230> stuff<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.800> your<00:02:25.010> food<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.640> that
