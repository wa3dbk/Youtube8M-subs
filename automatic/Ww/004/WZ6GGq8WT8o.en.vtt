00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 good kids we come back with the series of 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.990
 mini-analysis and today it's the class of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 engineer I know that you voted the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.070
 recognition class but in that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.920
 I could not because they were giving me 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.660
 constant ties now I have changed to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.190
 windows 8 of extruded gameplay for 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 engineer because the truth is that he had 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.880
 done the script for the class 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.070
 engineer and we are Spanish and he gives us 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.230
 stick to it then I hope you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 enjoy and is that if you look for the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
 beta of battlefield 4 it seems that you give 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.539
 decided to put a new weapon and one that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.040
 it was already and it will not be different for 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.649
 engineers where we will find a new 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000
 mx 4 and in the old vein 2000 the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.320
 change that has undoubtedly marked this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.360
 class is that now your weapons class 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.739
 predetermined are the submachine guns the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.300
 which agree better with what a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.520
 engineer would lead in a battle if 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.809
 out in vehicles obviously start 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.600
 with the data first the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.090
 cadence is 830 rounds per minute 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.219
 for the mx 4 and for the pt 2000 it will be 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.350
 650 rounds per minute which has not 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.030
 changed from battlefield 3 his 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.710
 kicks are pretty high on the shaft 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 vertical remember that the data in the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.940
 horizontal axis are not available yet 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.159
 but these weapons have a 100 a 0.52 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.859
 of vertical recoil for the mx 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.090
 and the huge drop of 0.77 for the 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.429
 2000 app was not so 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.409
 Quiet as before with respect to the rest 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.750
 of your statistics we see that these two 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 weapons are very changed by the fact 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 that there are very little things that improve 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.850
 much his hip game and his 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.380
 there's a short behavior here 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.789
 the first weapons in which I go to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.799
 thoroughly recommend Mixquic 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.049
 dearest micro bursts on everything 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.819
 for the 4 mx since the micros are 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.979
 santa's hand with this weapon for the lack 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.359
 of bullet deflection one thing that noticed in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.280
 both weapons is that sometimes has a 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.990
 weird behavior explained from time to time 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.549
 when it takes me four hours to kill 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 as it would be normal and sometimes 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.659
 practically at the same distance and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 remarked practically killed me 6 or 7 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.530
 shots that makes me think that the damage 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 falls very fast in these weapons and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.459
 obviously faster than in battlefield 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.379
 3 as accessories for the mx 4 you are looking for 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.000
 carry on lhasa ergo or even the 

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:55.890
 abnormal if we are lucky that we 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 tap in a battle pack regarding views 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 a metallic sight of the mx is quite 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 obstructive and they give us a reflex of 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.729
 series so I recommend you a lot 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
 put that in the second slot of 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.450
 accessory there are only two options the laser 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.160
 normal and the green laser and do the same 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.899
 so I recommend you take one of the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.130
 two then we will also have the assignment 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.660
 of cannon 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.090
 I put in compensator that improves 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.430
 very much this weapon since it reduces that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.110
 piece of vertical recoil for the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.330
 own 2000 I have almost no complaints 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.340
 apart from that his my daughter I would like that 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 outside battlefield 3 but I'm going to 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.360
 recommend the cobra anyway 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.850
 about handles the truth is that I think it's 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.560
 to have a great domain in the tree of 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.480
 battlefield 4 because he does not have any 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 cons and reduces the first setback what 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 2002 app that comes with luxury 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 shoot bursts on the laser to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.450
 the coolest fights the fill 4 as we see 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.430
 to sacrifice nothing because put it because 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.290
 not on the subject of accession is sample 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.820
 others specify a big change and it's 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.560
 that according to the published accessories 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.600
 we will have a kind of heavy cannon 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.700
 long cannon for all weapons which 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
 I think it's a little weird but good if I 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.690
 They give in a heavy cannon for the app 2000 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.160
 welcome is another remarkable change 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.140
 the accessories for these weapons is that 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.460
 we will no longer have the option of charger 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.780
 extended the truth is that I find 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.540
 pretty good we will not have to 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.830
 unblock the 60 deaths that god was 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.420
 has loaded extended that took away the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.130
 laser or the muffler and we can 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.530
 put more accessories what makes them 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.550
 rather better to this type of weapons the 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.200
 truth is that we do not have any 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.890
 new accessory for the class of 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.960
 engineer 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.610
 the end 4 but those that we brought from before 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.950
 have changed a bit in the first place in 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.510
 league and the stinger set even faster and 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.950
 the projectile also arrives faster 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.950
 which gives me that there's going to be a 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.300
 patch of slope on the rpg there 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.100
 another big change and that is if a 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.050
 fixed recognition to some vehicle with 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.940
 the binoculars we can fix that 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.550
 vehicle with the rpg which is very useful 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.709
 if they fix us a helicopter simply 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.650
 to fix with the rpg you have to follow 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.390
 then the vehicle because if not the rpg 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.819
 will lose the fixation that's like the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.200
 handicap that has this launcher 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.610
 talking about the rpg and also getting 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.260
 here to the spear pepos I have to 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.450
 say they are much better than in 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.130
 battlefield 3 where for me they were like 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.780
 they should be right now I would say that 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.760
 they are a little eighty two because they have 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.110
 many queues of metz but good everything is 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.000
 thing to expect that I think it's going to 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.580
 be early I hope that early 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.170
 they will realize the subject and what to tell you 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.790
 about the engineer class in general 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.350
 Well, the truth is that I think I'm going to 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.900
 play a lot more than in battlefield 3 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.160
 with this class I think that in fact 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.829
 engineers my least used class of 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.239
 battlefield 3 because as a player of 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.109
 infantry the truth is that 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:25.169
 and the carbines were good but not 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.310
 basically the class came to me 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.069
 however now with the submachine guns 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.660
 when you want to play is on a map 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.370
 we're not going to see so many 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.930
 doctors with their rifles but we 're going to 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.330
 see many engineers what will be 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.280
 a rather curious change and the truth 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.199
 is that I really like how they have 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.599
 left from the subject of the rpg yes 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.400
 all that very good change the jce and good 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.740
 kids that would be all for the guide of 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.210
 today the truth is that good today has been 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.840
 shorter than the other day and I'm going to 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.729
 explain why in principle I'm wrong 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.319
 I'm really bad I actually have a fever 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.610
 while I'm commenting and that's why 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.240
 so I'm commenting a bit more 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.159
 discouraged I also have allergy is a 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.020
 food is like a fatal combination 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.789
 here in toledo while you have the flu 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.889
 you have an allergy because we are very cool and 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.050
 we put plants we were up in the 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.210
 text up in the text of the clothes and 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.620
 but in the end is what there is so I hope 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.020
 get well soon to be able to 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.639
 tell you enough more videos other 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.949
 little thing that I was going to comment I have 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.810
 installed windows 8 cancer windows 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.220
 during the last years and because they have 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.930
 installed then well 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.360
 of windows 8 has optimized in my 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.580
 battlefield 4 apart from the patches of 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.170
 daisy all that the truth is that he has 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.930
 optimized to the point of having 100 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.330
 frames per second stable and good 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.400
 remove them lagazós remove everything and so you 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.720
 I can do the class guide 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.700
 recognition that whether you are 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.380
 waiting with which is a change 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.450
 quite remarkable if someone wants 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.980
 go to windows 8 because the truth is that 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.560
 I recommend that because it seems that 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.330
 will go much better battlefield 4 in this 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.310
 new operating system had a few 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.020
 kids and so if I stop boring 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.200
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.200
 next
