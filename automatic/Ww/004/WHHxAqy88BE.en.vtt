00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.690 
had some fun with that but overall the
pvm<00:03:13.870> event<00:03:14.200> failed<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.920> really<00:03:15.280> there<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.550> no

footage<00:03:20.470> i'm<00:03:20.650> sorry<00:03:20.860> i<00:03:20.950> couldn't<00:03:21.220> really<00:03:21.310> show

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
footage i'm sorry i couldn't really show

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.770 
footage i'm sorry i couldn't really show
anything<00:03:21.820> because<00:03:22.090> there<00:03:22.269> really<00:03:22.450> wasn't

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
anything because there really wasn't

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.259 
anything because there really wasn't
anything<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:23.890> hopefully<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.610> next<00:03:24.820> event

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
anything but hopefully the next event

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.180 
anything but hopefully the next event
will<00:03:25.360> be<00:03:25.600> better<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.019> i'm<00:03:26.620> probably<00:03:26.860> going<00:03:27.100> to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
will be better and i'm probably going to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.150 
will be better and i'm probably going to
skip<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.640> 3k<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.209> 4k<00:03:28.660> events<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.230> maybe<00:03:29.950> just

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
skip the 3k in 4k events and maybe just

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.910 
skip the 3k in 4k events and maybe just
wait<00:03:30.340> until<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.640> 5k<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.810> for<00:03:32.500> sure<00:03:32.530> will

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
wait until the 5k so I for sure will

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.130 
wait until the 5k so I for sure will
have<00:03:33.100> people<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.730> maybe<00:03:34.269> by<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.570> time<00:03:34.690> I'm<00:03:35.019> at

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
have people and maybe by the time I'm at

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.500 
have people and maybe by the time I'm at
5k<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.070> enough<00:03:36.340> good<00:03:36.610> internet<00:03:37.000> to
