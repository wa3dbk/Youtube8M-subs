that<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:22.859> last<00:00:23.160> night<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> decided<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
that well last night so I decided not to

that well last night so I decided not to
record<00:00:25.140> much<00:00:25.849> so<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.740> this

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
i recommend going for the lower

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.219 
i recommend going for the lower
killstreaks<00:01:01.980> even<00:01:02.250> though<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.809> do

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

to do to do you do em still like
continued<00:01:08.340> rather<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.659> game

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
continued rather I think in this game

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590 
continued rather I think in this game
might<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> UAV<00:01:11.000> napalm<00:01:12.000> strike<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
might go for the UAV napalm strike and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
might go for the UAV napalm strike and
the<00:01:13.080> black<00:01:13.260> bear<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> pretty<00:01:14.189> pretty

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
some action in the game and so I think

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.920 
some action in the game and so I think
the<00:02:53.519> sounds<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.000> ribbon<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> farmers<00:02:54.780> with

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the sounds is ribbon the farmers with

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.869 
the sounds is ribbon the farmers with
the<00:02:54.989> silence<00:02:55.379> as<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.709> see<00:02:55.859> here<00:02:56.129> it's<00:02:56.579> pretty

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
the silence as you see here it's pretty

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.940 
the silence as you see here it's pretty
it's<00:02:57.359> still<00:02:57.660> pretty<00:02:57.870> powerful<00:02:58.260> compared<00:02:58.859> to

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
it's still pretty powerful compared to

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.830 
it's still pretty powerful compared to
all<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.069> guns<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.549> not<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.909> you<00:03:00.480> drop<00:03:00.720> them

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840
