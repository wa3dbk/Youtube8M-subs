00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.410
 among so many cases that we have 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.420
 listened to and that have spread by 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 Internet and the different means of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 communication maybe this is one of the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.710
 more intriguing stories that do exist 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.860
 I present to ben hammam a man falling 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 you may not know that I myself do not 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.200
 I know no one so far 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.699
 affirms to know it and the most surprising thing 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.039
 that even he does not know who you are 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.739
 imagine the terrifying and overwhelming 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.199
 that would be to see yourself in a mirror 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.379
 and not knowing who you are, what is your 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.699
 Identify your name your relatives and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.260
 friends do not know about them or about yourself 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.269
 wake up one day and not have a past 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.420
 that gives you the reason why you're there 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:01.350
 and what is your destiny like a leaf in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 white without destination or origin you can 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.799
 imagine that something like this happen to you running 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.079
 the year 2004 on the outskirts of a burger 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.600
 king on richmond hill of georgia a 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.340
 man is fallen behind the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 fast food establishment is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.259
 find unconscious without belongings 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.560
 and he just left him burned 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.810
 the skin after being discovered the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 man can barely see the falls 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.190
 they have almost left him blind and unable to 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.620
 articulate a single word 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.830
 that dying man was quickly 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.050
 driven to a hospital because the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.690
 health care center already had between its 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.390
 patients to other subjects without identity 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.780
 and as is customary in that country they are 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.770
 called johndroe to this they adopted the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.180
 name should they call kyle is 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.600
 incredibly it would be the name that 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.000
 I would choose forever 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.049
 once he was assisted by the staff 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.770
 doctor began the questions of rigor 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.659
 as the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.909
 interrogation that the unknown 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.610
 man the astonishment that invading the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.040
 faces of the medical staff the man does not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.860
 he was able to answer assertively none 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.200
 question about who was his life 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.110
 itself or how it had come up 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.270
 those deplorable conditions are 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.870
 I found much more amazed than 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.239
 same interrogators finally the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.519
 specialists diagnosed him with amnesia 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.069
 post traumatic and despite being 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.530
 they took the fingerprints they did not 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.170
 could determine who it is so in 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.209
 rigor mathematically that man does not 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.739
 existed in the databases of 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.739
 people in usa 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.910
 from there the life of ben hammam 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.490
 begins to become very difficult 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.920
 of an identity and without any family member or 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.050
 friend who could help him man 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.350
 begins to wander between loneliness and 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.300
 helplessness no work is accepted 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.120
 because he did not have a number of 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.240
 social security and could not receive 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.820
 no state aid his despair 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.740
 came to benjamÃ£n to register in the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.440
 list of people reported as 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.230
 disappeared becoming the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 first person wanted to register 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.590
 personally his terrible condition of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.380
 bewilderment at the impossibility of 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.900
 know where he came from and who he was 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.870
 forced to roam the streets and adopt 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.280
 the life of a vagabond the authorities 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.890
 they refused to give him a new number 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.450
 due to the legal complexities that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.430
 this implied 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.680
 because the history of man without 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.200
 origin was popularized and managed to get 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.450
 up to the media the 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.610
 state of florida issued a document of 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.370
 identity that allowed him to regularize in 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.920
 part their employment situation being 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.739
 accepted as an employee in a restaurant 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.870
 although the authorities still refuse to return 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.410
 to provide a new insurance number 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.870
 social in the face of the outrageous case of 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.060
 benjamin kyle have been created various 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.519
