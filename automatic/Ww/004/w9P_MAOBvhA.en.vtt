I'm on the Monte Carlo mc5 and I'm gonna

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.060 
I'm on the Monte Carlo mc5 and I'm gonna
say<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> full-si<00:00:12.509> trial<00:00:12.889> now<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:13.980> course

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
say that the full-si trial now of course

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.259 
say that the full-si trial now of course
when<00:00:14.280> we're<00:00:14.429> getting<00:00:14.670> ready<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.059> underway

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
when we're getting ready to get underway

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.670 
when we're getting ready to get underway
one<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.080> things<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.560> do

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
one of the first things we have to do

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.760 
one of the first things we have to do
the<00:00:17.100> daily<00:00:17.310> engine<00:00:17.699> checks<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> mc5<00:00:19.320> it's

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the daily engine checks and the mc5 it's

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.070 
the daily engine checks and the mc5 it's
under<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> hatch<00:00:20.220> right<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> cockpit

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.330 

well<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> stairs<00:00:25.500> lead<00:00:25.710> us<00:00:25.859> directly<00:00:26.189> in

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
well the stairs lead us directly in

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.980 
well the stairs lead us directly in
between<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:26.939> engines<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> daily

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
between the two engines so the daily

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.390 
between the two engines so the daily
engine<00:00:28.349> checks<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.890> easy

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
engine checks are going to be easy

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
engine checks are going to be easy
the<00:00:29.550> engines<00:00:29.849> are<00:00:29.939> connected<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> pods<00:00:30.720> by

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the engines are connected to the pods by

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
the engines are connected to the pods by
jack<00:00:31.349> shafts<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> pods<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.550> located<00:00:32.940> in

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
jack shafts so the pods are located in

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.830 
jack shafts so the pods are located in
the<00:00:33.210> lazarette<00:00:35.149> now<00:00:36.149> let's<00:00:36.360> take<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> look<00:00:36.750> at

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.190 
the side decks the rails come up plenty
high<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.120> I'd<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> grab<00:00:39.870> handle

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
high but I'd like to see a grab handle

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.979 
high but I'd like to see a grab handle
here<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> ease<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:40.980> transmission<00:00:41.760> up

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
here just to ease the transmission up

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
here just to ease the transmission up
another<00:00:42.989> rail<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> along<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> side<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
flying bridge and at this point the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.639 
flying bridge and at this point the
rails<00:00:47.730> come<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.860> 29<00:00:49.860> inches<00:00:50.460> you've<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.649> 19

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
rails come up 29 inches you've got 19

inches of space on the side deck and
notice<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.930> low<00:00:55.289> point<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> deck<00:00:56.219> will

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
notice this low point on the deck will

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.150 
notice this low point on the deck will
allow<00:00:56.940> water<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> run<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.109> side<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.620> now

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
allow water to run out the side and now

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799
