00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780 
that and really I think during that time
frame<00:01:22.500> between<00:01:22.650> those<00:01:22.979> two<00:01:23.130> records<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.549> lot<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
frame between those two records a lot of

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
frame between those two records a lot of
people<00:01:23.970> wondered<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.509> maybe<00:01:24.659> killing<00:01:25.020> peace

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
people wondered if maybe killing peace

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.899 
people wondered if maybe killing peace
was<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> one-off<00:01:25.950> album<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.580> wasn't

be like Tokyo Drift onslaught edition or
something<00:03:58.510> like<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.660> which<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:58.960> just<00:03:59.140> really

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
something like that which is just really

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.070 
something like that which is just really
retarded<00:03:59.760> however<00:04:00.760> as<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.090> furiously<00:04:01.780> make

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
retarded however as you furiously make

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.990 
retarded however as you furiously make
your<00:04:02.230> way<00:04:02.350> through<00:04:02.380> this<00:04:02.680> album<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.850> almost

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
your way through this album it almost

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.060 
your way through this album it almost
feels<00:04:04.360> as<00:04:04.480> though<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.900> amount<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.650> animosity

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
feels as though the amount of animosity

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.000 
feels as though the amount of animosity
sort<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.670> builds<00:04:07.060> with<00:04:07.180> each<00:04:07.300> passing<00:04:07.540> track

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
sort of builds with each passing track

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.800 
sort of builds with each passing track
and<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.550> actually<00:04:09.730> leads<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.360> pretty

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
and that actually leads to a pretty

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.300 
and that actually leads to a pretty
unique<00:04:10.990> listening<00:04:11.560> experience<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.250> the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
unique listening experience in the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.400 
unique listening experience in the
thrash<00:04:12.550> metal<00:04:12.700> department<00:04:13.270> which<00:04:13.510> really<00:04:14.290> it

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
thrash metal department which really it

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.130 
thrash metal department which really it
just<00:04:14.440> feels<00:04:14.830> like<00:04:14.980> as<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.600> album<00:04:16.600> has<00:04:16.750> pressed

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
just feels like as the album has pressed

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.750 
just feels like as the album has pressed
on<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.350> as<00:04:17.650> they<00:04:17.830> continue<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.340> write<00:04:18.489> for<00:04:18.670> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
on and as they continue to write for the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.520 
on and as they continue to write for the
record<00:04:19.030> they<00:04:19.239> just<00:04:19.480> kind<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.930> got<00:04:20.049> pissed<00:04:20.380> off

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
record they just kind of got pissed off

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.560 
record they just kind of got pissed off
more<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.040> more<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.370> more<00:04:21.580> and<00:04:21.790> they've<00:04:22.480> been

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
more and more and more and they've been

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.610 
more and more and more and they've been
able<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.810> explode

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
able to explode

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.000 
able to explode
energy<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:25.150> really<00:04:25.449> release<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:25.900> energy

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
energy and really release that energy

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.620 
energy and really release that energy
with<00:04:27.010> greater<00:04:27.340> ferocity<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.030> with<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> greater

with greater ferocity and with a greater
you<00:04:29.110> know<00:04:29.260> heightened<00:04:29.949> sense<00:04:30.310> of<00:04:30.430> just<00:04:30.940> rage

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
you know heightened sense of just rage

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.990 
you know heightened sense of just rage
out<00:04:31.780> as<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.979> tracks<00:04:33.250> kind<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.610> continue

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
out as the tracks kind of continue

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.510 
out as the tracks kind of continue
onward<00:04:34.590> what<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:35.710> get<00:04:35.919> actually<00:04:36.340> is

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
onward what you get actually is

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.580 
onward what you get actually is
definitely<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.240> furious<00:04:37.690> album<00:04:38.110> one<00:04:38.290> that<00:04:38.410> may

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
definitely a furious album one that may

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.050 
definitely a furious album one that may
not<00:04:38.770> quite<00:04:39.010> compare<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:39.729> sounds<00:04:40.000> of

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
not quite compare to the sounds of

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.629 
not quite compare to the sounds of
violence<00:04:40.419> and<00:04:40.540> one<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.410> think<00:04:41.500> really<00:04:41.919> out

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
violence and one that I think really out

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.070 
violence and one that I think really out
of<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.850> three<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.300> kind<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.630> a<00:04:43.690> distant<00:04:44.050> third

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
of the three is kind of a distant third

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.469 
of the three is kind of a distant third
but<00:04:44.590> here's<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.190> thing<00:04:45.340> here's<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.360> thing

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
but here's the thing here's the thing

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.450 
but here's the thing here's the thing
about<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.930> being<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.199> distant<00:04:47.620> third<00:04:47.650> and

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
about it being a distant third and

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.800 
about it being a distant third and
that's<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.760> fact<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:49.060> even<00:04:49.360> though<00:04:49.630> is<00:04:49.780> a

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
that's the fact that even though is a

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.450 
that's the fact that even though is a
distant<00:04:50.260> third<00:04:50.290> it's<00:04:50.560> still<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.770> damn<00:04:51.100> fine

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
distant third it's still a damn fine

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.670

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
this is just something where they were

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.659 
this is just something where they were
