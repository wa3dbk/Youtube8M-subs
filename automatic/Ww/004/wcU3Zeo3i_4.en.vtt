heavier<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.760> our<00:02:21.030> RDW<00:02:21.990> boat<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.710> had

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
heavier in our RDW boat we had

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.140 
heavier in our RDW boat we had
lightweight<00:02:23.370> cables

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
lightweight cables

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.229 
lightweight cables
everything<00:02:24.900> weight<00:02:25.379> was<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.830> issue<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.459> this

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
everything weight was an issue on this

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.059 
everything weight was an issue on this
we<00:02:27.840> were<00:02:27.930> only<00:02:28.049> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.319> be<00:02:28.409> racing<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.040> a

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
we were only going to be racing for a

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.600 
we were only going to be racing for a
maximum<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.819> three<00:02:30.180> hours<00:02:30.620> maybe<00:02:31.620> maybe<00:02:32.099> well

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
maximum of three hours maybe maybe well

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.880 
maximum of three hours maybe maybe well
normally<00:02:33.209> two<00:02:33.510> hours<00:02:33.840> two<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> half<00:02:34.440> hours

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
normally two hours two and a half hours

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.699 
normally two hours two and a half hours
so<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.209> know<00:02:36.360> you're<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:37.049> really<00:02:37.500> that

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
so you know you're not really that

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.800 
so you know you're not really that
fatigued<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.239> everything<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
fatigued and you just want everything to

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.949 
fatigued and you just want everything to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
work 100% but to be honest I've not even

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.750
