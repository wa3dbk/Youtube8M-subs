three-dimensional and not pokemon 3d as
you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.640> actually<00:00:26.640> much<00:00:26.970> better

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.189 
you can see it's actually much better
textures<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.680> i<00:00:29.750> guess<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.019> say

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
textures and not so i guess you can say

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.670 
textures and not so i guess you can say
pixelated<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.730> 3d<00:00:33.270> game<00:00:33.440> because<00:00:34.440> he<00:00:34.530> has

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
pixelated it's a 3d game because he has

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
pixelated it's a 3d game because he has
like<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> dragon<00:00:35.399> ball<00:00:35.550> z<00:00:35.790> type<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.270> look<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
like a dragon ball z type of look on the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
like a dragon ball z type of look on the
character<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.260> yeah<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:39.329> pretty<00:00:39.510> much

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
character but yeah it's just pretty much

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.069 
character but yeah it's just pretty much
pokemon<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.070> 3d<00:00:41.430> form<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.480> running

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
pokemon in the 3d form and it's running

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.150 
pokemon in the 3d form and it's running
pretty<00:00:43.200> smooth<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> work-in-progress

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
pretty smooth for a work-in-progress

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
pretty smooth for a work-in-progress
it's<00:00:44.700> not<00:00:45.059> completely<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.899> yet<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.789> it's<00:00:48.530> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it's not completely out yet and it's the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.840 
it's not completely out yet and it's the
controls<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.010> kind<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.219> rough<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> i<00:00:50.670> think

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
controls are kind of rough and i think

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
controls are kind of rough and i think
it<00:00:50.940> runs<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.270> unity<00:00:52.370> hmm<00:00:54.079> i'm<00:00:55.079> assuming<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it runs on unity hmm i'm assuming it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.680 
it runs on unity hmm i'm assuming it
runs<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.949> unity<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.460> yeah<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.420> very

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
runs on unity but yeah it's not a very

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.830 
runs on unity but yeah it's not a very
big<00:00:57.809> world<00:00:58.260> yet<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.520> i'm<00:00:59.670> pretty<00:00:59.879> sure<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
big world yet but i'm pretty sure in the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.130 
big world yet but i'm pretty sure in the
upcoming<00:01:01.530> updates<00:01:02.160> there<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.329> bigger

it's very it's pretty good for starting

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.480 
it's very it's pretty good for starting
off<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.439> work<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.710> progress<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.250> stuff

off with the work in progress and stuff
there's<00:01:51.390> four<00:01:51.630> different<00:01:51.689> moves<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.350> think

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
there's four different moves I think
