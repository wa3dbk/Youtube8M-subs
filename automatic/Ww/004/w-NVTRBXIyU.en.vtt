it's<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:25.970> manual<00:02:26.420> mode<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:27.819> would<00:02:28.819> say<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.090> off<00:02:29.329> oh

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.220 

by<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.560> way<00:02:33.709> just<00:02:33.799> as<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:34.159> note<00:02:34.400> my<00:02:34.930> packs<00:02:35.930> up

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
by the way just as a note my packs up

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.280 
by the way just as a note my packs up
here<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:37.599> use<00:02:38.599> while<00:02:38.870> I'm<00:02:38.959> setting

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
here just to use while I'm setting

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.199 
here just to use while I'm setting
everything<00:02:39.500> up<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.859> four<00:02:43.159> so<00:02:43.400> four<00:02:43.970> two

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
everything up just to four so four two

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.490 
everything up just to four so four two
two<00:02:44.720> cell<00:02:44.989> batteries<00:02:45.819> okay

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
two cell batteries okay

00:02:47.500 --> 00:03:04.670 
two cell batteries okay
blinking<00:02:48.500> stopped<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:52.299> try

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:18.920 

I<00:03:04.709> think<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.700> way

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.860 

nothing<00:03:19.739> nothing<00:03:20.340> nothing<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.480> set

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
nothing nothing nothing I do have it set

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.550 
nothing nothing nothing I do have it set
so<00:03:24.920> failsafe<00:03:25.920> works<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.560> mix<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:30.560> it'll

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
so failsafe works I have a mix so it'll

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.259 
so failsafe works I have a mix so it'll
go<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.950> feel<00:03:32.129> safe<00:03:32.370> when<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.700> click<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.150> mix

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
go in to feel safe when I click the mix

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.710 
go in to feel safe when I click the mix
but<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:37.129> motors<00:03:38.129> don't<00:03:38.280> start<00:03:38.640> again<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.390> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
but the motors don't start again here a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.880 
but the motors don't start again here a
sec<00:03:39.989> less<00:03:40.680> lives<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:42.000> that's<00:03:42.930> my<00:03:43.140> man<00:03:43.349> I<00:03:43.650> think

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
sec less lives and that's my man I think

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.149 
sec less lives and that's my man I think
after<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:45.000> finished<00:03:45.689> doing<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.109> I'm<00:03:46.620> going<00:03:47.010> to

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
after I finished doing this I'm going to

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.509 
after I finished doing this I'm going to
try<00:03:48.140> bringing<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.260> firmware<00:03:49.530> back<00:03:49.980> down<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.489> I

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
try bringing the firmware back down to I

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.479 
try bringing the firmware back down to I
think<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:50.970> 1.8<00:03:51.569> or<00:03:51.780> two<00:03:51.989> just<00:03:52.319> like<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.680> and

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
think it's 1.8 or two just like that and

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.960 
think it's 1.8 or two just like that and
see<00:03:53.760> if<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.090> any<00:03:54.239> luck<00:03:54.389> with<00:03:54.420> that

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
see if I have any luck with that

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.209 
see if I have any luck with that
there<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.060> go
