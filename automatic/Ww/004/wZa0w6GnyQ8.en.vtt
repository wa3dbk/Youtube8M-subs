00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.750
 on the beach man presents 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.180
 How to check the thermal fuse 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.170
 let me show you how to check the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.270
 thermal fuse 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.600
 disconnect the dryer from the outlet 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.540
 on the wall to remove the panel 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.960
 front you first need to remove the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.450
 door to remove the door you have to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.760
 remove these two screws 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.400
 after removing the two screws 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.830
 grab the door and lift the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.470
 unhook the door hinges 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.840
 from the front panel and remove the door 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.270
 you also have to remove these two 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.270
 plastic pieces with the two screws 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.810
 you need to use a screwdriver 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.600
 flat tip to disengage the panel 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.340
 of the hooks on the top and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.530
 you also have to lift the panel 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.320
 for from his court what of the two hooks 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.970
 in the bottom part unhook the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.970
 panel and remove what 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.290
 now you have access to the thermal fuse 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.680
 to check it configure your multimeter 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.299
 on the lowest scale to read union 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.820
 to make sure your multimeter 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.729
 is working properly before 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.250
 use it try it this way when 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.009
 the multimeter's test leads do not 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.500
 they are touching each other reading 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.439
 it must be infinite and when they are touching 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.979
 one to the other the reading should be close 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.740
 of 0 years the thermal fuse is 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.110
 located in the exhaust pipe next to the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.880
 operating thermostat 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 disconnect one of the wires from 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.680
 thermal fuse 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.740
 I took a reading between the two 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.780
 terminals in the thermal fuse the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.350
 multimeter should read near zero or 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.930
 less chile and infinity the fuse 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.380
 thermal is melted and must be 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.580
 replace to replace it 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.580
 remove the two wires 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.840
 and remove the blown fuse 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.750
 put the new fuse in its place 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.180
 and with the tele the two wires 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.630
 it does not matter which wire connects to what 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.630
 terminal 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.360
 when the thermal fuse blows 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.940
 the thermostat must also be replaced 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.150
 of operation at the same time for 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.360
 replace it remove the thermostat without 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.540
 disconnect the wires 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.970
 install the new thermostat and secure it 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.370
 with the two screws remove and 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.130
 transfer the wires one by one from 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.080
 old thermostat to the new one that way 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.890
 will connect them in the terminals 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.890
 suitable 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.890
 now you just have to install the panel 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.180
 front and door panel hook 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.180
 on the hooks below 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.660
 and on the hooks above 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.190
 put the two plastic pieces with the 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:27.200
 two screws in place fit the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.200
 door hinges in place 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.750
 and secure the hinges with both 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.750
 screws 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.209
 close the door 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.970
 and that was the way to check and 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.849
 replace the thermal fuse to see
