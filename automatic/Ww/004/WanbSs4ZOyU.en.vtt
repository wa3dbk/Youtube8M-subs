00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.920
 what happened was the one that the 22 commenting 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.160
 a bad flip 4 video but it's not a 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.930
 departure as I have accustomed but 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.190
 how to create classes worth 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.190
 has to kill them 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.919
 I was asked by an average kid who 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.489
 I create the classes because they see a folio 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.109
 now I will explain it from the xbox vale 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.930
 from the game but first I'm going to 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.489
 explain from here as you will see I have the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.089
 prize is to say that we are going to be able 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:43.610
 enjoy all the maps and so on 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.620
 I hope this does not look good but I 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.740
 I think that it will be seen translating 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.070
 but good 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.700
 as you will see I show you my statistics 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.940
 here you can create 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.150
 emblems I have the emblem from s 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.720
 this can be changed if you have the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.780
 premium, I already have it 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.400
 these these eight soldiers and this what 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.350
 you have to give what was 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.380
 bad pack is ok but good what we came 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.320
 what I wanted to say for example 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.500
 there is the kind of assault worth engineer 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:33.460
 support and sniper I have in the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:36.549
 pan the m 4 16 for example let's 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.170
 by avoiding this class that is what I have 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.090
 more things when we put here 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.310
 we puncture the main weapon and it comes out 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.409
 the main weapon and all accessories 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.920
 that we have for example and here next 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.050
 we get all the weapons that we have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.780
 unlocked and what we have left 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.440
 block for example the m16 to 4 block 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.200
 can block it about 8,000 points 7 thousand 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.060
 points about here you have it 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.250
 then comes link z800 5 and so 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.940
 successively for example then the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 carbines etc all this is worth everything 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.220
 this is unlocked in the class it's worth in 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 the same class we have all this for 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.910
 put him in the assault class what 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 happens that this weapon is worth assault rifles 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.910
 good assault rifles to it he pointed it 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.080
 are the specialized weapons of this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.630
 class 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.600
 so for example, let's say 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.240
 what you are is that the last 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.610
 unlocked we add it and we give it to 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.500
 little symbol says it's a gear 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 we put the look that looks we have then 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.450
 we look and I the only one that I have 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.820
 unblock is then put it then 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.440
 accessories as accessories we have 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.130
 then one we put the being for example 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.800
 good better 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.980
 - Look, we're going now for the kings 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 lighter with the m 416 we puncture the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.930
 we have the holographic symbol 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.620
 we have link we have 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.790
 I do not know if this how it would translate I think 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.540
 that the long cannon can be the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.790
 economic costs and then camouflaging them 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.159
 camouflage you usually have is 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.079
 effect we're going and these two I think 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.420
 to these two I think I had it without being 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.830
 award and then already being prize for 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.010
 these two 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.560
 by bad pack or unblock and all these 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.240
 some are a prize others are not 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.010
 premium there you have it 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.310
 naval frigate I think it's called this and 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.990
 I have the one of none I do not know I like the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.270
 White 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.170
 the truth that I'm cool then the lady knows 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.930
 and it was saved later when we arrived at the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.280
 game we're going to have all these classes 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.800
 it's ok and then the helicopters 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.280
 vehicles etc etcetera 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.200
 there you have it then in case you do not have and 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.250
 this applies 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.160
 a fairly accurate way of knowing 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.950
 how much you have left to unlock it 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.160
 here it's worth to me I stay here as I say 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.400
 7,000 points here I have a little bit left 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.400
 plus 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.770
 here we go 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.240
 I've played the support class 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.780
 taste here we have all support alarm 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.670
 all engineer personal weapons 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.460
 all faces good these are staples 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.890
 francs for saying so is worth all the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.570
 francs for example here I have a 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.790
 star in this frank the truth that I 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.680
 it's quite liking already I have this 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:08.440
 frank but I do not like the weapon so much 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.150
 secondary and for example the grenades and 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.700
 I have them all are worth all 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.430
 unlocked and the fiber knife 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:21.870
 carbon that they give you with the prize worth 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.280
 said this in the game and now I will 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.600
 in the game 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.630
 now I will get into the game I do 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:34.150
 different because in the main menu 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:37.180
 I think remember does not come as 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.250
 you create your classes but well now I'm leaving 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.510
 to the game and now we see it worth up to 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.030
 now kids 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.120
 well nothing like 10 is worth here we have 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:52.270
 all the classes we have done 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:54.520
 in total roast m 4 to 16 mx 4 in the 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.930
 engineer in support the only one that I have 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.420
 worth and the franc record that I have more 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.820
 things are worth 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.310
 and you will say good and this can not be done 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.020
 in the main menu you can not do 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.030
 in the main menu you have to be 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.930
 within a game and right now 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:17.550
 within a game like bryce is worth 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:21.539
 it's very easy, you just put what 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.400
 come on we go what suits us best 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.850
 I usually take measurements of 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.900
 short range in assault those long 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.720
 reach in recognition or on the playing card 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:38.509
 of ballet and now obviated a trick and 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.509
 that more or less explained how I know 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:43.469
 the character is edited is this 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.499
 camouflage 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:50.669
 by the way fall of the soldier is worth if you 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:53.600
 you realize change soldier worth and the 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:57.730
 camouflage we already have the weapon 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.730
 since the weapon is simply worth 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.150
 Another trick that I wanted to teach it 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.060
 I'm going out there will not last many videos 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:09.600
 of the quiet game we give to the 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.750
 pause is the same in this case and as 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.560
 you will see here I have forty minutes good 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:19.710
 44 minutes of 25% increase point 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.900
 of XP of experience points is worth how 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.419
 you get that that is achieved through 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.960
 bad stack ok for example I have one of 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:33.720
 silver that at level 24 I'm in the 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:36.690
 level if I 'm not wrong 22 ok it gives me a 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:40.640
 peace battle can give you more or look or 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.640
 camouflage or they can give you 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.849
 the score increase of 50 per 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:50.280
 One hundred and twenty percent is worth more to kill 35 

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.919
 percent ok I hope you have 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.629
 liked the video that you go a little more 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:59.849
 clear and when and when they know 

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:04.409
 best classes the best weapons good 

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:06.810
 the best weapon and etcetera best accessory 

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:09.660
 Etcetera, I'll tell you 

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:13.700
 then nothing kids subscribe comment 

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.700
 and see you next video, bye bye
