00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.349
 the main product which accounts 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.200
 sell it yourself and here this one 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.760
 thought I should not give you the goods 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.379
 rest but even I product 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.120
 being there as a consultant 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.159

 exercise which is called 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.980

 even the opposite is destructive for his 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:35.389
 brand in a lot lost and very 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.849

 just warning such cases were 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.680
 I remember many years ago I was at 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.229
 I have such a friend here he has a son 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.240

 He sent it to me in the PR expert 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.860
 I sent him an internship PR 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.250
 will start accordingly after some 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.620
 time 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.840
 I asked them about the rock there I wonder 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.400
 asked the chief boss, she 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.400
 something guy does not show 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.729
 interest in public relations, I sat down with him 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.380
 drawing pr life cramped gas too 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.940
 much are you an adult man in 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.780
 essentially there have long known each other 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.740
 listen no menu absolutely not like 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.690
 let me introduce other people 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.909
 there is a grocery market 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.550
 communication analyst friend 100 you 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.530
 hook and start we have was such 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.000
 analyst guy very traverse terrible 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.250
 when talking to you and not in your eyes 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.840
 look and when he lifts those eyes 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.930
 I such calculations there such Excel 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.550
 tables runs I sent it to this 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.199
 the guy thought he didn't know in five 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.840
 minutes and then pops up as scalded and 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.759
 suddenly it means 5 here we are half an hour i 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.650
 gazing into each other's eyes looks about 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.960
 something to talk about it comes out like 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.979
 I understand the analyst is mine now she 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.659
 works in one of the major 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.240
 investment banks there every year 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:37.030
 send me dear enough gifts 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.979
 On new year and says here I know day 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.380
 when i was born in was then decor i 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.669
 met your analyst therefore 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.199
 once again it is quite possible when you will 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.090
 do a swot analysis you find yourself 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.740
 the next thing is life cycle 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.419
 I warned you too that it is very 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.130
 important thing is life and cycle 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.880
 Again, some parallel between the business 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.530
 and 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.060
 you life cycle and then when you 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.190
 product to market in these according to 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.990
 this life cycle you have a stage 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.039
 preparing to enter the market you have 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.009
 market entry 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:08.770
 growth saturation decline and passing through these 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.719
 stages you conduct your product and 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.909
 earn differently see the scale 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:14.770
 time scale of money accordingly when 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.729
 you see the goods on the market you carry 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.409
 some costs 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.210
 minus and then you start earning 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.220
 more more more more 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.870
 so that's not only the life cycle 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.000
 products it is not only a computer 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.039
 corporations from any of you oasis 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.259
 love him very much each of us 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.240
 each of us goes through such 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.030
 life cycle telling on yourself 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.530
 once upon a time ago igor mann not even 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.759
 was engaged in marketing he was just 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.280
 Moscow Institute teacher 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.199
 the zegor controls the grooms for and then 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.150
 students pushed him out of this university 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:47.080
 the words igor sore so clever 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.060
 enough for us to hang noodles on your ears go 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.740
 earn money I became a manager 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.960
 marketing communications start 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.250
 of my career then I became commercial 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.229

 marketing in Russia then cis countries 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:00.880
 then I became and it was probably the highest 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.759
 stage of my career I reached maturity I 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.020
 became the regional director of 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.150

 europe dipped stand africa i even 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.699
 then jump not yet given Italy 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.229
 Spain France Portugal gave Europe 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.770
 almost everything except Great Britain 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:19.300
 Germany 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.620
 but it was just a higher coil I understood 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.720
 what the vice president of marketing 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.759
 American companies need to become a screen 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.800

 of course, just great experts on 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:32.080
 marketer and I looked at our 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.820

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.550
 how to the moon 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:39.090
 year I just understood that this is the highest result 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.090
 my career
