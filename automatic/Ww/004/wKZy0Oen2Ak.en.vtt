00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello I chris hoy I thought so 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.950
 have a kelek tip for you so me 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.400
 did not think so but I thought 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.130
 I have too much 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.260
 i have quite a few days ago 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 with the topic of school care et cetera 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 busy because shoes is always like that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.660
 an investment that is really 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.580
 nothing cheap let's say it like this and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 I think you should then too 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 Accordingly , we have to maintain 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.090
 really all not too much money and want 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.239
 not throw it out the window and me 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.969
 I just noticed the better with me 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.730
 my studies g or even if they too 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 home, the better I handle it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.190
 The longer they hold me all the more 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.600
 more beautiful is the shape and all the more beautiful 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.390
 see it looks 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 accordingly, I'm pretty 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.680
 intensively concerned with the topic 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.370
 and found some tools 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.619
 least expensive as you might 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.340
 I have already noticed, I love my eyes 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.119
 never boots hot and heartfelt so that it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.430
 really was that and the problem is 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.439
 the cigna so long only they are yes 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 have a very high shaft and it 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.420
 keeps ringing me off and it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.270
 makes quite unsightly cracks in the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.250
 suede and it really is there 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 I think about it all the time okay 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.810
 I can not do that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 The boots can of course be bent off 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 I do not have the luxury to hang up 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.729
 I have so much space for my 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.729
 to hang shoes 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.860
 I have a shoe store that I completely 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.509
 Cheap got on ebay 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.149
 I am also solo 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.180
 student pm hunter and then have a look 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.560
 researched okay what do you do with it 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.570
 Boots so it does not bend it 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.939
 there are so many possibilities and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.950
 I have now found these parts here 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.479
 I ordered that on Amazon 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.710
 Link all the left you also like 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.969
 times in the infobox simple 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.280
 Plastic plates that you can bend 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.349
 and are just 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.959
 trapezoidal and these plates 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.750
 I agreed and then put them in 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.200
 my boots and it does not matter how 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.410
 Widerner is from the boot 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.480
 that certainly fits you either 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.069
 then you create something 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.989
 creates a wider or a whole 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.390
 broad creates it adapts completely 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.090
 wonderful and I never would have thought 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.360
 that keeps the amazon ratings 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.010
 I thought that was alright 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.930
 because as I look to the example also 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.239
 always very extreme on how are the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.160
 reviews and they were really good 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.620
 and then I ordered one too 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.150
 and i love these parts i can do that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.829
 really recommend you 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.720
 and that's the bomb that's mine 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:56.170
 bootschaft stands again 10 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.269
 no matter how high your boots are short 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.180
 medium or even if the boots 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.400
 With that you can really all boots 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.160
 tame and these are not expensive 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.459
 really great the other also to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.130
 The subject of school care are these wooden parts 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.230
 we also get that delivered and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.239
 I have just now and so in 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.730
 my shoes in it 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.340
 there you just have wood it is 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.880
 first very high quality and s2 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.799
 put rhine and the shapes of yours 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.530
 School worth is very very nice 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.359
 that is as I said elaste gives 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.609
 it also in plastic form, for example 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.609
 i also have ikea but i am the one 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.530
 wooden parts a lot better because the 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.630
 just be bigger and be more stable 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.359
 as soon as you get home it's just pure 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.069
 it's just beautiful 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.500
 again the shape I have it in too 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.180
 my nike air max in there and I have that 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.260
 in my mike fries in there too 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.329
 my complete sneakers so me 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.400
 I have it there in paks 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.750
 order path says I link you once 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.269
 I honestly do not have that much 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.139
 Expected because it is not very expensive 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.680
 was 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:09.040
 but it's worth every penny and mine 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.989
 shoes are much better infor has 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.950
 you also again the plastic variant 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.480
 brought 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.209
 already the form is essential 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.980
 smaller and different the wood part has yes 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.500
 but at least a little bit of 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.400
 foot shape so that the shoe just fine 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.050
 is completed 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.550
 this is not the case here 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.430
 I said one in mine 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.260
 really narrow school is better 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.610
 on as nothing in any case but the 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.710
 I would not be up to date right now 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.720
 buy again here's a spray that 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.260
 I would like to recommend you that is 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.660
 from the customer colony hightech waterproof 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.960
 which is now the example of a the her 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.960
 Also for clothes bags and tents 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.669
 or you can take all the textiles 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.760
 I would always recommend that to you 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.950
 to increase something there is nothing I do 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.229
 really goes through nothing and I have 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.600
 also the feeling that this is a bit 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.120
 stain-resistant and would want the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.070
 school, three times spray after all 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.110
 Spaces so spray once 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.729
 completely dry the second 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.370
 the third time and then you are 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.639
 completely waterproof so there goes 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.620
 really nothing through and so me 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.180
 I have very positive experiences 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.360
 that is not the case now 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.100
 very cheap but I think absolutely 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.900
 awesome what now actually already 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.729
 It was really short, I hope so 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.620
 could help you a bit if 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.010
 then have your tips for me then write me 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.289
 Please feel free to talk about school care there 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.880
 always very grateful if we are 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.990
 we can exchange that a bit 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.970
 maybe we can get each other 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.289
 Help a bit and thank you for that 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.240
