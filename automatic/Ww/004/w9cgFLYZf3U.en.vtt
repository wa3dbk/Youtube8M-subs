00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
when loading up Woody Woodpecker

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.280 
when loading up Woody Woodpecker
initially<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.880> turned<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.660> be<00:00:09.780> not<00:00:10.050> what

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
initially it turned out to be not what

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.440 
initially it turned out to be not what
we<00:00:10.469> were<00:00:10.620> expecting<00:00:10.910> first<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.150> looked<00:00:12.330> like

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
we were expecting first it looked like

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.330 
we were expecting first it looked like
it<00:00:12.599> might<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> cartoon<00:00:13.380> theme<00:00:13.620> platform<00:00:14.190> up

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
it might be a cartoon theme platform up

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.709 
it might be a cartoon theme platform up
then<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.940> character<00:00:15.299> selection<00:00:15.540> screen

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
then the character selection screen

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.890 
then the character selection screen
comes<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.830> looks<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.160> kart<00:00:17.490> racer

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
comes up and it looks like a kart racer

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.120 
comes up and it looks like a kart racer
turns<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:19.109> that's<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.590> exactly<00:00:19.949> right

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
turns out that's not exactly right

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.929 
turns out that's not exactly right

basically<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.080> game<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.650> would<00:00:22.800> happen

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
basically this game is what would happen

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.710 
basically this game is what would happen
if<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.279> took<00:00:23.430> tiny<00:00:23.760> wings<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.330> turned<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
if you took tiny wings and turned it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.779 
if you took tiny wings and turned it
