alright so I'm done braiding his hair

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
alright so I'm done braiding his hair
this<00:00:57.239> time<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> did<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.199> Beehive<00:00:59.010> braid

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this time I did the Beehive braid

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
this time I did the Beehive braid
pattern<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.600> we're<00:01:00.989> working<00:01:01.230> with

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
pattern just because we're working with

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
pattern just because we're working with
two<00:01:01.500> smaller<00:01:01.770> sections<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.550> thought<00:01:02.699> that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
two smaller sections and I thought that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.299 
two smaller sections and I thought that
would<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.239> less<00:01:03.750> bulky<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> lay<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.220> bit

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
would be less bulky and lay a little bit

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
would be less bulky and lay a little bit
better<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.970> did<00:01:06.479> his<00:01:06.600> leaf<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.409> way

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
better so I did his leaf out all the way

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800 
better so I did his leaf out all the way
around<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.939> section<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
around and then a little section in the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.950 
around and then a little section in the
middle<00:01:09.930> maybe<00:01:10.580> it's<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.790> even<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.090> inch<00:01:12.330> or

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
middle maybe it's not even an inch or

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.140
