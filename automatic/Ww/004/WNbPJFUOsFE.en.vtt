to go and the home stretch here i'm
going<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.649> sharpen<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.639> japanese

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
going to sharpen on this japanese

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.370 
going to sharpen on this japanese
natural<00:00:09.620> and<00:00:10.620> maybe<00:00:10.830> i<00:00:10.950> may<00:00:11.790> go<00:00:12.000> back<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.480> stop

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
natural and maybe i may go back and stop

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.760 
natural and maybe i may go back and stop
it<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.559> couple<00:00:13.740> times<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.759> i<00:00:14.940> got<00:00:15.059> it

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
it a couple times just because i got it

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.400 
it a couple times just because i got it
and<00:00:16.820> we'll<00:00:17.820> see<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.420> give<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and we'll see what we do give it a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.960 
and we'll see what we do give it a
couple<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.740> tests<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.279> sharpness<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
couple of tests for sharpness and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
couple of tests for sharpness and
hopefully<00:00:21.960> we'll<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.320> sharp<00:00:22.529> knife<00:00:22.710> at

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
hopefully we'll have a sharp knife at

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
hopefully we'll have a sharp knife at
the<00:00:23.010> end<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.930> japanese

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the end of this so it's japanese

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.200 
the end of this so it's japanese
naturals<00:00:25.830> pretty<00:00:26.130> much<00:00:26.250> ready<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> go<00:00:26.699> just

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
naturals pretty much ready to go just

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.689 
naturals pretty much ready to go just
needs<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.510> water<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.490> it's<00:00:29.490> already

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
needs a little water on it it's already

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:40.850 
needs a little water on it it's already
flat<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:38.540> can<00:00:39.540> feel<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> thing<00:00:40.140> moving<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
flat I can feel this thing moving just a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.950 
flat I can feel this thing moving just a
little<00:00:40.890> bit<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:42.450> because<00:00:42.660> it's

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
little bit and that's because it's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.709 
little bit and that's because it's
uneven<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:43.920> side<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.510> put

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
uneven on the back side you know put

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
uneven on the back side you know put
this<00:00:45.809> little<00:00:46.280> dmt<00:00:47.280> mat<00:00:47.460> down<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> hopefully

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this little dmt mat down and hopefully

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.350 
this little dmt mat down and hopefully
that'll<00:00:48.539> keep<00:00:49.340> it<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.370> moving<00:00:50.700> maybe<00:00:51.270> I'll

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that'll keep it from moving maybe I'll

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.189 
that'll keep it from moving maybe I'll
flip<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> over<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:53.120> it's<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> huge<00:00:54.690> deal<00:00:54.809> if

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
flip it over to it's not a huge deal if

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.189 
flip it over to it's not a huge deal if
but<00:00:56.129> we're<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> finer<00:00:56.850> part<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> knife

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
but we're on the finer part of the knife

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.860 
but we're on the finer part of the knife
sharpening<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.870> nice

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
sharpening I really want to get a nice

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.830 
sharpening I really want to get a nice
clean<00:01:01.230> approach<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.460> edge<00:01:02.629> without<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
clean approach on the edge without a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
clean approach on the edge without a
jiggling<00:01:04.439> around<00:01:05.299> let's<00:01:06.299> give<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> try

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.650 

on<00:01:19.060> this<00:01:19.210> particular<00:01:19.420> Japanese<00:01:20.350> natural<00:01:21.660> is

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
on this particular Japanese natural is

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.800 
on this particular Japanese natural is
very<00:01:23.200> hard<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:25.390> produces<00:01:25.930> mud<00:01:27.810> relatively

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
very hard it produces mud relatively

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.300 
very hard it produces mud relatively
quickly<00:01:29.080> compared<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.920> some<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.220> other

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
quickly compared to some of the other

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.970 
quickly compared to some of the other
ones<00:01:30.610> but<00:01:30.970> not<00:01:31.210> nearly<00:01:31.570> as<00:01:31.720> quickly<00:01:31.990> as<00:01:32.410> this

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
ones but not nearly as quickly as this

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.640 
ones but not nearly as quickly as this
affects<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.820> usually<00:01:37.330> press<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.050> little<00:01:38.440> bit

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
affects so usually press a little bit

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.360 
affects so usually press a little bit
harder<00:01:38.920> on<00:01:39.070> these<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:40.030> get<00:01:40.240> home<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:45.280> I'm

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
harder on these to get home what I'm

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.740 
harder on these to get home what I'm
doing<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:47.850> lift<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.150> knife<00:01:49.360> just<00:01:49.630> a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
doing to is lift in this knife just a

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.780 
doing to is lift in this knife just a
little<00:01:50.170> more<00:01:50.320> than<00:01:50.590> when<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:50.770> shove<00:01:51.430> in<00:01:51.580> on<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
little more than when I shove in on the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.330 
little more than when I shove in on the
others<00:01:52.060> not<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> lot<00:01:53.290> I<00:01:53.680> just<00:01:54.070> want<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.280> make

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
others not a lot I just want to make

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.219 
others not a lot I just want to make
sure<00:01:54.460> I'm<00:01:54.910> nail<00:01:55.570> on<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.840> edge<00:01:55.990> here<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
sure I'm nail on the edge here and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.140 
sure I'm nail on the edge here and
that'll<00:01:59.229> probably<00:01:59.590> create<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.430> little<00:02:00.760> micro

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
that'll probably create a little micro

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.630 
that'll probably create a little micro
bevel<00:02:01.360> on<00:02:01.570> here<00:02:01.869> you<00:02:02.530> can<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:03.190> can<00:02:03.400> raise<00:02:03.610> a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
bevel on here you can you can raise a

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.109 
bevel on here you can you can raise a
knife<00:02:03.970> quite<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.420> bit<00:02:05.369> some<00:02:06.369> people<00:02:06.670> will<00:02:06.790> do<00:02:06.970> it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
knife quite a bit some people will do it

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.070 
knife quite a bit some people will do it
35<00:02:08.080> 40<00:02:08.590> degrees<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.340> do<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.300> on<00:02:10.420> one<00:02:10.570> side<00:02:10.630> to

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
35 40 degrees and do it on one side to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.410 
35 40 degrees and do it on one side to
do<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> micro<00:02:11.680> bevel<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:12.190> usually<00:02:12.910> like<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.120> just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
do a micro bevel I usually like to just

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.330 
do a micro bevel I usually like to just
lift<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.870> little<00:02:13.900> bit<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.590> my<00:02:14.620> last<00:02:14.950> stone

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
lift it a little bit on my last stone

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.800 
lift it a little bit on my last stone
and<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.860> sharpen<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:21.120> what's<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.570> is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and and sharpen it what's going on is

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.020 
and and sharpen it what's going on is
instead<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.500> right<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.220> whole<00:02:24.430> edge

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
instead of going right on the whole edge

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.979 
instead of going right on the whole edge
bevel<00:02:25.540> here<00:02:26.010> basically<00:02:27.010> sharpening<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
bevel here basically sharpening just the

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.449 
bevel here basically sharpening just the
very<00:02:29.290> end<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.160> inch<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:32.160> some<00:02:33.160> people

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
very end of the inch and some people

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.479 
very end of the inch and some people
like<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:33.820> because<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.590> usually<00:02:35.590> adds<00:02:35.980> some

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
like this because it usually adds some

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.140 
like this because it usually adds some
stability<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.420> steep<00:02:37.780> edge<00:02:41.970> I'm<00:02:42.970> going<00:02:43.090> to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
stability to a steep edge I'm going to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.240 
stability to a steep edge I'm going to
do<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.330> little<00:02:43.510> finesse<00:02:43.810> work<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:45.010> now

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
do a little finesse work on this now

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.920 
do a little finesse work on this now
just<00:02:46.180> going<00:02:46.420> to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
just going to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.250 
just going to
run<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.140> back<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.650> forth<00:02:50.840> there's<00:02:51.840> one<00:02:51.930> or

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
run this back and forth there's one or

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.770 
run this back and forth there's one or
two<00:02:52.290> strokes<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.090> little<00:02:57.390> bit<00:02:57.510> higher<00:02:57.750> than

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
two strokes and a little bit higher than

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.090 
two strokes and a little bit higher than
I<00:02:58.110> normally<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.740> I'm<00:02:59.280> guessing<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.760> this<00:03:00.030> is

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
I normally do I'm guessing that this is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.870 
I normally do I'm guessing that this is
maybe<00:03:02.100> 15<00:03:02.730> degrees<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.390> each<00:03:03.510> side<00:03:04.820> instead<00:03:05.820> of

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
maybe 15 degrees on each side instead of

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:20.120 
maybe 15 degrees on each side instead of
10

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.400 

these<00:03:21.130> last<00:03:21.370> few<00:03:21.670> strokes<00:03:22.030> backwards<00:03:25.410> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
these last few strokes backwards the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.400 
these last few strokes backwards the
strapping<00:03:26.950> motion

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.290

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
if you have now if you make little

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.390 
if you have now if you make little
mistakes<00:03:33.330> as<00:03:33.930> you're<00:03:34.080> going<00:03:34.260> along<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:35.220> no

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
big deal because the next stone should

big deal because the next stone should
your<00:03:38.430> progression<00:03:38.850> should<00:03:39.860> help<00:03:40.940> grind<00:03:41.940> away

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
your progression should help grind away

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.230 
your progression should help grind away
the<00:03:42.540> mistake<00:03:43.760> when<00:03:44.760> you're<00:03:44.880> down<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.210> your
