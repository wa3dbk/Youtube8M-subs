00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.019 

when<00:00:04.800> hockey's<00:00:05.100> been<00:00:05.250> played<00:00:05.550> these<00:00:05.790> days

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
when hockey's been played these days

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.090 
when hockey's been played these days
teams<00:00:06.450> are<00:00:06.600> getting<00:00:06.779> really<00:00:07.020> good<00:00:07.350> at<00:00:07.770> setting

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.100 
teams are getting really good at setting

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.610 
teams are getting really good at setting
up<00:00:08.309> their<00:00:08.460> defenses<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:10.080> often<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.469> be

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
up their defenses so we often have to be

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.900 
up their defenses so we often have to be
creative<00:00:11.100> about<00:00:11.160> how<00:00:11.340> we're<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
creative about how we're going to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.209 
creative about how we're going to
penetrate<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.780> defense<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.590> one<00:00:13.800> way<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.009> do

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
penetrate the defense and one way to do

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.480 
penetrate the defense and one way to do
that<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.940> through<00:00:15.210> overheads<00:00:15.740> now<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:17.310> need

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
that is through overheads now you need

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.800 
that is through overheads now you need
to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.670> selective<00:00:17.820> about<00:00:18.240> when<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.480> use<00:00:18.660> this

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to be selective about when you use this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.380 
to be selective about when you use this
in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> game<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.590> if<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.489> do<00:00:21.239> it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
in the game but if you can do it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050 
in the game but if you can do it
consistently<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.770> very<00:00:22.980> useful<00:00:23.060> so

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
consistently it can be very useful so

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.069 
consistently it can be very useful so
there<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> couple<00:00:24.419> of<00:00:24.509> things<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.840> want<00:00:24.899> to

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
there a couple of things we want to

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.380 
there a couple of things we want to
think<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.579> when<00:00:26.579> doing<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.970> obviously

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
think about when doing that obviously

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450 
think about when doing that obviously
we're<00:00:27.630> looking<00:00:27.899> for<00:00:28.050> power<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.160> we're

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
we're looking for power and we're

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.999 
we're looking for power and we're
looking<00:00:29.700> for<00:00:30.290> accuracy<00:00:31.290> but<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.559> also<00:00:31.680> need<00:00:31.919> to

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
looking for accuracy but we also need to

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.290 
looking for accuracy but we also need to
be<00:00:32.130> able<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> height<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
be able to get the height and get it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.940 
be able to get the height and get it
consistently<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.559> they<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:34.800> come

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
consistently because if they don't come

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.590 
consistently because if they don't come
off<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:35.970> us<00:00:36.060> in<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.240> lot<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.390> trouble

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
off they can put us in a lot of trouble

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.500 
off they can put us in a lot of trouble
with<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:36.990> fence<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.940> terms<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.240> what<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
with the fence so in terms of what the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.900 
with the fence so in terms of what the
setup<00:00:39.720> is<00:00:40.040> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> want<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.490> picking<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
setup is if you want to be picking the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.320 
setup is if you want to be picking the
ball<00:00:42.060> up<00:00:42.560> probably<00:00:43.700> just<00:00:44.700> behind<00:00:45.030> this

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
ball up probably just behind this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.390 
ball up probably just behind this
they've<00:00:45.990> taught<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.740> left<00:00:47.100> leading

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
they've taught you your left leading

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.080 
they've taught you your left leading
tires<00:00:47.930> not<00:00:48.930> try<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> pick<00:00:49.470> it<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.650> out<00:00:49.829> here

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
tires not try to pick it up out here

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
tires not try to pick it up out here
we'll<00:00:51.090> try<00:00:51.240> and<00:00:51.360> pick<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.540> up<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:52.290> here<00:00:52.620> gonna

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
we'll try and pick it up in here gonna

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.190 
we'll try and pick it up in here gonna
make<00:00:53.310> it<00:00:53.490> very<00:00:53.670> difficult<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.540> elevations

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
make it very difficult to get elevations

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.810 
make it very difficult to get elevations
here<00:00:55.650> is<00:00:55.770> gonna<00:00:55.890> make<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.370> difficult<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
here is gonna make it very difficult to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.640 
here is gonna make it very difficult to
get<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> tower<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.110> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> pick<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.530> up

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
get the tower so you want to pick it up

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.350 
get the tower so you want to pick it up
in<00:00:58.860> here<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.310> then<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.610> are<00:00:59.640> looking<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.239> sort

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
in here and then you are looking to sort

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.960 
in here and then you are looking to sort
of<00:01:00.420> roll<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.960> ball<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.380> release<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.820> one

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
of roll the ball and release I think one

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.490 
of roll the ball and release I think one
of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> things<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.720> see<00:01:03.930> players<00:01:04.229> too

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
of the things that you see players too

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
of the things that you see players too
often<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.399> that<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.850> try<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.149> angle<00:01:07.079> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
often is that they try and angle the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.040 
often is that they try and angle the
stick<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.770> push<00:01:08.070> through<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.700> ball<00:01:09.050> now

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
stick and push through the ball now

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.260 
stick and push through the ball now
doing<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.130> way<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.400> can't<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.030> some

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
doing it that way you can't have some

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
doing it that way you can't have some
success<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.590> quite<00:01:13.890> often<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:14.370> happens<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
success but quite often what happens is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
success but quite often what happens is
that<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> ball<00:01:15.330> will<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:15.659> over<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> top<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that the ball will go over the top of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
that the ball will go over the top of
the<00:01:16.380> hook<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> stick<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the hook of the stick and the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.460 
the hook of the stick and the
consistency<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.930> which<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.290> throw

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
consistency with which you can throw

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.740 
consistency with which you can throw
these<00:01:19.650> over<00:01:19.799> has<00:01:20.100> diminished<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.390> really

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
these over has diminished so really

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.510 
these over has diminished so really
rather<00:01:21.960> than<00:01:22.260> trying<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.620> angle<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.370> stick

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
rather than trying to angle and stick

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760 
rather than trying to angle and stick
and<00:01:23.670> push<00:01:23.820> through<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> ball<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.409> just

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and push through the ball we are just

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.469 
and push through the ball we are just
going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> try<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.220> pick<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> head

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
going to try and pick it up on the head

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.080 
going to try and pick it up on the head
of<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:27.720> stick<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.260> just<00:01:28.380> fling<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> it's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
of your stick and just fling it so it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.460 
of your stick and just fling it so it's
a<00:01:30.150> slightly<00:01:30.510> different<00:01:30.659> way<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.080> think<00:01:31.350> about

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a slightly different way to think about

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
a slightly different way to think about
it<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.190> think<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> give<00:01:32.940> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it so I think it's going to give you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.820 
it so I think it's going to give you
more<00:01:33.420> consistency<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> click<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.710> your

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
more consistency and you click in your

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.920 
more consistency and you click in your
cookie<00:01:35.190> in<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.310> overheads<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.810> go

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
