00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.520
 and now we go to sleep but first 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.400
 we want to know first I thank you 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.400
 Look for an opportunity to come 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 healthy 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.030
 and now that I must be Mr. Gabriel 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.400
 rolón that seemed the good program 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.690
 I think as a friend of the house already 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.100
 I know of the program I look at it and it has 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 characteristics that make it very 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.000
 interesting for me in the first place 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.830
 they have one of the most beloved people 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.920
 of all the environment that is ready 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.880
 mountains so that is something that always 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.880
 caress 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.950
 listen to that affection then it seems 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.410
 interesting what what has had to 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.680
 happen today I think it's very good 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.660
 work with good professionals and it's 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.129
 very good to work with good people if 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.410
 over are good professional and good people 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.509
 doubly good so I think so 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.910
 It is has brought us many laurels 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.710
 in half to come by responding with 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.280
 Suitability with ability and on top of being 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.170
 good guy so it was very interesting what 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.800
 what he has done and also pity not being able to 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.800
 say the same 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.220
 but you also have to be very generous 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 to contain the anxiety of the other and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 cargárselo so I think he has 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.050
 been also because you have been very 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.270
 and has been generous as always well 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.750
 that I really enjoyed the program and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.750
 we 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.049
 everyone we meet again the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.049
 next Saturday 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.600
 if you are studying the book books but 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.450
 I brought it to me but it is not theft 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.869
 megalomaniac of book capacity so 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.869
 less 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.220
 dangerous to hear me come many times 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.150
 between 30 and 50
