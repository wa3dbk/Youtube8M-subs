00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:36.430
 the youtube staff apprehensive and not 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.920
 is another way out of 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.769
 10 years and as you can see from what 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.940
 all video if template go adding gte 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.510
 san andreas 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.449
 as in gta 5 the police alert 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.629
 that the police were chasing in the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.360
 map is also on gta5 with you 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.250
 they are seeing through the images the way is not 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.660
 heavy very light 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.059
 so because the computer will rotate 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.399
 usually but rest assured that 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.649
 in this video I will also show how 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.080
 you remove the move is the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.050
 It is advisable that you have already 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.660
 template that added radar to the neighboring map 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.119
 from gte 5 years ago 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.909
 so if you do not have I will leave 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.700
 a link in the description of the video I made 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.470
 showing how to install this map and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.080
 so if you do not have that here after 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.240
 video goes on the other is there and then 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.640
 come back here because in this video 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.619
 I'm going to show this, I'm not going to show you how. 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.399
 is up there ' because I've done it in another 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.500
 video 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.100
 In this video I'll just show you the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.810
 How do you add this mole of alert? 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.170
 The police are just this. 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.149
 but then who played gta5 what they've seen 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.689
 a video on youtube 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.280
 You know when the police were chasing 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.380
 physically point on the map and 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.229
 where there are police officers is 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.240
 she motorcycle the car I know there indicating 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.700
 You look like there's police for you. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.680
 escapes to avoid that place in this 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.320
 In the same way, I've already noticed that. 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.019
 that also has this way I do not know if it will 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.340
 Give it to you to see it through the images here. 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.750
 not youtube right? 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.269
 but when you install in a mold 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.489
 You'll see that you have it, too. 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.470
 now as always i will go back in the area 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.730
 work and show you the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.480
 installation in this way 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.480
 so come on 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.070

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.920
 in the description of the video as I said it now 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.440
 at the beginning of the video the link to the video 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.100
 demonstrates the installation of the mini map 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.230
 gps map 5 is the same as gta 5 or if 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.790

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.000
 to another video where it shows the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.740
 installation in library cléo 4 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Why do I leave because to 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.240
 install this mole 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.520
 You need the Cléo 41 bookstore. 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.910
 recommended is 4 so I'll leave it 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.240
 also in the video description so you 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.670
 download will extract the mob as ever and 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.520
 inside the module door will have two 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.100
 Folders will install one at a time 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.390
 then install first the cleo you 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.050
 plane copies this file and now we 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.810
 will locate the folder of your healthy gte 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.730
 it contains all the files in cgt a 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.860
 that folder that you are already so 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.770
 accustomed to see here 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.230
 in videos so let's find where 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.410
 is my car you? 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.760
 you at my local computer c risk 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.940
 rockstar games gt 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.840
 It's sania coming here in this gta folder . 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.989
 san andreas 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.690
 you will acosta said cléo and within 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.840
 of the pasta you are going to paste per pound 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.200
 and we just copied it, that's it 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.150
 so here you can go back to 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.640
 initial bet of gp's years 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.280
 this folder here you do not close she leaves 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.310
 because we do not use it for 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.019
 install another folder of the mode is 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.620
 back here again in the folder 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.300
 soft 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.970
 We just installed this folder 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.820
 clan remembering that I'm already here at the door 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.910
 of the module is this mobi-e folder 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.800
 gta san andreas's folder that I said 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.200
 that you would not close 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.169
 so we are betting goals now 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.979
 we are in this folder models about the 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.680
 folder 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:39.360
 also open this folder tx from 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.850
 and copy and if it does not copy entire folder 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.280
 always how I did it now because if you 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.979
 copy the whole game and pull to the gte 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.350
 sanders is going to make a mistake so do it the way 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.600
 I'm doing here buy that 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.930
 file we will return one more time 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.210
 in the folder of gta san andreas and coming 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.120
 of attention parties in these you go 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.570
 see this bet that also models the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.500
 Pacha tx coming here you will 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.289
 necklace 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.280
 they are people who are not just that 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.979
 simple 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.930
 and in case you want to remove the mode you 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.880
 they will only pay for this file here 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.180
 people just paste it on the 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.220
 sanas gta tests and that other 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.910
 file that we put inside the 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.669
 folder only these files will 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.520
 good care of the parent or the file is 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.560
 because if paying another can happen 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.610
 not only gta san andreas may not will 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.889
 to happen 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.930
 so pay close attention to a name of the 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.419
 file pay attention to this 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.479
 so now as always and I'm going to pee 10 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.360
 years and I will show you what is so 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.449
 Everything works fine, so let's go 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.449
 over there 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.330

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.640
 the mode is working 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.060
 Of course we 're going to make a 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.490
 little confusion here because gta and is 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.110

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.930
