so<00:00:00.420> we're<00:00:00.539> on<00:00:00.599> part<00:00:00.900> three<00:00:01.110> of<00:00:01.260> chapter<00:00:01.290> two

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
so we're on part three of chapter two

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.130 
so we're on part three of chapter two
neuroscience<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:02.970> looking<00:00:03.360> at<00:00:03.629> David

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
neuroscience we're looking at David

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
neuroscience we're looking at David

ap<00:00:05.609> psychology<00:00:05.970> textbook<00:00:06.540> so<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.950> were

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
ap psychology textbook so we were

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.009 
ap psychology textbook so we were
looking<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.790> left<00:00:09.030> versus<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.840> right

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
looking at the left versus the right

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.589 
looking at the left versus the right
brain<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.340> sometimes<00:00:11.639> happens<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
brain so what sometimes happens is the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.780 
brain so what sometimes happens is the
corpus<00:00:12.929> callosum<00:00:13.170> has<00:00:13.530> had<00:00:13.679> they<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> cut

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
corpus callosum has had they have to cut

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.490 
corpus callosum has had they have to cut
it<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.179> normally<00:00:15.570> they<00:00:15.660> cut<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.960> between<00:00:16.230> up

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it and normally they cut it between up

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470 
it and normally they cut it between up
for<00:00:16.800> people<00:00:17.070> who<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.310> severe<00:00:17.670> seizures<00:00:18.210> and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
for people who have severe seizures and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.140 
for people who have severe seizures and
this<00:00:18.630> will<00:00:19.039> eliminate<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.460> reduce<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
this will eliminate or reduce the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.840 
this will eliminate or reduce the
seizures<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:22.050> experience<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.640> when<00:00:23.789> I

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
seizures that they experience so when I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.580 
seizures that they experience so when I
look<00:00:24.000> at<00:00:24.119> split<00:00:24.420> brain<00:00:24.570> patients<00:00:25.289> when<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
look at split brain patients when the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
look at split brain patients when the
corpus<00:00:25.949> callosum<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.519> actually<00:00:26.939> severed

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
corpus callosum is actually severed

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
corpus callosum is actually severed
objects<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.140> an<00:00:28.260> Apple<00:00:28.710> presented<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
objects like an Apple presented on the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.630 
objects like an Apple presented on the
right<00:00:29.550> visual<00:00:29.820> field<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.539> named<00:00:31.640> objects

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
right visual field can be named objects

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
right visual field can be named objects
like<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.000> pencil<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.870> left<00:00:34.170> visual<00:00:34.380> field

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
like a pencil in the left visual field

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.250 
like a pencil in the left visual field
cannot<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.239> start<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> see<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
cannot so what you start to see is that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.690 
cannot so what you start to see is that
there<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> difference<00:00:38.040> between<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.579> way

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
there is a difference between the way

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.229 
there is a difference between the way
our<00:00:38.940> brains<00:00:39.300> actually<00:00:40.110> offering<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.120> when

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
our brains actually offering and so when

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.729 
our brains actually offering and so when
I<00:00:42.270> look<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> divided<00:00:42.960> consciousness<00:00:43.559> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
I look at the divided consciousness so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
I look at the divided consciousness so
here's<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.190> another<00:00:44.280> example<00:00:44.570> other

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
here's just another example other

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.360 
here's just another example other
divided<00:00:46.110> consciousness<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:47.010> at<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> dot

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
divided consciousness so look at the dot

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790 
divided consciousness so look at the dot
two<00:00:48.239> words<00:00:48.480> separated<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> dot<00:00:49.530> or

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
two words separated by the dot or

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.760 
two words separated by the dot or
momentarily<00:00:50.370> projected<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.050> word<00:00:52.559> do

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
momentarily projected so what word do

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
momentarily projected so what word do
you<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:53.100> she<00:00:53.579> saw<00:00:53.760> art<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you see she saw art and there now if you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.080 
you see she saw art and there now if you
look<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> another<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.250> point<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:56.969> your

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
look at it another way point with your

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.299 
look at it another way point with your
left<00:00:57.300> hand<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.750> word<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.230> saw<00:00:58.469> she<00:00:59.190> would

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
left hand to the word you saw she would

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
left hand to the word you saw she would
point<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.789> bit<00:00:59.940> different<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.780> can

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
point a little bit different so you can

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.799 
point a little bit different so you can
try<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.850> look<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> we're<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
try this what we look at is we're just

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.320 
try this what we look at is we're just
looking<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.080> divided<00:01:04.589> consciousness<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.119> non

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
looking at divided consciousness so non

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.719 
looking at divided consciousness so non
split<00:01:06.659> pea<00:01:06.930> brains<00:01:07.350> people<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.369> intact

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
split pea brains people with intact

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630 
split pea brains people with intact
brains<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.360> shown<00:01:09.710> left<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.979> hemispheric

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
brains are shown left right hemispheric

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
brains are shown left right hemispheric
differences<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.479> mental<00:01:12.840> abilities<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.409> number

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
differences in mental abilities a number

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
differences in mental abilities a number
of<00:01:14.040> brain<00:01:14.250> scans<00:01:14.580> studies<00:01:15.090> show<00:01:15.330> normal

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
of brain scans studies show normal

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
of brain scans studies show normal
individuals<00:01:16.290> engage<00:01:16.650> their<00:01:16.979> right<00:01:17.250> brain

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
individuals engage their right brain

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.640 
individuals engage their right brain
when<00:01:17.820> completing<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.420> perceptual<00:01:18.810> task<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
when completing a perceptual task in the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.690 
when completing a perceptual task in the
left<00:01:19.830> brain<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.220> carrying<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
left brain when carrying out a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.749 
left brain when carrying out a
linguistic<00:01:21.390> task<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> left<00:01:22.920> linguistic<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
linguistic task so left linguistic is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.870 
linguistic task so left linguistic is
handedness<00:01:24.390> inherited<00:01:25.020> yep<00:01:25.290> um<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.670> look

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
handedness inherited yep um what we look

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.929 
handedness inherited yep um what we look
at<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:28.310> really<00:01:29.310> when<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.729> at<00:01:29.909> like

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
at is that really when you look at like

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.719 
at is that really when you look at like
society<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.590> right<00:01:31.829> hand<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.490> being

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
society really right hand is being

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.160 
society really right hand is being
preferred<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.540> that's<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> why

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
preferred and that's kind of why

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.460 
preferred and that's kind of why
everything<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.950> right-handed<00:01:35.909> being<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.020> lefty

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
everything is right-handed being a lefty

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.319 
everything is right-handed being a lefty
in<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.770> right-handed<00:01:38.310> world<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.060> hard

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
in a right-handed world is really hard

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.039 
in a right-handed world is really hard
but<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.640> left-handed<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
but as we see left-handed is kind of

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.139 
but as we see left-handed is kind of
making<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.409> resurgent<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.490> also<00:01:44.700> because

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
making a resurgent but it's also because

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.749 
making a resurgent but it's also because
people<00:01:45.180> aren't<00:01:45.979> telling<00:01:46.979> kids<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.610> they're

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
people aren't telling kids when they're

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.160 
people aren't telling kids when they're
young<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.689> write<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.049> your

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
young that you have to write with your

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.520 
young that you have to write with your
right<00:01:49.259> hand<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.880> being<00:01:51.450> left-handed<00:01:51.840> it's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
right hand so being left-handed it's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
right hand so being left-handed it's
pretty<00:01:52.770> difficult<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.790> simple

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
pretty difficult just for the simple

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.639 
pretty difficult just for the simple
fact<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.479> our<00:01:54.630> machinery<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
fact that all our machinery is kind of

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
fact that all our machinery is kind of
built<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.219> someone<00:01:56.490> who<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.700> right-handed<00:01:57.360> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
built for someone who is right-handed so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.300 
built for someone who is right-handed so
the<00:01:57.990> percentage<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.530> left-handed<00:01:59.130> people

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the percentage of left-handed people

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
the percentage of left-handed people
decreases<00:02:00.119> sharply<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.689> samples<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> older

decreases sharply and samples of older

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
decreases sharply and samples of older
age<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.979> really<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.149> seeing<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.719> is

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
age and really what we're seeing is is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.380 
age and really what we're seeing is is
that<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.500> long<00:02:04.920> time<00:02:05.130> ago<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:05.520> grandparents

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that a long time ago your grandparents

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
that a long time ago your grandparents
area<00:02:06.689> great-grandparents<00:02:07.530> were<00:02:07.649> told<00:02:07.920> that

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
area great-grandparents were told that

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.389 
area great-grandparents were told that
left-handed<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:09.060> wrong

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
left-handed was wrong

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.680 
left-handed was wrong
and<00:02:09.640> they<00:02:09.759> were<00:02:09.819> forced<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.299> learn<00:02:10.509> how<00:02:10.659> to

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
and they were forced to learn how to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.570 
and they were forced to learn how to
write<00:02:10.929> with<00:02:11.080> their<00:02:11.200> right<00:02:11.379> hand<00:02:11.409> so<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:12.519> you

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
write with their right hand so when you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.369
