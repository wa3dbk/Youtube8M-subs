00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hi, all guys, this is Pablo. 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.600
 hitachi today I am sorry to all my psuv 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 for this delay that we had to see 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.150
 videos but is that the micro is a bit 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.710
 scared and could not buy from another and so 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 that this may be that you heard me 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 little bit bad but good we go with 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.430
 curiosities of dofus curiosities and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 Mysteries first a great curiosity 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 that I have always liked that they are 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.869
 some of the many characters 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.440
 they have as a secret for example 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.510
 we started with this the other 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.330
 the trophy ring of a class of two ships 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.820
 their specialty is Europeans for 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.220
 get beds to get money 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.620
 for what they want now the name in 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.720
 ultra or strawberry in the key to the other if you 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.000
 we turn over the other we start to 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.690
 our fracaman is in efe we ​​give him the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.600
 turn puts fortune fortune and trophy is 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.070
 basically almost the same thing so this 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.110
 is one of the universities that there is more 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.120
 I like them but some of the numerous 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.739
 characters have complicated our 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.370
 lives but good I found it funny 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.290
 because we a name and giving him the 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.010
 back to the fortune that is the class 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.430
 of this character the next one is the south 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.800
 character and another name so cool but 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 their faces their specialty is another class 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.780
 2 full his specialty is so attack him 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.030
 type luck not luck of classes but 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.180
 strong for example I make this attack and 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.070
 it goes out to which peace 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.070
 for example is the roulette is 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.730
 face or cross technique if it 's good if you 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.500
 we turn around every cross succeeds 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.500
 expensive but good 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.830
 and if we realize one of the attack of 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.050
 South face is face or cross, so this 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.570
 character is going is based on luck and 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.160
 the name says it is face or cross on 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.470
 next character is the most 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.410
 ridiculous I think I do not say the character 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.690
 I say the name but I love the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.430
 ocher this is a happiness that does not have 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.700
 guys archer guys now if we give him 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.260
 the return to the name okra puts bow or 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.040
 that this one does not get complicated 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.530
 nothing is the funniest and apart is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.930
 one of the most used characters 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.270
 in the 2 course and I would not say the most part 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.750
 this and the one who seek death what more 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.510
 I like it 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.180
 well the following is the a nor view this 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.670
 it's a one class of 2 bus that is based on 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.040
 Healing others or himself 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.739
 and now the name in view if we give it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.080
 the turn puts your aspirin losses 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.060
 that serves to heal the pains of the 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.130
 head and there are many types of aspirin 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.930
 it is also one of the now other two 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.280
 names that I have made so it turns out to me 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.220
 in peculiar because you do not have to see anything 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.510
 with your characters for example let's start 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.450
 with this zeal the zeal is a kind of 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.069
 two blocks its output are to remove 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.170
 action point 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.659
 so you can not be unable to 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.999
 attack etc etc now if we give it the 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.180
 turn does not put pages equitador 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:14.010
 imposes rolex roll this role is a brand 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.720
 of data 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.510
 that came out of the potato packages 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.730
 that I remember myself and that's why it's Rolex 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.239
 I do not know I'm not at all familiar with the 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.939
 name and the next one is the output 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.579
 statehood is a kind of doll that 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.430
 it looks like a tree and has varied attacks 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.610
 especially from chillán and also that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.709
 tampa invoke also and if we give it the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.590
 back to the name this one gets adidas 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.099
 adidas in a t-shirt tennis brand 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.190
 is a brand a clothing brand for 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.709
 say it and that's why I do not think this 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.620
 have nothing to do with that with the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.569
 character and I do not want to think that 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.790
 adidas has paid him dofus so that 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.549
 put this advertising go to a message 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.260
 subliminal but I do not think I paid 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.540
 I think it will not be complicated with the 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.750
 good names now we go with a 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.450
 mystery that I've always liked 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.269
 which is in two fuzz if you search in google 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.000
 images so if you put dofus some 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.700
 dofus the key is 2 I put find the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.820
 Two does thanks 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.530
 there are millions of your fakes but not in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.110
 they are actually typical 2000 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:31.530
 carrot ebony ivory the many 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.460
 bones and it's hard to get it but 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.850
 there is a false 2 in the 2 that is the two 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.560
 waters that this 2 and we see it here in the 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.820
 image looks like bamboo yes but no 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.560
 it's a 2 it 's an egg of a dragon paid 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.380
 who is who is the drago pago pago is the 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.990
 mount of two officers also the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:57.760
 dinosaur from british but only 2 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.370
 water is a false 2 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.110
 but it's a turgo dragon egg and what 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.360
 da is a vitality that neither the 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.550
 I'm going to die is the only mystery 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.630
 without fingers that I have seen like this in 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.030
 special of the two 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.450
 well now this is another curiosity that 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.390
 is us and this is another of the things 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.750
 that I like the update 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.190
 you do things that people like and 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.190
 half that you do not like for example 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.090
 nieces loved me theme 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.710
 open up then I do not have to spend my 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.990
 money in real life 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:41.380
 but they started selling to 70,000 us 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.750
 they got a good price, cheap, but 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.000
 every time it is rising more and already it arrives 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.670
 a point that is a barbarity 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.690
 700 flours that are to fly from a 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.060
 week seven days now they cost 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.550
 almost half a million if it does not cost half 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.500
 million then knows half a million 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.540
 many people is that I think they are 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.070
 methods have put it for the rich and 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.950
 the others who do not have money then 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:09.490
 will have and want to pay will have to 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.680
 pay the 70 thousand waitresses and very well 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.710
 and up to 120 thousand of the reasonable ones but 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.180
 five hundred thousand beds is an ally and 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.010
 other things that I like the least is 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.260
 that in the last update of two 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.630
 future weeks about two cycle that was 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.270
 was that the two bush and barnes and bound to 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.610
 an account, that is, they will not be able to 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.160
 sell the two points that for me is a 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.990
 pain in the subject that if I want to 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.720
 example get on carrot I think that 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.320
 to the Mora I saw all the missions 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.350
 guards and get it that space but 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.640
 for example the documentaries purple or not 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.200
 I agree that I do not remember 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.440
 now as this one called is 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.140
 and if someone to buy it but if 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.770
 someone to buy you will have the vision 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:56.380
 of what is called the eternal harvest that 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.290
 does not tell me eternal that does not end 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.140
 what are you facing this very good vision to 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.600
 this vision tries to capture everyone 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.610
 the monsters that there are of dofus up to a 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.830
 period of the sea giant france or 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.450
 be and until the last three is that this 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.180
 vision is almost impossible you have to have 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.330
 an incredible patience but good is 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.490
 like the ice domus this one not in the 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.460
 toys that you get for the offering that 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.050
 have to wait 365 days not to miss 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.270
 had one could offering because if you 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.130
 lack is going to have to wait for your other 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.620
 years to do it is another two seek 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.060
 I will never get it for the subject 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.360
 that I like to change characters 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.980
 but it's good two are like that a little bit 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.630
 to get it and before they could 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.370
 buy now for the theme that you're going 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.500
 linked to the accounts are not going to be able 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.300
 get and if you have 222 your 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.820
 carrot and has run other accounts 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.840
 neither will they be able to be a pain in the ass 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.120
 they will be as good as this has been one of 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.390
 the 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.980
 curiosities mysteries and actions 

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:02.200
 every time some things are rolling 

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.570
 Well I hope you liked the video 

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:10.140

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:10.140
