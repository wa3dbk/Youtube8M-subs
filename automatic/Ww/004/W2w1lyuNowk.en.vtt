mode<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.780> amongst<00:01:30.049> many<00:01:30.619> tweets<00:01:31.340> we've<00:01:31.580> made

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
mode so amongst many tweets we've made

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.539 
mode so amongst many tweets we've made
to<00:01:31.909> casual<00:01:32.270> mode<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.290> largest<00:01:33.830> alteration<00:01:34.400> we

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
to casual mode the largest alteration we

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.600 
to casual mode the largest alteration we
made<00:01:34.790> was<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.479> change<00:01:35.900> in<00:01:36.200> how<00:01:36.439> gold<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.100> awarded

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
made was a change in how gold is awarded

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.780 
made was a change in how gold is awarded
for<00:01:38.000> player<00:01:38.180> kills<00:01:38.830> what<00:01:39.830> we<00:01:39.950> did<00:01:40.189> was<00:01:40.400> made<00:01:40.610> it

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
for player kills what we did was made it

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.749 
for player kills what we did was made it
so<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.329> when<00:01:42.220> somebody<00:01:43.220> kills<00:01:43.520> somebody

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
so that when somebody kills somebody

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.999 
so that when somebody kills somebody
else<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.960> amount<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.290> gold<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.829> they're

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
else the amount of gold that they're

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.219 
else the amount of gold that they're
rewarded<00:01:46.549> is<00:01:46.759> based<00:01:47.119> on<00:01:47.360> how<00:01:47.570> well<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.020> player

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
rewarded is based on how well the player

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.920 
rewarded is based on how well the player
that<00:01:48.439> they<00:01:48.560> killed<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.920> doing<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.400> game<00:01:49.930> so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
that they killed is doing in the game so

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.810 
that they killed is doing in the game so
this<00:01:51.049> actually<00:01:51.439> takes<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.799> lot<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:51.979> frustration

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
this actually takes a lot of frustration

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.969 
this actually takes a lot of frustration
out<00:01:52.909> because<00:01:53.270> even<00:01:53.570> though<00:01:53.930> somebody<00:01:54.920> is

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
out because even though somebody is

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.240 
out because even though somebody is
dying<00:01:55.310> over<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:55.759> over<00:01:55.850> again<00:01:56.210> they're<00:01:56.869> not

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
dying over it over again they're not

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.520 
dying over it over again they're not
completely<00:01:58.250> rewarding<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.270> other<00:01:59.420> team<00:01:59.720> 100%

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
completely rewarding the other team 100%

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.340 
completely rewarding the other team 100%
so<00:02:01.159> that<00:02:01.189> they<00:02:01.490> will<00:02:01.759> crush<00:02:02.240> them<00:02:02.540> overall<00:02:02.899> and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
so that they will crush them overall and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.749 
so that they will crush them overall and
they'll<00:02:03.500> not<00:02:03.710> get<00:02:03.890> any<00:02:04.040> good<00:02:04.250> experience

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
they'll not get any good experience

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.639 
they'll not get any good experience
