00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.409
 queta welcome from the servers instead of ibarra on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:05.830
 be drawing ears 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.870
 party as always safe and very basic figures 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.159
 like been having good results and well let's start already in full 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.189
 that by way of being be working for the moment with rhomboids 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.499
 I live with course and more or less receives that this line totally 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.429
 vertical 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.279
 It boasts a not so pronounced 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.390
 another vertical line 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.679
 nor to turn by the diagonal not so pronounced 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.010
 state lines 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.370
 let's parallel 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.870
 and these parallel mass movements navarro with two goals to do with the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.740
 fact 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.580
 then from here based 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.440
 in drawing somewhat rounded strokes contemplate kinect you cut this 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.980
 protector this 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.990
 macy's vegas that is a little more pop and sharp who called shops that nothing 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.440
 k 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.770
 Here I leave a curve 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.950
 maybe if not homes race to Persian brings us closer what we have of the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.470
 team 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.510
 it's going to be a curve 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.800
 round psaki pretty 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.190
 the tracy end and even more rounds 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.560
 in the way that you are staying in humans like that of a mango 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.430
 We are local ear as if it were different 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.820
 after here 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.400
 tata make basic lines 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.740
 if you will explain all the Basques that inside the ear maybe 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.260
 the task of putting them all 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.380
 and it would be very bad ears and that for example make a line more or less like that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.860
 this area is coming from Libya 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.760
 it's going parallel to the ear Juan Carlos loyal to the ear only that 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.830
 inside 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.730
 here you can draw a 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.450
 a curve 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.540
 kikwete henry some areteo extends us 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.020
 from partner of name k 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.220
 here you can take a new line 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.480
 after you can get one is something else but in 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.620
 I'll have an ear there 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.420
 equaled bees this tend to take shape only when you're looking at a 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.830
 in the head and bets 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.400
 separately where it comes to light and some evil 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.440
 so I'm going to teach human subjects where they were portentous squares of the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.579
 nea zetas 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.449
 the ear as he embarked through the explained 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.449
 the tip and ear percent and chili with it and in the mushrooms 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.649
 here I will be ear directly novelty know rhomboid 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.329
 you will be able to do the text and I can already practice 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.029
 and good here would be here adrián sideburns 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.899
 here I open the pin for example they are drawing a man 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.109
 I am for a woman then ferial ear 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.869
 this one and he did not put on a hairstyle not according to still street him in in this part 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.079
 but it could fall would be just anything more than a little more than 1000 characters 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.879
 I was like we are looking at the bee 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.400
 c a little thinner than how we're making money quique here is totally 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.259
 sideways for example if we had 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.629
 someone on the side 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.629
 here you can place good course and park notes 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.549
 highlights the course and well 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.659
 and then someone from the CIO would see more for 100 more closer to 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.859
 what I am looking for 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.859
 here you have to k 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:24.159
 this the ears you can combine it with the first buttons that you draw for 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.159
 draw heads a manna from one side and front 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.750
 time to my channel is 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.880
 vitu puntocom lioness mutis that ching yes no no no no 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.590
 but to type everything because nothing else here above the video is surely going 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.930
 to be the word mutis that China takes away and leads to direct Tamil Canada 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.960
 then you can look for structural 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.069
 I was just a man 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.009
 in front of irak at the head of profile otegui 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.229
 iker as it combines very well with those 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:55.749
 the Italian party then it can be this ear plus tere fantasy for example 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.949
 if you want to make the ear an elf 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:02.179
 you are going to draw more or less percent in the proportion is of the decade carrió 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.309
 only that it came badly 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.789
 it's going to be much longer 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.919
 and this time on the line lower common with some also 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.319
 then you of the same strokes 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.319
 the tip of this side you pointy area 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.209
 molero enlarged and up 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.769
 the rest this 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.849
 13 exactly the same 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.169
 and you could also the same this child is that we are fighting 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.240
 the cerrato 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.120
 yes i would create 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.120
 unemployment per head 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.819
 bunbury 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.030
 type of basket is somewhat easier since you do not have to round both cinema 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.749
 so many parts 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.239
 We are a fantasy scholarship because there is no problem if it does not look so real. 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.580
 an ending is a fictional oreca 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.770
 so good to be only something very brief very basic to be like this 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.909
 certain point but 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.599
 but it helps a lot to give a good touch to the same one that is doing and 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:06.569
 towards there 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.809
 prone hand of an elf 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.409
 if you want you can see more or less how the ear looks to a dog and then always 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.789
 tata from the natives that you get used to science 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.339
 already a convoy of 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.309
 sometimes regular sometimes not regular 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.599
 but good the idea is the same if I hope that you've seen yourself fight 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:28.509
 very soon wind progress a little more advanced let's say that already a central 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.539
 intermediate impute action between a person 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.500
 and thank you very much for the video and see you in the next
