and<00:00:27.359> these<00:00:27.840> tunnel<00:00:28.500> halls<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> mod<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and these tunnel halls and the mod you

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.659 
and these tunnel halls and the mod you
tunnel<00:00:30.539> halls<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:30.869> well<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
tunnel halls as well which are the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.670 
tunnel halls as well which are the
high-performance<00:00:32.669> top-end<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
high-performance top-end now one of the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.799 
high-performance top-end now one of the
tunnel<00:00:35.070> holes<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.730> their<00:00:35.940> name<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:36.239> what

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
tunnel holes get their name from what

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.510 
tunnel holes get their name from what
what's<00:00:37.170> what's<00:00:37.230> what's<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.920> tunnel<00:00:38.190> well

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
what's what's what's a tunnel well

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.940 
what's what's what's a tunnel well
basically<00:00:38.960> whether<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.200> about<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
basically whether it's all about is this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.709 
basically whether it's all about is this
is<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.879> cavity<00:00:42.270> which<00:00:42.480> you're<00:00:42.690> probably

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
is this cavity which you're probably

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.190 
is this cavity which you're probably
seeing<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.550> runs<00:00:45.200> symmetrically

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
seeing right now that runs symmetrically

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.569 
seeing right now that runs symmetrically
straight<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> front<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> back

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
straight down from the front to the back

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.569 
straight down from the front to the back
and<00:00:47.940> scoops<00:00:48.750> air<00:00:49.020> once<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.890> pick<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and scoops air once you pick up to a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
and scoops air once you pick up to a
certain<00:00:50.850> speed<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:51.840> holds<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.230> up

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
certain speed and then holds you up

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.490 
certain speed and then holds you up
there<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.149> gives<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.300> maximum<00:00:54.780> speed<00:00:55.260> due<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
there and gives you maximum speed due to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
there and gives you maximum speed due to
the<00:00:55.590> fact<00:00:55.710> you've<00:00:55.949> got<00:00:56.070> very<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.820> drag

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the fact you've got very little drag

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.849 
the fact you've got very little drag
happening<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> water<00:00:57.930> okay<00:00:58.500> very

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
happening on the water okay very

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.760 
happening on the water okay very
interesting<00:00:59.340> cockpit<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.680> can<00:01:01.680> we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
interesting cockpit we have here can we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.070 
interesting cockpit we have here can we
open<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> yeah<00:01:02.370> mm-hmm<00:01:02.879> they're<00:01:03.090> uh<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:04.049> are

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
open it yeah mm-hmm they're uh these are

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.060 
open it yeah mm-hmm they're uh these are
a<00:01:04.260> Kevlar<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.129> balsa<00:01:05.610> core<00:01:05.850> self<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.070> an

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
a Kevlar and balsa core self and an

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.710 
a Kevlar and balsa core self and an
epoxy<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.820> things<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.510> mixed

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
epoxy and things like that are mixed

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
epoxy and things like that are mixed
into<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> makes<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.100> rest<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> boat

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
into it makes for the rest of the boat

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.300 
into it makes for the rest of the boat
very<00:01:12.299> fragile<00:01:12.600> wood<00:01:13.200> construction<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.130> west

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
very fragile wood construction and west

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.820 
very fragile wood construction and west
system<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> toughest<00:01:16.530> part<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
system this is the toughest part of the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
system this is the toughest part of the
boat<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.490> been<00:01:17.640> become<00:01:18.390> mandatory<00:01:18.659> in

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
boat this have been become mandatory in
