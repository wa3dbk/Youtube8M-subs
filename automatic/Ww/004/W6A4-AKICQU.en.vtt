00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.339 
Development Center and what we've built
is<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.860> miniature<00:00:11.370> turbine<00:00:11.940> engine<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:13.080> is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349

called VM LM one of the big advantages
of<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.690> process<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.619> redesign<00:00:20.160> your

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
of this process so you can redesign your

of this process so you can redesign your
parts<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:20.939> new<00:00:20.970> geometries<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.279> new<00:00:23.279> alloys
