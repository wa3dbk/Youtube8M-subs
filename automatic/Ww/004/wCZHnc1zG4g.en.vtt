came up on the crash shortly after
Contador<00:02:43.620> went<00:02:43.860> down<00:02:44.069> obviously<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.819> saw<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
Contador went down obviously you saw the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.630 
Contador went down obviously you saw the
blood<00:02:45.450> coming<00:02:45.510> down<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.069> silver

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
blood coming down if there is a silver

blood coming down if there is a silver
lining<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.239> believe<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.840> Nicholas<00:02:49.319> Roche<00:02:49.680> on

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
lining I believe that Nicholas Roche on

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.460 
lining I believe that Nicholas Roche on
his<00:02:50.760> team<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.360> actually<00:02:51.569> nearby<00:02:52.170> because

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
his team is actually nearby because

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.140 
his team is actually nearby because
about<00:02:52.829> two<00:02:53.099> minutes<00:02:53.250> before<00:02:53.519> Contador

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
about two minutes before Contador

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.330 
about two minutes before Contador
without<00:02:54.510> Roche<00:02:55.260> had<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> mechanical<00:02:56.130> so

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
without Roche had a mechanical so

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.069 
without Roche had a mechanical so
therefore<00:02:56.760> he<00:02:57.030> was<00:02:57.150> out<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.450> back<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:57.870> maybe

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
therefore he was out the back so maybe

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.170 
therefore he was out the back so maybe
he'll<00:02:58.290> get<00:02:58.500> help<00:02:59.129> early<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.730> far<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
he'll get help early as far as the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.309 
he'll get help early as far as the
Machado<00:03:00.780> ghost
