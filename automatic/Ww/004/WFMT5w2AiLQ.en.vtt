needed to get his move away from his

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.580 
needed to get his move away from his
club<00:03:14.799> he's<00:03:14.980> got<00:03:15.160> from<00:03:15.310> QPR<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.480> benefit<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.410> a

club he's got from QPR to a benefit on a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.770 
club he's got from QPR to a benefit on a
free<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.970> ridiculously<00:03:19.510> good

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
free I think that's a ridiculously good

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.569 
free I think that's a ridiculously good
deal<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.230> course<00:03:20.769> he<00:03:20.920> was<00:03:21.040> kind<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.340> wasting

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
deal of course he was kind of wasting

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.400 
deal of course he was kind of wasting
away<00:03:21.670> keep<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.209> up<00:03:22.329> but<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.510> think<00:03:22.780> finally<00:03:23.290> he

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
away keep you up but I think finally he

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.199 
away keep you up but I think finally he
can<00:03:23.560> go<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.890> club<00:03:24.099> where<00:03:24.310> hopefully<00:03:25.090> he's

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
can go to a club where hopefully he's

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.059 
can go to a club where hopefully he's
not<00:03:25.239> as<00:03:25.569> lazy<00:03:25.930> as<00:03:26.140> he<00:03:26.349> has<00:03:26.500> been<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.890> past

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
not as lazy as he has been in the past

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.460 
not as lazy as he has been in the past
and<00:03:27.310> he<00:03:27.400> can<00:03:27.520> actually<00:03:27.819> get<00:03:28.150> work<00:03:28.480> f<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.870> going

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and he can actually get work f it going

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.630 
and he can actually get work f it going
it<00:03:29.500> could<00:03:29.620> be<00:03:29.680> an<00:03:29.770> incredible<00:03:30.250> player<00:03:30.490> for

windows<00:03:44.050> so<00:03:44.290> far<00:03:44.590> they've<00:03:45.100> picked<00:03:45.250> up

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
windows so far they've picked up

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.310 
windows so far they've picked up
Trippier<00:03:45.730> for<00:03:45.910> 3.5<00:03:46.510> million<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.900> think<00:03:47.110> it's<00:03:47.230> a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
Trippier for 3.5 million I think it's a

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.840 
Trippier for 3.5 million I think it's a
good<00:03:47.530> little<00:03:47.710> sign<00:03:48.040> in<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:48.280> I'm<00:03:48.430> honest

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
good little sign in if I'm honest

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.210 
good little sign in if I'm honest
obviously<00:03:49.440> their<00:03:50.440> defense<00:03:50.800> has<00:03:50.860> been<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.070> bit

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
obviously their defense has been a bit

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.220 
obviously their defense has been a bit
shoddy<00:03:51.460> recently<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.450> Trippier<00:03:52.930> could<00:03:53.110> be

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
shoddy recently and it Trippier could be

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.330 
shoddy recently and it Trippier could be
a<00:03:53.260> play<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.680> could<00:03:53.860> bring<00:03:54.010> in<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.160> bit<00:03:54.310> of

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
a play that could bring in a bit of

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.550 
a play that could bring in a bit of
solidity<00:03:54.790> despite<00:03:55.420> going<00:03:55.570> down<00:03:55.810> Burnley's

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
solidity despite going down Burnley's

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.920 
solidity despite going down Burnley's
defense<00:03:56.920> wasn't<00:03:57.280> all<00:03:57.610> that<00:03:57.670> horrendous<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.840> I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
defense wasn't all that horrendous and I

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.660 
defense wasn't all that horrendous and I
think<00:03:59.170> Trippier<00:03:59.800> could<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.160> good<00:04:00.370> little

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
think Trippier could be a good little

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.699 
think Trippier could be a good little
plan<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.090> course<00:04:01.330> he's<00:04:01.450> English<00:04:01.840> which<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.500> key

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
plan of course he's English which is key

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.890 
plan of course he's English which is key
in<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.040> Premier<00:04:03.370> League<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.550> for<00:04:03.760> 3.5<00:04:04.360> mil<00:04:04.570> if

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
in the Premier League and for 3.5 mil if

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.660 
in the Premier League and for 3.5 mil if
it's<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.140> bit<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.380> steal<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.250> next<00:04:06.430> up<00:04:06.550> we

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
it's a bit of a steal and next up we

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.220 
it's a bit of a steal and next up we
have<00:04:06.700> undressed<00:04:07.120> violin<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:07.750> think<00:04:07.990> this<00:04:08.080> is<00:04:08.200> a

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
have undressed violin I think this is a

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.320 
have undressed violin I think this is a
bit<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.620> an<00:04:08.740> interest<00:04:09.100> in<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:09.340> eye<00:04:09.550> I<00:04:09.910> never

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
bit of an interest in one eye I never

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.820 
bit of an interest in one eye I never
really<00:04:10.540> know<00:04:10.630> what<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.870> make<00:04:10.900> of<00:04:11.050> him<00:04:11.260> he<00:04:11.470> seems

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
really know what to make of him he seems

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.460 
really know what to make of him he seems
like<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.100> an<00:04:12.490> average<00:04:13.480> player<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.990> an<00:04:14.110> average

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
like a an average player in an average

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.259 
like a an average player in an average
front<00:04:14.740> line<00:04:14.890> at<00:04:15.070> Villa<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.610> feel<00:04:15.880> like<00:04:15.910> if

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
front line at Villa and I feel like if

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.120 
front line at Villa and I feel like if
you<00:04:16.420> went<00:04:16.540> down<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.140> someone<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:17.620> Darby<00:04:17.950> I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
you went down to someone like Darby I

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.250 
you went down to someone like Darby I
think<00:04:18.489> he<00:04:18.609> could<00:04:18.790> actually<00:04:19.030> be<00:04:19.450> quite<00:04:19.720> good<00:04:20.230> I

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
think he could actually be quite good I

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.290 
think he could actually be quite good I
feel<00:04:20.410> like<00:04:20.709> in<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.489> championship<00:04:22.030> he<00:04:22.150> could

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
feel like in the championship he could

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.330 
feel like in the championship he could
have<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.419> really<00:04:22.720> good<00:04:22.840> time<00:04:22.900> up<00:04:23.230> for<00:04:23.350> 2.75<00:04:23.770> mill

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
have a really good time up for 2.75 mill

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.300 
have a really good time up for 2.75 mill
it's<00:04:25.210> really<00:04:25.480> it's<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:26.140> bit<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.470> gamble<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:27.250> I

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
it's really it's a bit of a gamble but I

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.800 
it's really it's a bit of a gamble but I
think<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:27.970> could<00:04:28.150> really<00:04:28.360> pay<00:04:28.780> off

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
think it's one that could really pay off

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.920 
think it's one that could really pay off
for<00:04:29.740> Darby<00:04:30.640> and<00:04:30.940> find<00:04:31.180> environments<00:04:31.720> will<00:04:31.810> be

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
for Darby and find environments will be

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.900 
for Darby and find environments will be
really<00:04:32.169> interesting<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.620> see<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.160> does<00:04:33.640> he<00:04:33.820> end

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
really interesting to see so does he end

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.300 
really interesting to see so does he end
