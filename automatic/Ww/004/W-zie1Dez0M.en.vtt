tell you a little bit about it it is a
Bluetooth<00:00:45.809> controller<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.270> no<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
Bluetooth controller so no need for the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.110 
Bluetooth controller so no need for the
USB<00:00:50.030> toggle<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.239> whatever<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.120> use

programmable rapid fire it also has six
axis<00:01:02.699> support<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.220> can<00:01:05.220> still<00:01:05.369> use

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
axis support so you can still use

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.080 
axis support so you can still use
sixaxis<00:01:05.939> under<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> motion<00:01:07.229> control<00:01:08.090> has

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
sixaxis under the motion control has

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.130 
sixaxis under the motion control has
dual<00:01:09.450> Rumble<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:11.150> LED<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.450> blue<00:01:12.720> LEDs

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
dual Rumble the LED that has blue LEDs

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.160 
dual Rumble the LED that has blue LEDs
on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:14.299> which<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.450> right<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.960> I'll

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
on the side which is right here and I'll

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.370 
on the side which is right here and I'll
show<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.470> later<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:19.290> much

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
show you that later and that pretty much

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
show you that later and that pretty much
tells<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.040> would<00:01:20.729> fire<00:01:21.119> mode<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.630> in

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
tells you what would fire mode it's in

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.929 
tells you what would fire mode it's in
or<00:01:21.990> whatever<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.590> guess<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.640> using<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
or whatever I guess if you're using the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.410 
or whatever I guess if you're using the
rapid<00:01:24.420> fire<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.310> at<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.790> very<00:01:26.820> bottom<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
rapid fire and at the very bottom you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.679 
rapid fire and at the very bottom you
can<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.049> does<00:01:28.950> use<00:01:29.220> batteries<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
can see it does use batteries and you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
can see it does use batteries and you
need<00:01:30.990> batteries<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.710> double-a<00:01:32.189> batteries<00:01:32.549> for

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
need batteries to double-a batteries for

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.420 
need batteries to double-a batteries for
this<00:01:32.880> controller<00:01:33.560> which<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:35.100> applause

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this controller which is not applause

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.859

everything and how how it feels wii

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
everything and how how it feels wii
controller<00:01:45.540> itself<00:01:45.930> feels<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.740> good<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
controller itself feels pretty good in

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.700 
controller itself feels pretty good in
your<00:01:47.310> hands<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:48.170> definitely<00:01:49.170> bigger<00:01:49.590> than

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
your hands it's definitely bigger than

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.929 
your hands it's definitely bigger than
the<00:01:50.310> DualShock<00:01:50.759> 3<00:01:51.049> it's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.880> little<00:01:53.880> more

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the DualShock 3 it's a little more

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.280 
the DualShock 3 it's a little more
comfortable<00:01:54.509> there<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.649> uh<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.840> only<00:01:58.049> thing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
comfortable there but uh the only thing

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.310 
comfortable there but uh the only thing
i<00:01:58.560> found<00:01:58.829> about<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.399> controller<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:01.200> r

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
i found about this controller is the r

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160 
i found about this controller is the r
one<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> hold

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
one and that one there you have to hold

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
one and that one there you have to hold
the<00:02:04.350> controller<00:02:04.710> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.070> weird<00:02:05.280> at<00:02:06.119> least<00:02:06.299> i

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
the controller kind of weird at least i

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109 
the controller kind of weird at least i
think<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.220> it's<00:02:08.220> kind<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.520> hard<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.700> press<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
think so it's kind of hard to press the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.980 
think so it's kind of hard to press the
button

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
button

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.950 
button
or<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.920> just<00:02:11.950> feels<00:02:12.310> awkward<00:02:13.090> like<00:02:13.720> they're

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
or it just feels awkward like they're

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.230 
or it just feels awkward like they're
out<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.560> way<00:02:14.710> or<00:02:14.740> whatever<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:16.060> they're

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
out of the way or whatever like they're

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.210 
out of the way or whatever like they're
just<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.540> close<00:02:16.780> enough<00:02:17.020> but<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.010> might<00:02:18.190> be

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
just not close enough but that might be

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.340 
just not close enough but that might be
me<00:02:18.490> i<00:02:18.520> don't<00:02:18.820> i<00:02:18.910> don't<00:02:18.970> know<00:02:19.150> that's<00:02:20.050> just<00:02:20.140> my

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
me i don't i don't know that's just my

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.550 
me i don't i don't know that's just my

charge<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.300> up<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.690> think<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.740> micro<00:03:30.250> USB<00:03:30.640> is

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.790 
charge it up I think the micro USB is
just<00:03:31.120> for<00:03:31.300> if<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:32.110> don't<00:03:32.290> have<00:03:32.410> any<00:03:32.590> batteries

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
in it you just use a cord I don't think

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.380

with<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:38.890> uh<00:03:39.090> let<00:03:40.090> me<00:03:40.150> give<00:03:40.270> you<00:03:40.390> a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
with that but uh let me give you a

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.720 
with that but uh let me give you a
comparison<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:44.700> sony<00:03:45.700> dualshock<00:03:46.270> 3<00:03:46.840> and

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
comparison of the sony dualshock 3 and

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.510 
comparison of the sony dualshock 3 and
the<00:03:48.730> detail<00:03:49.180> controller<00:03:49.660> as<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:51.220> can<00:03:51.310> see

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
the detail controller as you can see

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.420 
the detail controller as you can see
it's<00:03:51.700> not<00:03:51.910> much<00:03:52.440> some<00:03:53.440> much<00:03:53.650> bigger<00:03:53.950> but<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.310> is

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
it's not much some much bigger but it is

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.320 
it's not much some much bigger but it is
definitely<00:03:54.580> bigger<00:03:55.090> than<00:03:55.210> the<00:03:55.420> DualShock<00:03:55.870> 3

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.650 

it's<00:04:00.870> not<00:04:01.080> quite<00:04:01.500> as<00:04:02.030> lightweight<00:04:03.030> as<00:04:03.300> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
it's not quite as lightweight as the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.780 
it's not quite as lightweight as the
DualShock<00:04:04.080> for<00:04:04.290> me<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.620> definitely<00:04:05.250> heavier

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
DualShock for me it's definitely heavier

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.960 
DualShock for me it's definitely heavier
and<00:04:06.080> I<00:04:07.080> found<00:04:07.380> if<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.130> use<00:04:08.280> rechargeable

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
and I found if you use rechargeable

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.360 
and I found if you use rechargeable
batteries<00:04:09.780> which<00:04:10.050> it<00:04:10.560> may<00:04:10.710> be<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:11.010> batteries

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
batteries which it may be the batteries

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.550 
batteries which it may be the batteries
i'm<00:04:11.490> using<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:11.910> this<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:12.960> it<00:04:13.050> makes<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.260> lot

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
i'm using in this but it makes a lot

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.849 
i'm using in this but it makes a lot
heavier<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.100> feels<00:04:14.820> really<00:04:15.030> heavy<00:04:16.790> oh<00:04:18.859> and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
heavier it feels really heavy oh and
