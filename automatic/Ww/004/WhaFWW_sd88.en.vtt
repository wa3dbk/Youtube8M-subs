a<00:03:35.500> lot<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.310> with<00:03:36.340> Stuart<00:03:36.700> Pearce<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.090> think

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
a lot to do with Stuart Pearce I think

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.560 
a lot to do with Stuart Pearce I think
he's<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.959> almost<00:03:38.350> forged<00:03:38.769> like<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> club<00:03:39.820> type

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
he's is almost forged like a club type

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.720 
he's is almost forged like a club type
