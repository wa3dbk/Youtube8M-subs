00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
with that but anyway um now that I'm

looking<00:01:06.539> at<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.960> person's<00:01:07.350> team<00:01:07.560> he<00:01:07.830> really

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
looking at this person's team he really

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.669 
looking at this person's team he really
could<00:01:08.399> she<00:01:09.330> probably<00:01:09.990> could<00:01:10.319> have<00:01:10.350> come<00:01:10.649> in

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:10.679

with some way better selection but I'm

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.480 
with some way better selection but I'm

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
guessing that she thought that she could

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.270 
guessing that she thought that she could
just<00:01:14.880> sweep<00:01:15.390> me<00:01:15.630> easily<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:17.039> um<00:01:17.750> she<00:01:18.750> doesn't

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
just sweep me easily but um she doesn't

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
just sweep me easily but um she doesn't
yeah<00:01:20.280> yeah<00:01:21.090> she<00:01:21.330> doesn't<00:01:21.630> she<00:01:21.810> feels<00:01:22.049> but

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409

as<00:02:51.850> soon<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.210> I<00:02:52.300> use<00:02:52.450> belly<00:02:52.720> jump<00:02:53.020> it'll

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
as soon as I use belly jump it'll

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.440 
as soon as I use belly jump it'll

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.450 
instantly use a slack berry to make me
even<00:02:55.810> faster<00:02:56.380> than<00:02:56.560> everything<00:02:56.830> else<00:02:57.070> out<00:02:57.280> on

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
even faster than everything else out on

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.510 
even faster than everything else out on
the<00:02:57.580> field<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.690> basically<00:02:59.260> once<00:02:59.800> i<00:02:59.980> use<00:03:00.250> belly

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
the field so basically once i use belly

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.450 
the field so basically once i use belly
drum<00:03:00.760> i<00:03:00.910> think<00:03:01.150> i<00:03:01.240> have<00:03:01.270> like<00:03:01.800> 350<00:03:02.800> attack<00:03:03.160> and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
drum i think i have like 350 attack and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.400 
drum i think i have like 350 attack and
then<00:03:05.100> 210<00:03:06.100> speed<00:03:06.490> it's<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:07.120> awesome<00:03:07.750> Linoone

then 210 speed it's just awesome Linoone

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.620 
then 210 speed it's just awesome Linoone
just<00:03:08.680> gets<00:03:08.830> epic<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.640> actually<00:03:10.060> probably<00:03:10.300> is

little bit of poison hacks on me but it
doesn't<00:06:11.820> matter<00:06:11.970> since<00:06:12.240> i'm<00:06:12.450> not<00:06:12.599> holding<00:06:12.900> a

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.020 
doesn't matter since i'm not holding a
focus<00:06:13.349> sash<00:06:13.680> so<00:06:14.010> it<00:06:14.190> doesn't<00:06:14.460> really<00:06:14.580> matter<00:06:14.849> i

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
not and then you know i already know

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.320 
not and then you know i already know
that<00:06:40.889> Persians<00:06:41.340> going<00:06:41.520> to<00:06:41.580> be<00:06:41.669> out<00:06:41.789> sped<00:06:42.150> by

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
that Persians going to be out sped by

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.870 
that Persians going to be out sped by
lanoue<00:06:43.110> nor<00:06:43.440> slick<00:06:43.800> so<00:06:44.370> it<00:06:44.639> didn't<00:06:44.849> really

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
lanoue nor slick so it didn't really

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.129 
lanoue nor slick so it didn't really
matter<00:06:45.150> what<00:06:45.389> I<00:06:45.450> picked<00:06:45.750> in<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:45.960> end<00:06:46.080> I

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
matter what I picked in the end I

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.360 
matter what I picked in the end I
probably<00:06:46.380> could<00:06:46.590> have<00:06:46.620> cut<00:06:46.830> this<00:06:46.979> all<00:06:47.160> out

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
probably could have cut this all out

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.310 
probably could have cut this all out
like<00:06:47.639> the<00:06:47.789> move<00:06:47.970> selection<00:06:48.389> screens<00:06:48.660> that's

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
like the move selection screens that's

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.659 
like the move selection screens that's
one<00:06:49.500> thing<00:06:49.650> I<00:06:49.800> want<00:06:50.010> to<00:06:50.099> know<00:06:50.220> would<00:06:50.430> you<00:06:50.520> guys

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
prefer me to put out the take off the

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.580 
prefer me to put out the take off the
move<00:06:53.430> selection<00:06:53.880> screens<00:06:54.470> basically<00:06:55.470> it

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
move selection screens basically it

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.779 
move selection screens basically it
would<00:06:55.680> just<00:06:55.800> make<00:06:55.979> the<00:06:56.130> battles<00:06:56.520> a<00:06:56.610> lot

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
would just make the battles a lot

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.159 
would just make the battles a lot
shorter<00:06:57.330> but<00:06:57.479> it<00:06:57.599> would<00:06:57.720> make<00:06:57.810> them<00:06:57.990> a<00:06:58.020> lot

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
shorter but it would make them a lot

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.159 
shorter but it would make them a lot
faster<00:06:58.650> and<00:06:58.979> like<00:06:59.310> more<00:06:59.760> you<00:07:00.539> know<00:07:00.660> action

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
faster and like more you know action

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.589 
faster and like more you know action
packed<00:07:01.380> as<00:07:01.740> they<00:07:02.070> should<00:07:02.130> be<00:07:02.520> we're<00:07:03.330> not<00:07:03.419> just

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 
packed as they should be we're not just

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.300 
packed as they should be we're not just
sitting<00:07:03.750> here<00:07:04.020> for<00:07:04.200> 30<00:07:04.380> seconds<00:07:04.680> waiting<00:07:05.099> for

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
sitting here for 30 seconds waiting for

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.969 
sitting here for 30 seconds waiting for
me<00:07:05.400> to<00:07:05.520> choose<00:07:05.729> my<00:07:05.789> moves<00:07:06.180> but<00:07:07.050> anyway<00:07:07.409> I

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
me to choose my moves but anyway I

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.130 
me to choose my moves but anyway I
thought<00:07:08.849> I'd<00:07:08.969> swap<00:07:09.390> it<00:07:09.570> up<00:07:09.690> a<00:07:09.750> little<00:07:09.870> bit<00:07:10.080> and

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 
thought I'd swap it up a little bit and

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.550 
thought I'd swap it up a little bit and
go<00:07:10.260> for

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
go for

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.770
